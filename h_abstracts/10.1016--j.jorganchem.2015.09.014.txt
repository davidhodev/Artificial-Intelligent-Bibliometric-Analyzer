Â© 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.A silver-catalyzed highly efficient and regioselective synthesis of ketones from a wide range of alkynes is described. The reaction is dramatically accelerated by its performance in aqueous emulsion, which is self-assembled by the addition of silver perfluorooctanesulfonate (1) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) to water. The reaction is conducted under convenient conditions with broad substrate scope, including a variety of aromatic and aliphatic terminal alkynes and internal alkynes. Furthermore, the air- and light-stable silver catalytic microemulsion can be reused for 4 times with minimal change in catalytic efficiency.
