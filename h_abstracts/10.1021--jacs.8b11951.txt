C-H bond activation via σ-bond metathesis is typically observed with transition-metal alkyl compounds in d 0 or d 0 f n electron configurations, e.g., biscyclopentadienyl metal alkyls. Related C-H activation processes are also observed for transition-metal alkyls with higher d-electron counts, such as W(II), Fe(II), or Ir(III). A σ-bond metathesis mechanism has been proposed in all cases with a preference for an oxidative addition-reductive elimination pathway for Ir(III). Herein we show that, regardless of the exact mechanism, C-H activation with all of these compounds is associated with π-character of the M-C bond, according to a detailed analysis of the 13 C NMR chemical shift tensor of the α-carbon. π-Character is also a requirement for olefin insertion, indicating its similarity to σ-bond metathesis. This observation explains the H 2 response observed in d 0 olefin polymerization catalysts and underlines that σ-bond metathesis, olefin insertion, and olefin metathesis are in fact isolobal reactions.
