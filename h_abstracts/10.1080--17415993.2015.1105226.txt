© 2016 Taylor & Francis.Bis(N-benzyl-N-(4-methoxybenzyl)dithiocarbamato-S,S′)zinc(II) (1) and bis(N-benzyl-N-(4-chlorobenzyl)dithiocarbamato-S,S′)cadmium(II) (2) have been prepared and characterized by elemental analysis, IR and NMR (1H and 13C) spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray analysis. Complexes 1 and 2 exist as monomer and dimer, respectively. Crystal structures of 1 and 2 confirm the presence of four coordinated zinc in a distorted tetrahedral arrangement and five coordinated cadmium in a distorted square pyramid arrangement, respectively. Both the complexes are further stabilized by various interactions such as C-H···S, C-H···N, C-H···O and C-H···π (chelate). C-H···O interaction leads to the formation of dimer in complex 1. In complex 2, C-H···π (chelate) interaction runs in opposite directions which results in the polymeric chain. ZnS and CdS have been prepared from 1 and 2, respectively, and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, SEM, UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. The X-ray diffraction pattern confirms the wurtzite phase of as-prepared ZnS and CdS.
