© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim The reaction of N-heterocyclic carbenes, 1a–c, towards cyclopentadienes, 2a–c, was studied. N,N′-diisopropyl-substituted carbene 1a acts as a Brønsted base and deprotonates cyclopentadiene, 2a, and isopropylcyclopentadiene, 2b, to yield the corresponding imidazolium cyclopentadienide salts, 3a,b, whereas there is no reaction towards 1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadiene. Imidazolium cyclopentadienide salts, 3a,b, were characterized in solution by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy, as well as in the solid state by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In addition, it was demonstrated that imidazolium cyclopentadienide salt 3a can be used as a Cp-transfer reagent in the synthesis of different cyclopentadienyl transition metal complexes.
