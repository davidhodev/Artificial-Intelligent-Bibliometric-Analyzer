The reaction of alkynylzirconates with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds has been achieved. Reactions of alkynylzirconates with cinnamates afford ester-functionalized multisubstituted dienes, in which the C3 attacks cinnamates via Michael addition. Reactions of alkynylzirconates with benzylideneacetone give (1E,3Z)-dienes, in which benzylideneacetone acts as an electrophile to afford a proton. © 2013 American Chemical Society.
