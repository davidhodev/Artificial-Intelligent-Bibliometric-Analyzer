A new zirconocene bis(arsenide) derivative, Cp 2Zr(AsMes 2) 2 (1; Cp = cyclopentadienyl, Mes = 2,4,6- trimethylphenyl), has been prepared by the metathetical reaction of 2 equiv of LiAsMes 2 with Cp 2ZrCl 2 and structurally characterized. Efforts to prepare Cp 2ZrCl(AsMes 2) (2) by reaction of 1 equiv of LiAsMes 2 with Cp 2ZrCl 2 yielded a mixture of products that could not be separated, including 1 and 2, as identified by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Compound 1 thermally decomposes with formation of As 2Mes 4, suggestive of reductive elimination to form an As-As bond. Further evidence for reductive elimination comes from effective interception of a putative zirconium(II) intermediate with diphenylacetylene to give Cp 2Zr(C 4Ph 4).
