Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.Two air-stable novel Lewis acids of triphenylantimony(V) pentafluorbezenesulfonates (2) and perfluorooctanesulfonates (3) were successfully synthesized and characterized. X-ray studies and thermo-gravimetric analysis found that these complexes showed high anti-hydrolyzability and thermal stability. The high catalytic activity and excellent recyclability of these complexes were achieved in the Michael addition reaction and the allylation reaction. On account of their stability, storability, as well as catalytic efficiency, these complexes should find a broad range of utility in organic synthesis.
