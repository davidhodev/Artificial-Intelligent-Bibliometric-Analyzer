In the presence of excess magnesium, the vinyl moieties of 3 undergo intramolecular coupling to afford the ansa-titanocene [Ti(η5:η5:η2-C5Me4SiPh2CH=CHCH2CH2SiPh2C5Me4)] (4) possessing the η2-coordinated double bond in lateral position of its ansa-chain. The symmetrical ansa-titanocene [Ti(η5:η5:η2-C5Me4SiPh2CH2CH=CHCH2SiPh2C5Me4)] (5) was not obtained although its DFT-calculated energy is only slightly higher than that of 4. It is considered that transient 5 gives rise to non-identified tar-like by-products which inherently accompany the formation of 4.
