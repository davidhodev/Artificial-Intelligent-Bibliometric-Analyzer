Combinative one-pot Si-Si/Si-O dehydrocoupling of hydrosilanes with alcohols (1:1.5 mole ratio), mediated by a mixture of AgNO3-AuCl 3 (100/1 mole ratio) rapidly produced poly(alkoxysilane)s in reasonably high yield. The addition of small amount of gold complex to the reaction mixture effectively accelerated the coupling reaction compared to the reaction rate with AgNO3 alone. The hydrosilanes include p-X-C 6H4SiH3 (X = H, CH3, OCH 3, F), PhCH2SiH3, and (PhSiH2) 2. The alcohols include MeOH, EtOH, iPrOH, PhOH, and CF 3(CF2)2CH2OH. The weight average molecular weight and polydispersity of the poly(alkoxysilane)s were in the range of 1,600∼8,000 Dalton and 1.4∼3.5, respectively. The dehydrocoupling reactions of phenylsilane with ethanol (1:3 mole ratio) in the presence of the Ag-Au complexes gave only triethoxyphenylsilane.
