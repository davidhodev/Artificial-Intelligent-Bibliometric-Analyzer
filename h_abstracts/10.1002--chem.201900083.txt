KGaA, WeinheimTitanium(III) complexes containing unprecedented (NH2BH2NHBH3)2− and {N(BH3)3}3− ligands have been isolated, and their structures elucidated by a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. The treatment of the trimethyl derivative [TiCp*Me3] (Cp*=η5-C5Me5) with NH3BH3 (3 equiv) at room temperature gives the paramagnetic dinuclear complex [{TiCp*(NH2BH3)}2(μ-NH2BH2NHBH3)], which at 80 °C leads to the trinuclear hydride derivative [{TiCp*(μ-H)}3{μ3-N(BH3)3}]. The bonding modes of the anionic BN fragments in those complexes, as well as the dimethylaminoborane group trapped on the analogous trinuclear [{TiCp*(μ-H)}3(μ3-H)(μ3-NMe2BH2)], have been studied by X-ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
