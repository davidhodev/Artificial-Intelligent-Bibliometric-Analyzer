Four tethered titanocene complexes were covalently immobilized onto 3-mercaptopropyl-functionalized silica gel. We have investigated the influence of the length of the tether and of the ansa-bridge on the activity in the heterogeneous hydrosilylation of the cyclic imine 2-phenylpyrroline, taken as an illustrative example. Possible metal leaching during the reaction was investigated using ICP/OES, recycling studies and the three-phase test. The novel immobilized catalysts exhibit an activity similar to their homogeneous analogues in the tested hydrosilylation reactions with a TOF of ∼20 h -1. Furthermore, our results indicate that metal leaching is negligible under the applied reaction conditions. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
