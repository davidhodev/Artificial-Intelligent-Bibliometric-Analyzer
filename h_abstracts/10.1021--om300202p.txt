Reaction of zirconocene-carboryne in situ generated from Cp 2Zr(μ-Cl)(μ-C 2B 10H 10) Li(OEt 2) 2 with various alkenes RCH=CH 2 in refluxing toluene gave the monoinsertion products 1,2-[Cp 2ZrCH(R) CH 2]-1,2-C 2B 10H 10 (R = aryl) or 1,2-[Cp 2ZrCH 2CH(R)]-1,2-C 2B 10H 10 (R = alkyl) in good to high isolated yields with very high regioselectivity, depending on the polarity of the alkenes. This reaction offered an efficient route to zirconacyclopentanes with a carborane auxiliary, which can be viewed as a carborane version of zirconacyclopentanes. They are thermally very stable and chemically inert toward unsaturated organic molecules such as alkenes, alkynes, nitriles, CO, and CO 2. All complexes have been fully characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. Some have been further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analyses. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
