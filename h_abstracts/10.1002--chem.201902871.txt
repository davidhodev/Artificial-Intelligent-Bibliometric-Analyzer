KGaA, WeinheimIn the last seven years, chemistry of the phosphaethynolate reagent, Na(OCP)(1,4-dioxane)2.5, has seen a surge in organic and inorganic chemistry—A renaissance to cyanate chemistry in a new guise. Whereas there have been many reports of main group reactivity with [OCP]−, largely from group 14, in more recent times the use of electropositive metals has garnered significant interest given their ability to disguise in various oxidation states. Herein, we report and discuss advances in such studies of [OCP]− with early transition metal and f-block metal scaffolds.
