We report the first reactions of titanium imido, alkylidene hydrazido, and dimethylhydrazido compounds with the boranes H2BTex, 9-BBN, HBArF 2, and HBPin (Tex = tert-hexyl; ArF = C6F5). Reactions of Cp∗Ti{MeC(NiPr)2}(NTol) with H2BTex, 9-BBN, or HBArF 2 resulted in the hydride-bridged adducts Cp∗Ti{MeC(NiPr2)2}{N(Tol)HBRR′} without B-H bond cleavage. Cp∗Ti{MeC(NiPr)2}(NNCPh2) (4) reacted with HBArF 2 via a sequence of steps involving adducts at the β- and then α-nitrogen of the NNCPh2 ligand, before slow 1,2-addition of B-H across the N=CPh2 double bond of 4, forming Cp∗Ti{MeC(NiPr)2}{NN(BArF 2)CHPh2} (17). The other boranes reacted immediately with 4 to form homologues of 17. These products are the first examples of borylhydrazido(2-) complexes. Reaction of Cp∗Ti{MeC(NiPr2)2}(NNMe2) (2) with HBArF 2 gave the hydride-bridged adduct Cp∗Ti{MeC(NiPr2)2}{N(NMe2)HBArF 2}, whereas with HBPin B-H bond cleavage occurred to form the borylhydrazide(1-)-hydride Cp∗Ti{MeC(NiPr)2}(H){N(BPin)NMe2}. Finally, reaction of 2 with 9-BBN dimer resulted in H2 elimination and formation of Me2NBC8H14 and Cp∗ Ti{MeC(NiPr)2}(NBC8H14), a rare example of a borylimido compound.
