In contrast to olefin complexes, their congeners of heavier elements display various coordination modes, and their complexes may be present as bis(metallylene) complexes, with side-on coordination, as metallacyclopropanes, or as πcomplexes. In the course of our studies on the reactivity of dilithiostannoles towards transition-metal reagents, three-membered TiSn 2 and six-membered Ti2Sn4 ring complexes were obtained. According to its geometric parameters, NMR analysis, and theoretical calculations, the TiSn2 complex cannot be categorized into any of these previously described bonding modes. Therefore, a novel resonance structure has been proposed for a complex that has a delocalized σ-orbital over the TiSn2 ring to understand its electronic structure. The mechanism for the formation of the Ti2Sn4 ring complex and its EPR spectrum are also discussed. Various characters: Depending on the stoichiometry, the reaction of dilithiostannole1 with [Cp2TiCl2] yields either the three-membered TiSn2 ring complex2 or the six-membered Ti2Sn4 ring complex3. The novel distannene complex 2 can be regarded as a bis(stannylene) complex, as a Sn-Sn σcomplex, and as an unprecedented resonance structure with delocalization of the σorbital over the three-membered TiSn2 ring. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH.
