The remarkable progress in olefin polymerization catalysis and polyolefin technology contributes to sustainable development in manifold ways and helps to meet the urgent demand of the growing world population for cost-, resource-, and energy-efficient as well as environmentally benign materials with a low carbon footprint and facile recycling. The development of multisite catalyst and reactor blend technology will continue to play a prominent role. During the 20th century, in the premetallocene age, many attempts toward multisite and tandem catalysis were commercial failures due to poor process control, which frequently led to the formation of rather ill-defined product mixtures. Today, considerably more robust catalyst systems are at hand combining different single-site catalysts in a single multisite catalyst. Now it is possible to co-immobilize independent sites, thus preserving their single-site nature, to produce reactor blends in which immiscible polymers are blended together and uniformly dispersed on the nanometer scale. Blend composition and properties are primarily governed by the site mixing ratios and the properties of the individual catalyst components. High-throughput screening enables identification of complementary single-site catalysts with matched compatibilities and polymerization kinetics.
