The polyesters were formed in good yields with moderate chain lengths. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy shows bands characteristic of the presence of both reactants with new bands characteristic of the formation of the M‒O and M–O(CO) linkage present. The polymers largely exist in a bridging geometry of the carbonyl groups about the metal atom. Nuclear magnetic resonance shows the presence of bands derived from both reactants. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy shows ion fragments to three units for the polymers with isotopic abundance characteristic of the presence of metal atoms in the ion fragment clusters. All the polymers exhibit good ability to inhibit all the tested cancer cell lines but the zironocene and hafnocene polymers exhibit especially good inhibition of the tested cancer cell lines that included two pancreatic cancer cell lines. They represent a potential new group of anticancer drugs.
