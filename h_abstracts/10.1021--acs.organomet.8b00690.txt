SC-XRD analysis has revealed that the η2 coordinated iminoacyl ligand has an "N-outside" orientation. Compound 2 undergoes rapid Zr-C bond cleavage with the Brønsted acid CpCr(CO)3H or the Lewis acid B(C6F5)3, yielding Zr cation 4 or 5 with the corresponding anion [MeB(C6F5)3]- or [CpCo(CO)3]-. In the solid-state structure of 4, the Zr cation features an η2 "N-inside" geometry for the iminoacyl group and interacts with the [CpCo(CO)3]- via the oxygen atom of one of the CO ligands. Cleavage of the methyl ligand from the Zr of 1 with CpCr(CO)3H proceeds with a second-order rate constant k1 of 2.11(4) × 10-3 M-1 s-1, whereas cleavage of the methyl ligand from the Zr of 2 is significantly faster, with an estimated k2 greater than 104 M-1 s-1. In light of the observed "N-outside" to "N-inside" change from 2 to 4, we propose that the enhanced rate with 2 is due to initial protonation of its nitrogen, subsequent outside-to-inside rotation, and eventual transfer of the proton onto the Zr-C bond.
