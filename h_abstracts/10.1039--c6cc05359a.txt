Â© 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry. Herein we report the synthesis and structural characterization of a series of novel Zr(iv)salan complexes. The initial metalation product [(L1)2Zr] is highly water sensitive while ligand exchanged [L1Zr(dipic)] hydrolyses slowly with a bis-hydroxo Zr(iv) species identified by MS as an intermediate. [L1Zr(dipic)] is cytotoxic in the range of cisplatin against two human carcinoma cell lines.
