The reaction of [Bn 2Cyclam]ZrCl 2 (Bn = benzyl) with 2 equiv of KHBEt 3 generates the ionic dinuclear zirconium derivative [([Bn 2Cyclam]Zr) 2(μ-H) 3][(Et 3B) 2H]. An analogous trihydride is obtained when [Bn 2Cyclam]Zr(CH 2Ph) 2 reacts with BEt 3 in the presence of dihydrogen, whereas in the absence of BEt 3, the bis(ortho-metalated) derivative [(C 6H 4CH 2) 2Cyclam]Zr is obtained. DFT calculations support the stability of a cationic dinuclear trihydride complex in comparison to the neutral dinuclear tetrahydride. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
