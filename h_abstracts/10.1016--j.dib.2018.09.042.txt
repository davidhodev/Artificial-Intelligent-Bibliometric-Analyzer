© 2018 The AuthorsThe data presented in this paper are related to the research article entitled “Effect of ligand structure in the trimethylene carbonate polymerization by cationic zirconocene catalysts: A “naked model” DFT study” (Jitonnom and Meelua, 2017) [1]. In this data article, we present 3D molecular information of 29 zirconocene catalysts that differ in electronic and steric properties. The data contains all cationic species along the initiation and first propagation step of the polymerization, which are provided in a PDB format that can be used for further studies.
