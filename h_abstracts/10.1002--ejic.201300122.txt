The reactivity of the reduced ZrIIICo0 heterobimetallic complex [(thf)Zr(MesNPiPr2)3CoN 2] (1a) towards O-H, S-H, S-S, and O-O bonds has been investigated. Complex 1a reacts readily with PhOH, EtOH, and H2O to generate the one-electron-oxidized complexes [(RO)Zr(MesNPiPr2) 3CoN2] [R = Et (2), Ph (3), H (4)]. In contrast, PhSH and PhS-SPh react by means of overall two-electron processes to form [(η2- MesNPiPr2)Zr(μ-SPh)(MesNPiPr 2)2Co(SPh)] (5a). Addition of stoichiometric diethyl peroxide to 1a generates 2, but further equivalents lead to the two-electron oxidized product [(EtO) Zr(MesNPiPr2)3Co(OEt)] (6). More sterically hindered peroxides such as dicumyl peroxide or di-tert-butyl peroxide do not react with 1a under ambient conditions, but upon photolysis, di-tert-butyl peroxide reacts with 1a to form [(tBuO) Zr(MesNPiPr 2)3CoN2] (7). These results imply that an innersphere electron-transfer process is occurring at the Zr site of 1a upon treatment with these chalcogen-based substrates, and a dissociative electron-transfer mechanism is proposed. © 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
