Several chemical equilibria between these species have been analyzed by NMR and DFT calculations, which revealed that they are mainly controlled by the entropy. Moreover, β-agostic species were found to be lower in enthalpy than the corresponding hydride-ethylene complexes, probably due to the steric pressure exerted by the bulky fac-triphosphane ligand.
