A methylzirconocene cation (with a [B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ] - counterion) transfers a methyl cation equivalent to diphenylphosphino-alkynes to generate (η 2 -alkyne)ZrCp 2 complexes bearing the [RCCPPh 2 Me] + ligand. Two examples of the PMe 3 ligand stabilized [(Me 3 P)Cp 2 Zr(η 2 -RCCPPh 2 Me) + ][B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 - ] salts were characterized by X-ray diffraction. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
