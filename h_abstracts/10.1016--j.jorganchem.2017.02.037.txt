© 2017 Elsevier B.V.The reactivity of the bidentate ancillary ligand 1,2-bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane (dmpe), Me2PCH2CH2PMe2, involving low-valent zirconium complexes was studied. Negishi reagent, Cp2Zr(n-Bu)2, gave zirconocene but-1-ene complexes of monocoordinated dmpe, while dicoordinated Cp2Zr(κ2-dmpe) was not formed. Cp2ZrEt2reacted with dmpe to afford Cp2Zr(η2-ethene)(κ1-dmpe) (2) and [Cp2Zr(η2-ethene)]2(μ,κ1-dmpe) (3). Cp2Zr(κ2-dmpe) (1) prepared by reduction of Cp2ZrCl2with Li in the presence of dmpe reacted with alkynylimine and alkynylthioamide to give the corresponding 1-aza-2-zirconacyclopenta-3,4-diene (6) and 1-thia-2-zirconacyclopenta-3,4-diene (8), respectively, whereas neither conjugated 1-en-3-ynes nor alkynes gave zirconacycle products. Reactions of 1 with iodomethane brought about oxidative addition of C-I to afford Cp2Zr(Me)X (X = Cl, I) species.
