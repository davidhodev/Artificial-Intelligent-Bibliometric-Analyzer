The synthetic methods of trifluoromethylated cyclopentadienes/fulvenes/ norbornenes have been developed using 3-CF3-1,4-dien-3-ols as the synthons, which can be easily prepared by the regiospecific 1,2-addition of the Ruppert-Prakash reagent (TMSCF3) to divinyl ketones. All the reactions are carried out under mild, metal-free conditions to afford the corresponding products in high to excellent yields. Â© 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
