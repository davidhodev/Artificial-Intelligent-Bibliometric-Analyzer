© 2015 Elsevier B.V.Functional groups attached to η5-coordinated cyclopentadienyl or related (indenyl, fluorenyl) ligands in transition metal complexes may be subjected to various synthetic transformations giving rise to novel, often otherwise inaccessible organometallic derivatives. Alternatively, this approach may eliminate the necessity of previous elaborate ligand synthesis. A number of synthetic methods have appeared in the recent past, which are compatible even with reactive electrophilic early transition metal compounds. This review article summarizes the development of functional group chemistry performed at group 4 metallocene, half-sandwich, and related complexes.
