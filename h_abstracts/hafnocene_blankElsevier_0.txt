Â© Prints Publications Pvt. Ltd.Poly(ether esters) are rapidly formed employing the interiacial condensation of metallocene dihalides with glycyrrhetinic acid in high yield producing moderate to high polymeric chain lengths. Infrared spectroscopy shows the formation of metal-oxygen bonds. The products are a mixture of bridging and non-bridging structures about the metal atom. Proton NMR and MALDI MS results are consistent with the formation of the poly (ether esters).
