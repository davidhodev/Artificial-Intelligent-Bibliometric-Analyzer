All rights reserved.Several approaches to the intramolecular activation of a pendant nitrile group attached to the group 4 metallocene framework have been probed starting with the complexes [(η<sup>5</sup>-C<inf>5</inf>Me<inf>5</inf>)(η<sup>5</sup>-C<inf>5</inf>H<inf>4</inf>CMe<inf>2</inf>CH<inf>2</inf>CN)MCl<inf>2</inf>] (M = Zr, 1; M = Ti, 2). A reduction induced activation of the nitrile moiety was effected for the Zr derivative either by the treatment with Mg, or by the alkylation using t-BuMgCl followed by spontaneous reductive elimination. In both cases, the reactions finally yielded the zirconocene cyano complex with an intramolecularly tethered alkyl substituent, [(η<sup>5</sup>-C<inf>5</inf>Me<inf>5</inf>)(η<sup>5</sup>:κC<sup>1</sup>-C<inf>5</inf>H<inf>4</inf>CMe<inf>2</inf>CH<inf>2</inf>)Zr(CN-κC)] (4), which resulted from the C-C bond cleavage in the pendant arm. Furthermore, a by-product was isolated which contained two zirconocene fragments bridged through a MgCl<inf>2</inf> moiety featuring a rare σ,π-bridging mode of the pendant nitrile group, [(η<sup>5</sup>-C<inf>5</inf>Me<inf>5</inf>)(μ-η<sup>5</sup>:η<sup>2</sup>:κN-C<inf>5</inf>H<inf>4</inf>CMe<inf>2</inf>CH<inf>2</inf>CN)(μ-Cl)Zr<inf>2</inf>Mg] (3). The solid-state structure of 3 was elucidated and this compound together with the product 4 and the tentative intermediate [(η<sup>5</sup>-C<inf>5</inf>Me<inf>5</inf>)(η<sup>5</sup>:η<sup>2</sup>-C<inf>5</inf>H<inf>4</inf>CMe<inf>2</inf>CH<inf>2</inf>CN)Zr] (3′) were also investigated by DFT calculations. In another approach, 1 and 2 were treated with Li[B(C<inf>6</inf>F<inf>5</inf>)<inf>4</inf>]Et<inf>2</inf>O to generate cationic complexes. Accidental hydrolysis of these species afforded complexes bearing an intramolecularly tethered amide group [(η<sup>5</sup>-C<inf>5</inf>Me<inf>5</inf>)(η<sup>5</sup>:κO-C<inf>5</inf>H<inf>4</inf>CMe<inf>2</inf>CH<inf>2</inf>CONH<inf>2</inf>)M], of which the Ti derivative (6) was isolated and structurally characterised. Finally, reaction of the zirconocene dimethyl complex [(η<sup>5</sup>-C<inf>5</inf>Me<inf>5</inf>)(η<sup>5</sup>-C<inf>5</inf>H<inf>4</inf>CMe<inf>2</inf>CH<inf>2</inf>CN)ZrMe<inf>2</inf>] (8) with (Ph<inf>3</inf>C)[B(C<inf>6</inf>F<inf>5</inf>)<inf>4</inf>] was studied.
