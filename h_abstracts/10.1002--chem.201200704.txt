Treatment of Me 2S·B(C 6F 5) nH 3-n (n=1 or 2) with ammonia yields the corresponding adducts. H 3N·B(C 6F 5)H 2 dimerises in the solid state through N-H⋯H-B dihydrogen interactions. The adducts can be deprotonated to give lithium amidoboranes Li[NH 2B(C 6F 5) nH 3-n]. Reaction of the n=2 reagent with [Cp 2ZrCl 2] leads to disubstitution, but [Cp 2Zr{NH 2B(C 6F 5) 2H} 2] is in equilibrium with the product of β-hydride elimination [Cp 2Zr(H){NH 2B(C 6F 5) 2H}], which proves to be the major isolated solid. The analogous reaction with [Cp 2HfCl 2] gives a mixture of [Cp 2Hf{NH 2B(C 6F 5) 2H} 2] and the N-H activation product [Cp 2Hf{NHB(C 6F 5) 2H}]. [Cp 2Zr{NH 2B(C 6F 5) 2H} 2]·PhMe and [Cp 2Hf{NH 2B(C 6F 5) 2H} 2]·4(thf) exhibit β-B-agostic chelate bonding of one of the two amidoborane ligands in the solid state. The agostic hydride is invariably coordinated to the outside of the metallocene wedge. Exceptionally, [Cp 2Hf{NH 2B(C 6F 5) 2H} 2]·PhMe has a structure in which the two amidoborane ligands adopt an intermediate coordination mode, in which neither is definitively agostic. [Cp 2Hf{NHB(C 6F 5) 2H}] has a formally dianionic imidoborane ligand chelating through an agostic interaction, but the bond-length distribution suggests a contribution from a zwitterionic amidoborane resonance structure. Treatment of the zwitterions [Cp 2MMe(μ-Me) B(C 6F 5) 3] (M=Zr, Hf) with Li[NH 2B(C 6F 5) nH 3-n] (n=2) results in [Cp 2MMe{NH 2B(C 6F 5) 2H}] complexes, for which the spectroscopic data, particularly 1J(B,H), again suggest β-B-agostic interactions. The reactions proceed similarly for the structurally encumbered [Cp" 2ZrMe(μ -Me)B(C 6F 5) 3] precursor (Cp"=1,3-C 5H 3(SiMe 3) 2, n=1 or 2) to give [Cp" 2ZrMe{NH 2B(C 6F 5) nH 3-n}], both of which have been structurally characterised and show chelating, agostic amidoborane coordination. In contrast, the analogous hafnium chemistry leads to the recovery of [Cp" 2HfMe 2] and the formation of Li[HB(C 6F 5) 3] through hydride abstraction. Copyright © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
