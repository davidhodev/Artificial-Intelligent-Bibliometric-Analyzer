© 2015 American Chemical Society.The synthesis of the ether-substituted group 4 metallocene complexes [Ti(η5-C5H5)(η5-C5H4{CMeRCH(OMe)2})Cl2] (R = Me (4), Ph (5)) and [M(η5-C5H4{CMeRCH(OMe)2})2Cl2] (M = Ti, R = Me (6), Ph (7); M = Zr, R = Me (8), Ph (9)) is reported. In addition, the titanocene derivatives 4-7 have been supported on the mesoporous silica-based material KIT-6, giving the functionalized materials K4-K7, respectively. All compounds and materials have been characterized by different analytical techniques such as solution NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, solid-state multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, X-ray fluorescence and diffraction, SEM, and TEM. Additionally, the molecular structures of the zirconocene derivative 8 and the hydrolysis product [Ti(η5-C5H5)(η5-C5H4{CMe2COO})Cl] (4a) of titanocene complex 4 have been determined by X-ray diffraction studies. The structure of 4a reveals a five-membered metallacyclic arrangement. The ether-substituted titanocene compounds 4-6 and the functionalized material K5 have been tested for their antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects in vitro in three human cancer cell lines (A549 lung adenocarcinoma, MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma, and HCT-116 colorectal adenocarcinoma), as well as in normal human fibroblasts. Compounds 4-6 and K5 showed moderate but specific cytostatic effects. Moreover, additional studies related to the hydrolytic stability (for 4-7) and DNA interaction (for 6) have been carried out. Finally, taking into account the feasible applicability of metallocene complexes, a preliminary ethylene polymerization study has been performed using the two synthesized zirconocene compounds (8 and 9).
