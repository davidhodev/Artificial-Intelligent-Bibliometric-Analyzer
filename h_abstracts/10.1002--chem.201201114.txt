A study regarding coordination chemistry of the bis(diphenylphosphino)amide ligand Ph2P-N-PPh2 at Group 4 metallocenes is presented herein. Coordination of N,N-bis(diphenylphosphino)amine (1) to [(Cp 2TiCl)2] (Cp=Î·5-cyclopentadienyl) generated [Cp2Ti(Cl)P(Ph2)N(H)PPh2] (2). The heterometallacyclic complex [Cp2Ti(κ2-P,P-Ph 2P-N-PPh2)] (3 Ti) can be prepared by reaction of 2 with n-butyllithium as well as from the reaction of the known titanocene-alkyne complex [Cp2Ti(Î·2-Me3SiC 2SiMe3)] with the amine 1. Reactions of the lithium amide [(thf)3Li{N(PPh2)2}] with [Cp 2MCl2] (M=Zr, Hf) yielded the corresponding zirconocene and hafnocene complexes [Cp2M(Cl){κ2-N,P-N(PPh 2)2}] (4 Zr and 4 Hf). Reduction of 4 Zr with magnesium gave the highly strained heterometallacycle [Cp2Zr(κ 2-P,P-Ph2P-N-PPh2)] (3 Zr). Complexes 2, 3 Ti, 4 Hf, and 3 Zr were characterized by X-ray crystallography. The structures and bondings of all complexes were investigated by DFT calculations. All roads lead to Rome: Heterometallacyclic complexes of the type [Cp2M(κ 2-P,P-Ph2P-N-PPh2)] (Cp= Î·5-cyclopentadienyl; M=Ti, Zr) can be prepared by using four different synthetic pathways (see scheme). All routes yielded the corresponding metallacycles in very high yields. Analysis of the structure and bonding of these complexes revealed that in-plane aromaticity plays an important role for the stabilization of these species.
