The zirconocene dinitrogen complex [{(η5-C 5Me4H)2Zr}2(μ2, η2,η2-N2)] was synthesized by photochemical reductive elimination from the corresponding zirconium bis(aryl) or aryl hydride complexes, providing a high-yielding, alkali metal-free route to strongly activated early-metal N2 complexes. Mechanistic studies support the intermediacy of zirconocene arene complexes that in the absence of sufficient dinitrogen promote C-H activation or undergo comproportion to formally ZrIII complexes. When N2 is in excess arene displacement gives rise to strong dinitrogen activation.
