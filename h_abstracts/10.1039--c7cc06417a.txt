© 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Scandium and yttrium congeneric complexes, supported by a monoanionic PNP ligand, were studied as catalysts for alkene hydrogenation and hydrosilation, and alkyne semihydrogenation and semihydrosilation. The yttrium congener was found to be much more active in all cases, but this greater activity is accompanied by more rapid catalyst decomposition and therefore higher total yields for some of the reactions with the scandium catalyst. Calculations indicate that the reactions may proceed via σ-bond metathesis of the alkyl complexes to form metal hydride intermediates into which alkenes/alkynes insert.
