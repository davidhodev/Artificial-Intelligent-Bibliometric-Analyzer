Â© 2015 American Chemical Society.The reaction of a cyclic disilylated bromostibine with magnesium yields a rare example of a magnesium stibide that can be silylated with trimethylchlorosilane. Reaction of the thus-obtained trisilylated stibine with potassium tert-butoxide gives a potassium stibide in a clean reaction. Attempts to obtain an antimony-containing oligosilanide did not lead to the expected compound but to another potassium stibide, which presumably forms from the initially formed silanide by a 1,2-silyl shift. The synthetic potential of the obtained stibides to serve as building blocks could be shown by the preparation of stibylated zircono- and hafnocenes.
