© 2019 the Partner Organisations.A convex-bound sumanenyl hafnocene complex Cp∗(sumanenyl)HfCl2 (Cp∗ = C5Me5) was selectively synthesized. The catalytic activity of the sumanenyl hafnocene and zirconocene was also demonstrated in the hydroethylation reaction of allylbenzene via carboalumination. This is the first example demonstrating the catalytic activity of sumanenyl metallocenes. Furthermore, the sumanenyl ligand was found to exhibit higher reactivity compared to fluorenyl and Cp∗ ligands.
