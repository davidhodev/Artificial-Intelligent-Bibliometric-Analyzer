Â© 2018 American Chemical Society.We report the synthesis and reactivity of Zr complexes supported by a 9,10-anthracenediyl-linked bisphenoxide ligand, L. ZrIVLBn2 (1) undergoes facile photolytic reduction with concomitant formation of bibenzyl and ZrIVL(THF)3 (2), which displays a two-electron reduced anthracene moiety. Leveraging ligand-stored reducing equivalents, 2 promotes the oxidative coupling of internal and terminal alkynes to isolable zirconacyclopentadiene complexes, demonstrating the reversible utilization of anthracene as a redox reservoir. With diphenylacetylene under CO, cyclopentadienone is formed stoichiometrically. 2 is competent for the catalytic formation of pyrimidines from alkynes and nitriles. Mechanistic studies suggest that selectivity for pyrimidine originates from preferred formation of an azazirconacyclopentadiene intermediate, which reacts preferentially with nitriles over alkynes.
