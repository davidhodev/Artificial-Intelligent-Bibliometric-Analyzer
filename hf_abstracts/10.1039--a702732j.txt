Allenyl carbenoids (3-chloro-1-lithioalk-1-ynes) insert into zirconacyclopentanes and zirconacyclopentenes to afford cyclic Î·3-allenyl/prop-2-ynyl zirconocene complexes which give allenyl, alkynyl or cyclised-alcohol products on addition of aldehydes activated with boron trifluoride-diethyl ether.
