After treatment of mice bearing Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) with titanocene dichloride, it could be shown (a) that all cured animals were able to reject EAT cells implanted subsequently and (b) that in the serum of these animals the contents of γ-globulins was markedly increased, whereas after treatment with cis-platinum both the ability to reject EAT cells and the increase of γ-globulins were less pronounced. It is supposed that the observed increase of γ-globulins is due to a stimulated production of antibodies against EAT. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.
