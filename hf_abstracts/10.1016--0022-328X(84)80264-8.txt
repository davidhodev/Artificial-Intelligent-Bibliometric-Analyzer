UV photolysis of mixtures of dialkyl or diaryl complexes of Group IVA metals (η5-t-BuC5H4)2M(CH3)2 (M = Zr, Hf) containing grey selenium gives the new complexes [(η5-t-BuC5H4M(μ-Se)]2 (II). These complexes are also formed by UV irradiation of a solution of equimolar amounts of I and (η5-t-BuC5H4)2M(SePh)2. © 1984.
