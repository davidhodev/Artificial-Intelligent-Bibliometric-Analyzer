The reaction of dimethylzirconocene with nitrosobenzene gave the hydroxylaminatozirconium complex 6. Its structure in the solid state was characterized as the N-inside isomer [η2(O,N)-ON(CH 3)Ph](CH3)-ZrCp2 (6a) by X-ray diffraction. Dynamic 1H NMR spectroscopy indicated a rapid enantiomerization process of the chiral system 6a in solution, probably taking place via a rapid equilibration with a reactive η1(O) isomer. © 2006 American Chemical Society.
