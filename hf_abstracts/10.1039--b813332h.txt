Metal complexes bearing terminal phosphido or phosphinidene ligands have become versatile tools in the stoichiometric and catalytic preparation of phosphorus-element bonds. This Perspective describes a selection of recent advances in this field, and certain emphasis has been placed on reactions that vary from what has been previously observed. Some of the general reactivity trends and mechanistic understanding in these metal-mediated reactions that has emerged are also described. Much of what is chronicled herein comes from a flux of reports over the last decade describing unique metal-mediated phosphorus-element bond formation reactions that are likely to stimulate further discoveries.
