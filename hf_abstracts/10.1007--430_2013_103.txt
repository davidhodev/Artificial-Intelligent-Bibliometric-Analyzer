The chemistry of oligosilanes has made numerous advances since the beginning of the new millennium. While during the time from the 1960s to the 1990s research has concentrated on comparably simple systems, more recent studies have introduced much complexity into oligosilane chemistry. In the course of studies on compounds with one or several multiple bonds between silicon atoms a rich precursor and derivatization chemistry of these compounds was developed. In addition numerous functionalized oligosilanes have been prepared so that today a fairly elaborate repertoire for the synthesis of these compounds exists. Another factor which has strongly contributed to the development of oligosilane chemistry is that oligosilanes are increasingly being applied as reagents as well as activating, protecting, and stereodirecting groups in organic synthesis.
