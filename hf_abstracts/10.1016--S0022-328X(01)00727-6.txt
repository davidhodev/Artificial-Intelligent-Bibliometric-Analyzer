The complexes, Cp2M((μ-H)2BC4H8) (1: M=Ti; 2: M=Nb), Cp2M((μ-H)2BC5H10) (3: M=Ti; 4: M=Nb), and Cp2M((μ-H)2BC8H14) (5: M=Ti; 6: M=Nb), were prepared from the reactions of Cp2MCl2 with the organohydroborate salts, K[H2B2(μ-H)(μ-C4H8) 2], K[H2BC5H10], and K[H2BC8H14], respectively. In these reactions, the transition metal is reduced from M(IV) to M(III), producing 17-electron, paramagnetic titanocene complexes (1, 3 and 5) and eighteen electron, diamagnetic niobocene complexes (2, 4 and 6). Single crystal X-ray structures of 1-6 were determined. The molecular structure of Cp2Nb((μ-H)2BH2) (7) was redetermined using modern CCD techniques. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.
