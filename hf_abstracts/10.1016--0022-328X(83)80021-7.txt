Metallacycles are formed upon thermolysis of (s-trans-η4-butadiene)zirconocene and binuclear (η2-aldehyde)zirconocene complexes or photolysis of diphenylzirconocene in the presence of t-butyl-, trimethylsilyl-, and phenyl-acetylene. From a surprising equally high preference for α-t-butyl- and -trimethylsilyl-substituted products as well as the statistically favoured 2,4-disubstituted metallacyclopentadienes formed from t-butyl- or trimethylsilyl-acetylene it is suggested, that the position of the substituents in the final product is predominantly determined by the coordination of the alkyne preceding the ring-closure reaction. In contrast to the thermally induced reactions the expected major product (2,5-disubstituted zirconacyclopentadiene) of the kinetically controlled cyclization reaction is formed upon photolysis of diphenylzirconocene in the presence of phenylacetylene. © 1983.
