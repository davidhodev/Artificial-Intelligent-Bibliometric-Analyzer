© 2015 American Chemical Society.The zirconocene complexes L2ZrCl2 (L = C5H5, C5H4Me, Ind, C5Me5; L2 = rac-Me2C(2-Me-4-But-C5H2)2, meso-Me2C(2-Me-4-But-C5H2)2, rac-Me2C(3-But-C5H3)2, rac-Me2C(Ind)2, rac-Me2Si(Ind)2, and rac-C2H4(Ind)2) were tested as catalysts in alkene hydroalumination by the isobutylalanes XAlBui2 (X = H, Cl, Bui). A low-temperature NMR spectroscopy study on the structure and dynamics of Zr,Al intermediates formed in the L2ZrCl2-XAlBui2 systems showed that the intra- and intermolecular exchange in the bimetallic clusters, controlled by the steric factor of the η5 ligand and organoaluminum compound nature, determines the activity of the whole catalytic system.
