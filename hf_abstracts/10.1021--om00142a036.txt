: Reaction of tert-butyl isocyanide and cyclo-hexyl isocyanide with dihydride led to multiple insertions into the Zr-H bond and to simultaneous reductive coupling of iso-cyanides with the formation of an unusual zirconacycle: Current interest in the reduction of carbon monoxide has led to studies of the reactivity of CO with various zirconocene hydrides which have resulted in the observation of C-C bond formation.la, bas well as simple CO reduction by these complexes.10Examination of the reactivity of zirconocene hydrides has recently been extended to reactivity with isocyanides, which are isoelectronic with CO.12Specifically, interest has focused on the question of whether CO insertion into a Zr-H bond is thermodynamically feasible and, by analogy, whether such a process occurs in the cp2ZrH2-isocyanide system. Another aspect of this chemistry concerns the role that the cp ligand plays. It has been noted that alkyl sub-stituents on the cp ring increase the ligand to metal electronic donation, thereby heightening metal basicity. Â© 1986, American Chemical Society.
