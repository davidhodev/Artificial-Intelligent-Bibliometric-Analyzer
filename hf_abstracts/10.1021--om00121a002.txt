The crystal and molecular structures of (s-cis-2,3-dimethylbutadiene) hafnocene (3b), (1,2-bis(methylene)cyclohexane)zirconocene (4a), and (1,2-bis(methylene)cyclohexane)hafnocene (4b) have been determined from X-ray data. 3b crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnma with a = 7.994 (1) Å, b = 11.741 (1) Å, c = 14.449 (1) Å, V = 1356.18 Å3, and dcalcd = 1.914 g cm-3 for Z = 4. Full-matrix least-squares refinement of 82 parameters with 1403 unique observed reflections converged at R = 0.030. It is isostructural with the previously reported (s-ds-2,3-dimethylbutadiene)zirconocene complex (3a). 4a crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1̅ with a = 10.506 (1) Å, b = 12.469 (2) Å, c = 12.803 (1) Å, α = 104.77 (1)°, β = 103.083 (7)°, γ = 103.02 (1)°, V = 1506.77 Å3, and dcalcd= 1.453 g cm-3 for Z = 4. Refinement of 343 parameters based on 5184 reflections led to a final R of 0.033. 4b crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n with a = 14.149 (3) Å, b = 8.600 (1) Å, c = 25.642 (2) Å, β = 101.732 (9)°, V = 3054.98 Å3, and dcalcd = 1.813 g cm-3 for Z = 8. Refinement of 343 parameters with 4778 reflections produced R = 0.031. In all three complexes the diene is η4-bonded to the metallocene fragments with the metals in a ψ-tetrahedral coordination. The bonds of the diene termini to the metals are noticeably shorter than those of the internal C atoms of the dienes. The respective bond lengths (3b, 2.267 (5)-2.641 (5) Å; 4a, 2.279 (2)–2635 (6) Å; 4b, 2.255 (8)-2.72 (1) Å) are in a range typical for M-C σ and π bonds of the respective elements. Together with the other geometrical parameters of the diene-metallocene frameworks they allow the following generalizations: (a) (s-cis-η4-diene)zirconocenes and -hafnocenes are best described as σ2,π complexes, (b) the σ/π ratio in the metal-diene bonding is smaller for the zirconocene complexes than for their Hf analogues, (c) this ratio is smaller for 3b than for 4b, a trend which is similar in the previously reported (s-cis-η4-2,3-dimethylbutadiene)zirconocene (3a) and 4a, and (d), Zr-C bonds are slightly longer than their Hf counterparts. Differences in the chemical behavior of corresponding (s-cis-conjugated diene)zirconocene and -hafnocene complexes can be rationalized in view of their characteristic structural features. © 1985, American Chemical Society.
