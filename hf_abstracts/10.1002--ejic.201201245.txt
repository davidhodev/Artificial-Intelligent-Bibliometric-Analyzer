Seven-membered metallacycloalkyne compounds were synthesized. The reaction of the zirconocene-ethylene complex and (Z)-1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)buta-1,2,3- triene gave a mixture of 1-zirconacyclopent-3-yne and 1-zirconacyclohept-3-yne. In contrast, zirconocene-alkyne complexes, such as those of 1-(trimethylsilyl) prop-1-yne and diphenylacetylene, gave 1-zirconacyclohept-2-en-5-yne in good yields. Consideration of structural parameters suggests that both a seven-membered cyclic alkyne and a five-membered structure contribute to generation of this complex. Coupling of benzyne and [3]cumulenes on a metal was also found to afford the corresponding metallacycles. Seven-membered metallacycloalkyne compounds were synthesized and structurally characterized. Zirconocene-alkyne complexes, such as those of 1-(trimethylsilyl)prop-1-yne and diphenylacetylene reacted with [3]cumulene to give 1-zirconacyclohept-2-en-5-yne in good yields. Coupling of benzyne and [3]cumulenes on the metal also gave the corresponding metallacycles. Copyright Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
