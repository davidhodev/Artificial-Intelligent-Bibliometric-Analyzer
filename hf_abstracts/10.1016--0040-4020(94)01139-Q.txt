Deuterium labelling experiments prove that the zirconocene dichloride catalysed ethylmagnesiation of alkenes occurs via a zirconocene η2-ethylene complex and allow a deuterium isotope effect for a key β-hydride transfer to be estimated ( kH kD = 2.5). Transmetallation from zirconium to magnesium to form 1,4-dimagnesiated reagents is shown to be an intramolecular process. Kinetic studies show that the reaction between η2-ethylene zirconocene and the alkene is rate limiting and that Lewis bases inhibit the reaction by decreasing the amount of η2-ethylene zirconocene in equilibrium with the 'ate' complex [Cp2Zr(CH2=CH2)Et]-.[MgX.Base]+. © 1995.
