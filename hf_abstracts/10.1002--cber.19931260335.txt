Monoazadiene Complexes of Electron‐Deficient Transition Metals, I. – Zirconocene(1‐aza‐1,3‐diene) Complexes: Synthesis, Structure and Reactions1 The reduction of Cp2ZrCl2 in THF by Mg in the presence of 1‐aza‐1,3‐dienes 2a–d generates the orange air‐sensitive zirconocene(s‐cis‐1‐aza‐1,3‐diene) complexes 3a–d. 1H‐and 13C‐NMR spectral data of 3a–d indicate that the bonding of the heterodiene ligand has σ2,π1‐metallacyclopentene rather than η4‐1‐aza‐1,3‐diene character. No evidence for s‐trans1‐heterodiene coordination was found in any of the new zirconocene complexes. The molecular structure of 3d has been determined by single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction, confirming the envelope‐shaped σ2,π1‐type structure also in the solid state. 3b slowly reacts with one molar equivalent of acetophenone to give a seven‐membered oxaazametallacycle (4) which has a cis1‐CC bond in the ring. The structure of 4 has been determined by NMR and X‐ray diffraction. Copyright © 1993 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim
