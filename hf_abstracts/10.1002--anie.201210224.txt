Experimental and theoretical charge density studies and molecular orbital analyses suggest that the complexes [Cp2Ti(PMe3)SiH 2Ph2] (1) and [Cp2Ti(PMe3)SiHCl 3] (2) display virtually the same electronic structures. No evidence for a significant interligand hypervalent interaction could be identified for 2. A bonding concept for transition-metal hydrosilane complexes aims to identify the true key parameters for a selective activation of the individual M-Si and Si-H bonds.
