Standard ligand-substitution reactions afforded moderate yields of (PhC 5H 4) 2ZrCl 2 (1), (1,3-Ph 2C 5H 3)CpZrCl 2 (2), [1,3,-(C 6F 5) 2C 5H 3]CpZrCl 2 (5), and [1,2,4-(C 6F 5) 2C 5H 3]CpZrCl 2 (6). Crystal structures of 1, 2, 6, and [(C 6F 5C 5H 4] 2HfMe 2 (7) were obtained. Physicochemical studies (CV, IR) show that C 6F 5 groups are strongly electron-withdrawing compared to phenyl groups. In ethylene-1-hexene copolymerization reactions using 1, 2, (C 6F 5C 5H 4)CpZrCl 2 (3), (C 6F 5C 5H 4) 2ZrCl 2 (4), and 5 (toluene solution, methylalumoxane cocatalyst), C 6F 5 substituents decrease catalytic activity but increase comonomer incorporation compared to phenyl substituents.
