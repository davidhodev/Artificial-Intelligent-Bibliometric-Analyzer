The reactions of tris(2,6-diisopropylphenolato)titanium(IV) chloride with alkali-metal dihydridodiorganylborates M(H2BR2) (M = Li, K; R = Me, C6H11, CMe3; BR2 = BC5H10, BC8H14) led to the corresponding titanium dihydridodiorganylborates. However, in almost all cases byproducts such as (2,6-diisopropylphenolato)diorganylboranes, triorganylboranes, diorganylboranes, diborane and tetrakis(2,6- diisopropylphenolato)titanium(IV) were also generated. (2,6-iPr 2C6H3O)3Ti(H2BR 2) compounds also resulted from the interaction of methyltris(2,6-diisopropylphenolato)titanium, for example, with catecholborane. In addition to the formation of tris(2,6-diisopropylphenolato) catecholboratotitanium(IV), B-methylcatecholborane was also formed The reaction of potassium dihydro-9-cyclooctylborate with 2,6-bis(2,2-di-tert-butyl-2- hydroxyethyl)pyridinetitanium dichloride (LTiCl2) led to the complex LTi(H2BC8H14)2. This compound showed no agostic C-H···Ti interaction in contrast to (2,6-iPr2C6H3O)3TiH 2BC8H14 and the corresponding titanium dihydridobis(cyclohexyl)borate. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
