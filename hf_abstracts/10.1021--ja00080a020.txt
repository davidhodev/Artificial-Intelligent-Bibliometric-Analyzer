A series of silylamido complexes of zirconium, Cp2Zr(X)(NtBuSiMe2H) (X = H, I, Br, Cl, F; 1–5), have been prepared. These complexes exhibit agostic β-Si-H interactions with the metal center and have been characterized by spectroscopic and structural methods. Spectroscopic evidence for the interaction of the Si-H μ-bond with zirconium include (1) abnormally large upfield chemical shifts for the silicon hydride and silicon nuclei in the 1H and 29Si NMR spectra, (2) unusually small values of the silicon-hydrogen coupling constants (1JsiH) and (3) low-energy Si-H stretching frequencies in the infrared spectra. AH of the spectroscopic data also establish a clear trend for the strength of the nonclassical Zr-H-Si interaction in Cp2Zr(X)(NtBuSiMe2H): X = H > I > Br > Cl > F. This ordering directly reflects the relative electrophilicity of the zirconium center. The molecular structures of the hydride and chloride derivatives 1 and 4 as determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies are also consistent with coordination of the Si-H bond to the metal center. In particular, short Zr-Si distances and acute Zr-N-Si angles point to a severe bending of the silyl group toward zirconium, and the location of the amido group near the center of the metallocene equatorial wedge is consistent with a Cp2ML3 coordination environment, not the Cp2ML2 geometry implied by the formula Cp2Zr(NR2)(X). © 1994, American Chemical Society.
