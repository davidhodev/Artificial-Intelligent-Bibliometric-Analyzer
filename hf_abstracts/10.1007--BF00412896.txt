The antitumor activity of the metallocene dichlorides TDC, ZDC, and HDC against Ehrlich ascites tumor in CF 1 mice is investigated. A single i.p. injection of TDC in the optimum dose (30-60 mg/kg) 24 h p.t.t. achieves survival of 80-90% of the animals until day 180 p.t.t. without any tumor manifestation. This indicates an increase in the mean survival time of about 900% referred to the untreated animals. In contrast, ZDC and HDC exhibit no recognizable antineoplastic properties under equal experimental conditions. Assuming a similar mechanism of tumor inhibition for both DDP and the antineoplastic active metallocene dichlorides TDC, VDC, and MDC, the comparatively increased non-bonding Cl... Cl distance ("bite") of ZDC and HDC may be responsible for the cancerostatic inactivity of the latter compounds. Â© 1980 Springer-Verlag.
