The complex [TiCl2{η5-C5Me 4(SiMe2H)}2] (3) was prepared by reacting the lithium salt of 2,3,4,5-tetramethyl-1-(dimethylsilyl)cyclopenta-2,4-diene (1) with [TiCl3(THF)3] followed by chlorination of the formed [TiCl{η5-C5Me4(SiMe2H)} 2] (2) with PbCl2. The reduction of 3 with excess magnesium in THF in the presence of excess bis(trimethylsilyl)ethyne (btmse) afforded the bivalent metal ansa disilylene complex with π-coordinated btmse [Ti{η5-C5Me4(SiMe2)} 2(η2-btmse)] (4). The dehydrocoupling of the SiMe 2H groups was accompanied by hydrogen transfer to the free btmse. Analogous reduction of 3 with magnesium in the presence of ethene gave a mixture of titanocene [Ti{η5-C5Me4(SiMe 2Et)}2] (5) and its ethene complex [Ti{η5- C5Me4(SiMe2Et)}2(η2- C2H4)] (6). The latter complex is however unstable in this mixture and rearranges with evolution of ethane to [Ti{η5-C 5Me4(SiMe2Et)}{η5: η2-C5Me4(SiMe2CH= CH 2)}] (7), which has its vinyl group attached by π-coordination to Ti(II). The chlorination of 4 by PbCl2 yields ansa-[TiCl 2{η5-C5Me4(SiMe 2)}2] (8), liberating the btmse ligand. Complex 8 is reduced with a half-equivalent of Mg to give ansa-[TiCl{η5-C 5Me4(SiMe2)}2] (9). Compounds 5, 6, and 7 were identified by 1H, 13C, and 29Si NMR spectra. The crystal structures of complexes 3, 4, and 9 have been determined by X-ray crystallography. © 2008 American Chemical Society.
