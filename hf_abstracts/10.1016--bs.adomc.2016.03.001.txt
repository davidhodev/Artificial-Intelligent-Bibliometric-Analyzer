The activation and functionalization of N2 is certainly one of the most challenging reactions for molecular chemists. In industry N2 and H2 are converted into NH3 by heterogeneous catalysts under harsh reaction conditions, whereas biology accomplishes the formation of NH3 under ambient conditions. This has inspired many chemists to pursue this goal using molecular (homogeneous) catalysts. In the past two decades, tremendous progress has been made and in the course of these studies new reactivity patterns have emerged and new ligand design strategies have been developed. Furthermore, first steps to incorporate dinitrogen as an earth abundant feedstock into value-added organic molecules have been taken. This review is intended to summarize some of the most relevant contributions to this area and also to present the latest developments in dinitrogen rare-earth and actinide chemistry.
