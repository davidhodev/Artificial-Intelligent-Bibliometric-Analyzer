(Chemical Equation Presented) The C-D activation of bromobenzene-d 5 by [Cp*2ZrMe(BrC6D5-kBr)] [B(C6F5)4] to form σ-aryl complex [Cp*2Zr(2-BrC6D4-k2Br,C)] [B(C6F5)4] is accelerated when the decamethylzirconocene methyl cation is generated in the presence of tertiary amines. Computational studies suggest that the overall B-bond metathesis reaction proceeds, in the presence of tertiary amines, via initial deprotonation of bromobenzene in the coordination sphere of the metal center. In a subsequent step, the resulting neutral methyl aryl species, Cp*2ZrMe(2- BrC6D4), reacts with the concurrently generated trialkylammonium cation to generate [Cp*2Zr(2-BrC 6D4-k2Br,C)] [B(C6F5)4]. © 2009 American Chemical Society.
