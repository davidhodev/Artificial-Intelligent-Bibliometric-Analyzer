Titanocene, zirconocene, and hafnocene derivatives with an interannular 1,1,4,4-tetramethyl-1,4-disilabutylene bridge were synthesized by the reaction of the dilithium derivative of 1,4-dicyclopentadienyl-1,1,4,4-tetramethyl- 1,4-disilabutane with titanium, zirconium, and hafnium tetrachlorides in THF. The identities of all new compounds have been documented by analytical as well as by spectroscopic (IR, MS, 1H and 13C NMR) data. Â© 1991, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
