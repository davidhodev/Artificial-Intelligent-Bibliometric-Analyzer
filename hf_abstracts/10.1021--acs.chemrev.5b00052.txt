Isomerization of allylbenzenes have been used as starting materials in many multistep syntheses. Many naturally occurring 1-propenylbenzenes have therefore been directly isolated from essential oils in which they occur and subsequently synthetically transformed to afford a wide range of diversified products, most of which display interesting bioactivities. It should be noted that 1-propenylbenzenes have also been very popular substrates for the development of new synthetic methods, requiring, in particular, the synthesis of purecis and trans isomers of these compounds.
