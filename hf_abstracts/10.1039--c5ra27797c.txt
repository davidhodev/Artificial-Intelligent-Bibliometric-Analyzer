© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016. Polymerisation of 1-decene, 1-dodecene, 1-hexadecene, and 1-octadecene by Cp∗TiCl2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) (1) - MAO catalysts yielded high molecular weight polymers with unimodal molecular weight distributions, and the Mn values in the resultant polymers were higher than those prepared by linked half-titanocene, [Me2Si(C5Me4) (NtBu)]TiCl2 and ordinary zirconocenes (Cp2ZrCl2etc.); Cp∗TiMe2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) - [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] catalyst showed higher catalytic activities, affording ultrahigh molecular weight polymers (Mn = >1.07 × 106).
