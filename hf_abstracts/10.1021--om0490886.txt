The dehydrocoupling polycondensation of dihydro(tetraphenyl)metalloles, where every silicon or germanium atom of the oligomer backbone is part of a silole or germole rink was presented. Slightly less reactive catalyst systems of mol % of Wilkinson's catalyst, ((RhCl(PPh 3) 4 yield the oligometallole in good yield. It is observed that under less vigorous reflux conditions, the (tetraphenyl)silole dimer may be isolated in 40% yield. X-ray structural characterization of the dimer reveals a Si-Si bond length of 2.363 Å and an H-Si-Si-H torsion angle of 90(2)°.
