Cp2Zr(-NCHR)Cl compounds (9a-9c: R = CH3, C6H5, CH2Ph,respectively) are formed upon hydrozirconation of nitriles. Subsequent reaction with an aryllithium reagent yields Cp2Zr(-NCHR)Ar (14). The (alkylidene amido)zirconocene complexes are characterized by a linear heteroallene-type structure possessing an sp-hybridized nitrogen atom. 9 reacts with the oligomeric metallocene dihydrides (Cp2ZrH2)x (15) and (Cp2HfH2)c, (17), respectively, to form the binuclear compounds Cp2Zr(μ-NCHR)(μ-Cl)MCp2 (16, M = Zr) and (18, M = Hf). The formation of these thermally very stable metal complexes is discussed. © 1985.
