A Rh-catalyst derived from (NacNac)Rh(COE)(N2) effects the hydrogenation and silylation of P-P bonds to give secondary phosphines and silylphosphines, (Ph2PH) and (Ph2PSiRR′2) respectively; the latter process is shown to also involve the silylation of secondary phosphines. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.
