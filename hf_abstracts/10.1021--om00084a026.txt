Dibenzylzirconocene (3a) and (s-trans-ƞ4-trans, trans-1,4-diphenylbutadiene)zirconocene (5) are formed rapidly upon irradiation of benzyl(β-styryl)-zirconocene (2a) in benzene at ambient temperature. Trapping and crossover experiments using benzyl chloride and (β-styryl)zirconocene chloride and the kinetic influence of added “moderators” trimethyl phosphite and triphenylphosphine in addition to ESR experiments point to a radical reaction mechanism for alkenyl group transfer. Transfer and coupling of alkenyl ligands can also be initiated in a dark reaction when starting from methyl(β-styryl)zirconocene (2b). © 1984, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
