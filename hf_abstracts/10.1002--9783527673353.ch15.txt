Â© 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.This chapter focuses solely on the metal-metal bonded compounds containing organometallic antimony or bismuth fragment. A review of the literature shows that metal-metal bonds involving antimony and bismuth are present in a plethora of organometallic derivatives and coordination complexes. The first part of the chapter is concerned with the chemistry of main group only compounds in which two or more antimony or bismuth atoms are covalently linked via single or multiple bonds. The second part of the chapter deals with the chemistry of transition metal complexes containing organometallic antimony or bismuth fragments in their coordination sphere. The chapter recognizes that stibines and bismuthines are donor ligands that interact with metal centers via coordination bonds. It documents chemistry of complexes featuring R2Pn, RPn. The chapter discusses recent advances made in the chemistry of complexes containing pentavalent antimony moieties bound to d-block metals.
