Structure and Reactivity of Bis(π‐pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)(2‐methylidene)titanacyclobutane The reaction of vinyllithium with bis(π‐pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)titanium dichloride in a molar ratio of 2:1 quantitatively yields the unexpected titanacyclobutane derivative (2) (Cp* = [C5(CH3)5]). The isolated complex 2 has been characterized by spectroscopic methods and by elemental analysis, and its structure has been confirmed by an X‐ray structure determination. The chemical reactivity of 2 is characterized by the splitting of the four‐membered ring at higher temperatures, forming a titanocene vinylidene fragment {Cp2*Ti = C = CH2} and ethylene. This cycloreversion is confirmed by the fragmentation behavior in the mass spectrometer, and some aspects of it have been studied by Extended Hückel Model calculations.
