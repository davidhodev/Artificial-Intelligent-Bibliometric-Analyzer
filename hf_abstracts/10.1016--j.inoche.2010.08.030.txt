In situ generated Cp2Zr(n-Bu)Cl (6) reacts with {2-[(CH 3)2NCH2]C6H4} 2Pb to form exclusively {2-[(CH3)2NCH 2]C6H4}Cp2ZrCl (7), [(CH 3)2NCH2]C6H5, butene and elemental lead. The further derivatization of chloride (7) to fluoride (8), hydride (9), methyl derivative (10), and a reduction of 7 are also described. The crystal structures of 7-10 were determined. The catalytic activity of 9 and 10 in hydrogenation of styrene was also preliminarily tested. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
