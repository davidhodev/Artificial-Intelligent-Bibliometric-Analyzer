Metallacyclobutenes via η2‐Cyclopropene Complexes of Titanocene and Zirconocene (η2‐Cyclopropene)(trimethylposphane) complexes of titanocene (4, 5) and zirconocene (8) are obtained in good yields by the reaction of 1,2‐diphenylcyclopropene (2) or 4,8‐dioxaspiro[2.5]oct‐1‐ene (3) with bis(trimethylphosphane)titanocene (1) and (1‐butene)(trimethylphosphane)zirconocene (7), respectively. In solution the new complexes 4 and 8 rearrange smoothly above room temperature to give the metallacyclobutene derivatives 6 and 9. All new compounds were characterized by spectroscopic methods (31P, 1H, 13C NMR), and the crystal structure of 9 was determined by an X‐ray analysis. Copyright © 1991 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
