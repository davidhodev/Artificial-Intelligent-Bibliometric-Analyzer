The zirconocene η2-formaldehyde dimer 6 reacts with trialkylchlorosilanes R3SiCl (R = ethyl, methyl, isopropyl) to yield the (η2-(trialkylsiloxy)methyl)zirconocene chloride complexes Cp2- Zr(Cl)CH2OSiR3 (7a-c). These complexes exhibit internal O-coordination; they belong to a metallaoxirane structural type. Thermolysis of 7b,c at 110 °C leads to equilibration with the isomers 8b,c and 9b,c. Complexes 8 are the acyclic Cp2Zr(Cl)CH2OSiR3 isomers of 7, whereas dyotropic rearrangement has resulted in the formation of the Cp2Zr(Cl) OCH2SiR3 products 9. The kinetics of the thermally induced rearrangement of 7b (R = CH3) is described by a 8b ⇌ 7b → 9b kinetic scheme. At 110 °C the K(8b ⇌ 7b) equilibrium constant is 0.35. The Gibbs activation energy of the 7b → 8b isomerization at 110 °C is ΔG‡isom(383 K) = 30.9 ± 0.5 kcal mol-1. The activation barrier of the 7b →9b transformation is in the expected range of a concerted dyotropic rearrangement process at ΔG‡dyo(383 K) = 31.5 ± 0.5 kcal mol-1. Treatment of 6 with triphenylchlorosilane has resulted in the direct formation of the acyclic addition product Cp2Zr(Cl)CH2OSiPh3 (8d). Our study underlines the important participation of metallaoxirane type structures in dyotropic rearrangement systems. © 1994, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
