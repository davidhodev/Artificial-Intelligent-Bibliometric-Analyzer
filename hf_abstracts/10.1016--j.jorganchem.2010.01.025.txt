Air-stable titanocene bis(perfluorooctanesulfonate) [Cp2Ti(OSO2C8F17)2] that shows high Lewis acidity was prepared from Cp2TiCl2 and AgOSO2C8F17. The compound was characterized by different techniques, and examined as a catalyst for acylation reactions. It was found that using equimolar acetic anhydride as acetylating agent and under solvent-free condition, Cp2Ti(OSO2C8F17)2 exhibits high activity and selectivity in the acetylation of various alcohols, phenols, thiols, and amines. Also, good catalytic efficiency is observed in the acylation of 2-phenylethanol across various acylating reagents. The catalyst can be reused without loss of activity in a test of ten cycles. The Cp2Ti(OSO2C8F17)2 catalyst affords a simple, efficient and general method for the acylation of alcohols, phenols, thiols, and amines. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
