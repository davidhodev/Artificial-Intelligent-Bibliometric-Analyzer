On the tracks of Schwartz's reagent: Two zirconocene hydrido amidate complexes are synthesized by formal oxidative addition of amide N-H bonds to reduced zirconocene fragments. Insertion reactions with alkenes show a different behavior than Schwartz's reagent by forming branched insertion products. The insertion product and the hydrido complex are characterized by X-ray analysis. Copyright Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
