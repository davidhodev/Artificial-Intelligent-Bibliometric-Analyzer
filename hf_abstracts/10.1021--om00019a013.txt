In the presence of excess butylmagnesium chloride and in diethyl ether at 25 °C, zirconocene dichloride is an effective catalyst precursor for the the stereoselective cyclization of nonconjugated dienes containing a terminal alkoxide substituent. The products are carbocyclic rings containing adjacent vinyl and methyl substituents with trans stereochemistry. © 1994, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
