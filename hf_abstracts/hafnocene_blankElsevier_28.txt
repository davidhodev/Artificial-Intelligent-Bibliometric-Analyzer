In this study, behaviours of ethylene/norbornene copolymerization using zirconocene catalysts; rac-Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 (cat. A) and Cp2ZrCl2 (cat. B) were investigated. Based on activity profiles at various norbornene concentrations, it can be observed that although cat. A is more active than cat. B, it is less stable, indicating more rapid deactivation rates with time. It was found that deactivation rates was more pronounced with high concentrations of norbornene for both catalytic systems. Asymmetric activity profiles were observed for both catalytic systems indicating higher deactivation rates compared to the activation rates. The copolymer produced by cat. A exhibited lower melting temperature (Tm), but higher incorporation of norbornene. However, both catalysts produced copolymers with random distribution.
