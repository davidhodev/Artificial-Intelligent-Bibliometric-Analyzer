The phase behavior of poly(ethylene-co-styrene) (PES) and poly(ethylene-co-butene) (PEB) blends has been studied. A closed-loop phase diagram was clearly observed in this weakly interacting system as the styrene content in the PES decreased to about 1 mol-%. At higher styrene contents, the phase loop starts to interplay with the crystallization transformation at lower temperatures. Â© 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
