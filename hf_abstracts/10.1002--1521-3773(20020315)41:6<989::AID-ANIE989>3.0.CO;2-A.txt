Multiply metalated oligosilanes: Treatment of bridged bis[tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl] compounds with two equivalents of potassium tert-butoxide leads to the formation of 1,3- and 1,4-dipotassium silanes [Eq. (1)]. Reaction of the latter with zirconocene dichloride and hafnocene dichloride, respectively, gives the corresponding metallacyclopentasilanes.
