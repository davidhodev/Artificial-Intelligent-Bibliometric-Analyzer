The zirconocene-alkyne complex Cp2Zr(py)(η2-Me3SiC2SiMe3 ) reacts with methyl vinyl ketone to yield the zirconadihydrofuran Cp2ZrOCMe=CHCH2 (1). In contrast, rac-(ebthi)Zr(η2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) (ebthi = 1,2-ethylene-1,1′-bis(η5-tetrahydroindenyl) reacts with methyl vinyl ketone giving, for the first time, the 1,4-conjugated insertion product rac-(ebthi)ZrOCMe=CHCH2C(SiMe3)=C(SiMe3) (2) in good yield. An X-ray crystallographic structure determination of 2 shows that the seven-membered ring is twisted in such a way to fit the steric demands of the "ebthi" and SiMe3 groups. Treating rac-(ebthi)Zr(η2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) with tert-butyl acrylate gives the zirconadihydrofuran rac-(ebthi)ZrOC(OtBu)=CHCH2 (3). The monomeric structure of 3 has been established by X-ray crystallography. A different type of zirconadihydrofuran, rac-(ebthi)ZrOCMe(CH=CH2)-C(SiMe3)=C(SiMe3) (4), results from the reaction with mesityl oxide. Complexes analogous to 4 and 2 were observed consecutively by NMR in the reaction of Thi2Zr(η2-Me3SiC2SiMe3 ) (Thi = η5-tetrahydroindenyl) with methyl vinyl ketone. This lets one conclude that the carbonyl insertion products (e.g. 4) are formed first as intermediates. Finally, rac-(ebthi)ZrCH2CHMe=CHCH2 (5), a zirconacyclopentene, is obtained from rac-(ebthi)Zr(η2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) and isoprene.
