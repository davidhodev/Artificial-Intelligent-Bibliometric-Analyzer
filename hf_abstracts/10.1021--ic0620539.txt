An activated side-on-bound ansa-zirconocene dinitrogen complex, [Me 2 Si(η 5 -C 5 Me 4 )(η 5 - C 5 H 3 -3- t Bu)Zr] 2 (μ 2 , η 2 ,η 2 -N 2 ), has been prepared by sodium amalgam reduction of the corresponding dichloride precursor under an atmosphere of N 2 . Both solution spectroscopic and X-ray diffraction data establish diastereoselective formation of the syn homochiral dizirconium dimer. Addition of 1 atm of H 2 resulted in rapid hydrogenation of the N 2 ligand to yield one diastereomer of the hydrido zirconocene diazenido complex. Kinetic measurements have yielded the barrier for H 2 addition and in combination with isotopic labeling studies are consistent with a 1,2-addition pathway. In the absence of H 2 , the hydrido zirconocene diazenido product undergoes swift diazene dehydrogenation to yield an unusual hydrido zirconocene dinitrogen complex. The N=N bond length of 1.253(5) Å determined by X-ray crystallography indicates that the side-on-bound N 2 ligand is best described as a two-electron reduced [N 2 ] 2- fragment. Comparing the barrier for deuterium exchange with [Me 2 Si(η 5 -C 5 Me 4 )(η 5 -C 5 H 3 -3- t Bu)ZrH] 2 (μ 2 ,η 2 , η 2 -N 2 H 2 ) to diazene dehydrogenation is consistent with rapid 1,2-elimination of dihydrogen followed by rate-determining hydride migration to the zirconium. This mechanistic proposal is also corroborated by H 2 inhibition and the observation of a normal, primary kinetic isotope effect for dehydrogenation. © 2007 American Chemical Society.
