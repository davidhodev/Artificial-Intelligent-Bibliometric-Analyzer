Zirconocene derivatives with interannular MeN(CH2 CH2)2, C5H3N(CH2)2-2,6 or C6H4(CH2)2-1,3 bridges were synthesised by the reaction of the corresponding disodium salts with ZrCl4. The crystal structure of dichloro[m-phenylenedimethylenebis(η5-cyclopentadienyl)]zirconium was determined by X-ray crystallography. The compound crystallizes in space group P212121 with cell parameters: a = 13.519(4), b = 13.671(3), c = 8.557(2) Å, Z = 4, R = 0.034 and R′ = 0.039.
