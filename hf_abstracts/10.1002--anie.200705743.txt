(Figure Presented) Close relatives! The Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation of the "isolated" C=C double bonds of dibenzo[c,g]fluorenide coordinated to an FeII center confirms that the electronic structure of this ligand in organometallic compounds is related to that of cyclopentadienide. The resulting 3,4,3′,4′-tetrahydrodibenzo[c,g]fluorenide is a new chiral cyclopentadienide ligand (see picture for the molecular structure of the Fe complex). © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
