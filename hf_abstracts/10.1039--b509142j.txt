Multiply-substituted iminocyclopentadienes were formed from Lewis acid-promoted reactions of zirconacyclopentadienes and isocyanates via a one-pot three-component coupling process; the C=O double bond of the RN=C=O moiety in the isocyanate was cleaved, and the isocyanates behaved formally as a one-carbon unit with Lewis acid-dependent and substituent-dependent reactions being realized.
