The electron ionization mass spectrometric behaviour of a new series of hafnocene and zirconocene dialcoholates is discussed. Deprotonized moieties of menthol, verbenol and hydroxypinanone were used as Ïƒ-ligands. These data are also compared to those of mass-analysed ion kinetic energy spectrometry. The fragmentation pattern of the complexes in question gives relevant information on their gas-phase behaviour and on the influence of the ligand's structure on the decomposition pathways as well.
