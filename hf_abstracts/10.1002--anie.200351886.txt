Complexes with backbone: Upon photolysis the title complexes undergo intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition to yield unique cyclobutylene-bridged ansa-zirconocenes. The annelated phenylene rings of the indenyl ligand lie directly above and below the σ ligands of the bent metallocene wedge (see picture). Ligands that are introduced inside the resulting "phenylene π-electron box" display special chemical and spectroscopic features.
