The directed oligomerization of propene and 1-hexene was carried out with a series of CP′(C5H5)ZrCl2 and Cp′2ZrCl2 pre-catalysts (Cp′ = C5HMe4, C4Me4P, C5Me5, C5H4tBu, C5H3-1,3-tBu2, C5H2-1,2,4-tBu3) together with (C5H5)2ZrCl2. Oligomers in the molar mass range 300-1500 g/mol for propene and 200-3000 g/mol for 1-hexene were synthesized at 50 °C. The majority of oligomer molecules contain a double-bond end group. Oligomer characterization was carried out by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), 1H and 13CNMR. Vinylidene double bonds (from Β-hydrogen elimination) are solely found for the tert-butyl-substituted zirconocenes and for most of the unsymmetrical methyl-substituted Cp′(C5H5)ZrCl2 systems (except Cp′ = phospholyl). With (C4Me4P)(C5H5)ZrCl2 and with the symmetrical methyl-containing Cp′2ZrCl2 pre-catalysts, also vinyl end groups (from Β-methyl elimination) are observed in the case of oligopropenes. The vinylidene/vinyl ratio depends on the ligand and the vinyl content increases from C5HMe4 (65/35) over C4Me4P (61/39) to C5Me5 (9/91). The phospholyl zirconocenes and (C5HMe4)2ZrCl2 also exhibit chain-transfer to aluminum thereby giving saturated oligomers. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
