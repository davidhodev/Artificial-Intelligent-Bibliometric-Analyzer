The TpMe2Ir moiety has proven to easily promote the formal oxidative addition reactions of unsaturated molecules, with or without concomitant formation of carbon-carbon bonds, to form metallacyclic species. The ring sizes may range between having 5- and 7 members, and these metallacycles exhibit a rich reactivity. Some of these metallacycles represent stable models of intermediates proposed in catalytic processes such as alkyne cyclotrimerization or olefin/alkyne coupling. The stability of these Tp Me2IrIII species allows the mechanistic investigation of the reactions observed, by way of the isolation and/or trapping of intermediates. Many kinds of iridacycles containing the TpMe2Ir moiety (iridacyclopentene, -pentadiene, -heptadiene, -heptatriene and -benzenoid derivatives) have been obtained starting from the IrI precursors TpMe2Ir(C2H4)2and/or Tp Me2[I·4-CH2=C(R)C(R)=CH2] (R = H, Me). The synthesis and reactivity of these species is the subject of the present review. Copyright © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
