Condensation of cyclopentadienyl anions obtained from fulvenes and tetra- chloride metal to prepare (η5-RC5H4)2MCl2, R = alkyl; M = Zr or Hf is described. The prochiral complexes (η5-RC5H4) (η5-C5H5)MCl2 are prepared in a similar way from MCl4 (M = Zr), but the best method uses (η5-C5H5)ZrCl3 or (η5-C5H5)HfCl3, 2THF. Preparation of this adduct is described. © 1978.
