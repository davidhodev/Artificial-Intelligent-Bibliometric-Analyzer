The synthesis and structural analysis of the hetero-bimetallic M-Al complexes MMe[(O-2,4-tBu2C6H 2-6-CH2)2(μ2-O-2,4- tBu2C6H2-6-CH2)N][Me 2Al(μ2-OiPr)] [M = Zr, Hf], prepared from M(OiPr)[{(O-2,4-tBu2C6H 2)-6-CH2}3N] by treating with 1.0 equiv. of AlMe3, have been explored: these complexes exhibited catalytic activities for ethylene polymerisation in n-octane in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO). The Zr-Al analogue showed high catalytic activities affording polymers with unimodal molecular weight distributions. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
