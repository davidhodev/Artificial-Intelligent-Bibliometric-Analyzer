The use of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, (C6F5)3B, as a cocatalyst in the dehydrocoupling of phenylsilane, in the presence of zirconocene-derived catalysts, leads to suppression of chain scission reactions and to an increase in polysilane chain length (Mn > 7000). An exhaustive multinuclear NMR study of the catalytic species leads to the conclusion that they are zirconocene-(IV) hydride bridged dimers, with a “cation-like” silylium ligand on each zirconium: [Cp2Zr(SiHPh)(μ-H)]2[Bu2(C6F5)2B]2. © 1994, American Chemical Society.
