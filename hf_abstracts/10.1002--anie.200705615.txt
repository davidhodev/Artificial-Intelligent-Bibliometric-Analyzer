Metallocene lends a hand: Treatment of [bis(alkynyl)HfCp2] complexes with HB-(C6F5)2 results in1,1-hydroboration and subsequent carbon-carbon coupling to yield the corresponding metallacyclopenta-1,2-diene derivatives (see structure of the trimethylsilyl derivative; Hf brown, B red, Si blue, F green, C black). X-ray diffraction and a quantum chemical analysis reveal anelectron ic structure between a bent cyclic allene and a coordinated butenyne. (Figure Presented). Â© 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
