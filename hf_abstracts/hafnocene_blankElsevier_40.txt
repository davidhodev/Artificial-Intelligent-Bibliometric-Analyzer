The phosphonium-bridged ansa-metallocene complexes {[Me2P(C5Me4)2]ZrCl 2}+ and {[Me2P(C5Me4)2]HfCl 2}+ have been prepared by the reactions of {[Me2P(C5Me4)2]Li2}I with ZrCl4 and HfCl4, respectively; the isolation and structural characterization of {[Me2P-(C5Me4)2]ZrCl 2}+ complete a series of isostructural zirconocene derivatives, namely, [R2P(CpR)2-ZrCl2]+, [R2E(CpR)2ZrCl2] (E = C, Si, Ge), and [R2B(CpR)2ZrCl2]-, which differ according to the charge on the complex.
