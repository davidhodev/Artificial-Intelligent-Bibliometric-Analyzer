Recently, an asymmetric ansa-zirconocene dichloride complex that is able to introduce single stereoerrors into an isotactic polypropene chain as a function of monomer concentration is described. Though, one major requirement for the practical application of such new materials is a molecular weight high enough to ensure satisfying tensile and creep properties below and above room temperature. This paper reports on a series of new asymmetric zirconocene dimethyl, hafnocene dichloride, and hafnocene dimethyl complexes for the homopolymerization of propene in toluene solution and in liquid monomer after MAO and borate activation.
