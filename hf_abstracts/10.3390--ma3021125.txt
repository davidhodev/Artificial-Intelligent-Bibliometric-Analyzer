The Cp2ZrCl2/2 BuLi catalyzed co-polymerization of H2MeSiSiMeH2 and PhSiH3 was compared to the homo-polymerization of H2MeSiSiPhH2. In contrast to the copolymerization, which gave molecular weights comparable to homo-polymerization of phenylsilane, the reaction of 1-methyl-2-phenyldisilane yielded a partially cross-linked high molecular weight polymer with very broad molecular weight distribution. A higher reactivity of phenyl-substituted silicon atoms compared to methyl-substituted ones was detected. Stoichiometric reactions of some disilanes with the slow dehydropolymerization catalyst CpCp*Hf(Cl)Si(SiMe3)3 gave metal disilanyl intermediates with selectivities that reflect the observed polymerization behavior.
