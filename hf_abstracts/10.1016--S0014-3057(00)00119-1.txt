This paper describes ethylene polymerization using four kinds of zirconocene with different substitutionary groups in Cp ring as catalysts and aluminoxane as cocatalyst. Their polymerization activities and Mη of resultant polyethylene were compared. It was found basically that in Tp = 70 °C and Al/Zr = 1000, polymerization activities were of the following order: A2>B2>A1>B1 [A1: (CH2 double bond CH-CH2-CH2-Cp)2ZrCl2; B1: (CH2 double bond CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-Cp)2ZrCl2; A2: {CH2 double bond C(CH3)-CH2-Cp}2ZrCl2; B2: {CH3(CH3)-C double bond CH-CH2-Cp}2ZrCl2]. Polymerization activities were affected greatly by polymerization conditions. The influences of catalyst concentrations on polymerization activities were discussed. The possible effect mechanism of different substitutionary groups in Cp ring on polymerization activities was investigated.
