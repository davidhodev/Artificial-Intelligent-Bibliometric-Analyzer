The titanium and zirconium complexes (η5- C5H5)2M(OAr)2 (M = Ti, Zr; Ar = C6H5, p-MeOC6H4, p-MeC6H4,p-ClC6H4, p-CNC6H4 are shown to be convenient, stable precursors of dehydrocoupling catalysts. Their reactions with a primary silane, at 50 °C or below, generate active catalysts for RSiH3 dehydrocoupling at 20 °C. © 1995, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
