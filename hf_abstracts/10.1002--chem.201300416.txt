1,2,3,4-Tetrasubstituted cyclopentadienes and indene derivatives with identical or different substituents were obtained in good to excellent isolated yields through a zirconocene- and CuCl-mediated intermolecular coupling process. This synthetic procedure involved three organic partners, including one CH 2I2, and two different or identical alkynes. Two alkynes or one diyne undergo Cp2ZrII-mediated (Cp= η5-C5H5) pair-selective reductive coupling to afford the corresponding zirconacyclopentadiene derivatives, which react, in the presence of CuCl and 1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(1 H)-pyrimidinone (DMPU), with CH2I2 through intermolecular followed by intramolecular coupling to afford the cyclopentadiene derivatives. An application of the prepared tetrasubstituted cyclopentadiene derivatives was demonstrated by the facile synthesis of the corresponding zirconocene complexes [(4RCp)2ZrCl2] and [(4RCp) 2ZrR′2] (R′=Me, Et, or nBu). The unique 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted cyclopentadiene ligands and the corresponding metallocenes are expected to have further applications in organometallic chemistry and organic synthesis. Ringing in the changes: A one-pot synthesis of 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted cyclopentadienes by zirconocene- and CuCl-mediated intermolecular coupling of two alkynes and diiodomethane (see scheme; Cp=η5-C5H5; DMPU=1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6- tetrahydro-2(1 H)-pyrimidinone) gave products that were successfully applied for the synthesis of the corresponding zirconocene derivatives.
