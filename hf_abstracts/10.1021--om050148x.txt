The complexation of the uncommon 1-zirconacyclopent-3-yne Cp 2Zr(η4-H2C4H2) by Ni(0) complexes is described and compared to the coordination of similar 1-metallacyclopenta-2,3,4-trienes Cp2M(η4-PhC 4Ph) of titanium and zirconium, both showing μ-"cts"-complexation of 1,2,3-butatrienes and 1,3-butadiynes in addition to the well-known μ-"trans"-complexation. © 2005 American Chemical Society.
