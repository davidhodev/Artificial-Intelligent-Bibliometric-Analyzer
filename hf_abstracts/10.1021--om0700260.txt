Organosilane reagents are introduced into organotitanium-mediated styrene polymerizations to produce atactic polystyrene with high activities (up to 106 g polymer/(mol Ti·h)) and narrow polydispersities. Previously recognized CGCTiMe2 systems having marginal styrene homopolymerization activity are shown to be up to 3 orders of magnitude more active for styrene homopolymerization upon addition of organosilane. © 2007 American Chemical Society.
