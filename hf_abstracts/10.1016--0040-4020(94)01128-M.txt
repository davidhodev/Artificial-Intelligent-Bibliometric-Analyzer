The zirconocene π-complex of 3-methyl-1,2-butadiene(1,1-dimethylallene) cannot be prepared by simple ligand substitution due to rapid coupling of the initally formed complex with the unreacted allene. This problem was circumvented by generating the allene complex by β-hydrogen elimination from a pre-formed sigma complex. This appears to be a potentially general way to prepare allene complexes of zirconocene if the allene precursor has no cis-vinyl hydrogen. This method has been successfully used to prepare zirconocene complexes of 3-methyl-1,2-cycloheptadiene, 3-methyl-1,2-cyclohexadiene and 4-phenyl-1,2,3-cyclohexatriene. Attempts to prepare a complex of 3-methyl-1,2-cyclopentadiene failed. Selected reactions of two of these cumulene complexes and their coupling products are reported. © 1995.
