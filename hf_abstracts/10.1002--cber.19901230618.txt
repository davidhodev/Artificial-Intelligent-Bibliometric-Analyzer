While (η4‐butadiene)zirconocene and ‐hafnocene do not react with Pt(PPh3)2(CO)2 (2) in toluene solution at room temperature, cp2Zr(η4‐C4H6) (1a: cp = η5‐C5H5; 1b: cp = η5‐C5H4CH3) reacts with cis‐Pt(C6F5)2L(CO) (3: L = CO; 5: L = PiPr3) under similar conditions to give the metallacyclic Fischer‐type carbene complexes (4: L = CO; 6: L = PiPr3). When L = CO, isomerization takes place by UV irradiation (cis‐4⇌trans‐4) presumably as the result of a dissociative CO scrambling process. This is not observed when L = PiPr3.
