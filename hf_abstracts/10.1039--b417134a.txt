Systematic explorations of organozirconium chemistry over the past quarter of a century have led to the discoveries and development as well as structural and mechanistic clarifications of novel Zr-catalyzed and -promoted carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions including (i) Ni- or Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of organozirconiums, (ii) Zr-catalyzed carboalumination of alkynes, (iii) Zr-catalyzed asymmetric carboalumination of alkenes, (iv) generation and carbometallative ring expansion of zirconacyclopropanes and zirconacyclopropenes and a myriad of their transformations and (v) various organozirconium migratory insertion reactions.
