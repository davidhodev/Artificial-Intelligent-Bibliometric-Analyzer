Dimeric Zr(III) complexes have been prepared by thermolysis of (η5-C5H5)2ZrII-bis(phosphme) compounds. These dimeric Zr(III) complexes can also be prepared by treating “zirconocene” with phosphines. The structure of these dimeric Zr(III) complexes has been determined spectroscopically to contain (η5-C5H5)(η1:η5-C5H4])Zr units. “Zirconocene” is proposed to contain similar units. Oxidation of these Zr(III) compounds by secondary phosphines, by O2, and by I2 is described. © 1981, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
