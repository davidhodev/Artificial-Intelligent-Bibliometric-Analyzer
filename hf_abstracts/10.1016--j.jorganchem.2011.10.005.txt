Cp-functionalized monotroticenes [(η7-C7H 7)Ti(η5-C5H4E)] (2, E = Ph 2SiCl; 3, E = tBu2SnCl; 12, E = I) and bitroticenes [(η7-C7H7)Ti(η5-C 5H4)]2E′ (5, E′ = PPh; 6, E′ = BN(SiMe3)2; 7, E′ = Cp2Ti) were prepared by salt elimination metathesis between the monolithiated troticene [(η7-C7H7)Ti(η5-C 5H4Li)]·pmdta (1b) (pmdta = N,N′,N′, N″,N″-pentamethyldiethylene-triamine) and the appropriate electrophile. The troticenyl-substituted zirconocene monochloride [(η7-C7H7)Ti(η5-C 5H4ZrClCp*2)] (Cp* = η5-C5Me5) (8) and hafnocene ethoxide [(η7-C7H7)Ti{η5-C 5H4Hf(OEt)Cp2}] (Cp = η5-C 5H5) (11), and the heterobimetallic μ-oxo complexes [(η7-C7H7)Ti(η5-C 5H4MCp2)]2O (9, M = Zr; 10, M = Hf) were obtained instead of the expected zircona- and hafna[1]troticenophanes by reaction of the dilithiated troticene [(η7-C7H 6Li)Ti(η5-C5H4Li)]·pmdta (1a) with [Cp2MCl2] (M = Zr, Hf) or [Cp* 2ZrCl2] in stoichiometric amounts. These compounds were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses and, in the case of 2, 3, 5-7, 9, 10 and 12, also by elemental analyses and 1H, 13C and 119Sn NMR spectroscopy. Exposure of the troticenyl organotin chloride 3 to moisture resulted in its partial hydrolysis and formation of the organostannoxane-bridged bitroticene 4, while palladium-catalyzed Negishi C-C cross-coupling reaction between the troticenylzinc chloride [(η7-C7H7) Ti(η5-C5H4ZnCl)] (13) and the iodotroticene 12 or iodobenzene (PhI) led to the fulvalene complexes [(η7- C7H7)Ti(η5-C5H 4)]2 (14) and [(η7-C7H 7)Ti(η5-C5H4Ph)] (15). Compound 4 displays an unsymmetrical structure with the troticenyl fragments cis with respect to the Sn-O-Sn core, whereas compound 14 is centrosymmetrically trans oriented. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
