The chlorozirconocene carboxylates Cp2(Cl)ZrOC(0)R, with formate (2a, R = H), acetate (2b, R = CH3), pivalate (2c, R - C(CH3)3), and benzoate (2d, R = Ph) as the carboxylate ligands, have been prepared and characterized, and their reactions with the zirconium hydride reagents [Cp2Zr(H)Cl]] (1) and [(C5H4Me)2Zr(H)(M-H)]2(6) have been studied. These carboxylates 2a-d are available by treating [Cp2(Cl)Zr]20 with an excess of the requisite carboxylic acid. In CH2C12solution or as KBr pellets, 2a-d have IR spectra that are consistent with the presence of a chelating, biderttate (η2-O,O') carboxylate ligand, although the formate also has equilibrium amounts of unidentate (η1–O) carboxylate. In THF solution, however, all exist as solvated η1-O carboxylate complexes, possibly Cp2(Cl)Zr(OC(0)R)(THF). of these zirconocene carboxylates, all but the pivalate react in THF (but not in toluene) with 1 and yield the requisite aldehyde plus the μ-oxo compound [Cp2(Cl)Zr]20. Yields of acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde are 92-93%. No direct evidence for the postulated μ-η1-O,O’ gem-diolate intermediates Cp2(Cl)ZrOCH(R)-OZr(Cl)Cp2(3a,b,d) during this reduction of ligated carboxylate was obtained. Reduction of the acetate 2b with 6, however, regioselectively affords the μ-oxo compound Cp2(Cl)ZrOZr(OCH2CH3)Cp2, which is consistent with transience of a μ-η1'O,O’ gem-diolate. © 1987, American Chemical Society.
