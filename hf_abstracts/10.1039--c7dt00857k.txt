Mono-, di- and trinuclear zirconium hydride species have been isolated in the treatment of amido complexes [Zr(η5-C5Me5)(NMe2)nCl3-n] (n = 3, 1) with amine-borane adducts NHR2BH3 (R2 = Me2, HtBu). The reactions involve the formation of amidoborane ligands with Zr⋯H-B interactions which readily undergo β-hydride elimination to give hydride functions.
