KGaA, WeinheimThe polymerization of ethylene is investigated in a semibatch solution reactor using bis(n-propylcyclopentadienyl)hafnium dichloride catalyst and tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate dimethylanilinium salt ([B(C6F5)4]−[Me2NHPh]+) as the catalytic system. Trioctylaluminum (TOA) is used as impurity scavenger and alkylating agent. Ethylene pressure, polymerization temperature, TOA, borate, and catalyst concentrations are changed to investigate ethylene polymerization kinetics with this catalyst system. A 23 central composite design, augmented with extra runs to further explore the effect of some factors, is used as the statistical basis for the polymerization study. Ethylene propagation follows first-order kinetics. Chain transfer to monomer, β-hydride elimination, and transfer to TOA are the main chain transfer reactions. In addition to alkylating the catalyst precursor, TOA also deactivates the catalyst. The mode of reactor addition for catalyst, borate, and TOA has also been studied. When TOA and borate are added sequentially to the reactor, followed by the catalyst, the polymerization activity is lower than when the catalyst and borate are added simultaneously, suggesting that complexation with borate avoids deactivation reactions with TOA.
