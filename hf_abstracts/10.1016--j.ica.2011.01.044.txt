The alkyne complexes [Cp′2M(L)(η2-Me 3SiC2SiMe3)] (Cp′ = substituted or unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl; M = Ti, Zr, Hf; L = Py, THF) can serve as metallocene precursors by substitution of the alkyne molecule with other ligands. The reactions of the unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl complexes [Cp 2Zr(THF)(η2-Me3SiC2SiMe 3)] (1) and [Cp2Ti(η2-Me 3SiC2SiMe3)] (2) with azobenzene were investigated. In the first case the diazene complex [Cp2Zr(THF) (N2Ph2)] (3) was obtained by alkyne exchange. In the reaction of the titanium complex 2 a NN bond cleavage of azobenzene and a C-H activation of the cyclopentadienyl ligand were observed and the dinuclear imido bridged compound 4 was formed. This mixed valence complex is bridged additionally by a cyclopentadienyl ligand in a η1: η5-coordination mode which is very unusual for titanium complexes. The molecular structures of both compounds were confirmed by X-ray crystallography and compared to former structural data shown in literature. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
