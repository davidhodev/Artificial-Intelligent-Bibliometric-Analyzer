Heterobimetallic complexes containing titanocene chloride and trans-platinum dichloride-DMSO functional groups have been prepared by bridging the metal centers with hydroxypyridine ligands, in order to explore the possibility that a chelate effect will enhance DNA-metal binding affinity and chemotherapeutic effectiveness. The structure of trans-PtCl2(DMSO)(NC5H4-2-OTi(C5H5)2Cl) has been determined; crystals are monoclinic, (Cc), with unit cell dimensions a = 6.958(2) Å, b = 18.047(3) Å, c = 33.217(5) Å, β = 92.04(2)°, V = 4168.5(16) Å3, and Z = 4 and density = 2.077 Mg m−3. Both metal coordination environments are virtually identical to related monometallic complexes. © 1993, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
