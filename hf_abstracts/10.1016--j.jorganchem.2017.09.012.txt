The complexes were found to react with methylaluminoxane (MAO) to give both toluene-soluble derivatives and poorly soluble heavy adducts. DFT study has been carried out for the modeling the possible variants of MAO binding with the complexes. Various MAO models, namely, one-, two- and three-dimensional structures were considered as scaffolds for coordination with the complexes, however, plane hexagon with a (MeAlO)3 unit as the chain analog were found to be the preferable structure for binding.
