Â© 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Polymers derived from reacting Group IVB metallocene dihalides and the matrix alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid act as their own matrix agent when performing MALDI MS. Ion fragments containing two repeat units and greater are formed. The results are similar to those obtained employing graphite as the matrix material. The advantage of employing graphite as a comparative standard is that non-interfering ion fragment clusters are not produced by graphite. This is the second report of the inclusion of alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid into a condensation polymer and the use of the polymer itself as a matrix material indicating that this approach can be successfully applied to other systems. The addition of graphite as a matrix material allows the mass range to increase for the reflective mode.
