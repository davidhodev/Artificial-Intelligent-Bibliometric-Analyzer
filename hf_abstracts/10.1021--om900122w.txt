The previously described hafnocene alkyne complexes are of limited applicability for the generation of the hafnocene fragment in stoichiometric and catalytic reactions. For this reason di-n-butylhafnocene (1-Hf) was fully characterized and used as a hafnocene source in reactions with alkynes and diynes. With bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene and pyridine the alkyne complex Cp2Hf(py)(n2-Me3SiC2SiMe 3) (2-Hf) was obtained and coordination of di-tert-butylbutadiyne yielded the first structurally characterized hafnacyclocumulene, Cp 2Hf(n4-t-BuC4-t-Bu) (4-Hf). By the coupling of 2 equiv of the 1,3-butadiyne RC4R at the hafnocene center, hafnacyclopentadienes were formed regioselectively (R ) t-Bu, 5-t-Bu-Hf; R = SiMe3, 5-SiMe3-Hf. In the case of 1,4-diphenylbutadiyne the hafnocene-substituted [4]radialene 6-Hf was formed. Treatment of the latter with acid gave the free [4]radialene 7. In the reaction of 4-Hf with diphenylacetylene, the alkyne inserted into the Hf-Cα bond to give the hafnacyclopentadiene 8. © 2009 American Chemical Society.
