Methyl-substituted titanocene dichlorides (C5H5-nMen)2TiCl2 (n = 0-5), [C5Me4(SiMe3)]2TiCl2, (C5Me4Ph)2TiCl2 (Ph = phenyl), [C5Me4(FPh)]2TiCl2 (FPh =para-fluorophenyl), [C5Me4(CH2Ph)]2TiCl2 and ansa-compounds Me2Si(C5H4)2TiCl2 and Me2Si(C5Me4)2TiCl2 were investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry at a mercury electrode in tetrahydrofuran. The standard potential (Eo l) of the first electron uptake shifts to more negative values proportionally to the number of methyl groups in the (C5H5-nMen)2TiCl2 (n = 0-3) compounds, with an increment of 0.093 V per one methyl group. A decline from this linear dependence is observed for (C5HMe4)2TiCl2 and a positive shift for (C5Me5)2TiCl2. The [C5Me4(R)]2TiCl2 (R = SiMe3, Ph, FPh and CH2Ph) compounds show even larger positive shifts of Eo l. These positive shifts can be brought about by a steric strain between the cyclopentadienyl ligands which lowers the dihedral angle between cyclopentadienyl ring planes (φ) and thus decreases energies of bent titanocene 1a1 and b2 LUMO orbitals. This opinion is corroborated by the voltammetry of ansa-compounds Me2Si(C5H4)2TiCl2 and Me2Si(C5Me4)2TiCl2, having a large and fixed angle φ. Their Eo l values are close to those of (C5H5)2TiCl2 and (C5HMe4)2TiCl2, respectively. © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.
