Metal alkylperoxides are remarkable, highly effective, yet often thermally unstable, oxidants that may react through a number of possible pathways including O-O homolytic cleavage, M-O homolytic cleavage, nucleophilic O-atom transfer, and electrophilic O-atom transfer. Here we describe a series of zinc alkyl compounds of the type To MZnR (To M = tris(4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazolinyl)phenylborate; R = Et, n-C 3H 7, i-C 3H 7, t-Bu) that react with O 2 at 25 °C to form isolable monomeric alkylperoxides To MZnOOR in quantitative yield. The series of zinc alkylperoxides is crystallographically characterized, and the structures show systematic variations in the Zn-O-O angle and O-O distances. The observed rate law for the reaction of To MZnEt (2) and O 2 is consistent with a radical chain mechanism, where the rate-limiting S H2 step involves the interaction of •OOR and To MZnR. In contrast, To MZnH and To MZnMe are unchanged even to 120 °C under 100 psi of O 2 and in the presence of active radical chains (e.g., •OOEt). This class of zinc alkylperoxides is unusually thermally robust, in that the compounds are unchanged after heating at 120 °C in solution for several days. Yet, these compounds are reactive as oxidants with phosphines. Additionally, an unusual alkylperoxy group transfer to organosilanes affords To MZnH and ROOSiR 3'. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
