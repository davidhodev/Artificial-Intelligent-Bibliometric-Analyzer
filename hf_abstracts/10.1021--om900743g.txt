The bonding nature of metallocene acetylene complexes Cp 2M(η2-H3SiC2SiH3) 1M and Cp2M(η2HC2H) 1M′ (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) was studied by density functional theory method. It is found that this acetylene complex has indeed a metallacyclopropene moiety with two in-plane M-C σ-bonds and one out-of-plane π-bond interacting with the metal center, resulting in the formation of a delocalized three-center and two-electron (3c-2e) system. Along with its delocalized out-of-plane bonding, this complex has been characterized as aromatic on the basis of the computed stabilizing energy and negative nucleus-independent chemical shifts (NICS). The aromatic stabilization increases from Ti to Zr and Hf, and this is because of the increased charge separation between the Cp2M fragment and the H 3SiC2SiH3 (also HC2H) unit. The decrease of the M-C bond length from Zr to Hf is attributed to the increased s character of both M and C hybridization of the M-C σ-bonds. © 2009 American Chemical Society.
