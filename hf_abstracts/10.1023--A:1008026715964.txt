The inclusion of titanocene dihalides (X = F, Cl) into α-, β-and γ-cyclodextrin hosts was studied by NMR spectroscopy, thermal analysis and mass spectrometry. It was found that α-cyclodextrin does not form inclusion complexes with titanocene halides whereas β-and γ-cyclodextrin do form such complexes. According to the changes in NMR spectra we propose that there is a shallow penetration of a guest molecule of titanocene dihalide into the cavity in the case of β-cyclodextrin, but deeper penetration in the case of γ-cyclodextrin. The stability of the latter inclusion complexes was studied by NMR shift titration.
