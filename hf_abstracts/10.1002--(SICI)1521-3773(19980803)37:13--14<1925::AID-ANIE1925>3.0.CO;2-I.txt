The activation and cleavage of the central C-C bond of substituted butadiynes has been combined for the first time with a subsequent coupling reaction of the resulting alkynyl units: In the presence of an equimolar amount of 'Cp2Ti', the butadiynes 1 and 2 afford after workup the asymmetrically substituted diyne 3. This photocatalyzed metathesis also proceeds in the reversed direction.
