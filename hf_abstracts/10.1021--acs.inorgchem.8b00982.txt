X-ray structure analyses reveal that all three of the complexes have a dimeric structure with a μ-N2 ligand (N-N bond length 1.200-1.221 Å). Resonance Raman and NMR spectra of 1-3 in solution show that these complexes maintain a dimeric structure in benzene and toluene solutions. 15N NMR spectra of 1 and 3 have peaks assignable to μ-N2 ligands at 33.4 and 27.6 ppm, respectively, but 2 does not have a similar peak under the same conditions. In 51V NMR spectra, the peaks of vanadium ions were observed at -173.3, -143.8, and -240.2 ppm, respectively, which are in a higher magnetic field region in comparison to those of dinitrogen-divanadium complexes reported previously. The structure and electronic properties of 1 are supported by DFT calculations. Additionally, all complexes react with excess amounts of M[C10H8] (M = Na, K) and the proton sources HOTf, HCl, and [LutH]OTf (Lut = 2,6-dimethylpyridine) to produce ammonia without hydrazine. The ammonia produced was evaluated as an ammonium salt by 1H and 15N NMR spectroscopy. The yield of NH3 produced in the reaction of 1 with Na[C10H8] and HOTf under N2 was 151% (per V atom).
