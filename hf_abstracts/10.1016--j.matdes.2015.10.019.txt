© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.Multiphase ceramics like ZrC-SiC are the most promising ultra-high temperature ceramics in the aerospace applications. In this study a precursor of zirconocene-polycarbosilane (PZCS) for ZrC-SiC ceramic with relatively high Zr content was successfully synthesized through the reaction between Cp2Zr(CHCH2)2 and low molecular weight polycarbosilane (LPCS). To prove the effectiveness of this synthetic pathway with a higher Zr incorporation, the composition, structure and pyrolysis process of the precursor were thoroughly characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectra, nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Results show that the precursor mainly contains the groups of Si-C-Si, and Cp with the Zr in the backbone or the side chains. After a heat treatment at 1200°C under inert atmosphere the well dispersed ZrC-SiC ceramic formed with a yield of 73.6%. The obtained ZrC-SiC ceramic has a good high-temperature and oxidation resistance with a weight loss of 7.2% when treated from 1200°C to 2000°C in Ar and a weight increase of 9.5% in air respectively.
