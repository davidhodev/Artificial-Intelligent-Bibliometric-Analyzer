The compound Cp2TiMe2 reacts with [Ph 3C][B(C6F5)4] in CD 2Cl2 at 205 K to give, inter alia, [Cp 2TiMe(CD2Cl2)][B(C6F 5)4]. This solvent-separated ion pair reacts in turn with 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene (DMP) to give a series of cationic species, the first being the alkene complex [Cp2TiMe(DMP)]+, which undergoes ready migratory insertion to form the σ-alkyl complex [Cp 2Ti(CH2CMe2CH2CHMe 2)]+. The latter, which does not contain a β-hydrogen atom, rearranges rapidly via an unprecedented 1,5-σ bond metathesis reaction involving two isomeric ε-agostic species to give the σ-alkyl species [Cp2Ti(CH2CHMeCH2CMe 3)]+; this does contain a β-hydrogen atom and, in concurrent processes, eliminates H2 or 2,4,4-trimethyl-1-pentene (a major product) to form respectively the allylic complex [Cp2Ti{η 3-(CH2)2CCH2CMe3}] + (a major product) or the hydride complex [Cp2TiH] +. The latter reacts reversibly with free DMP to give the insertion product [Cp2Ti(CH2CHMeCH2CHMe 2)]+ (V, a major product), in which the italicized hydrogen atom engages in a β-agostic interaction with the metal atom. Compound V is a rare example of both a β-agostic derivative of a group 4 metallocene and a β-agostic compound of any metal in which the 1H resonance of the agostic hydrogen can be identified in the 1H NMR spectrum (δ-3.43). Interestingly, a NOESY experiment on V indicates slow mutual exchange between the agostic hydrogen atom, the hydrogen atoms on C(1), and those of Me(2). These observations are consistent with the intermediacy of the allylic dihydrogen species [Cp2Ti(H 2){η3-(CH2)2CCH 2CHMe2}]+, which loses H2 to form [Cp2Ti{η3-(CH2)2CCH 2CHMe2}]+ (a minor product). Support for all steps of the proposed reaction scheme comes from product distributions, from labeling studies utilizing [Cp2Ti(CD3)(CD 2Cl2)]+, and from extensive DFT calculations. The observed titanocene-based chemistry stands in stark contrast to that of the analogous zirconium system, in which the unusual but well-characterized cationic methyl alkene complex [Cp2ZrMe(DMP)]+ does not undergo migratory insertion and subsequent reactions. © 2010 American Chemical Society.
