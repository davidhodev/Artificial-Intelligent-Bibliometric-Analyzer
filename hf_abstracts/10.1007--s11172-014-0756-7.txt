Â© 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.We analyzed the research data on antitumor effects of a wide range of ferrocene compounds and discussed possible mechanisms of their bioactivities. Current trends in the study of anticancer effects of ferrocene derivatives were considered. Promising ways in the design of low-toxicity anticancer ferrocene-based drugs of new generation were outlined.
