The para‐substituted diphenylzirconocenes [(t‐BuCp)2Zr(p‐C6H4R)2; R = Br, NMe2] (A) were easily obtained from the reaction of the appropriate organolithium reagent with bis(t‐butylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride. Elimination of bromobenzene or N,N‐dimethylaminobenzene from A by slight heating led to arynezirconocenes into which were inserted two equivalents of elementary chalcogens. As a result dichalcogenated zirconacycles [(t‐BuCp)2ZrY2C6H3R; Y = S, Se] (B) were obtained. Complexes B constitute useful potential synthons in organic synthesis and a large family of new functionalized dichalcogenated benzenic compounds was prepared by reacting electrophiles. The structure of complexes B as well as related benzenic derivatives has been confirmed by microanalysis, 1H NMR and mass spectrometry. Copyright © 1991 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
