The reduction of Cp*2HfCl2 with lithium in the presence of disubstituted butadiynes RC≡C - C≡CR (R = Ph, SiMe 3, t-Bu) in toluene leads, respectively, to the five-membered hafnacyclocumulene complexes Cp*2Hf(η4-1,2,3,4- PhC4Ph) (1-Hf) and Cp*2Hf(η4-1,2,3,4- Me3SiC4SiMe3) (2-Hf) and, in the case of 1,4-bis(tert-butyl)butadiyne by a 2-fold activation of the methyl groups of one pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand, to the complex Cp*Hf[ - C(=C=CH-t-Bu) - CH(t-Bu)CH2 - η5-C5Me3-CH 2-] (3-Hf) containing a fulvene ligand that is coupled to the modified substrate (allenic subunit). The latter inserts 2 equiv of the isocyanide t-BuNC to give by coupling of the isocyanide molecules the complex Cp*Hf[ - C(=C=CH-t-Bu)-CH(t-Bu)CH2-η5-C 5Me3 - CH2 - C(=N-t-Bu) - C(=N-t-Bu) - ] (4). The structures of complexes 3-Hf and 4 were determined by X-ray crystallography. © 2007 American Chemical Society.
