(Î·2-Formaldehyde)zirconocene dimer (8) cleanly adds one or two molar equivalents of the borane HB(C6F5)2 by insertion of the H-[B] unit into the zirconium-carbon bond of the metallaoxirane moleties to form the mono- and bis-insertion products 16 and 17, respectively. These systems contain five-membered heterocyclic rings that are built up by connecting five different elements, namely H, B, C, O, and Zr. The bis(borane) insertion product 17 was characterized by an X-ray crystal structure analysis. (Butadiene)zirconocene reacts with HB(C6F5)2 in a similar way by insertion of the H-[B] unit into the (butadiene)C4-Zr linkage to form the metallacycle 18.
