For a class of π-complexes as energy donors, with the use of highly emissive d0 metallocenes Cp2MCl2 where M = Zr and Hf, it is shown that radiationless triplet energy transfer to unsaturated hydrocarbons in a rigid nonpolar methylcyclohexane (MCH) matrix (where molecular diffusion is absent) obeys the Perrin equation, occurs at radii R0, being close to the diameter of interacting molecules, and is well described by an electron-exchange resonant (Dexter) mechanism of interaction. Principle correlation between values of the critical radius and a number of C atoms in a linear α-olefin is for the first time reported, viz. R0 (Å) = -2.47 + 1.35n (obtained for systems [Cp2HfCl2 + CnH2n + MCH] at 77 K). Pronounced blue shifts (up to 1000 cm-1) of low-temperature emission spectra of Cp 2ZrCl2 in MCH in the presence of dienes, possessing nonconjugated C=C bonds, are observed, thus suggesting inner-sphere diene coordination. In view of the experimental data, inner- and outer-sphere coordinative interaction between the components of catalytic systems for polymerization (d0 metallocene precatalysts and alkenes and dienes) is rationalized. © 2007 American Chemical Society.
