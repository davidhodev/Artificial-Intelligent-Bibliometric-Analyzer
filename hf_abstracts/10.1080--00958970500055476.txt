Complexes of acetylacetonatodichlorocyclopentadienyltitanium(IV) (1) and dichlorocyclopentadienyl(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)titanium(IV) (2) have been prepared and their crystal structures determined by X-ray diffraction methods. Complex 1 crystallizes in space group P21/m with a = 7.1893(10), b = 11.7680(17), c = 7.6129(11) Å, β = 109.901(12)°; complex 2 crystallizes in space group P21/n with a = 10.065(2), b = 16.322(3), c = 12.219(2) Å, β = 110.99(3)°. The molecular structures of 1 and 2 can be described as square-based pyramidal, with the centroid of the C5H5 ring occupying the apical site and the bidentate β-diketonate and two chloride ligands occupying the basal positions. The average distances between titanium and oxygen atoms are 1.991(2) and 1.967(3) Å in compounds 1 and 2, respectively. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.
