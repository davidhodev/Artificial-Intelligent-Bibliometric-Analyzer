The enantiomeric pure TADDOLate complexes of the heavier group 4 metals [(η5-C5H5)2M{(S,S)-TADDOLate}] (M = Zr, Hf) were prepared by treatment of (S,S)-TADDOL with 2.5 equivalents of n-butyl lithium followed by reaction with zirconocene and hafnocene dichloride, respectively. The new complexes have been characterized by standard analytical/spectroscopic techniques and the solid-state structures of both compounds were established by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The title compounds are the first fully characterized TADDOLate complexes of zirconium and hafnium. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.
