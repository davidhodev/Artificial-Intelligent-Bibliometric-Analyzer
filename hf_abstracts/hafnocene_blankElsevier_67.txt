The anion [H2B2(μ-H)(μ-C4H8) 2]-, II, reacts with zirconocene dichloride and with hafnocene dichloride to form (η5-C5H5)2ZrCl{(μ-H) 2BC4H8}, III, and (η5-C5H5)2HfCl{(μ-H) 2BC4H8}, IV, complexes, which contain a boracyclopentane ring that is bound to the metal through hydrogen bridges. In these reactions, 0.5 mol of the transannular hydrogen-bridged 10-membered ring compound B2(μ-H)2(μ-C4H8)2 is also formed. A possible reaction pathway for the formation of these complexes is proposed on the basis of time-lapse 11B NMR spectroscopy. The methyl-substituted complex (η5-C5H5)2Zr(CH 3){(μ-H)2BC4H8}, V, is prepared from the reaction of III with CH3Li. The molecular structure of III was reported earlier. The structures of IV and V are reported here. Crystal data for IV: space group P21/n (No. 14), a = 8.565(1) Å, b = 14.786(3) Å, c = 11.120(3) Å, β = 96.17(2)°, Z = 4. Crystal data for V: space group Pbca (No. 61), a = 8.436(1) Å, b = 16.343(2) Å, c = 20.827(2) Å, Z = ft.
