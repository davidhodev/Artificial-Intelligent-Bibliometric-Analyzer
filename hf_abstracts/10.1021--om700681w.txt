Exposure of [W(CO)5(2,6-Mes2C6H 3SbH2)] (1) in toluene to day light leads to the distibene complex [W(CO)5{(2,6-Mes2C6H3) 2Sb2}] (2). [Cp2Ti{(2,6-Mes2C 6H3)2Sb2}] (3) is obtained by reaction of [Cp2Ti{(Me3Si)2C2}] with 2,6-MeS2C6H3SbH2. The structures of 2 and 3 were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and DFT calculations were carried out on Me2Sb2, [W(CO) 5(Me2Sb2)] (2a), and [Cp2Ti(Me 2Sb2)] (3a).
