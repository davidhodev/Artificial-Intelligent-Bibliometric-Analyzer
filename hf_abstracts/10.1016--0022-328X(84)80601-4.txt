The photolysis of Cp2Zr(CO)2 with diphenylacetylene or 3-hexyne yields the respective zirconacyclopentadiene complexes Cp2Z(C4R4) (R = Ph, Et). The thermolysis of Cp2Z(CO)2 with 3-hexyne or bis(pentafluorophenyl)acetylene also leads to the formation of Cp2Z(C4R4) (R = Et, C6F5). HCl degradation of Cp2Zr[C6(C6F5)4] yields 1,2,3,4-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)-1,3-butadiene and Cp2ZrCl2. When Cp2Zr(CO)2 is heated with diphenylacetylene in a closed vessel, tetraphenylcyclopentadienone is formed along with Cp2Zr(C4Ph4). The hafnacyclopentadiene complexes Cp2Hf(C4R4) (R = Ph, C6F5, Et) are obtained when Cp2Hf(CO)2 is thermolyzed with the respective acetylene in refluxing octane. Complexes Cp2Hf(C4R4) (R = Ph, Et) are also formed when Cp2Hf(CO)2 is photolyzed with diphenylacetylene or 3-hexyne, respectively. The monocarbonyl-triphenylphosphine complexes Cp2M(CO)(PPh3) (M = Zr, Hf) can be prepared via the irradiation of hydrocarbon solutions of Cp2M(CO)2 and triphenylphosphine. These complexes react readily with diphenylacetylene and 3-hexyne at 55-60 °C to afford the corresponding metallacyclopentadiene complexes Cp2M(C4R4) (M = Zr, Hf; R = Ph, Et). The metallocene dicarbonyls Cp2M(CO)2 (M = Zr, Hf) are readily prepared via the reduction of Cp2MCl2 (M = Zr, Hf) with amalgamated magnesium metal in THF solution under one atmosphere of carbon monoxide. © 1984.
