(Chemical Equation Presented) Alkyne, alkene, and "allene"? A stable five-membered metallacycloalkyne 1 with alkylidene moieties was treated with an alkali metal to give a dianionic species 2, which was transformed into a 1-zirconacyclopent-3-ene complex by protonation. The alkylation of 2 afforded zirconocene-η4-1,3-enyne complexes 3, which can be regarded as formal "1-zirconacyclopenta-2,3-dienes". Ar = 4-EtC6H 4; R=Me, Me3Sn. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
