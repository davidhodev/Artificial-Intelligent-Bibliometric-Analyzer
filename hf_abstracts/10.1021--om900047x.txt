Reaction of the zirconocene dichloride Cp Flu * ZrCl 2 (Cp = 1,3-(SiMe 3 ) 2 C 5 H 3 , Flu = C 13 Me 9 ) with i BuLi ( i BuLi = LiCH 2 CHMe 2 ) resulted in elimination of isobutylene and formation of Cp (η 5 η 3 -C 13 Me 9 H)ZrH (1-syn-1,2-DH * FD), possessing an η 5 :η 3 -dihydrofluorenediyl ligand derived from ametal-to-benzo ring hydride transfer. This species undergoes reversible hydride transfer and exists in equilibrium with only one of its three other possible isomers (1-syn-3,4-DHFD). Compound l-syn-l,2-DHFD catalyzes the cyclization of 1,5-hexadiene to methylenecyclopentane, and its reaction with excess isobutylene leads to the elimination of isobutane and formation of the cyclometalated zirconocene isobutyl species (η 5 :η 1 -C s H 3 -l-SiMe 2 CH 2 -3-SiMe 3 )(η 5 -C 13 Me 9 )Zr i Bu (2). Reaction of Cp Flu ZrCl 2 with i BuLi directly generated the cyclometalated zirconocene species (η 5 : η 1 -C 5 H 3 -l-SiMe 2 CH 2 -3-SiMe 3 )(η 5 -C 13 Me 8 Zr i Bu (3); however, reaction of the dichloride Cp Flu ZrCl 2 with i BuLi in the presence of hydrogen generated the dihydrofluorenediyl monohydride derivative Cp (η 5 : η 3 -C 13 Me 8 H 2 )ZrH (4). Treatment of the cyclometalated isobutyl species 3 with H 2 led to partial hydrogenation of the Flu ligand and formation of the monohydride Cp (η 5 :η 3 -C 13 Me 8 H 6 )ZrH (5), which contains a hexahydrof-luorenediyl ligand. Partial hydrogenation of the Flu ligand proceeded exclusively via an intramolecular pathway, as evidenced by the all-exo configuration of the methyl groups on the saturated benzo ring. Structural characterization of l-syn-l,2-DHFD, 2, 3, and 5 revealed a highly strained η 5 :η 3 -coordination mode for the dihydro- and hexahydrofluorenediyl ligands. © 2009 American Chemical Society.
