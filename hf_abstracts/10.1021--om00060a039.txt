(Butadiene)zirconocene adds 1 molar equiv of aluminum trichloride to give Cp2Zr(μ-C4H6)(μ-Cl)AlCl2 (3). Complex 3 crystallizes in space group P21/n with cell parameters a = 9.124 (1) Å, b = 15.040 (1) Å, c = 11.737 (1) Å β = 93.60 (1)°, Z = 4, R = 0.024, and Rw = 0.032. In the crystal the butadiene carbon centers C(1) and C(2) are bonded to zirconium (Zr-C(1) = 2.348 (2) Å, Zr–C(2) = 2.525 (3) Å), whereas the Zr–C(3) separation is large at 3.04 Å. The butadiene C(4)–Al bond length is 1.966 (2) Å. A “π-agostic” interaction may serve to describe the special bonding situation observed in complex 3. © 1992, American Chemical Society.
