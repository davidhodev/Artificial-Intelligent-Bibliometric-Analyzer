Zirconocene and hafnocene dihydrides Cp2MH2 (M = Zr, Hf) are capable of rapid absorbing carbon dioxide at room temperature and atmospheric pressure in a THF medium. In the case of Cp2ZrH2, the reaction results in the cleavage of the C=O bond of a CO2 molecule to form cyclic trimeric zirconocene oxide [Cp2ZrO]3, whose structure was confirmed by analytical and spectral methods as well as by X-ray diffraction study. Small amounts of formaldehyde and methyl formate are found in the organic products of the reaction.
