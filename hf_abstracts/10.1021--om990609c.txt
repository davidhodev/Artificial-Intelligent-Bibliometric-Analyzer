A kinetic study of the photochemical reaction of [Cp2Zr(μ-SiH2Ph)]22+2[BBu n(C6F5)4-n]+ (1) with PhCH2SiH3 to give the analogous PhCH2SiH2 complex 2 was carried out using a combination of NMR and EPR spectroscopy to follow the rates of disappearance of reactants and the appearance of intermediates and products. The paramagnetic intermediate [Cp2ZrIII]+[BBun(C6F 5)4-n]- (3) is produced with a quantum efficiency of 0.96 ± 0.16 on irradiation of 1 with light having λ < 450 nm. The rate law and analysis of intermediates supports a Zr(IV)/Zr(III) redox mechanism in which the rate-determining step is photodecomposition of 1 to generate 3 and silyl radicals by homolytic dissociation. In the presence of excess PhCH2SiH3 3 reacts rapidly to give products.
