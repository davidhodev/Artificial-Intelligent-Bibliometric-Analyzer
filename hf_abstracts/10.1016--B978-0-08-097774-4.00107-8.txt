This chapter reviews developments in the field of catenated As, Sb, and Bi compounds since the year 2000. Catena species comprise dipnicogen compounds, oligomeric pnicogen compounds with structures of linear or branched chains or bicyclic or polycyclic arrangements, as well as polymeric species with extended structures in indefinite chains or strips. Catenation occurs in organometallic and purely inorganic, neutral, or ionic pnicogen species. Element-element bonds in catenated As, Sb, and Bi bonds range from weak intermolecular or interatomic interactions to well-established single or multiple bonds. The chapter addresses chemical and physical properties of catenated species, as well as their structural aspects. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
