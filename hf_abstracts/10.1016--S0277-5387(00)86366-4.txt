Readily available (butadiene)zirconocene and -hafnocene complexes react with various metal carbonyls to form metallacyclic metal oxycarbene complexes. The π-allyl species Cpa2MOC[M′Ln]C4H6) (M = Zr, Hf) can often be obtained crystalline. The bimetallic carbene complexes exhibit a rather short OC(carbene) bond distance indicating a pronounced metal acyl complex character. Carbene complex formation between (s-trans-η4-butadiene)zirconocene and CpCO(CO)2 or CPV(CO)4, respectively is reversible. The equilibrium can be shifted towards the carbene complex side by reducing the electron density at the carbene ligand bearing metal or by using the hafnium instead of the zirconium containing butadiene metallocene reagent. Five-membered benzannelated zirconium oxycarbene complexes CP2ZrOC[W(CO)5](C6H4) were obtained by CC-coupling from thermally generated (1,2-didehydrobenzene)zirconocene and W(CO)6. This carbene complex is an oligomer in the solid state as revealed by X-ray diffraction. Monomeric units are linked together via intermolecular ZrOCW bonds. This zirconium oxycarbene complex acts as an organometallic Lewis acid in solution. It reversibly coordinates organic carbonyl compounds. Zirconium oxycarbene complexes CP2Zr(OR)C(Ph)W(CO)5 react readily with several non-stabilized phosphorus ylides to produce zirconium enolates CP2Zr(OR)C(Ph)CHR which can be used as carbon nucleophiles in syn-selective aldol condensation reactions. The (butadiene)zirconocene derived metallacyclic zirconium oxycarbene complexes CP2ZrOC[M(CO)5](C4H6) (M = Cr, Mo, W) act as carbon nucleophiles at the Zr-bound substituted π-allyl ligand. Ketones or aldehydes are CC-coupled regioselectively to the allyl-CH2 terminus to form chiral nine-membered metallacyclic products. © 1988.
