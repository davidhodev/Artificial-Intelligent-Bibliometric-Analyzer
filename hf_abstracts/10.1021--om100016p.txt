Metal sandwich compounds, more commonly known as metallocenes, are some of the most enduring molecules in organometallic chemistry. Beginning with Wilkinson's quest for titanocene, [(?5-C5H 5)2Ti], the synthesis and exploration of the electronic structure and reactivity of group 4 metal sandwich complexes have been an ongoing story for almost six decades. This review recounts the historical origins of group 4 metallocenes and highlights synthetic efforts to observe and stabilize formally d2 metal sandwich compounds. Specific attention is devoted to recent developments in the field, including dinitrogen coordination by various substituted titanocene derivatives as well as our group's interest in bis(indenyl)zirconium and -hafnium compounds.
