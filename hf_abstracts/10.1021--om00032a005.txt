EPR spectroscopy shows that reactions of organosilanes with dimethyltitanocene in the presence of the phosphines PMenPh3-n (n = 1–3) lead to a rich variety of products, including Cp2TiH(PMenPh3-n), Cp2TiSiRR′H(PMenPh3-n), Cp2Ti[(SiRR′)nSiRR′H]-(PMenPh3-n), and Cp2Ti(η2-CH2PMexPh2-x) (x = 1, 2). © 1993, American Chemical Society.
