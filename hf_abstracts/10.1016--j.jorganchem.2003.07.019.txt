The reaction of ω-alkenyl substituted zirconocene dichloride complexes with two equivalents of n -butyllithium is strongly influenced in the presence of alkenes and alkynes. Metallacyclic zirconocene complexes of novel structures are obtained. The additives alkenes and alkynes compete with the ω-alkenyl substituents and the intermediate 1-butene for the formation of a metallacyclic structure. The reaction of ω-alkenyl substituted zirconocene dichloride complexes with two equivalents of ethyllithium and n -hexyllithium gives analogous reactions and metallacycles as with n -butyllithium. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.
