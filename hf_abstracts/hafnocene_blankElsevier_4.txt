In the presence of 5.0 mol% titanocene perfiuorooctanesulfonate, reductive cleavage S-S bond by zinc at room temperature led to nucleophilic sulfur anion species, which reacted with acid anhydrides (α-bromocarbonyl compounds) to afford thioesters (α-arylthiocarbonyl compounds) in good to excellent yields. The catalyzed mechanism was discussed.
