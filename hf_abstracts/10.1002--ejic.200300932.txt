Methylenetriphenylphosphorane was coordinated to the boron of phenylborylidene-bridged bis(cyclopentadienyl)-and bis(2-Me,4-Ph-indenyl) zirconium dichloride to form zwitterionic ansa-zirconocene complexes. The cyclopentadienyl complex 2, when activated with MAO, exhibits remarkable polymerization activity that is more than an order of magnitude greater than that of a related amidoborylidene-bridged complex as well as the commercially important pre-catalyst [Cp′-SiMe2-N-tBu]TiCl2 (Cp′; C5Me4). The zwitterionic bis(2-Me,4-Ph- indenyl)zirconium dichloride species is isolated as a mixture of rac and meso isomers 4-6. The propylene polymerization efficiency of the isomer mixture activated by MAO is greater than that of a related silylene bridged system at 70 and 85 °C; however, the activity of the zwitterionic system decreased with further increase in temperature. The high level of isotactic triads (63.6%) and pentads (52.4%) in the polypropylene formed by 4-6 indicates that the rac isomer is the most active precatalyst of the mixture. The molecular structures of 2 and the rac bis-indenylzirconium isomer 4 and one of the meso isomers 5 are described. © Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 69451 Weinheim, Germany, 2004.
