Reactions of [Cp*Rh(η2-NO3)(OTf] (1), which bears two labile ligands (NO3- and OTf-), with a terminal aryl alkyne (phenylacetylene (HC≡CPh) or 4-ethynyltoluene (HC≡CC6H4-CH3)) in alcohol (EtOH or n-BuOH) gave the substituted-rhodocenium cation [Cp*Rh(η5- C5H2Ar2-CH(Ar)OR)]+(OTf) - (2a-d: Ar = Ph, p-tolyl; R = Et, n-Bu). Treatment of 1 with 4-ethynyltoluene in ethanol followed by the addition of a pseudo-halide (HSPh, Me3SiN3, or Me3SiNCS) in dichloromethane also produced the substituted-rhodocenium cation [Cp*Rh-(η5- C5H2(p-tolyl)2-CH(p-tolyl)Nu)] +(OTf)- (Nu- = SPh (3a), N3 (3b), NCS (3c)). All products appeared to have been formed by the formal [2 + 2 + 1] cyclotrimerization of the terminal aryl alkynes and the subsequent nucleophilic addition of the alcohol or pseudo-halide at the exocyclic double bond of a fulvene intermediate. Molecular structures of 2b,c and 3a,c were determined by X-ray diffraction. All complexes are isostructural and show sandwich-type structures composed of one Cp* ligand and one substituted-Cp ligand. © 2005 American Chemical Society.
