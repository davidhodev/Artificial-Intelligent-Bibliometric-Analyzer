Allylically methyl-substituted 1,6-heptenynes, such as 3-methyl-1,6-octenyne, can be diastereoselectivity converted to the corresponding bicyclic ketones, such as (5R, 6S)-2,6-dimethylbicyclo[3.3.0]oct-1-en-3-one readily convertible to (+)-iridomyrmecin, the observed diastereomeric excesses of the bicyclization reaction being >90%.
