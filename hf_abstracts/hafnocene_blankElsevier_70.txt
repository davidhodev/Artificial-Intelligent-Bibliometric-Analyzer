1,6- and 1,7-dienes and -enynes incorporating a silicon-oxygen or silicon-nitrogen link are co-cyclised with zirconocene(1-butene) or diisopropoxytitanium(propene) to give metallabicycles. Further elaboration followed by cleavage of the silicon-carbon bond using Tamao oxidation affords a wide variety of organic products.
