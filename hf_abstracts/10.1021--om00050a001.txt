In situ generation of i-BuZrCp2CI by treatment of Cp2ZrCI2 with 1 equiv of t-BuLi followed by addition of 1 equiv more of t-BuLi can serve as a satisfactory “ZrCp2” source, permitting direct conversion of various alkenes and dienes into the corresponding ZrCp2 complexes in high yields. © 1991, American Chemical Society.
