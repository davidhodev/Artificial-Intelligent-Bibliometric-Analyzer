The Lewis acid tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane adds to the (butadiene)group 4 metallocenes 1a-d (metallocene = Cp2Zr, Cp2Hf, (MeCp)2Zr, (Me3CCp)2Zr) to give the metallocene-(μ-C4H6)-borate-betaine complexes 2a-d. (Isoprene)zirconocene (1e) and (2-phenylbutadiene)zirconocene (If) add the B(C6F5)3 reagent regioselectively at the carbon atom C-4 to give the complexes 2e and 2f, respectively. The complexes 2 all show a pronounced M···F-C interaction with one of the six ortho-B(C6F5)3 fluorine atoms. The resulting metallacyclic structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction of the complexes 2c and 2e (Zr···F ~ 2.40 Å, angle Zr-F-C ~ 140°). The bridging fluorine atom of the complexes in solution is characterized by an extreme upfield shift of its 19F NMR resonance (δ ~ -210 to -220 ppm) relative to the signals of the remaining five o-F resonances of the B(C6F5)3 moiety (average δ ~ -135 ppm). The 19F NMR spectra of the complexes 2 are dynamic even in the noncoordinating solvent toluene-d8. All six o-fluorine signals equilibrate with coalescence temperatures around 240 K at 564 MHz to give a single resonance signal at high temperature. This fluorine equilibration process of the -B(C6F5)3 end of the metallocene-borate-betaine complexes 2 is very likely to proceed via a rate determining cleavage of the coordinative M···F-C interaction. From the activation barrier of this process, obtained from the dynamic fluorine NMR spectra, Zr···F bond dissociation energies of ca. 8.5 kcal/mol were estimated for the complexes 2. This magnitude of the M···F-C band dissociation energy makes the internal fluorocarbon coordination a very suitable tool for protecting active electrophilic metal catalyst centers. The Zr···F-C bond of the complexes 2 is cleaved by the addition of the donor solvent THF with formation of acyclic 1,2-η2-allyl metallocene complexes.
