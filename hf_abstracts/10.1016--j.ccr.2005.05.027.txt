Pentalene bridged zirconocene/methylaluminoxane catalysts are described as useful for the polymerization of ethene, propene, and co-polymerizations with norbornene. They show a high thermostability up to polymerization temperatures of 105°C. Polyethylenes with molecular masses of 4 million g/mol are obtained at 30°C and 500,000 g/mol at more than 90°C. The molecular mass distribution varies between 2 and 15 because of the steric isomers of the pentalene ligand. Some of the complexes are active for the polymerization of propene. Similar to ansa cyclopentadienyl-fluorenyl complexes, the tacticity of the produced polypropylenes can be changed from syndiotactic to isotactic by substitution of the cyclopentadienyl ring. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.
