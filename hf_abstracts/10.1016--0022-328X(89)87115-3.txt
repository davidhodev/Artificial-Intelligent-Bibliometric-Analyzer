Titanocene, zirconocene, and hafnocene dichlorides were reduced in the presence of terminally disubstituted 1,6-heptadiyne or 1,7-octadiyne to produce dicyclopentadienylmetallabicyclooctadienes and -nonadienes. The compounds were characterized by elemental analysis and 1H and 13C NMR spectrometry, and (C5H5)2HfC7H6[Si(CH3)3]2 was characterized by X-ray diffraction techniques. The compounds crystallized in the triclinic space group P1 in a unit cell of dimensions a 10.214(2), b 12.213(2), c 10.051(3) Å, α 79.53(2), β 105.25(2), γ 96.26(2)° and V 1187.2(5) Å3. Refinement was done to a final agreement for 3950 reflections with F023σ(F02) of R(F) = 0.042. © 1989.
