Titanocene‐ and Zirconocene(diazadiene) Complexes: Preparation, Characterization, and Structure By treating Cp2MCl2 (M = Ti, Zr) with magnesium in the presence of the diazadienes R1N = CR2CR2  NR1 (R1  R2  Ph:1a; R1  Ph, R2  Me: 1b) metallocene complexes of formula Cp2) (M  Ti: 2a, b; M  Zr: 3a, b) have been obtained in good yields. 2a–3b exhibit dynamic NMR spectra indicating a rapid intramolecular migration of the bent metallocene unit Cp2M from one “face” of the reduced diazadiene to the other. From the 1H‐NMR Cp‐coalescence ΔG‡ values for the activation barrier of this automerization process have been obtained. Complex 3a was characterized by X‐ray diffraction. The five‐membered metallacyclic ZrNCCN ring system adopts an “envelope”‐conformation. Copyright © 1990 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim
