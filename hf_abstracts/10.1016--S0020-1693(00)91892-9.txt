The interactions of dichloro-bis(η5-cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) (titanocene dichloride, Cp2TiCl2) with nucleosides have been studied in methanolic solutions. Complexes of the general formula [Cp2Ti(Nucl)MeOH]Cl2 were isolated. The nucleoside complexes with one N(1)H ionizable imino proton (i.e. inosine and guanosine) undergo ionization in alkaline solution and complexes of the formula [Cp2Ti(NuclH+)] Cl were isolated. All complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses and various spectroscopic techniques. In the first series of complexes, [Cp2Ti(Nucl)MeOH]Cl2, the nucleosides act as monodentate ligands with an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the coordinated methanol and the C6O group, while in the second, [Cp2Ti(NuclH+)] Cl, they coordinate through both their N7 and O6 atoms. © 1988.
