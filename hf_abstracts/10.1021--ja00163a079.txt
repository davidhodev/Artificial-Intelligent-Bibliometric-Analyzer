Page 6712: The constants 45.6 in eq 12 and 50.3 in eq 15 are in error by 8.0 kcal/mol and should read 53.6 (eq 12) and 58.3 (eq 15). Consequently, the M-H BDE in Table II should be 8 kcal/mol greater than indicated. The electrode potentials used in the equations are referred to the (H+/H2) electrode in acetonitrile. When using this potential scale no correction for the free energy of transfer of the proton from acetonitrile to water is necessary. This correction was erroneously made in eq 12 and 15. The relative values of the BDE in Table II are not affected by the correction., IEEE. All rights reserved. Â© 1990, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
