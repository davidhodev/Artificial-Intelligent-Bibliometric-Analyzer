Polymer-attached TiCp2Cl2 and TiCpCl3 have been reduced by BuLi and the reduction products have been employed in catalytic isomerization of allylbenzene and 1,5-cyclooctadiene. The former was converted into a mixture of trans-and cis-propenyl benzene, white the 1,5-cyclooctadiene was isomerized to 1,3-cyclooctadiene through the 1,4-cyclooctadiene intermediate. Oligomerization of ethyl propiolate has been effected by the polymer-attached titanocene species and gave a mixture of closed and open trimers. Polymer-supported TiCp2-Cl2 and TiCpCl3 can be used directly, without going through the reduction process, for the low yield epoxidation of cyclohexene and cyclooctene. Polymer-supported, methylene-bridged, Cl2TiCp(C5H4CH2C5H3-Π)CpTiCl2, was prepared and used in dinitrogen fixation studies. Polymer-attached TiCp2(CO)2 was prepared. © 1981 Elsevier Sequoia S.A.
