Anticancer polyoxomolybdates have been investigated for medical application of polyoxometalates as discrete cluster anions of metal oxides. [NH3Pri]6[Mo7O24] ·3H2O (PM-8) has been recognized as one of significant antitumoral polyoxomolybdates. PM-8 had shown the growth suppression against several tumors, for examples, Co-4, human colon cancer, MX-1, human breast cancer, and OAT, human lung cancer. PM-8 showed the tumor growth suppression for MKN-45 human gastric cancer in tumor bearing mice. PM-8 inhibited the cell growth of AsPC-1 which depended on the dose with showing DNA ladder formation and DNA fragmentation, and positive Hoechst staining indicating apoptosis. The ratio of apoptotic cells on flow cytometry analysis were 35%, and 57% with treatment of PM-8 after 48, and 72 h, respectively. One of the anti-tumor activity of PM-8 result from the activation of apoptotic pathway. It is thought that polyoxomolybdates will be applied as a novel anti-tumor agent especially against cancers which are difficult to be treated clinically. © 2006 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.
