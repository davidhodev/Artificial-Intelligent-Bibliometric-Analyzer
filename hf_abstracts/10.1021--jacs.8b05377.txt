The 2,3-dimethylbutadiene complexes of Group 4 metals with constrained geometry (cg) ligands have been prepared and found to adopt a supine orientation with σ 2 ,π bonding. Treatment of cgTi(2,3-dimethylbutadiene) (1-Ti) with t BuNC leads to the formation of a titana-aziridine (3) with a coordinated cyclopentenimine that arises from the formal [4+1] addition of the diene to the isonitrile. In contrast, the reactions of cgZr(2,3-dimethylbutadiene) (1-Zr) or cgHf(2,3-dimethylbutadiene) (1-Hf) with 2 equiv of t BuNC or XyNC proceeded in a more sophisticated manner to yield unsymmetrical 2,5-diazametallacyclopentane derivatives (4, 6-Zr, and 6-Hf) or symmetrical 2,5-diazametallacyclopentene complexes (7-Zr and 7-Hf). The unsymmetrical products contain coordinated cyclopropanes; the strength of the interaction is measured by the reduction in the 1 J CC of the C-C bond that is coordinated. A detailed mechanistic analysis has been possible with the related cgM(Me) 2 (M = Ti and Hf) complexes. The first insertion is too fast to monitor, but allows complete conversion to an alkyl iminoacyl intermediate. The second isonitrile (RNC) may react with that intermediate by either of two different mechanisms, reductive elimination and coordination/insertion. In the first mechanism (Ti), rate-determining C-C coupling gives a titana-aziridine, followed by fast coordination of the isonitrile. In the second mechanism (Hf), coordination is the slow step; insertion to form a bis(iminoacyl) Hf complex is rapid.
