The orbital nature of excited states of organometallic π-complexes of early transition metals of the third-fifth periods with the d0 electronic configuration was surveyed, and their photophysical characteristics were discussed. Examples of long-lived luminescence generated by ligand-to-metal charge transfer in liquid solutions at room temperature were thoroughly considered. Regularities of nonradiative triplet-triplet energy transfer from aromatic molecules and d0 metallocene complexes of Group 4B transition metals to unsaturated hydrocarbons were examined. © 2007 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.
