The pendant (η2-formaldiminium)zirconocene cation complex 3 is generated by treatment of the (Cp-CMe2NMe2)CpZrMe2 precursor 1 with B(C6F5)3. The formation of 3 proceeds with C-H activation and methane evolution. Addition of the phosphanes PPh2R (R = Ph, CH3 and cyclopropyl) leads to the stable adducts 6a-c, in which the Zr-CH2-N three-membered ring structure of the (η2-for-maldiminium)Zr subunit is retained. The reactive complex 3 readily inserts benzophenone into the Zr-CH2(N) linkage to yield the carbon-carbon coupling product 7. α-Olefins also insert into the reactive Zr-C bond of 3. Exposure of 3 to ethene at a low temperature (-50 °C) results in the formation of the labile metallacyclic mono-alkene- insertion product 8, that is characterized spectroscopically. Styrene and 4- tert-bu-tylstyrene undergo a clean [2,1]insertion into the Zr-C bond of 3 to selectively yield the isomerically pure mono-insertion products 9a and 9b, respectively, that exhibit their aryl substituents in the α-position adjacent to the zirconium center. In each case a single stereoisomer is formed that contains a σ-π-structured η3-benzylic coordination of the chain end, exhibiting the meso-allyl position oriented cis to the substituted Cp ring at the resulting metallacyclic framework. Complex 9b was characterized by X-ray crystal-structure analysis.
