This work describes the synthesis and characterization of new organometallic species, an unprecedented mononuclear zirconium complex bearing a tetraalkylated s-indacene ligand, and secondly, its respective dicarbonyl complex obtained by reduction with Mg/HgCl2. Theoretical calculations of these two compounds were carried out to gain further understanding of these novel molecular systems.
