The synthesis, characterization, and application of a wide variety of metallocene and metallocene-like polymers and oligomers is described. Much of this effort involves the Group IVB metallocenes, but the work of vanadium and ruthenium are also included. The use of these materials as analytical reagents, laser modifiers, and in solar energy conversion is described. Â© 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.
