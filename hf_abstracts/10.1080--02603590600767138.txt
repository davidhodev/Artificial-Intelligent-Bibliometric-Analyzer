This account mainly describes results from studies in our laboratory of the reactivity of well-characterized titanium(II) species, supported by chelating bis(aryloxide) ligation, with unsaturated organic compounds, including alkynes, aldehydes, and ketones. Taken together with reported chemistry of related low-valent titanium complexes, our results serve to advance current understanding of the nature of the active species and mechanism(s) of alkyne cyclotrimerization, pinacol coupling, and McMurry reactions.
