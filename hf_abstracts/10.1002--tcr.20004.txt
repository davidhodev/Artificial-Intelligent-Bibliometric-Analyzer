Radical reactions mediated by Schwartz reagent and zirconocene(alkene) complex are firstly described. Schwartz reagent is a promising alternative to tributyltin hydride and the first transition metal hydrido complex used as a radical mediator in organic synthesis. A zirconocene (alkene) complex effects single electron transfer to alkyl halide to generate the corresponding alkyl radical. Secondly, serendipitous allylic C - H bond activation of the coordinating alkene of zirconocene(alkene) complex and its application to organic synthesis are summarized. By utilizing equilibrium between zirconocene(alkene) and zirconocene 2-alkenyl hydride, reaction of acid chloride with zirconocene(alkene) provides the corresponding homoallylic alcohol by sequential attacks of the hydride and 2-alkenyl moieties. A set of hydride and 2-alkenyl attacks on 1,4-diketone yields 6-heptene-1,4-diol derivative in high yield with high stereoselectivity. Selective capture of the hydride with diisopropyl ketone gives zirconocene 2-alkenyl alkoxide, which is a useful reagent for stereoselective allylation of aldehyde and imine. α-Halo carbonyl compounds undergo radical allylation with the zirconocene 2-alkenyl alkoxide which serves as a substitute for allyltin. © 2004 The Japan Chemical Journal Forum and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
