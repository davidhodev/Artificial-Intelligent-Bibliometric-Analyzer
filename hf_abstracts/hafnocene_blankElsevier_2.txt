A series of ancillary directing ligands bearing O, S, N atoms were used to react with ZrCl 4 to get the intermediate complexes, which showed certain diastereoselectivity when reacting with the dilithium salts of ethene-bridged bis(indene). To carry out the selective synthesis, the ancillary directing ligand was firstly reacted with equal molar amount of ZrCl 4 in toluene under argon overnight. The resultant suspension was transferred to the solid salts of C 2H 4-[(η 5-Ind)Li] 2 (molar ratio 1:1) at 0°C. The reaction mixture was warmed up and stirred for 48 h at 30°C. Then the solvent was removed under vacuum and the residue was analyzed directly by 1H-NMR spectroscopy to detect the relative amount of rac-C 2H 4- (η 5-Ind) 2ZrCl 2 and meso-C 2H 4- (η 5-Ind) 2ZrCl 2. Most of these ancillary directing ligands assisted the formation of racemic isomers, rac-C 2H 4- (η 5-Ind) 2ZrCl 2, with the molar ratio of rac-C 2H 4- (η 5-Ind) 2ZrCl 2 to meso-C 2H 4- (η 5-Ind) 2ZrCl 2 as high as 74:26. Further research demonstrated that the diastereoselectivity was significantly influenced by the structure, coordination atoms and substituents thereon of the intermediate complexes.
