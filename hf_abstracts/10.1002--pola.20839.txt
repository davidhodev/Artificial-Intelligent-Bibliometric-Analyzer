Ethylene and propylene polymerization using Ind2ZrCl2 and Ind2Zr(CH3)2/MAO catalytic systems modified by the sterically demanding bridged alicyclic alcohols, adamantan-1-ol, adamantan-2-ol, 2-methyladamantan-2-ol, and fenchyl alcohol, was investigated. Lower alcohols like isopropanol completely deactivate the system, whereas in the case of catalysts modified by these voluminous alcohols only a slight decrease in the catalytic activity proportional to alcohol/metallocene molar ratio was observed. The addition of the modifiers gives rise to polymers with higher molecular weights than the nonmodified systems, but no structural changes in the polyethylenes were observed. The addition of the sterically demanding alcohols to the reaction medium changes the regioregularity of polypropylenes, but does not significantly influence their stereoregularity, at 30°C. Propylene-ethylene copolymers containing up to 8.6% of ethylene units derived from 1,3-insertion and significant amount of rr-centered pentads were obtained by single-monomer polymerization of propylene with Ind2ZrCl 2/MMAO/adamantan-1-ol, at 70°C. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
