Reactions of [Cp2Ti(btmsa)] (btmsa = bis(trimethylsilyl) acetylene) with R4Sb2 (R = Me, Me3Si) give [Cp2TiSbMe2]2 (1) or [Cp 2TiSb(SiMe3)2]2 (2) respectively. [Cp2TiCl]2·2Mes4Sb2 (3) is serendipitously formed from [Cp2Ti(btmsa)] and Mes2SbH containing NH4Cl traces. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
