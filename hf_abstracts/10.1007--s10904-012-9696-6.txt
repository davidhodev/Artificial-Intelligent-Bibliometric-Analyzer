The conductivity of the polyamine derived from titanocene dichloride and 2-nitro-1,4-phenylenediamine increases to 101 to 103 fold when doped with iodine. Larger increases are found for the analogous polyamines except derived from zirconocene dichloride (increased 103-104 fold) and hafnocene dichloride (105-106 fold) and for certain other diamines. The conductivity of the product of titanocene dichloride and N-methyl-1,4-phenylenediamine increased 105 fold when doped. By comparison, conductivity increased only tenfold for the product from titanocene dichloride and chloro-1,4-phenylenediamine and less for the titanocene product with 1,4-phenylenediamine and methoxy-1,4-phenylenediamine and none for the product from dibutyltin dichloride and 2-nitro-1,4-phenylenediamine. Conductivity did not appreciably change when samples were exposed to the atmosphere for 21 h. MALDI MS and IR results are consistent with the formation of C-I compounds for doped materials.
