Titanium-catalysed dehydrocondensation and hydrosilylation of primary, secondary and tertiary phenylsilanes have been investigated in a one-pot process with Cp2Ti(OPh)2 as catalyst by NMR studies. Only primary and secondary silanes were found to undergo simultaneous dehydrogenative coupling and hydrosilylation reactions to produce the functional polysilanes. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V.
