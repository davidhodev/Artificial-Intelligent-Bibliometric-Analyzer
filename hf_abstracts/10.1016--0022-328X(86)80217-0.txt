The compound (butadiene)zirconocene reacts readily at room temperature with iron carbonyl complexes under CC coupling of the conjugated diene ligand with a carbonyl carbon atom. Starting from Fe(CO)5 and (C4H6)ZrCp2 the metallacyclic (π-allylzirconoxy)carbene iron complex is obtained in good yield. From the (butadiene)zirconocene equilibrium mixture ( 12a 14a = 45 55) the preferred reaction of the (s-trans-η4-diene)metallocene isomer with Fe(CO)5 or Fe(CO)4PPh3 takes place. (s-cis-Butadiene)ZrCp2 (14a), which is a stronger nucleophile than its isomer (12a), appears to be inert towards these metal carbonyls under kinetically controlled reaction conditions. This suggests a novel mechanism for the M-carbonyl → M-carbene transformation. © 1986.
