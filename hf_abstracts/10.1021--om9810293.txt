A series of zirconocene dihydride complexes of the general form [(RnCp)2ZrH2]x having substituted cyclopentadienyl ligands has been prepared by hydrogenation of the corresponding dimethyl complexes. The most sterically crowded members (Cp*(η5-C5HMe4)ZrH2, (Cp* = (η5-C5Me5)), Cp*{η5-C5H3-1,3-(CMe 3)2}ZrH2 and {η5-C5H3-1,3-(CMe3) 2}2ZrH2) are monomeric; those less crowded members ([Cp*{η5-C5H4(CMe 3)}ZrH2]2, [Cp*(THI)ZrH2]2 (THI = η5-tetrahydroindenyl), and [{η5-C5H3-1,3-(CHMe2) 2}2ZrH2]2) are predominantly dimeric in benzene solution. Cp*{η5-C5H3-1,3-(CHMe 2)2}ZrH2 and (η5-C5HMe4)2ZrH2 exist as equilibrium mixtures of monomer and dimer in benzene solution. The hydride ligands rapidly exchange with D2, affording the dideuteride complexes. Deuterium incorporation into some of the substituents on the cyclopentadienyl rings of the monomeric dihydride complexes is also observed. The X-ray structures of Cp*2HfH2, Cp*{η5-C5H4(CMe 3)}ZrCl2, Cp*{η5-C5H3-1,3-(CHMe 2)2}ZrCl2 and {η5-C5H3-1,3-(CMe3) 2}2ZrCl2 are reported. © 1999 American Chemical Society.
