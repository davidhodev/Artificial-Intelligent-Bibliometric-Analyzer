The syntheses of a series of 1-methyl-3-aryl-substituted titanocene and zirconocene dichrorides are reported. These complexes are synthesized by the reaction of 2- and 3-methyl-6, 6-dimethylfulvenes (1:4) with aryllithium, followed by the reaction with TiCl4·2THF, ZrCl4 and (CpTiCl2)2O respectively, to give complexes 1 - 5. The complex [η5-1-methyl-3-(α, α-dimethylbenzyl)cyclopentadienyl]titanium dichloride has been studied by X-ray diffraction. The red crystal of this complex is monoclinic, space group P21/C with unit cell parameters: a = 6.973(6) × 10-1 nm, b = 36.91(2) × 10-1 nm, c = 10.063(4) × 10-1 nm, α = β = γ = 93.35(5)°, V = 2584(5) × 10-3 nm3 and Z = 4. Refinement for 1004 observed reflections gives the final R of 0.088. There are four independent molecules per unit cell.
