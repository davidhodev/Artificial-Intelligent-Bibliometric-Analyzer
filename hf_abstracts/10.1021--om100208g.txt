The previously described hafnacyclocumulene Cp2Hf(- 4-t-Bu-C4-t-Bu) (1) reacts with B(C6F 5)3 to give the dinuclear complex 2, which consists of a cationic part with two hafnocene centers bridged unsymmetrically by butadiyne and acetylide moieties and an alkynyl boranate representing the anionic part. In the reaction of 1 with i-Bu2AlH the central C - C bond of the hafnacyclocumulene ring is weakened, resulting in the formation of an intermediate zwitterion, which then forms the hafnium bis-acetylide Cp 2Hf(C - C-t-Bu)2. Subsequent hydroalumination of one of the C - C bonds with i-Bu2AlH yields the final complex Cp 2Hf(C - C-t-Bu)[C(Al-i-Bu2)=CH(t-Bu)] (3). Reaction of the titanacyclocumulene 4 with catalytic amounts of B(C6F 5)3 results in the formation of the previously described dinuclear complex 5, which then undergoes further reaction with B(C 6F5)3 to give the known zwitterionic Ti(III) species 6 and the ene-yne t-BuCH - CHC - C-t-Bu.
