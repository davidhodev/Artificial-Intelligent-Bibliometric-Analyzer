Two routes lead to the target: The title compound 2 is formed, both upon reaction of the double Grignard reagent 1 with titanocene dichloride as well as upon reaction of H2CPPh3 with thermally generated (aryne)titanocene 3. In the second route, the phenyltitanocene ylide 4 is also formed. (Figure Presented.) Copyright © 1986 by VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Germany
