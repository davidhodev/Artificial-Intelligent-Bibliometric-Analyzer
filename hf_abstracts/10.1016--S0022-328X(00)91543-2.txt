The volatile products resulting from the solid-state thermal decomposition of the dimethylmetallocenes Cp2M(CH3)2 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) have been characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Analogous studies utilizing Cp2Ti(CD3)2 have provided evidence for the various degradative pathways involved in these thermolysis processes. Â© 1976.
