Using the catalyst system consisting of an alkenyl-substituted Cp′2TiCl2 and i-C3H7MgCl, isoprene can be dimerized to linear dimers 2,6-dimethyl-1-trans-3,6-octatriene and 3,6-dimethyl-1,3,6-octatriene under mild reaction condition. The substituent effects of alkenyl-substituted titanocene catalysts on both the yield and the selectivity were studied. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
