Chloride coordination is the key: Dimethylzirconocene reacts with amides to form methylzirconium amide complexes. On heating, in the presence of a chloride source, these compounds are converted into N-acylimidozirconocene complexes that react intramolecularly to form the corresponding nitrile compounds (see scheme; Cp = C5H5). Mechanistic studies reveal that chloride coordination to zirconium is required for this transformation to occur.
