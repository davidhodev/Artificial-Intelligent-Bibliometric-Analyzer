Heterobimetallic sulfides of composition [LAl(μ-S)2MCp 2] (M = Ti, Zr) react smoothly with two equivalents of water by ring opening and chalcogen exchange to form the heterobimetallic oxide-hydroxide- hydrogensulfides [LAl(OH) (μ-O)MCp2(SH)] (Ti derivative shown). The presence of the hydrolysis intermediate [LAl(SH)(μ-O)MCp2(SH)] in the reaction mixture confirms the proposed pathway. (Chemical Equation Presented) © 2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.
