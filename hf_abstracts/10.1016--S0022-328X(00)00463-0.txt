The reactions of the zirconocene-ethylene complex Cp2Zr(CH2=CH2)(PMe3) with Group 14 metal chlorides or alkoxides give ethylene-bridged group 14 metal-zirconocene complexes. A reaction mechanism via a five-membered intermediate which involves direct coupling of ethylene and single bonding is proposed. Â© 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.
