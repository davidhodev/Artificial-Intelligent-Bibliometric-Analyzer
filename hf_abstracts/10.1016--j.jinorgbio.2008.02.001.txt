A variety of substituted titanocene and ansa-titanocene complexes have been synthesized and characterized using traditional methods. The cytotoxic activity of the different titanocene complexes was tested against tumour cell lines human adenocarcinoma HeLa, human myelogenous leukemia K562, human malignant melanoma Fem-x and normal immunocompetent cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC. Alkenyl substitution, either on the cyclopentadienyl ring or on the silicon-atom ansa-bridge of the titanocene compounds [Ti{Me2Si(η5-C5Me4) (η5-C5H3 {CMe2CH2CH 2CH{double bond, long}CH2})}Cl2] (8), [Ti{Me(CH2{double bond, long}CH)Si(η5-C5Me4)(η 5-C5H4)}Cl2] (9) and [Ti(η5-C5H4{CMe2CH2 CH2CH{double bond, long}CH2})2Cl2] (12) showed higher cytotoxic activities (IC50 values from 24 ± 3 to 151 ± 10 μM) relative to complexes bearing an additional alkenyl-substituted silyl substituent on the silicon bridge [Ti{Me{(CH2{double bond, long}CH)Me2SiCH2CH2}Si(η 5-C5Me4)(η5- C5H4)}Cl2] (10) and [Ti{Me{(CH2{double bond, long}CH)3SiCH2CH2}Si(η5- C5Me4)(η5-C5H4 )}Cl2] (11) which causes a dramatic decrease of the cytotoxicity (IC50 values from 155 ± 9 to >200 μM). In addition, the synthesis of the analogous niobocene complex [Nb(η5-C5H4{CMe2CH2 CH2CH=CH2})2Cl2] (13), is described. Structural studies based on DFT calculations of the most active complexes 8, 9 and 12 and the X-ray crystal structure of 13 are reported. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
