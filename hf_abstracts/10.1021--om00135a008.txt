(η2-Benzophenone)zirconocene has been obtained by the thermolysis of (η2-benzoyl)phenylzirconocene. In the solid state this (η2-ketone)metallocene complex adopts a dimeric structure and crystallizes in the Monoclinic space group P21/n with lattice parameters a = 13.765 (4) A, b = 18.220 (3) A, c = 14.182 (5) Å, β = 93.20 (2)°, V = 3551.3 (1.6) Å3, and Z = 4. In [(η5-C5H5)2Zr(η2-OC(C6H5)2)]2(3), the two independent three-membered Zr-O-C rings, which contain short zirconium-oxygen bonds (Zr1–O1 = 2.109 (2), Zr2–O2 = 2.112 (2) A) and long zirconium-carbon distances (Zr1–C1 = 2.346 (3), Zr2-C2 = 2.350 (3) A), are linked together by relatively weak Zr1–O2 (2.304 (2) A) and Zr2–Ol (2.287 (2) A) bonds. In contrast to many other oligomeric (η2-ketone)- and (η2-aldehyde)MCp2 complexes, the central four-membered Zr202- unit in 3 is nonplanar with a folding angle of 17.2°. In solution 3 reacts with electron-deficient transition metal or main-group metal hydrides to form 1:1 adducts containing the Monomeric (η2-benzophenone)zirconocene unit. The reaction of 3 with (Cp2ZrH2)x yields the binuclear complex Cp2Zr(μ-η1(O):η2-OC(C6H5)2)(μ-H)ZrCp2H (17). The corresponding 1:1 adduct between Cp2Zr(η2-OC(C6H5)2) and hafnocene dihydride undergoes a thermally induced “dyotropic” rearrangement to give an equilibrium mixture of Cp2Zr(μ-η1(0):η2-0C(C6H5)2)(μ-H)ZfCp2H (18) and Cp2Hf(μ-η1(0):η2-OC(C6H5)2)(μ-H)ZrCp2H (19). The reaction of 3 with methylenetriphenylphosphorane proceeds with ring opening of the metallaoxirane structural subunit. Transfer of one ylide hydrogen to the carbonyl carbon atom of the former η2-ketone ligand leads to the formation of the metallocene-substituted phosphorus ylide Cp2Zr(OCHPh2)(CHPPh3) (25). © 1986, American Chemical Society.
