(Butadiene)zirconocene reacts with acetone azine by CC coupling to give a seven-membered metallacyclic 1:1 addition product. In contrast, benzophenone azine reacts with the diene metallocene system with liberation of butadiene to form Cp2Zr(N═CPh2)2 (9b). This product is also obtained upon irradiation of Cp2Zr(CO)2 with Ph2C═NN═CPh2 or treatment of Cp2ZrCl2 with 2 equiv of LiN═CPh2. The molecular structure of the bis(alkylideneamido)metallocene complex 9b was determined by X-ray diffraction. The zirconocene complex crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c with cell constants a - 32.878 (5), b - 9.697 (1), c - 19.653 (2) Å, β = 111.818 (8)°, and Z = 8. The zirconium bound —N═CPh2 ligands (including the ipso carbons of the phenyl substituents) are oriented in the Cp-Zr-Cp bisecting plane. To a first approximation both Zr_N═CPh2 units can be regarded as being of a heteroallene structural type, characterized by bisecting C═N and N═Zr π-bonding planes and near to sp-hybridized nitrogen centers. Accordingly, very short zirconium to nitrogen bond distances are observed: N(1)-Zr, 2.058 (2) Å; N(2)-Zr, 2.063 (2) Å. The Zr-N(2)-C(2) unit (164.1 (2)°) is slightly less linearly arranged than Zr-N(l)-C(1) (173.7 (2)°). The solid-state structure shows a clear distinction of E- and Z-oriented phenyl substituents at the Ph2C═N—Zr moieties. This is not observed in solution, however. In the 13C NMR spectrum even at low temperature (198 K) complex 9b exhibits only one set of phenyl group carbon resonances. This indicates a rapid equilibration of (E)- and (Z)-phenyl groups. This is an uncommon feature for heteroallene-type (alkylideneamido)metallocene complexes. We propose a linear to bent to linear (R2C═N)MCp2(X) isomerization reaction sequence to take place rapidly in solution. This unusual dynamic feature attributes to the organometallic compound 9b an intermediate position between organic Schiff bases (sp2-hybridized nitrogen, bent structure) and stabilized heteroallene-type (sp-hybridized nitrogen, linear structure) inorganic (alkylideneamido)metal complexes. © 1988, American Chemical Society.
