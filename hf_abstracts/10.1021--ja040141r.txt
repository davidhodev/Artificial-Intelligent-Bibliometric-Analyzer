The scandium dihydrosilyl complexes Cp*2ScSiH2R (R = Mes (4), Trip (5), SiPh3 (6), Si(SiMe3)3 (7); Mes = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2, Trip = 2,4,6- iPr3C6H2) and Cp* 2ScSiH(SiMe3)2 (8) were synthesized by addition of the appropriate hydrosilane to Cp*2ScMe (1). Studies of these complexes in the context of hydrocarbon activation led to discovery of catalytic processes for the dehydrogenative silation of hydrocarbons (including methane, isobutene and cyclopropane) with Ph2SiH2 via Ïƒ-bond metathesis.
