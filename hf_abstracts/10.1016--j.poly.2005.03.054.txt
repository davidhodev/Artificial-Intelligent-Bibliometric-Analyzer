A number of methods by which various functional groups that are attached at the Cp-rings of Group 4 bent metallocenes can be intramolecularly coupled to yield ansa-metallocenes are presented and discussed. These methods include pathways of metallacyclopentane formation from Cp-alkenyl moieties, olefin metathesis reactions between α-olefins attached at the Cp-ligands, photochemically induced [2 + 2]cycloadditions of substituted vinyl groups and Lewis acid- or Brønsted acid-catalyzed Mannich-type condensation reactions between 1-aminoethenyl functional groups at the bent metallocene framework. The latter reaction type was also used for the formation of functionalized [3]ferrocenophane systems that provided a convenient entry to the synthesis of a variety of useful optically active [3]ferrocenophane-based chelate ligands for applications in asymmetric catalysis. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
