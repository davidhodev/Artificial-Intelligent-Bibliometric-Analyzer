A method is described that allows the preparation of stable conjugated primary enamines containing furyl or pyridyl substituents. In a template reaction (butadiene)zirconocene is 1,4-selectively coupled to two 2-cyanopyridine equivalents to give the nine-membered metallacycle 8b. Subsequent treatment with methanol removes the bent metallocene template and leads to the formation of 1,6-diamino-1,6-bis(2-pyridyl)-1,3,5-hexatriene (9b). The 1,6- diamino-1,6-bis(2-furyl)-1,3,5-hexatriene system (9a) was prepared analogously (69% isolated). Subsequent addition of benzonitrile to (butadiene)ZrCp2 followed by 2-cyanopyridine or 2-cyanofurane gave the respective unsymmetrically substituted 1,6-diaminohexatrienes in good yield. Â© 1994.
