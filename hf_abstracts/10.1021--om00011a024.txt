Tandem mass spectrometry methods were used to assign the structure of C10H10Zr•+ ions produced by electron impact ionization of (C5H5)2Zr(CH3)2 and [(C5H5)2ZrO]2. The results were consistent with the formation of the zirconocenium radical-cation. The neutralization-reionization mass spectrum of this species showed a recovery signal, indicating that neutral monomeric zirconocene had been generated in the gas phase. © 1995, American Chemical Society.
