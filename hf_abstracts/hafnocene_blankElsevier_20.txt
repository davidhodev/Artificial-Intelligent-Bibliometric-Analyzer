Group IVB metallocene polyethers containing the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol have been synthesized in moderate yield with chain lengths ranging from 100 to 1,000 employing the interfacial polycondensation procedure. Infrared spectroscopy shows the absence of the O-H group and formation of the M-O linkage consistent with the formation of the polyether. F-MALDI MS results are consistent with the presence of metal-containing fragmentation clusters containing one and two metal atoms and ion fragments up to several hundred units long. The polymers all show moderate to good inhibition of a group of cancer cell lines including colon, breast, lung, and prostrate cell lines. The titanocene-containing polymer has significant CI50 values showing a preference to inhibit the cancer cell lines in preference to the WI-38 normal cell line. Â© MD Publications Pvt. Ltd.
