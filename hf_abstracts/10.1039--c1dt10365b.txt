The mononuclear silyl-linked bis(amidinate) titanium compound 2 was prepared by salt metathesis of 1 and TiCl4(thf)2. Alkylation of 2 with methyllithium gave analogue 3. Both 2 and 3 exhibited a configuration similar to ansa-metallocene and showed good activity towards ethylene polymerization after activation with MAO. Â© 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
