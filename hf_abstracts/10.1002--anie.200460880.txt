Alternative catalysts: The hydroamination of nonactivated double bonds has been the domain of rare-earth-metal catalysts. Now alkyl zirconocene and titanocene cations, which are readily prepared from commercially available precursors, are shown to be active catalysts in the hydroamination/cyclization of secondary aminoalkenes to give tertiary pyrrolidines and piperidines.
