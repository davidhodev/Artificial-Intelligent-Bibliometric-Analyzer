The zirconocene ylide Cp2Zr(Ph)CHPPh3 (1a) reacts with benzyl isonitrile at temperatures above 0°C by insertion into the ZrC(ylide) bond to give the (η2-iminoacyl)zirconocene complex Cp2Zr(Ph)[η2-N(CH2Ph)C(CHPPh3)] (2a). Complex 2a crystallizes in the space group P 1 - with a 11.624(4), b 12.365(4), c 13.332(5) Å, α 109.50(3), β 93.58(3), γ 104.41(3)°. The X-ray diffraction study, showed 2a the (η2-iminoacyl) metallocene stereoisomer to have an "RN-inside" arrangement. The bonding parameters of the Ph3PCHC[Zr]NCH2Ph unit are consistent with 2a being an internally Lewis-acid coordinated stabilized ylide. Similarly the hafnocene ylide Cp2Hf(C2H5)CHPPh3 (1c) reacts with benzyl isonitrile to give 2c which was identified by X-ray crystallography. It crystallizes in space group I 1 - with a 14.833(4), b 15.117(5), c 16.397(3) Å, α 88.47(2), β 84.80(2), γ 64.23(2)°, Z = 4. The MC and MN bonds of the (η2-iminoacyl) metallocene moiety in 2c are slightly shorter than those in 2a. © 1988.
