Air-stable binuclear complex of bis(methylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium perfluorooctanesulfonate (1a) was successfully synthesized by the reaction of (CH3Cp)2ZrCl2 with C8F 17SO3Ag. The compound 1a was characterized by different techniques and found to have the nature of air-stability, water tolerance, thermally-stability and strong Lewis-acidity. In addition, its solubility was higher than that of our previously reported uninuclear zirconocene bis(perfluorooctanesulfonate). It showed high catalytic efficiency in the Friedel-Crafts acylation of alkyl aryl ethers and the Mannich reaction and could be reused. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
