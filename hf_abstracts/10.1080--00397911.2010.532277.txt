Air-stable zirconocene bis(perfluoroctanesulfonate) s [Cp 2Zr]OSO 2C 8F 17) 2] (1) with high Lewis acidity and high thermal stability was prepared by the reaction between Cp 2ZrCl 2 and AgOSO 2C 8F 17. The as-prepared complex 1 exhibits good activity and selectivity in the cyclotrimerization of various ketones to the desired 1,3,5- triaylbenzenes. Furthermore, in the cyclic experiments, the complex 1 shows little loss of activity after 10 cycles. The results afford a general and efficient method for the cyclotrimerization of ketones using Cp 2Zr(OSO 2C 8F 17) 2 as catalyst. Â© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
