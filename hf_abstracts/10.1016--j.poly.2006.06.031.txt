ES-MS of dilute solutions of (bcep)ZrCl2 (1) (bcep = PhP(CH2CH2-η5-C5H4)2) in acetonitrile-water indicates the presence of three species in solution: [(bcep)Zr(H2O)2]2+ (2), [{(bcep)Zr(μ-OH)}2]2+ (3), and the singly deprotonated form of dimer 3, [{(bcep)Zr}2(μ-O)(μ-OH)]+ (4). In aqueous solutions, reactivity studies investigated largely by 31P NMR spectroscopy support the presence of 2, 3 and 4. One equivalent of fluoride was found to react immediately with 2, but slowly with 3 and 4, to give the monofluoro complex [(bcep)ZrF]+ which was isolated as the BPh4- salt. Addition of aqueous sodium sulphate gave insoluble crystals of the sulfato complex (bcep)Zr(SO4) which was characterised by X-ray crystallography. Addition of acids HX (X = Br, NO3, HSO4, HCO3) to aqueous solutions of 1 gave species observed by ES-MS corresponding to [(bcep)ZrX]+. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
