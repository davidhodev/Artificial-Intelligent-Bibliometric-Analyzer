© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimDimeric germole dianion bridged TiIII and ZrIV complexes have been synthesized. In these complexes, the germole dianion adopts a formal η1,η5 coordination to the two metal centers. The bonding situation in these bridged dimers is dominated by a covalent Ge−Ge interaction that results, for example, in a strong antiferromagnetic coupling of the d1 Ti centers.
