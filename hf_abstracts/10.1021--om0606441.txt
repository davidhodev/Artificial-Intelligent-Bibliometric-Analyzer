Tin trihydride Os(SnH3)(Tp)L(PPh3) [L = P(OMe) 3, P(OEt)3] complexes were prepared by allowing chloro OsCl-(Tp)L(PPh3) complexes to react first with SnCl2 and then with NaBH4 in ethanol. The complexes were characterized spectroscopically and by the X-ray crystal structure determination of the Os(SnH3)(Tp){P(OMe)3}(PPh3) derivative. Reaction of tin trihydride complexes with CO2 led to formate Os[SnH{OC(H)= O}2](Tp)L(PPh3) derivatives. Â© 2006 American Chemical Society.
