The organo-tin compounds, Me2Sn(C5H4R-1)2 (R = Me (1), Pri (2), But (3), SiMe3 (4)) and Me2Sn(C5Me4R-1)2 (R = H (5), SiMe3 (6)), were prepared by the reaction of Me2SnCl2 with the lithium or sodium derivative of the corresponding cyclopentadiene. Compounds 1-6 have been characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 119Sn). In addition the molecular structures of 5 and 6 were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The transmetalation reaction of 1-6 with ZrCl4 or [NbCl4(THF)2] gave the corresponding metallocene complexes in high yields. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
