In reactions of Cp2ZrCl{(μ-H)2BC5H10}, 1, with LiH, Cl- is replaced to produce Cp2ZrH{(μ-H)2BC5H10}, 2. Reaction of 1 with K[H2BC5H10] yields Cp2Zr{(μ-H)2BC5H10}2, 4. The methyl-substituted compound Cp2Zr-(CH3{(μ-H)2BC5H 10}, 3, is prepared from the reaction of Cp2ZrCl(CH3) with K[H2BC5H10]. The synthetic route for the preparation of 3 prevents side reactions that occur in the direct alkylation of zirconocene organohydroborate complexes. Proton NMR spectra of 2 at elevated temperatures indicate that intramolecular hydrogen exchange occurs among Zr-H-B hydrogens, terminal H on Zr, and Cp hydrogens. The structures of 2, 3, and 4 are reported. Crystal data for 2: space group Abm2 (No. 39), a = 11.423(2) Å, b = 14.138(3) Å, c = 9.025(5) Å, Z = 4.
