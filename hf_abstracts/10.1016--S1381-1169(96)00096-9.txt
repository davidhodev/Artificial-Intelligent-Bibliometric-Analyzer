The stereotacticities of a series of polypropylene polymer chains produced with different categories of structurally characterized ansa- zirconocene and hafnocene procatalysts in homogeneous catalysis have been determined by statistical analyses of the methyl pentad signal intensity distributions of their 13C NMR spectra. The polymers microstructural characteristics have been contrasted with the intramolecular parameters of the discrete metallocene molecules obtained from single crystal X-ray diffractions and different 1H NMR measurements. For the first category, by contrasting the polymerization behavior of zirconocene-hafnocene pairs the origin of the stereospecificity differences have been discussed in terms of heavy atom electron configuration, lanthanoid shell contraction and relativistic effects operative on elements belonging to the sixth row of the periodic table. For the second category the observed changes in polymerization behavior for a pair of zirconocene based catalysts with ligand modification of irrelevant steric control have been correlated to the electron density redistribution on different aromatic carbons and the consequent change in flexibility of the catalyst framework, increase of the haptocity of M-C5 bonding and variation of the frontier orbital shape and diffusivity. For the third category, pairs of syndio- and isotactic specific ansa-zirconocene and hafnocenes have been selected in which the organic ligands are constructed with the same aromatic moieties joined with different bridges. The observed catalytic changes have been correlated to combined steric and electronic factors altering orbital energies and hybridizations. Finally, by introducing a fourth category, the Hf effect is demonstrated by comparing the catalytic olefin activities of two non-bridged hafnocene- zirconocene pairs.
