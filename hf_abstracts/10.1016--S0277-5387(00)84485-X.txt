The five complexes (RC 5 H 4 ) 2 M(S 2 CNBz 2 )Cl (R = H, CH 3 ; M = Ti, Zr, Hf; B = CH 2 C 6 H 5 ) have been prepared by the reaction of (RC 5 H 4 ) 2 MCl 2 with anhydrous sodium salts of dibenzyldithiocarbamate in refluxing CH 2 Cl 2 . These complexes have been characterized by elemental analysis, IR and 1 H NMR. X-ray crystal structure determination Of Cp 2 Zr(S 2 CNBz 2 )Cl shows the molecule has a five-coordinate bent metallocene geometry in which the zirconium atom is attached to two η 5 -C 5 H 5 groups, one bidentate dibenzyl-dithiocarbamate ligand and one chlorine [ZrCl, 2.549(1) Å; ZrS, 2.734(1), 2.667(1); ClZrS, 137.6(1)° and 73.3(1)°; SZrS, 64.3(1)°]. The catalytic system Cp 2 Ti(S 2 CNBz 2 )Cl-NaH exhibits high initial catalytic activity of hydrogenation of hexene-1 under mild conditions. © 1992.
