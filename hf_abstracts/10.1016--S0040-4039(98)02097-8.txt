Styrenes were alkylated with alkyl tosylates, sulfates and bromides in the presence of a zirconocene catalyst and (n)BuMgCl in THF. By the use of this reaction, primary and secondary alkyl groups can be introduced regioselectively at the benzylic carbon of styrenes to give Î±-substituted ethylbenzenes.
