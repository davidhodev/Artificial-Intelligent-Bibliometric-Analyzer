Give me five! Addition of alkynes as well as dienes to a quintuply bonded dichromium complex was investigated and cycloaddition reactions were observed (see scheme). The structures of the obtained compounds indicate the reduction of the alkyne and diene ligands, an oxidation of the chromium atoms, as well as the decrease of the Cr-Cr bond order.
