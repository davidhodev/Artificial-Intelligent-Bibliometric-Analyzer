The reaction of (η2-formaldehyde)zirconocene dimer (3) with hafnocene dichloride (5) at room temperature gives the heterobimetallic complex [μ-(η1-O: η2-C,O-formaldehyde)(Cp2ZrCl)(Cp2HfCl)]. From thermochemical considerations it is suggested that methylene migration from zirconium to hafnium occurs during the reaction, favouring the regioisomer Cp2(Cl)Zr-O-CH2-Hf(Cl)Cp2 (7) under equilibrium conditions. © 1991.
