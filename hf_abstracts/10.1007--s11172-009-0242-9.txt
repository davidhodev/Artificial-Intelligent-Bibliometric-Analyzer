The present review summarizes the results of studies of Zr and Ti complexes based on chelating side-chain functionalized cyclopentadienyl ligands, which were synthesized by the author of the present review and co-workers. The coordination ability of the functional groups is considered. Dynamic processes that occur in half-sandwich complexes in solutions were studied by NMR spectroscopy. Emphasis is given to the reduction reactions of side-chain functionalized zirconocene dichlorides, as well as to the structures and properties of the reaction products depending on the nature of the heteroatomic substituent.
