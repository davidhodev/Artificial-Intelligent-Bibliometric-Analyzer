Co-cyclisation of alkenes with alkenes or alkynes and zirconocene gives zirconacycles which are further elaborated by the consecutive insertion of allyl, propargyl, or allenyl metal carbenoids and electrophiles. Insertion of other carbenoids give the first zirconacyclohexanes with the potential for further elaboration.
