The electron ionization mass spectrometric behaviour of a new series of hafnocene and zirconocene dialcoholates is discussed. Deprotonized norborneol and 3-methyl-2-norbornanemethanol were used as lateral ligands. These data are also compared to those of mass-analysed ion kinetic energy spectrometry. Fragmentation patterns of the complexes in question give relevant information on their gas-phase behaviour and on an influence of the ligand's structure on decomposition pathways as well.
