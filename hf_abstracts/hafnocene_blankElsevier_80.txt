We have studied reaction chemistry that appears to be relevant to the mechanism of the dehydrogenative polymerization of phenylsilane by zirconocene and hafnocene catalysts. These investigations suggest that the polymerization proceeds by a two-step mechanism involving sigma-bond metathesis. The active catalysts is therefore proposed to be a coordinatively unsaturated d0 metal hydride complex, which mediates a step (condensation) polymerization.
