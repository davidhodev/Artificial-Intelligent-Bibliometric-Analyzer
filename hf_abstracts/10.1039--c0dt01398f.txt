This perspective focuses on complexes of radioactive metal ions applied in multimodal radio- and optical imaging. The application of metal ions in radioimaging techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) has advantages over lighter nuclei in terms of half-life, but there are particular issues related to their speciation (particularly leaching from complexes) and with the combination of certain ions with fluorescent systems. The basic coordination chemistry of the ions involved and issues relating to biological conditions and their compatibility with optical imaging techniques are reviewed, the current literature presented in context, and the prospect of exploiting the intrinsic luminescence of certain metal–ligand complexes is discussed. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
