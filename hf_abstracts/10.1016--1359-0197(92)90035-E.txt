The nature and distribution of radioactive species resulting from (nγ) neutron-capture reactions in the metal atoms of zirconocene dichloride and molybdocene dichloride were investigated. Retention values of 20.22, 12.63 and 20.23% were obtained for Zr-95, Zr-97 and Mo-99 respectively. β-Transformation in 95Zr-zirconocene dichloride and 99Mo-molybdocene dichloride led to approximately 80% of the respective daughters Nb-95 and Tc-99m being retained at the same molecular form as the parent. © 1992.
