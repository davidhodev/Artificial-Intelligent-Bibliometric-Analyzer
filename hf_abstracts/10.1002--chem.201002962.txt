Tandem insertion of 1,1-dihalo-1-lithio species (halocarbenoids) and lithium alkynides into zirconacyclopentenes and zirconcyclopentanes affords carbocyclic products in high yields via an unusual rearrangement that probably involves addition of an organolithium species to the β-position of a zirconium-alkyne complex to give an alkenylidene-zirconate species. A wide variety of cyclopentanoid organic structures are rapidly assembled in good yield using this multicomponent coupling. The main side reaction, which becomes exclusive in some cases, is β-hydride elimination of an intermediate cyclopentyl- or cyclopentenyl zirconocene. Zirconocene 'ate' complexes play several roles in a versatile three-component one-pot assembly of bicyclic organic structures from a 1,6- or 1,7-enyne or -diene, an in situ generated halocarbenoid RCX2Li and a lithium acetylide. The most likely reaction pathway involves the unprecedented β-addition of an organolithium species to an alkynyl zirconocene to give a zirconium alkenylidenate complex.
