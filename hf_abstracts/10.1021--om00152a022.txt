The (s-cis-/S-trans-η4-butadiene)zirconocene equilibrium mixture (17/15 = 55/45) reacts with CpCo(CO)2at ambient temperature to give the metallacyclic Fischer-type carbene complex Cp2Zr(C4H6)(OC=)Co-(CO)Cp, 20. The (s-trans-diene)metallocene complex reacts much faster with the metal carbonyl than the more nucleophilic (S-cis-C4H6)ZrCp2isomer. The product of this nonnucleophilic carbene complex forming reaction, 20, was characterized by X-ray diffraction. It crystallizes in the space group P21/c with cell constants a = 7.824 (2), b = 15.753 (4), and c = 15.121 (3) A and β= 99.26 (2)°. Complex 20 is characterized by a rather short Co-C(carbene) bond length of 1.815 (4) A. At ambient temperature in solution 20 rapidly equilibrates with the starting components Cp2Zr(butadiene) and CpCo(CO)2. At equilibrium the carbene complex is favored by 85/15. Substitution of a Cl on the Cp ring of the CpCo moiety shifts the equilibrium ratio further to the side of the zirconoxycarbene complex: (η5-C5H5)2Zr-(C4H6)(OC=)(CO)(η5-C5H4Cl) ⇄Cp2Zr(butadiene) + (η5-c5h4c1)co(co)2 (>98/2). © 1987, American Chemical Society.
