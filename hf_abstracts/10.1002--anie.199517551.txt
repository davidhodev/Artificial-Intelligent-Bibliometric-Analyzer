An active catalyst for α‐olefin polymerization without addition of activator components has been discovered in the betain 2, which is formed in the title reaction shown below. Laser desorption mass spectrometry shows that B(C6F5)3‐containing polymers with a molecular weight distribution typical of Ziegler catalysts are formed. (Figure Presented.)
