Si-Si/Si-O dehydrocoupling of hydrosilanes with alcohols (1:1.5 mole ratio), catalyzed by AgNO 3 which converted to Ag(0) colloidal nanoparticles, gave poly(alkoxysilane)s in one-pot in moderate to high yield. The hydrosilanes include p-X-C 6H 4SiH 3 (X = H, CH 3, OCH 3, F), PhCH 2SiH 3, and (PhSiH 22. The alcohols include MeOH, EtOH, iPrOH, PhOH, and CF 3(CF 2) 2CH 2OH. The weight average molecular weight and polydispersity of the poly(alkoxysilane)s were in the range of 1,600∼8,000 Dalton and 1.4∼3.5. The dehydrocoupling reactions of phenylsilane with ethanol (1:3 mole ratio) in the presence of the silver nanocolloid catalyst produced only triethoxyphenylsilane as product.
