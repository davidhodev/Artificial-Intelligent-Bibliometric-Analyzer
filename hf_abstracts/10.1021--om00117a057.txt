The first structurally characterized transitionmetal complex of cyclobutene is described. The complex is formed by the elimination of methane from cyclobutylmethylzirconocene with subsequent trapping by trimethylphosphine. The reactivity of the complex with unsaturated organic molecules and its X-ray crystal structure are reported. Â© 1990, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
