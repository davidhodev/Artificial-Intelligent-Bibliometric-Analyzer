The complex of a derivative of β-cyclodextrin, that is mono[6-deoxy-6-(2-butenedinitrile-2,3-dimercapto sodium salt)]-β- cyclodextrin (6-mnt-β-CD), with titanocene (titanocene di[mono[6-deoxy-6- (2-butenedinitrile-2,3-dimercapto)]-β-cyclodextrin], Cp 2 Ti[6- mnt-β-CD] 2 ) has been synthesized and characterized by IR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, elemental analysis, thermogravimetry, 1 H- and 13 C-NMR spectroscopy. The stoichiometry of the target molecule was determined by 1 H-NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. © 2003 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.
