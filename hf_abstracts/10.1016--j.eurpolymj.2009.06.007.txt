The structural characteristics of polypropylene samples prepared with two post-metallocene catalysts based on complexes bis-{M-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-salicylidene)-4-[bis-(5-methyl-2-furyl)methyl]aniline}titanium dichloride and [(4R,5R)-2,2-dimethyl-α,α,α′,α′-tetra(pentafluorophenyl)-1,3-dioxalan-4,4-dimethanol)titanium dichloride are investigated by GPC, 13C NMR, IR, DSC, and XRD methods. A combination of the first complex and MAO forms a single-center catalyst which polymerizes propylene to a nearly perfectly atactic polymer. A combination of the second complex and MAO forms a multi-center catalyst system producing polymer mixtures with broad molecular weight distributions containing five to six Flory components with different average molecular weights. Relative contents of the Flory components strongly depend on the type of solvent in the polymerization reactions. Some of the active centers produce high molecular weight, highly isotactic crystalline material with the melting point over 154 °C. The nature of steric errors in these polymer fractions (determined by 13C NMR) can be explained by a variant of stereocontrol similar to that exerted by metallocene catalysts of the C1 symmetry. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
