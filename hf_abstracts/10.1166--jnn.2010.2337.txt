Si-Si/Si-O dehydrocoupling of hydrosilanes with alcohols (1:1.5 mole ratio), catalyzed by group VIII metallocenes Cp 2M' (M' = Co, Ni) which converted to Co(0)/nickel(0) colloidal nanoparticles, produced poly(alkoxysilane)s in one-pot in high yield. The hydrosilanes include p-X-C 6H 4SiH 3 (X = H, CH 3, OCH 3, F), PhCH 2SiH 3, and (PhSiH 2) 2. The alcohols include MeOH, EtOH, 'PrOH, PhOH, and CF 3(CF 2) 2CH 2OH. The weight average molecular weight of the poly(alkoxysilane)s were in the range of 600 to 8100. The dehydrocoupling reactions of phenylsilane with ethanol (1:3 mole ratio) in the presence of the nanocolloid catalyst gave only triethoxyphenylsilane as product Copyright Â© 2010 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.
