The chiral ansa metallocenes trans-(11R,12R)-bis-(η5-cyclopentadienylmethyl)-dibenzobicyclo-(2.2.2]octano-iron(II) (6) and trans(11R,12R)-bis-(η5-cyclopentadienylmethyl)dibenzobicyclo-[2.2.2]-octano-titanium(IV) dichloride (8) have been prepared from the dilithium salt of trans-(11R,12R)-bis-(cyclopentadienyl-methyl)-9,10-dihydro-9,10-ethanoanthracene (4) by reaction with FeCl2 and TiCl4, respectively. Oxidation of the ferrocene derivative (6) with NOBF4 gave trans-(11R,12R)-bis-(η5-cyclopentadienylmethyl)-dibenzo-bicyclo-[2.2.2]octano-iron(III) tetrafluoroborate (7) which catalyzes the Diels-Alder reaction of methacrylaldehyde with cyclopentadiene giving high diastereo- but modest enantio-selectivity. © 1993.
