(1,2,5,6-Tetramethyl-3,4-dimethylenetricyclo[3.1.0.02,6]hexane)zirconocene (2a), prepared by irradiation of diene la and diphenylzirconocene, and (2,3-dimethylenebicyclo[2.2.1]heptane)zirconocene (2b), obtained by reduction of zirconocene dichloride with lithium in the presence of 2,3-dimethylenenorbornane (lb), both react with carbon monoxide under displacement of the conjugated diene forming zirconocene dicarbonyl. Envelope-shaped σ2, Π-type structures were found for the diene zirconocene units in X-ray diffraction studies of both complexes. 2a crystallizes in space group P1 (Z = 4) with cell constants o = 8.578 (2) Å, b = 14.466 (3) Å, c = 15.717 (1) Å, α = 75.00 (1)°, β = 88.566 (8)° γ, and y = 89.12 (2)° (7110 observed reflections, R = 0.035). Compound 2b crystallizes in space group PI (Z = 2) with cell constants a = 7.4540 (7) Å, b = 8.8377 (8) Å, c = 11.8934 (7) Å, α = 84.704 (5)°, β = 88.922 (5)°, and γ = 79.765 (7)° (3165 observed reflections, R = 0.021). Comparison of the molecular geometries of (diene)zirconocenes 2a, b, d, e and the zirconaindan 3 reveals a continuously increasing metallacyclopentene character. In this series the reactivity of 2a and 2b toward carbon monoxide is markedly less influenced by ground-state effects as compared with that of 2d, 2e, and 3. © 1984, American Chemical Society.
