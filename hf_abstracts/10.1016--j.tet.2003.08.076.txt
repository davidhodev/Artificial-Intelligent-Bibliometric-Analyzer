Cationic metallocene species, generated from Cp2MCl2 and AgClO4 (M=Zr, Hf), were used for the glycosylation of catechin derivative 2, enabling a concise synthesis of a glycosyl flavonoid, astilbin (1). Further study revealed the efficiency of this Lewis acidic species for SN1-type activation of the C(4) position of catechin derivative 11, enabling selective substitution with various nucleophiles.
