Kinetic studies have been performed for the substitution of the first silyl ligand in (Me2N)3Ta[Si(SiMe3) 3]2 (1) by Li(THF)3SiButPh 2 at 233 K (THF = tetrahydrofuran). In the presence of excess Li(THF)3SiButPh2, these studies reveal that the reaction likely follows a dissociative pathway. THF, a polar solvent, is found to promote the substitution, and the order of the reaction with respect to THF is 1.7(0.3). Â© 2007 American Chemical Society.
