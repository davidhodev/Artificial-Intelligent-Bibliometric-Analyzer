Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy is used to measure the DNA-metal binding of the antitumor agents Cp2TiCI2, Cp2VCl2, Cp2NbCI2, and cis-(H3N)2PtCl2 and of Cp2ZrCl2 and Cp2HfCl2 in 10 or 110 mM sodium perchlorate with an initial phosphorus to metal ratio of 10:1. All the metals of these complexes bind DNA except vanadium from vanadocene dichloride. There is no release of metal when isolated DNA-metal adduct is dissolved in fresh 10 mM sodium perchlorate for up to 48 h. DNA binding studies using 3H-labeled titanocene dichloride are consistent with a DNA-Cp2Ti adduct at pH 5.3 and a DNA-CpTi adduct at pH 7.0 A DNA-titanium adduct is also formed from CpTiCl3 and DNA in 10 mM sodium perchlorate with an initial phosphorus to metal ratio of 20:1.
