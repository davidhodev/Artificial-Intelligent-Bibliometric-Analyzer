Cationic (C5H4R)2ZrAr+ aryl species (2a-d: R = H; Ar = o-tolyl (a), 2-Me-4-F-C6H3 (b), 3-F-C6H4 (c), Ph (d); 2e: R = Me, Ar = Ph) are generated by the reaction of a 1:1 mixture of (C5H4R) 2ZrAr2 and (C5H4R) 2ZrMe2 with 2 equiv of [CPh3][B(C 6F5)4] via methide abstraction and ligand exchange steps. Complex 2d and the Cp2HfAr+ analogues (2f,g: Ar = o-tolyl (f), Ph (g)) are generated by the reaction Of Cp 2MAr2 with [C6Me6H] [B (C 6F5)4]. NMR studies suggest that these metallocene aryl cations exist as (C5H4R) 2M(Ar)(RCl)+ solvent adducts in chlorocarbon solution. NMR and DFT studies show that the (C5H4R)2Zr(Ar) (RCl)+ species contain β-C-H-Zr agostic interactions involving an ortho-aryl hydrogen. The "endo" isomers, in which the β-agostic interaction occupies the central coordination site, are ca. 5 kcal/mol more stable than the "exo" isomers, in which the β-agostic interaction occupies a lateral site. The aryl agostic interactions are weaker for Hf than Zr, and Cp2Hf(Ph)(C 6D5Cl)+ (2g·C6D 5Cl) does not contain an agostic interaction. © 2007 American Chemical Society.
