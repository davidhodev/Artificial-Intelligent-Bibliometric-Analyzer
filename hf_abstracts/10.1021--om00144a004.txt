Reactions of the isodicyclopentadienide anion with TiCl3in tetrahydrofuran at 25 °C, with ZrCl4in dimethoxyethane at reflux for 70 h, and with HfCl4in dimethoxyethane (reflux, 100 h) have been performed in order to assess the x-facial stereoselectivity of complexation to group 4 transition metals. In all three instances, a single complex was isolated. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the titanocene and zirconocene dichlorides demonstrate both to be the result of dual coordination to the exo surfaces. By NMR 1H comparison, the hafnocene is shown to be closely similar and therefore of the same stereochemistry. The three-dimensional features of the complexes are discussed. © 1987, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
