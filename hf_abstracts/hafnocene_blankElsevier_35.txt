As a discovery of C - C coupling and amine elimination reaction by treatment of 6-dimethylamino-6-methylfulvene with zirconium tetrachloride, experiments using amino-substituted benzofulvene 1a or aminopentafulvene 2a, instead of 6-dimethylamino-6-methylfulvene, gave bis [1-(dimethylamino)ethenyl-indenyl]zirconium dichloride 1c which was characterized by X-ray diffraction as monoclinic, space group C2/c, a = 2. 028 8(4) nm, b=0. 981 7(2) nm, c=1.458 9(3) nm, β= 115. 73(3)°, V=2. 617 5(9) nm 3 , Z=4, R= 0. 072 3, and bis[(1-methyl-4,5-dihydro-2-pyrrolnyl)cyclopentadienyl ] zirconium dichloride 2c as triclinic, space group P1, a = 0. 807 49 (16) nm, b = 0. 943 40(19) nm, c=1.423 8(3) nm, α=91. 04(3), β=97.41 (3), γ=106. 68(3)°, V=1. 028 6(4) nm 3 , Z=2, R=0. 080 0.
