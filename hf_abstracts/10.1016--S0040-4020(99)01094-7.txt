The regioselectivity of insertion of lithium chloroallylides (allyl carbenoids) into a wide variety of unsymmetrical zirconacycles has been determined. In all but one case a single regioisomer was obtained. A combination of steric and electronic effects is needed to explain the results and imply that the carbenoid is acting predominantly as an electrophilic species. The first carbenoid insertion into a zirconacyclopentadiene is noted. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.
