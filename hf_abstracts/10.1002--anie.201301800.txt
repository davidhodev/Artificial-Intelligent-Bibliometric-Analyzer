N2 shuffle: One-electron reduction of the ansa-zirconocene complex with a side-on dinitrogen ligand furnished the corresponding anion in which the hapticity of the N2 ligand changed to end-on. Oxidation of the anion regenerates the neutral complex with concomitant change in N 2 hapticity. The zirconocene complexes with unusual (N 2)3-/(N2)- ligands have been fully characterized.
