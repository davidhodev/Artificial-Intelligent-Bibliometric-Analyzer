The group 4 metallocenes were then reacted with methylaluminoxane-functionalised silica (SSMAO) to afford silica supported catalysts. A mixture of rac- and meso-(3-EtInd#)2ZrCl2supported on SSMAO demonstrated an initial polymerisation activity of 250 kgPE/molM/h/bar. At 70 °C, using rac-(3-EtInd#)2ZrCl2, solution phase polymerisation activities were twenty times faster than slurry phase polymerisation using SSMAO-rac-(3-EtInd#)2ZrCl2(1243 and 75 kgPE/molZr/h/bar respectively).
