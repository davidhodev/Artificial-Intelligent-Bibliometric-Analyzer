Â© 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.The UV spectral study of the interaction of titanium, zirconium, and hafnium metallocene dichlorides with styrene or methyl methacrylate in the media of different polarity (carbon tetrachloride and ethanol) has been carried out using the isomolar series method. The formation of weak intermediate complexes has been shown, the solvent polarity significantly affecting the process of their formation. It has been found for the first time that charge-transfer complexes between metallocene dichlorides and styrene are formed only in polar solvent (ethanol). Possible structures of intermediate complexes have been proposed.
