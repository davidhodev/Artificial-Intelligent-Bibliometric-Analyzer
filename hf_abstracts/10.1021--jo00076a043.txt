(Butadiene)zirconocene (4) was reacted with 2 mol equiv of pivalonitrile to give the nine-membered metallacyclic product 5. 1,4-Selective coupling of butadiene with the two nitrile functionalities was achieved at the zirconocene template. Subsequent hydrolytic cleavage (H2O/THF) gave (3Z,5E,7Z)-3,8-diamino-2,2,9,9-tetramethyldeca-3,5,7-triene (13). The stable conjugated primary enamine 13 was isolated in 54% yield. It was characterized by an X-ray crystal structure analysis. Compound 13 crystallizes in space group Pbca with cell parameters a = 6.343(1), b = 23.471(3), c = 10.025(1) Å, Z = 4, R = 0.052, Rw = 0.059. Analogously, coupling of two 4-methylbenzonitrile molecules with butadiene at the zirconocene template followed by hydrolysis yielded l,6-diamino-1,6-di-p-tolyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (6b). Compound 6b crystallizes in space group P21/a with cell parameters a = 12.778(8), b = 4.722(1), c = 14.203(5) Å, β = 110.6(1)°, Z = 2, R = 0.043, Rw = 0.049. Both primary enamines contain planar conjugated polyene frameworks with alternating carbon-carbon double and single bonds. The geometries at the sp2−CNH2 groups of the stable conjugated primary enamines 6b and 13 are very similar as observed in aromatic amines. It was shown by ab initio calculation of suitable model systems on the MP2/6–31+G*//6–31+G* level that the conjugated tail-to-tail connection of two CH═C(NH2)H primary enamine moieties results in an unfavorable repulsive electron interaction which may become effectively compensated when the conjugated system separating the NH2 substituents is sufficiently extended as is the case in the frameworks found in 6 or 13. Therefore, some development of the chemistry of stable, isolable primary enamines may be based on suitably substituted 1,6-diamino-1,3,5-hexatriene systems which will be easily available by our novel template synthesis. © 1993, American Chemical Society.
