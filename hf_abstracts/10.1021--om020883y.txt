Reduction of [ZrCl2{η5-C5Me4(SiMe3 )}2] (1) with excess magnesium in tetrahydrofuran affords a mixture of the monomeric zirconocene hydride [ZrH{η1:η5-C5Me4- (SiMe2CH2)}{η5-C5Me4( SiMe3)}] (2) and the dimeric, tetranuclear Zr(III)- and Zr(IV)-magnesium hydride complexes 3 and 4, respectively. In the presence of bis(trimethylsilyl)ethyne (btmse), a similar reduction yields the η2-alkyne complex [Zr{η5-C5Me4(SiMe3)}2 - (η2-btmse)] (5) as the major product and compounds 2-4 as minor impurities. Upon thermolysis under vacuum, 5 undergoes a 2-fold hydrogen transfer from trimethylsilyl groups in the zirconocene intermediate to leaving btmse to afford [Zr{η5:η1-C5Me4 (SiMe2CH2)}- 2] (6) and a mixture of alkenes (E)- and (Z)-Me3SiCH=CHSiMe3 (E ≫ Z). Crystal structures of compounds 2 and 4-6 were determined by X-ray crystallography.
