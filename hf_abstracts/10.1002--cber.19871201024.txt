Synthesis of a Heteroatom‐Stabilized Rhodiumcarbene Complex by Reaction of CpRh(CO)2 with (Butadiene)zirconocene (η4‐Butadiene)zirconocene reacts at room temperature in toluene with CpRh(CO)2 to give the metallacyclic [(π‐allyl)zirconoxy]rhodium carbene complex Cp2Zr(C4H6)(OC)Rh(CO)Cp 5. The structure of 5 was determined by X‐ray analysis. The Rh‐carbene unit Cp(CO)RhC(R)OM is almost planar, featuring the O[Zr] and Cp groups in a Z orientation at the RhC moiety [dRhC(carbene) = 1.925(3) Å].
