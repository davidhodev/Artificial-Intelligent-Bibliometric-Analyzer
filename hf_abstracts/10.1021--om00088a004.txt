The (1,3-pentadiene)zirconocene complex and its higher homologues of the type (η5-C5H5)2Zr(CR1-(CH3)==CR2CR3=CR4H) were prepared by reaction of (η5-C5H5)2ZrHCl with alkyl-substituted or nonsubstituted pentadienyl anions through novel σ-π rearrangement of hydrido-2,4-pentadienylzirconium species. The 1H NMR studies on these complexes revealed that the 1,3-pentadiene and 2,4-hexadiene complexes are composed of ca. 1:1 mixture of s-cis and s-trans isomers while each of the complexes containing 2-methyl-1,3-pentadiene, 3-methyl-1,3-pentadiene, 2,4-dimethyl-1,3-pentadiene, 1-(trimethylsilyl)-1,3- pentadiene, and 1,5-bis(trimethylsilyl)-1,3-pentadiene ligands consists of a single isomer of s-cis structure. The process of hydrogen transfer was elucidated on the basis of the analysis of the stoichiometric reaction between (η5-C5H5)2ZrDCl and (2-methylpentadienyl)potassium. The reaction of (η5-C5H5)2Zr (2,4-hexadiene) with 1-alkenes or 2-butyne showed that the coordinated diene is easily expelled to give zirconacyclopentanes or a zirconacyclopentadiene derivative, respectively. The addition of butanal or 3-pentanone resulted in double insertion into the 2,4-hexadiene moiety to selectively afford 3-hexene-1,6-diols through hydrolysis. © 1984, American Chemical Society.
