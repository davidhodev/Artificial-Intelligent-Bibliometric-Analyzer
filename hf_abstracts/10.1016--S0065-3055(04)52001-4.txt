"From Obscurity to Applications" was the subtitle of the Piers and Chivers 1997 Chem. Soc. Rev. article highlighting the chemistry of perfluoroaryl boranes.2b The discovery that B(C6F5)3 is an effective co-catalyst for olefin polymerization processes has led to the proverbial explosion of research activity in its chemistry and that of its derivatives. The unique properties of B(C6F5)3 (thermal and hydrolytic stability coupled with strong Lewis acidity) have led to extensive applications in widely varying areas of chemistry. Most of what has been discussed above has focused on applications as Lewis acids, but emerging applications such as anion transport additives in lithium batteries273 suggest even broader utility for this remarkable class of compounds. As B(C6F5)3 and its derivatives become more broadly available, this should continue to be an active area of research. Â© 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
