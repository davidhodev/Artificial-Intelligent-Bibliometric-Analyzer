1,1-Dicyclopentadienyltitanaindan (1) reacts with isocyanides (RNC) to give cyclic iminoacyl complexes 2 (R = t-Bu) and 5a—e (R = p-R'C6H4, R' = Et2N, MeO, Me, H, and Cl) where the isocyanide has inserted into the Ti-CH2 bond. The X-ray crystal structure of 2 has been determined. Complex 2 crystallizes in a monoclinic space group P21 with a = 14.353(1), b = 8.556(2), c = 15.652(2) Å; β = 88.95(5); and Z = 4. Compounds 2 and 5a—e decompose in solution with formation of imines and paramagnetic Ti species. The decomposition follows first-order kinetics, with ΔG* = 24.5 ± 0.2 Kcal mol, ΔH‡ = 24.3 ± 0.2 Kcal mol, and ΔS* = -0.4 ± 2 eu in the case of 2. The rate of imine elimination depends on the nature of the substituent on the nitrogen atom, higher rates are observed for electron-withdrawing substituents (Hammet ϱ= +1.59 ± 0.04 for 5a—e), and the rate is little affected by the solvent or by the presence of PMe3. These results are consistent with a concerted reductive elimination mechanism that initially leads to an unstable η-imine complex which subsequently converts to the observed products. © 1995, American Chemical Society.
