A series of 3,4-dialkylcyclopentanones was synthesized by template reactions on the "Cp 2 Zr" moiety generated from Cp 2 Zr(2,4-hexadiene) or Cp 2 Zr(olefin) complexes by ligand exchange reactions. The addition of a 1-olefin or 1,7-octadiene to the Cp 2 Zr species followed by CO insertion and acid hydrolysis gave a cis- or trans-disubstituted cyclopentanone in high yield. Â© 1991.
