The first acetylene complex of hafnium, Cp 2 Hf[Me 3 SiCa≡CHf(H)Cp 2 ], was synthesized by the reaction of hafnocene dihydride Cp 2 HfH 2 with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene in benzene. The reaction is accompanied by elimination of the Me 3 Si group from the molecule of the initial acetylene, as a result of which the acetylenide derivative of hafnium Cp 2 Hf(C≡CSiMe 3 )(H) acts as an acetylene ligand in the complex. Under analogous conditions, the reaction of zirconocene dihydride Cp 2 ZrH 2 with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene affords an analogous acetylene complex of zirconium Cp 2 Zr[M 3 SiC≡CZr(H)Cp 2 ]. Reactions of Cp 2 HfH 2 with tolane and 3-hexyne proceed differently than the reaction with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene. Here the corresponding hafnacyclopentadiene metallacycles are the final products.
