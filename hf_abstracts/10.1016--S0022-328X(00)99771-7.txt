Diphenylmetallocene complexs (RCp)2ZrPh2 (4a, 4b: RH, CH3) react with the phosphorous ylide Ph3PCHCH3 (5) at 80°C to yield six-membered metallocyclic ylides (RCp)2ZrCH2CHP(Ph)2(C6H4) (8a,8b) plus two equivalents of benzene. The reaction presumably proceeds through a thermally generated (η2-benzyne) zirconocene intermediate which takes up 5 to form a metallocene ylide (RCp)2Zr(Ph)C(CH3)PPh3 (6). β-Hydride elimination and readdition followed by ortho-metallation then leads to the six-membered metallacycle. Complexes 8 have a stable chiral ground state geometry as judged by NMR spectroscopy. The presence of a distorted Cp2Zr (phospha-allyl) moiety is suggested to explain theobserved characteristic spectroscopic features of the metallacyclic ylides 8. © 1987.
