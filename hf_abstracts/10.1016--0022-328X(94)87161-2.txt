Two series of Group 4 bent metallocene complexes bearing cholestanol-derived substituents at their Cp-rings have been prepared. 5α-Cholestan-3 α-ol was converted to the 3α-mesylate. Nucleophilic substitution with CpNa, followed by deprotonation and treatment with ZrCl4(THF)2 gave bis[η5-(5α-cholestan-3β-yl)cyclopentadienyl]zirconium dichloride 3β-5. 5α-Cholestan-3-one 6 was converted to the corresponding fulvene, methyl lithium was added and deprotonation and addition to ZrCl4(THF)2 furnished bis[η5-(3β-methyl- 5α-cholestan-3α-yl)cyclopentadienyl]zirconium dichloride (11b). Treatment of the chiral Cp-substituted zirconocene dichlorides with a large excess of methyl alumoxane gave homogeneous Ziegler catalysts. Propene polymerization proceeded with overall stereochemical chain end control to give partly isotactic polypropylene. © 1994.
