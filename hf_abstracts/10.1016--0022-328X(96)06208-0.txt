The methylzirconocene cation [Cp 2 ZrCH 3 (THF) + BPh 4 - ] reacts with Cp 2 Zr(Cl)(C≡C-R) reagents (5a-c, R=-CH 2 Ph,-CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 ,-CH 3 ) to yield the dinuclear metallocene cations [(Cp 2 Zr) 2 (μ-Cl)(μ-η 2 : η 2 -RCCCH 3 ] + (6a-c) (with BPh 4 - anion) that contain a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom. Complex 6b was characterized by X-ray diffraction. The activation energy of the degenerate rearrangement of 6c was determined by temperature dependent dynamic 1 H NMR spectroscopy (ΔG‡(240 K) = 11.3 ± 0.5 kcal mol - 1 ).
