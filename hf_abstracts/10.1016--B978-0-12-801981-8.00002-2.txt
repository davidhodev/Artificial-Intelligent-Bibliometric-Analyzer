All rights reserved.This section reviews recent achievements regarding the metal complexes with an Si-M single bond between transition metals and silyl ligands as well as the related compounds. The number of the reports of late transition metal complexes having tridentate Si-ligands and pincer-type structures, has been increased significantly because of their unique reactivity. Multinuclear late transition metal complexes with silyl ligands also exhibit the chemical properties that differ from those of the mononuclear metal complexes. Major early transition metal complexes having an Si-ligand have the metallocene structures, while half-sandwich complexes and cyclopentadienyl ligand-free complexes show similar chemical properties to the metallocenes. Detailed studies were conducted on the bonding and structure of the early transition metal complexes having Si- and hydride ligands.
