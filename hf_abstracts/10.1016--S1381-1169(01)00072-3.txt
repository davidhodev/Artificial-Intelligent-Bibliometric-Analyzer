Investigations were carried out on the oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides catalyzed by the commercial Cp2Ti(X)2 (X=Cl, Otf)/t-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). The asymmetric version of prochiral sulfides oxidation was achieved using Cp2TiCl2, as transition metal catalyst, in the presence of (+)-(R)-BINOL, as chiral ligand and activated 4 Å molecular sieves (m.s.). © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.
