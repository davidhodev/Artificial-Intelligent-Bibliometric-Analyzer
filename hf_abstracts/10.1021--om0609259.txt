The complexes Cp2Hf(PMe3)(η2-Me 3SiC2SiMe3) (3) and Cp* 2Hf(η2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) (4), as the first examples of well-defined hafnium alkyne complexes with a simple intact alkyne, are described; 4 displays an unusually strong interaction of the alkyne with hafnium, in comparison to analogous compounds of titanium and zirconium. © 2007 American Chemical Society.
