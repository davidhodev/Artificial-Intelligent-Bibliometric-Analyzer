The five-coordinate zirconocene dichloride PhP(CH2CH 2-η5-C5H4)2ZrC12 (3), containing a tethered bis(cyclopentadienyl)-phosphine ligand, was prepared by treating a tetrahydrofuran solution of ZrC14(thf)2 with Li2[PhP(CH2CH2C5H4)2]. An X-ray crystal structure analysis confirmed the phosphorus atom to be coordinated to the zirconium metal center. Dissolution of 3 in wet methanol followed by evaporation of the solvent yielded the crystallographically characterized cationic chloroaqua complex [PhP(CH2CH2-η5-C5H4)2ZrC1(H2O)]+ as the chloride salt (4). Treatment of an aqueous solution of 3 with excess thiocyanate gave a good yield of the bis(isothiocyanato) complex PhP(CH2CH2-η5-C5H4)2Zr(NCS)2 (7), the structure of which was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. © 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.
