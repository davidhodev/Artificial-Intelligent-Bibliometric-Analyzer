Zirconocene dichloride reacts with 2 molar equiv of (2-furyl)lithium to give bis(2-furyl)zirconocene (1a). The (σ-furyl)zirconocene complexes Cp2ZrR(2-furyl) (R = CH3, Ph, SiMe3) were similarly prepared by treatment of the respective Cp2Zr(R)Cl complexes with (2-furyl)lithium. Cp2Zr(SiMe3)(2-thienyl) was obtained from the reaction of Cp2Zr(SiMe3)Cl with (2-thienyl)lithium. The Cp2ZrR(2-furyl) complexes with R = 2-furyl, methyl, or phenyl all undergo an intramolecular high-temperature (≥180 °C),σ, σ-exchange reaction to give the oxazirconacyclohexadienes [formula omitted] (2a-c). The 1a →2a rearrangement follows first-order kinetics in the temperature range 140-180 °C and is characterized by the activation parameters ΔH‡ = 30.9 ± 2.0 kcal mol−1 and ΔS‡ = -9 ± 5 cal mol−1 K−1. The complexes Cp2Zr(SiMe3)(2-furyl) (1d) and Cp2Zr(SiMe3)(2-thienyl) (1e) undergo the analogous dyotropic rearrangements much faster. The 1d → 2d isomerization is fast at 0 °C and already takes place during the formation of 1d from Cp2Zr(SiMe3)Cl and (2-furyl)lithium. The activation parameters of the 1e → 2e ring enlargement reaction of the (2-thienyl)metallocene system are ΔH‡ = 20.4 ± 2.0 kcal mol−1 and ΔS‡ = -12 ± 5 cal mol−1 K−1. The oxa- and thiazirconacyclohexadienes [formula omitted] (X = O, 2d; X = S, 2e) were characterized by X-ray diffraction. Complex 2d crystallizes in space group PI with cell parameters a = 9.783 (1) Å, b = 11.514 (1) Å, c = 15.806 (1) Å, α = 96.27 (1)°, β = 101.64 (1)°, γ = 98.89 (1)°, Z = 4,R = 0.037, and Rw = 0.053. Complex 2e crystallizes in space group Cc with cell parameters a = 13.988 (4) Å, b = 30.774 (2) Å, c = 9.788 (4) Å,β = 122.93 (1)°, Z = 8, R = 0.034, and Rw = 0.035. Both chalcogenazirconacyclohexadienes are monomeric in the solid state and exhibit nonplanar metallacyclic conformations with the metal-chalcogen vectors rotated significantly relative to the planes of the endocyclic conjugated diene moieties. © 1992, American Chemical Society.
