Conjugated dienes can be initially converted to their zirconocene complexes most conveniently by their reaction with (C5H5) 2ZrCl2 and freshly ground Mg; the resultant complexes can then be protonolysed with 3 mol dm-3 HCl to give regioselectively monoenes corresponding to partial hydrogenation of the more highly substituted double bond.
