The reaction of zirconium and hafnium tetrachlorides with tris(trimethylsilyl)cyclopentadiene affords the monocyclopentadienyl complexes (l,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)cyclopentadienyl)zirconium trichloride (1, 73%) and (1,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)cyclopentadienyl)hafnium trichloride (2, 76%) in good isolated yields. The reaction of 1 with (1,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)cyclopentadienyl)lithium affords 1,1′,3,3′-tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)zirconocene dichloride (74%). In contrast to the preparations of 1 and 2, reaction of bis(trimethylsilyl)cyclopentadiene with zirconium and hafnium tetrachlorides affords l,l′-bis(trimethylsilyl)zirconocene dichloride (5, 73%) and l,l’-bis(trimethylsilyl)hafnocene dichloride (6, 76%). The reaction of (trimethylsilyl)cyclopentadiene with zirconium and hafnium tetrachlorides affords zirconocene dichloride (7, 91%) and hafnocene dichloride (8, 90%). The intermediacy of monocyclopentadienyl species in the preparation of the metallocene dichlorides is supported by the reaction of cyclopentadienylzirconium trichloride with (trimethylsilyl)cyclopentadiene to afford 7 (85%). Reaction of zirconium tetrachloride with 1 equiv of (trimethylsilyl)cyclopentadiene at 0 °C for 0.5 h affords 7 and cyclopentadienylzirconium trichloride in a (69 ± 2):(31 ± 2) ratio. The silyl group regiochemistry in 1 and 2 was established through an X-ray crystal structure determination of the titanium analogue (1,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)cyclopentadienyl)titanium trichloride (3). Complex 3 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbnm with a = 7.459 (3) Å, b = 11.799 (3) Å, c = 20.535 (3) Å, V = 1807.1 (9) Å3, and Z = 4. © 1991, American Chemical Society.
