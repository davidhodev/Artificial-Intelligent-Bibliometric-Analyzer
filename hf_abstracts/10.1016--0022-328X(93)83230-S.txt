The titanium(II) adducts Ti[Me2Si(η5-C5H4)2]L2 [L CO (1), PMe2Ph (2), CNR (R = 2,6-Me2C6H3) (3) have been made by the reduction of Ti[Me2Si(η5-C5H4)2]Cl2 with HhCl2-activated magnesium in THF in the presence of the ligand L. Mixed titanocene adducts Ti[Me2Si(η5- C5H4)2]LL′ (L CO; L′ PMe2Ph (4), CNR (5)) can be prepared by the addition of ligands (PMe2Ph, CNR) to hexane solutions of Ti[Me2Si(η5-C5H4)2)(CO)2 exposed to sunlight. The crystal structure of 3 has been determined by X-ray diffraction; the phenyl groups of the isocyanide ligand are almost perpendicular to the reflection plane of the cyclopentadienyl groups. © 1993.
