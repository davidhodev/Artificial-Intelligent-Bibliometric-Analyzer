The pattern of organ toxicity after single injections of the antitumor agent titanocene dichloride (TDC) in ED90 (40 mg/kg) and LD10 (60 mg/kg) doses to female mice was investigated by analyzing various blood chemical parameters and the composition of urine at intervals between 30 min and 16 days after administration. Whereas the serum levels of electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total bilirubin and cholesterol did not alter, marked and simultaneous increases in serum concentrations of the enzymes GLDH, GOT and GPT occurred pointing to cellular damage within liver parenchyma; these lesions were apparently reversible within 8 and 16 days after application of TDC even at the LD10 dose. Moreover, glucose concentration decreased immediately after TDC administration, obviously stimulating a regulative output of glucagon and cortisol; these effects were also reversible within 4 to 8 days after TDC administration. No hints to nephrotoxicity induced by TDC became manifest in the present study. Â© 1986 Springer-Verlag.
