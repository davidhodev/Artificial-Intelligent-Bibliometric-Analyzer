Examination of the reaction of [Cp2Zr(n-octyl)2](2) with D2C=CH-n-hexyl or styrene in the presence of PMe3 by NMR spectroscopy rules out dissociative mechanisms for the conversion of (2) into alkene-ZrCp2-PMe3 complexes involving free ZrCp 2 and supports non-dissociative mechanisms (Cp = cyclopentadienyl).
