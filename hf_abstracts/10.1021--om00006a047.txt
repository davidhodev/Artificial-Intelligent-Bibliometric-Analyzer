Anti van't Hoff/le Bel compound 1 consisting of titanocene tolan and diethylborane units reacts with ethene, acetylenes, phosphaacetylenes, and acetone to give metallacycles 2, 3, 6, and 7, and in most cases the corresponding diethylorganylboranes are formed by hydroboration of the carbon-carbon or carbon—heteroatom multiple bond in the substrate. With nitriles the new bimetallic systems 9a-c (X-ray structure available for 9a) with titanium and boron centers and 12 containing zirconium and aluminium centers are generated by the formal insertion of the nitrile into the B-Cplanar bond of 1 or the Al-Cplanar bond of 11. © 1995, American Chemical Society.
