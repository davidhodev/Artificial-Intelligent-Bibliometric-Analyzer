By the reaction of silyl anions with Group 4 metallocene dichlorides, a number of new Group 4 oligosilyl compounds have been synthesized. The silyl residues employed include the popular tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl group and sterically more encumbered derivatives. For the cases of the tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl group both the mono and the disilylated products were obtained. Â© 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
