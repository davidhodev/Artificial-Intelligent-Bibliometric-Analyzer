Hydrogenolysis of (M(CH3)2) (M = Zr, Hf) bonds gives new racemic and optically active substituted zirconocene and hafnocene dihydrides A: (RCp)2MH2 (M = Zr, Hf; R = Me, Me2CH, Me3C, PhCH2) and B: (R*Cp)2MH2 (M = Zr, Hf; R* = MeCHEtCH2, PhCHEtCH2), R*CpCpHfH2 R* = PhCHCH3). Substitution of hydridic hydrogens by halogens, mobile hydrogen compounds, addition with unsaturated derivatives are studied. The A and B type complexes are good catalysts in hydrogenation of alkenes; the B type complexes give only poor asymmetric induction in catalytic reduction of prochiral alkenes.
