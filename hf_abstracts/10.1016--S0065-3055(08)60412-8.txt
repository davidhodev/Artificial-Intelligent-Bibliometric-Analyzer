This chapter discusses the remarkable features of (η4-conjugated fiene) zirconocene and –hafnocene complexes. (η4-conjugated diene) transition-metal complexes are important as starting materials or reactive intermediates in many catalytic processes. They play an increasingly important role as stoichiometric substrates or reagents in organic synthesis. Group IV metallocenes readily form 1: l complexes with conjugated dienes in their s-trans conformation. Many (η4-diene) metallocenes of conjugated dienes, fixed in their s-cis conformation by a rigid carbon framework, have been obtained in high yields. Inner and outer methylene hydrogens appear as doublets at sufficiently low temperature. A hypsochromic shift is observed for long-wave absorption band on going from 5a to 3a. The diene moiety (plane C1, C2, C3, C4) of the ligands remains essentially planar. All four carbon atoms of the conjugated diene skeleton are clearly within bonding distance of the zirconium center. Isomeric (s-cis- and (s-trans-η4-conjugated diene)zirconocene and –hafnocene complexes exhibit pronounced differences in their characteristic structural data as well as their spectroscopic features. By the nature of its molecular mechanism, carbonyl-insertion reaction represents a typical reaction mode ofσ–alkyl transition-metal complexes. The pronounced alkyl metal character of (s-cis-butadiene)zirconocene should make the diene ligand in 5a much more amenable to electrophilic attack than in the isomeric (s-trans-η4-butadiene)ZrCp2 (3a). The (conjugated-diene)zirconocene and –hafnocene systems are unique in that three isomeric organometallic species can be distinguished by physical and/or chemical means. © 1985, Elsevier Inc.
