Host-guest interactions between α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrins and vanadocene dichloride (Cp2VCI2) have been investigated by a combination of thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction and solid-state and solution electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The solid-state results demonstrated that only β- and γ-cyclodextrins form 1 : 1 inclusion complexes, while α-cyclodextrin does not form an inclusion complex with Cp2VCl2. The β-and γ-CD-Cp2VCl 2 inclusion complexes exhibited anisotropic electron-51 V (l = 7/2) hyperfine coupling constants whereas the α-CD-Cp 2VCl2 system showed only an asymmetric peak with no anisotropic hyperfine constant. On the other hand, solution EPR spectroscopy showed that α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) may be involved in weak host-guest interactions in equilibrium with free vanadocene species.
