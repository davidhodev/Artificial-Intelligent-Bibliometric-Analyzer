© 2018 Elsevier LtdAn air-stable mononuclear complex of bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium pentafluorbezenesulfonate was successfully synthesized by treating C6F5SO3Ag with [(CH3)5Cp]2ZrCl2, which showed the cationic uninuclear structure of [{(CH3)5Cp}2Zr(CH3CN)2(H2O)][OSO2C6F5]2·CH3CN (1) confirmed by the X-ray analysis. Complex 1 was also characterized by other techniques and found to have the good nature of air-stability, water tolerance, thermally-stability and strong Lewis-acidity. Moreover, the complex showed high catalytic activity and recyclability in catalytic epoxide ring-opening reactions by amines or alcohols. This catalytic system affords a simple and efficient approach for synthesis of β-amino alcohols or β-alkoxy alcohols.
