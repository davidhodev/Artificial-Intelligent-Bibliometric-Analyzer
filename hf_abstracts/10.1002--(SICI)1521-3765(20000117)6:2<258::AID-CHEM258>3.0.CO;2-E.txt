Treatment of the (C6F5)2BF OEt2 (3) complex with N-pyrrolyl lithium gives bis(pentafluorophenyl)(N-pyrrolyl)borane (2), a strong organometallic Lewis acid, which was characterized by X-ray diffraction (B-N bond length: 1.401(5) Å). It exhibits a columnar superstructure in the crystal and contains π-stacks of pyrrolyl units. Compound 2 readily abstracts alkyl anions from a variety of alkyl Group 4 metallocene-type complexes and leads to the clean formation of the respective metallocene ions or ion pairs. For example, the treatment of Cp3ZrCH3 (9) with 2 transfers a methyl anion to yield the ion pair [Cp3Zr]+[(C4H4N)B(CH 3)(C6F5)2]- (12). The X-ray crystal structure analysis of 12 shows a close contact between zirconium and the pyrrolyl-β-carbon (2.641(2) Å). The borane 2 adds to (butadiene)zirconocene (13) to yield the betaine system [Cp2Zr]+ [(C4H6)B-(NC4H4)(C6F 5)2]- (15). Complex 15 contains a distorted η3-allyl moiety inside the metallacyclic framework and it features an internal Zr+ ⋯ (pyrrolyl)B- ion pair interaction with a Zr ⋯ pyrrolyl-α-carbon separation of 2.723(3) Å (determined by X-ray diffraction). From the dynamic NMR spectra of 15 the bond strength of the internal ion pair interaction was estimated to be ΔG≠diss (223 K) ≈ 15 kcal mol-1. Treatment of dimethylzirconocene (16) with 2 yields the metallocene borate salt [Cp2ZrCH3]+[(C4H 4N)B(CH3)(C6F5)2] - (17), which is an active catalyst for the polymerization of ethene.
