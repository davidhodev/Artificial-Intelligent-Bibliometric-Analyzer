Reaction of Schwartz's reagent [Cp2ZrHCl]n (1) (one or two equivalents) with gem-dinitrile compounds of the type X(CN)2 [X = CMe2, CBenz2, P(NiPr2)2] gives the corresponding mono- and di-N-zirconated imino complexes selectively. Substitution reactions of the zirconocene metal fragment with electrophiles such as, for example, chlorophosphanes of the type R2PCl, acid chlorides RC(O)Cl or the iminium salt [CH2NMe2]Cl allowed the preparation of a large variety of stable N-functionalized mono- and β-diimine derivatives. The nature of the X group is of particular importance for the success of the substitution reaction step. The X-ray crystal structures obtained for the N-functionalized gem-aldiminonitrile compounds 9, 10b, the N-phosphorylated β-diimine 32, and the gem-formyl nitrile derivative 12b are presented.
