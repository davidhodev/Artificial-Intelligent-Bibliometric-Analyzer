Thermolysis of zirconocene dicarbonyl at 50°C in toluene in the presence of an equimolar amount of trimethylphosphite produced dark green crystals of Cp2Zr(CO)[P(OCH3)3] (5) in about 50% isolated yield. 5 was characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy (v(CO) 1849 cm-1) and by an X-ray crystal structure analysis. 5 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1 with cell constants a 8.351(1), b 14.347(2), c 14.876(1) Å, α 68.256(5), β 75.978(5), and γ 85.87(1)°; Z = 4. Characteristic bond distances (for the two crystallographically independent molecules) are ZrCO 2.153(4), 2.167(5); CO 1.164(5), 1.149(7); ZrP 2.630(1), 2.619(1) Å. Spectroscopic parameters of 5 are compared with those of 34 Group IV metallocene carbonyl complexes described in the literature. © 1986.
