The electron ionization mass spectrometric behaviour of a new series of hafnocene and zirconocene diadamantanolates is discussed. They are also compared on the basis of mass‐analyzed ion kinetic energy spectrometry. Fragmentation patterns of the complexes in question give relevant information on their gas‐phase behaviour as MO2/MC (M = Zr, Hf) precursors for metal‐organic chemical vapour deposition.
