Fulvenes (1a-e) derived from condensation of cyclopentadiene with acetone or a variety of aldehydes were treated with LiPAr2 (Ar=phenyl, p-tolyl) to yield the respective substituted (diarylphosphinomethyl)cyclopentadienides (2, 3). Subsequent reaction with ZrCl4 (THF)2 gave the respective bis [(diarylphosphinomethyl)cyclopentadienyl] zirconium dichlorides (Ar=phenyl (4), p-tolyl (5)). The complex rac-[C5H4-CH(CH3)-PPh2] 2ZrCl2 (rac-4b) was characterized by X-ray diffraction. The reaction of complexes 4a and 5a [(Cp-CMe2-PAr2)2ZrCl2] with PdCl2(NCPh)2 or PtCl2(NCPh)2 leads to the formation of the trans-(metallocene-chelate-phosphane)metal complexes 6-9 (e.g. trans-Cl2Pd(Ph2P-CMe2-Cp)2ZrCl 2]. Chloride abstraction from the reaction product of [Cp-CH(CMe3)PPh2]2ZrCl2 with PdCl2(NCPh)2 eventually gave the cationic complex [meso,trans-(Cp-CH(CMe3)PPh2) 2(Cl)Zr(μ-Cl)Pd(Cl)]+ (10) that was also characterized by X-ray diffraction. It features a dimetallabicyclic framework with two Cp-CHR-PPh2 ligands and a chloride bridging between the early and the late transition metal center. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.
