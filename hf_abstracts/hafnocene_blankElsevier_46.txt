Trimethylphosphane adds to the zirconocene-[C4H6B(C6F5)3] betaine complex 2a regioselectively by an overall inversion pathway, with opening of the internal ZrF-C(Ar) bond and formation of the Cp2Zr(PMe3)[C4H6B(C6F5)3] adduct 6. Complex 6 was characterized by X- ray diffraction. The betaine complex 6 contains a -CH2B(C6F5)3- substituted π-allyl ligand with characteristic bonding parameters of C1-C2: 1.402(8) Å, C2-C3: 1.373(7) Å, Zr-C1: 2.443(5) Å, Zr-C2: 2.526(4) Å, and Zr-C3: 2.681(4) Å.
