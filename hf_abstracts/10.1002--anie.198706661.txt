Despite their importance as potential intermediates, carbenevanadium complexes are still a rarity. Reaction of (butadiene)zirconocene or (butadiene)hafnocene with [CpV(CO)4] affords 1, which for M  Zr is in equilibrium with the reaction partners in solution, whereas for M  Hf it is in equilibrium with 2.
