A series of metallocene-containing silsesquioxanes with alkenylsilyl and trimethylsilyl groups, Cp′ 2 M[(c-C 5 H 9 ) 7 Si 7 O 11 ](OSiMe 2 R) (2b-d, 3b-d, 4d, 5d: Cp′ = Cp (cyclopentadienyl), Cp* (pentamethylcyclopentadienyl); M = Ti, Zr, Hf, R = methyl, vinyl, allyl), have been synthesized. The structures of the complexes Cp 2 M[(c-C 5 H 9 ) 7 Si 7 O 11 ](OSiMe 2 CH 2 CH=CH 2 ) (M = Zr (3d), Hf (5d)) have been unambiguously established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. Silylation or germylation of the zirconocene-containing silsesquioxane monosilanol Cp 2 Zr[(c-C 5 H 9 ) 7 Si 7 O 11 ](OH) (3a) or its hafnocene derivative Cp 2 Hf[(c-C 5 H 9 ) 7 -Si 7 O 11 ](OH) (5a), which can be prepared by the careful reaction of the silsesquioxane trisilanol (c-C 5 H 9 ) 7 Si 7 O 9 (OH) 3 (1a) with zirconocene dichloride or hafnocene dichloride, yields the new series of metallocene-containing silsesquioxanes Cp 2 Zr[(c-C 5 H 9 ) 7 Si 7 O 11 ](OSiMe 2 H) (3e), Cp 2 -Zr[(c-C 5 H 9 ) 7 Si 7 O 11 ](OGeMe 3 ) (3f), and Cp 2 Hf[(c-C 5 H 9 ) 7 Si 7 O 11 ](OSiMe 2 H) (5e). The reaction of 3e with 2 equiv of hydrogen chloride results in the formation of the dimethylsilyl-containing silsesquioxane disilanol (c-C 5 H 9 ) 7 Si 7 O 9 (OH) 2 (OSiMe 2 H) (1e), indicating the applicability of metallocene moieties as protecting groups of two adjacent silanol groups. Silsesquioxanes bearing alkenylsilyl groups can be easily converted to derivatives with ethoxysilyl groups, Cp 2 M[(c-C 5 H 9 ) 7 Si 7 O 11 ] [OSiMe 2 (CH 2 ) 3 SiMe 2 (OEt)] (M = Ti (2g), Zr (3g)), by the hydrosilylative reaction. The preliminary examination of the catalytic activity of these metallocene-containing silsesquioxanes toward the epoxidation of cyclohexene by tert-butyl hydroperoxide revealed that titanocene-containing silsesquioxanes (2b-d) show modest catalytic activity. The presence of alkenylsilyl groups has been found to accelerate the reactions, especially in the case of titanium-bridged silsesquioxanes.
