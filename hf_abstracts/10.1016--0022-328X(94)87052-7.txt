The catalytic epoxidation of trans-3-hexene with electronically different bis(2-aryl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)titanium dichloride complexes in the presence of stoichiometric tert-butylhydroperoxide has been studied. The results show that both electron donating (4-methoxyphenyl and 4-methylphenyl) and withdrawing (4-bromophenyl) groups on the 2-position of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindene produce an enhancement in the number of turnovers of epoxide formed during 15 h at 80°C when compared to the 2-phenyl substituted complex. The facile preparation and purification of these previously unreported ligands and the corresponding titanocene complexes, and the results of the catalytic epoxidation of trans-3-hexene are described. © 1994.
