Reaction of the 2,5‐hexanedione‐derived bisfulvene 1 with RLi reagents (R = phenyl or n‐butyl) yields the ring‐closed [4‐(cyclopentadienylidene)‐7‐R‐4,7‐dimethyl‐4,5,6,7‐tetrahydroindenyl]dilithium reagents 3. Their reaction with MCl4 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) gives the corresponding ansa‐group‐4‐metallocene dichloride complexes 4, 6, or 7. In a similar way the [7‐allyl‐4‐(η‐cyclopentadienylidene)‐4,7‐dimethyl‐4,5,6,7‐tetrahydro‐η5‐indenyl]metal dihalides (M = Ti, Zr) (6d, 4d) are prepared. Two diastereomers are formed in most cases, some of which could be separated. The five representative examples cis‐ and trans‐4c, trans‐4d, cis‐6c, and trans‐7c of these complexes were characterized by X‐ray diffraction. All these six‐membered ring‐annulated C1‐bridged ansa‐metallocene dichlorides exhibit extremely small D1ZrD2 angles (D1 and D2 denote the centroids of the cyclopentadienyl rings) of 116.5°, i.e., they are characterized by a very open bite of the bent metallocene wedge. The homogeneous Ziegler‐type catalysts derived from these ansa‐zirconocenes by activation with methylalumoxane have high activities and all produce low‐molecular mass atactic polypropylenes or propene oligomers.
