Tetramethyldisiloxane and poly(methylsiloxane) react with chlorine to give 1,3-dichlorotetramethyl-disiloxane and poly(methylchlorosiloxane). These chlorosiloxanes react with sodium cyclopentadienide to give l,3-bis(cyclopentadienyl)tetramethyldisiloxane and poly(cyclopentadienylmethylsiloxane), respectively. The reactions of these compounds with sodium metal or n-butyllithium afford the anionic cyclopentadienide derivatives, which in turn react with TiCl4-2py (py = pyridine) to yield 1,1′-η5,η5-(Me4Si2O)(C5H4)2TiCl2 (10) and [1,1′-η5,η5-(Me2Si2O2)(C5H4)2TiCl2]n. The crystal and molecular structure of 10 has been determined from a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The crystals are monoclinic of space group P21/c with a = 13.305 (2) Å, b = 8.643 (2) Å, c = 15.067 (2) Å, β = 96.350 (5)°, and Z = 4. On the basis of 2118 reflections with F02 > 3σ(F02), the structural data were refined by full-matrix least-squares methods to R = 0.035 and Rw = 0.041. The siloxy unit bridges the two cyclopentadienyl rings, the bridge lying completely to one side of the bisector of the Cl-Ti-Cl angle. The structure of 10 is compared with (CH2)n(C5H4)2TiCl2 (n = 1-3) which also contained a bridged framework as well as bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium dichloride, the unbridged parent compound. The dichloride 10 reacts with MeLi to give the corresponding dimethyl-titanocene derivative. Carbon monoxide reacts with 10 upon reduction with aluminum powder to form the titanocene (II) dicarbonyl complex. © 1983, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
