A set of asymmetric bis-indenyl zirconium SiMe2-bridged ansa-complexes, containing 2-isopropyl-4-arylindenyl and 2-methyl-4- aryltetrahydroindacenyl fragments, have been synthesized. These complexes demonstrate better catalytic activity, stereoselectivty, and polymer molecular weight capability in propylene homo-and copolymerization in comparison to analogues without a tetrahydroindacenyl fragment.
