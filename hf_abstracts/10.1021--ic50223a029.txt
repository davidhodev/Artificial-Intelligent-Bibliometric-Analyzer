The binuclear zirconocene hydride complex [(η5-C5H4CH3)2ZrH(µ-H)]2 was prepared by the stoichiometric addition of 2 equiv of LiAlH(0-t-Bu)3 to 1 equiv of (η5-C5H4CH3)2ZrCI2 and was characterized by elemental analysis, IR, NMR, hydrolysis, and X-ray diffraction methods. The molecular structure of this binuclear complex consists of two (η5-C5H4CH3)2ZrH molecular units linked by two three-center, two-electron Zr-H-Zr bonds. Its molecular geometry is constrained by a crystallographic center of inversion, which requires a trans orientation for the two terminal hydrides. The important bond angles within the Zr2H4 core are Ht,-Zr-Hb = 70 (1)Å, Ht-Zr-Hb‘ = 130 (1)°, Hb-Zr-Hb‘ = 60 (1)°, and Zr-Hb-Zr’ = 120 (1)°, and the metal-hydrogen bond distances are Zr-H, = 1.78 (2) Å, Zr-Hb = 2.05 (3) Å, and Zr-Hb‘ = 1.94 (2) Å. So that inter-ring repulsions introduced during dimer formation might be relieved, the methylcyclopentadienyl rings have been rotated so that the methyl substituents on opposite sides of the molecule are directed away from one another. The compound crystallizes in a triclinic unit cell of PI symmetry with refined lattice parameters of a = 6.390 (2) Å, b = 8.291 (3) Å,c= 11.308 (4) Å, a = 85.39 (3)°, β = 74.36 (3)°, γ = 68.87 (2)°, V= 538.0 (3) Å3, Z = 1 dimer of fw 502.9 per cell, and pcalod= 1.552 g/cm3. Full-matrix least-squares refinement (based on F°2) of 2489 diffractometry data converged with final discrepancy indices of R(F0) = 0.0197, R(F02) = 0.0357, and Rw(F°2) = 0.0463 with σ1, = 1.30. © 1981, American Chemical Society.
