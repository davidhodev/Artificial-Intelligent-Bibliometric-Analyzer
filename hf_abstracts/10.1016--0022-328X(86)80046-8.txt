Dimeric metallocene dihydrides [(η5-t-BuC5H4)2MH(μ-H)]2 (1; M = Zr, Hf) react with elemental chalcogens to give the four-membered metallacycles [(η5-t-BuC5H4)2M(μ-E)]2 (2, E = Se; 3, E = S). In the case of sulfur, the reaction also gives (η5-t-BuC5H4)2MS5 (4). Both 3 and 4 are shown to come from subsequent reactions of the primary insertion product (η5-t-BuC5H4)2M(SH)2. © 1986.
