Metal-carbon covalence in (C5H5)2MCl 2 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) has been evaluated using carbon K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) as well as ground-state and time-dependent hybrid density functional theory (DFT and TDDFT). Differences in orbital mixing were determined experimentally using transmission XAS of thin crystalline material with a scanning transmission X-ray microscope (STXM). Moving down the periodic table (Ti to Hf) has a marked effect on the experimental transition intensities associated with the low-lying antibonding 1a1* and 1b 2* orbitals. The peak intensities, which are directly related to the M-(C5H5) orbital mixing coefficients, increase from 0.08(1) and 0.26(3) for (C5H5)2TiCl 2 to 0.31(3) and 0.75(8) for (C5H5) 2ZrCl2, and finally to 0.54(5) and 0.83(8) for (C 5H5)2HfCl2. The experimental trend toward increased peak intensity for transitions associated with 1a 1* and 1b2* orbitals agrees with the calculated TDDFT oscillator strengths [0.10 and 0.21, (C5H 5)2TiCl2; 0.21 and 0.73, (C5H 5)2ZrCl2; 0.35 and 0.69, (C5H 5)2HfCl2] and with the amount of C 2p character obtained from the Mulliken populations for the antibonding 1a 1* and 1b2* orbitals [8.2 and 23.4%, (C 5H5)2TiCl2; 15.3 and 39.7%, (C 5H5)2ZrCl2; 20.1 and 50.9%, (C 5H5)2HfCl2]. The excellent agreement between experiment, theory, and recent Cl K-edge XAS and DFT measurements shows that C 2p orbital mixing is enhanced for the diffuse Hf (5d) and Zr (4d) atomic orbitals in relation to the more localized Ti (3d) orbitals. These results provide insight into how changes in M-Cl orbital mixing within the metallocene wedge are correlated with periodic trends in covalent bonding between the metal and the cyclopentadienide ancillary ligands.
