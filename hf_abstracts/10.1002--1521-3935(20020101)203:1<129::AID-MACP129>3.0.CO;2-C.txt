A series of Cp′(C5H5)ZrCl2 and Cp2′ZrCl2 precatalysts (Cp′ = C5HMe4, C4Me4P, C5Me5, C5H4tBu, C5H3-1,3-tBu2, C5H2-1,2,4tBu3) together with (C5H5)2ZrCl2 was used for the directed oligomerization of propene and 1-hexene in comparative experiments. Oligomer characterization was carried out by 1H NMR, SEC (GPC), MALDI-TOF, MS, cryoscopy and Raman spectroscopy. From 1H NMR the nature and relative ratio of the double-bond end group is determined together with Mn if every oligomer molecule contains such a double bonds (From β-hydrogen elimination) are found. From 1H NMR and MALDI-TOF MS also vinyl end groups (from β-methyl elimination) are observed in the case of oligopropenes with (C4Me4P)-(C5H5)ZrCl2 and with the symmetrical methyl containing Cp2′ZrCl2 pre-catalyst. The vinylidene/vinyl ratio depends on the ligand and increases from C5HMe4 (65/35) over C4Me4P (61/39) to C5Me5 (9/91). A comparison of Mn from 1H NMR and SEC together with MALDI-TOF MS shows that the phospholyl-zirconocenes and (C5HMe4)2ZrCl2 also exhibit chain transfer to aluminium, thereby giving saturated oligomers.
