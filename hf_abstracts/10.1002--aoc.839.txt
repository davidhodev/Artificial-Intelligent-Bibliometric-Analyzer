Raman spectroscopy was used as a very simple and convenient tool for the detection of bent metallocene fragments [M(Cp)2]2+ (Cp = η5-cyclopentadienyl ring; M = early transition metal) both in solid state and in solution. The rules were formulated and tested on the group of titanium complexes containing one or two η5-bonded cyclopentadienyl rings, as well as on a series of model α-amino acid complexes of antitumour active titanocene and vanadocene dichlorides.
