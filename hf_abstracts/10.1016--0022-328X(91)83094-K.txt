Hydrozirconation-deuterolysis of (E)-3-methoxy-1-phenyl-1-propene was found to give α- and ω-deuterated propylbenzenes after elimination of the ether function. An unforeseen higher degree of benzylic substitution in the propylbenzenes was observed. In an effort to account for the regiochemical outcome of the reaction, hydrozirconation of propenylbenzenes with mixed reagents and deuterozirconation was investigated. Hydrozirconation of (E)-3-propenol-2-propenol results in loss of the hydroxyl group to only a small extent, and after hydrozirconation and deuterolysis fair yields of benzenopropan-γ-d-ol are formed. Carbonyl insertion into 3-hydroxyl-1-phenyl-1-zirconocene-propane gives low yields of the lactone dihydro-3-phenyl-2(3H)-furanone. © 1991.
