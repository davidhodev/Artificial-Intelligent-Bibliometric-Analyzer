Bis(alkynyl)zirconocene and -hafnocene complexes 4 react with (butadiene)zirconocene or -hafnocene, respectively, to yield the binuclear σ,π-acetylide bridged complexes [(Cp 2 M) 2 (μ-C≡C-R) 2 ] 7 (M = Zr, Hf; R = CH 3 , C 2 H 5 , or CH 2 Ph). The complexes 7 are selectively protonated upon treatment with N,N-dimethylanilinium tetraphenylborate or tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate to yield the dinuclear metallocene cation complexes [(Cp 2 M 1 )(μ-RCC 1 -H)(μ-C=C-R)M 2 Cp 2 + ] 13 (M 1 = M 2 = Zr, a-c; M 1 = Zr, M 2 = Hf, h; M 1 = M 2 = Hf, i) that contain a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom (C 1 -H) bearing a hydrogen substituent. Complex 13a was characterized by X-ray diffraction. It reveals an agostic interaction of the C 1 -H moiety with the M 2 Cp 2 unit. The planar-tetracooidinate carbon unit C 1 -H of 13a exhibits 13 C/ 1 H NMR chemical shifts of δ = 161.0 and -0.11 and a coupling constant of 1 J CH = 103 Hz. Selective protonation of (μ-alkynyl)bis(group 4 metallocene) complexes containing other additional bridging ligands provides a rather general synthetic entry to planar-tetracoordinate carbon containing complexes of this type: [Cp 2 M 1 (μ-C≡C-CH 3 )(μ-Cl)M 2 Cp 2 ] (10a-c, M 1 , M 2 = Zr, Hf) and [Cp 2 M 1 (μ-C≡C-CH 3 )(μ-CH 3 )M 2 Cp 2 ] (11a.b) selectively add a proton from [(HNMe 2 Ph) + (BAr 4 ) - ] at carbon atom C 1 of the acetylide ligand to yield the corresponding "anti-van't Hoff/LeBel complexes" [Cp 2 M 1 (μ-CH 3 CC 1 -H)(μ-X)M 2 Cp 2 + ] (13d-g and k, X = Cl, CH 3 ), respectively.
