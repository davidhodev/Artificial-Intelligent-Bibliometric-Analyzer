The photodecomposition of the Ar‐laser sensitive photo‐initiator bis(pentafluorophenyl)titanocene 1 was investigated. Two intermediate species were postulated: a pentafluorophenylcyclopentenyl radical 16 which acts as quencher and a ketene acetal radical of the structure CH2‐CH=C(OCH3)OTiRx 17 which could initiate the polymerization.
