Insertion of lithium chloroallylide into a bicyclic zirconacyclopentane yields a zirconocene allyl complex which reacts with a variety of C, N, O and S containing electrophiles to give elaborated cyclopentane products on work-up. An intramolecular version of this tandem protocol gives a stereospecific synthesis of a (E)-alkylidenecyclohexane. Â© 1995.
