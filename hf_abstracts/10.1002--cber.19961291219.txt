The ethene polymerization activities of a series of Cp′(C5H5}ZrCl2 and Cp2ZrCl2 pre-catalysts (Cp′ = C5HMe4, C4Me4P, C5Me5, C5H4tBu, C5H3-1,3-tBu2, C5H2-1,2,4-tBu3) together with (C5H5)2ZrCl2 have been correlated with the coordination gap aperture. In the case of the mixed substituted C5R5-nR′n ligands, the coordination gap aperture has been determined with the help of the cyclopentadienyl cone angle and the bending angle at zirconium. A hindered rotatability of the (erf-butyl substituted systems has been evaluated by molecular modeling calculations and was included in the gap aperture estimation. Deviations from the activity-gap aperture correlation in the case of the phospholyl (C4Me4P) systems could be accounted for in terms of adduct formation between aluminum species and the phosphorus donors. These Lewis acid/base adducts form in an equili-brium reaction at high Al/Zr ratios, as shown by 31P NMR. Ab initio calculations on model L2TiMe+ complexes (L = C5H5, C5H4N and C5H4P) for the insertion of ethene in the Ti-Me bond suggest a high electronic similarity for phospholyl and cyclopentadienyl. The 91Zr-NMR data (chemical shift and line width) for the above zirconocene series are reported. The 91Zr chemical shift values increase with a good linear correlation to the number of methyl or (erf-butyl groups, which is traced to the additive electron donating effect of the alkyl groups. The hyperconjugative donor effect of a tert-butyl group is found here to be 1.25 times that of a methyl group. The X-ray structure of (C5H3-1,3-ffiu2)(C5H 5)ZrCl2 has been determined (monoclinic, P21/n, a= 6.631(3), b= 18.843(9), c = 15.265(5) Å, β= 91.3°, Z = 4). © VCH Verlagsgeselischaft mbH. 1996.
