The chemistry research community is identifying hafnium's potential capabilities as a catalyst to advance N2 and C-H activation reactions. The research has found a close relationship between the physical and chemical properties of hafnium and zirconium. It is reported that hafnocene-N2 and zirconocene-N2 complexes react with H2 to form a hydrazine core between two metallocene units. Hafnium is also found to offer broader reactivity of the dihafnocene-N2 complex with carbon dioxide leading to double insertion of carbon dioxide into the Hf-N bonds to form a N2-carbon dioxide core. The group 4 metallocene reactions with acetylenes form adducts between bis (trimethylsilyl) acetylene, titanocene, and zirconocene. The chemical researchers have applied the enhanced reactivity of hafnium organometallic compounds for synthesis and catalysis.
