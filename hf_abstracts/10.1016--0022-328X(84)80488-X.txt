The dark green crystalline [ZrCp″2(CO)2] (Cp″ = η-C5H3(SiMe3)2), (I) (δ(13CO) 264 ppm), was prepared by reduction from [ZrCp″2Cl2] and either CO (using NaHg, MgHgCl2, or Li2 [COT]) or CO2(NaHg) in high (CO) to moderate (CO2) yield; the NaHg/CO procedure was much more effective than for Zr analogues having η-C5H5 or η-C5H4(SiMe3) ligands; the carbonyl complex I is a convenient precursor to CO-free derivatives obtained either by oxidative addition or ligand displacement. © 1984.
