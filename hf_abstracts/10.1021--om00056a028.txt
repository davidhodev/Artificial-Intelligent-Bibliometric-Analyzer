(s-traras-Butadiene)zirconocene (8) adds to a carbonyl ligand of CpV(CO)4 to give the [(π-allyl)-zirconoxycarbene]vanadium complex Cp2ZrOC[=VCp(CO)3]C4H6 (11b). (butadiene)HfCp2 reacts similarly to give a mixture of the [(π-allyl)hafnoxycarbene]- and seven-membered metallacyclic [(σ-allyl)hafnoxycarbene]vanadium species (11a/12a). These complexes subsequently add a ketone (acetone, acetophenone, methyl vinyl ketone), aldehyde (acrolein), or nitrile (pivalonitrile) to yield nine-membered metaloxycarbene vanadium complexes, such as Cp2HfOC[=VCp(CO)3]CH2CH=CHCH2C(CH3)2O (13a), exhibiting anal ogous chiral trans-cycloalkene dioxametalla-trans-cyclononene frameworks. The (carbene)vanadium complex 13a was characterized by X-ray diffraction. Complex 13a crystallizes in space group P21/c with cell constants a = 11.741 (1) Å, b = 14.244 (2) Å, c = 15.824 (1) Å, β = 109.57 (1)°, Z = 4, R = 0.028, Rw = 0.023. Treatment of the nine-membered metaloxycarbene complexes with tetrabutylammonium fluoride trihydrate in tetrahydrofuran solution gave the Zr, Hf-free vanadium acylmetalate complexes [Cp(CO)3VC(=O)-CH2CH=CHCH2CR1R2OH](NBu4), which were subsequently O-alkylated with triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate to yield the ordinary Fischer-type (carbene)vanadium complexes Cp(CO)3V=C(OC2H5)-CH2CH=CHCH2CR1R2OH. Treatment of Cp2ZrOC[=VCp(CO)3]C4H6 (11b) with TBAF•3H2O followed by the reaction with Meerwein’s reagent gave Cp(CO)3V=C(OC2H6)CH2CH=CHCH3 (24). © 1991, American Chemical Society.
