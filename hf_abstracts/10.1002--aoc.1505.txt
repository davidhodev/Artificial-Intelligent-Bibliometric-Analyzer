Activation of ansa-zirconocenes of the type Rac [Zr{1-Me2Si(3-R-(n5-C9H5)) (3-R′-(n5-C9H5))}Cl2] [R =Et, R′ =H (1);R=Pr, R′ =H (2); and R = Et, R′ = Pr (3), R, R′ = Me (4) and R, R′ = Bu (5)] by MAO has been studied by UV-visible spectroscopy. Compounds 1-3 have been tested in the polymerization of ethylene at different Al : Zr ratios. UV-vis spectroscopy was used to determine a correlation between the electronic structures of (1-5) and their polymerization activity. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
