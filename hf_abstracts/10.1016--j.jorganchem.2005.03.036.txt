Several new methyl-substituted indenyl ferrocenes were prepared by metathesis reactions of the indenide (generated from the appropriate indene with BuLi) with ferrous chloride. The indenides used to prepare new ferrocenes were: 2-methyl-, 1,2-dimethyl-, 4,7-dimethyl-, 1,4,7-trimethyl-, and 1,3,4,7-tetramethyl-indenide. These indenyl ferrocenes, along with those prepared from indenide, 1-methylindenide, and 1,3-dimethylindenide, were then characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, UV/visible spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and mass spectrometry. The cyclic voltammetry showed an additive relationship between oxidation potential and the number of methyl groups which is also position-dependent, whereas the UV/visible spectra showed two absorptions essentially unaffected by methyl substitution. Additionally, bis(2-methylindenyl)iron(II) and bis(4,7-dimethylindenyl)iron(II) were characterized by X-ray crystallography. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
