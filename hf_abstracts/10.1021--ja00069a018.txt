Heating norbornene in the presence of catalytic amounts of dimethyltitanocene, cyclopentadienyltrimethyltitanium(IV), chlorodimethylcyclopentadienyltitanium(IV), and bis[(trimethylsilyl)methyl]titanocene resulted in the ring-opening metathesis polymerization of norbornene. Presumably, the in-situ generation of free or complexed titanium alkylidene intermediates is responsible for these polymerizations. The use of tetrahydrofuran as the solvent had a significant inhibitory effect that varied with the initiator used. This effect was confirmed with the measurement of kinetic data. This substituent-dependent solvent effect was attributed to changes in the relative contributions of nucleophilic and neutral resonance structures, in agreement with recent theoretical calculations.
