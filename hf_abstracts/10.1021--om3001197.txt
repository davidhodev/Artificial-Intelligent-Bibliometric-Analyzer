Reaction of [Cp 2Ti(Me)(CD 2Cl 2)] + (I) with 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene in CD 2Cl 2 at 205 K produces the α-agostic insertion product [Cp 2TiCH 2CHMe tBu] + (II), in which the chirality at C(2) induces preferential agostic binding of one of the diastereotopic α-H atoms; subsequent coordination of ethyl ether to II leaves the α-agostic interaction weakened but intact. On warming, II undergoes β-hydrogen elimination and the resulting hydride reacts further with excess 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene to form the β-agostic species [Cp 2TiCH 2CH 2 tBu] +.
