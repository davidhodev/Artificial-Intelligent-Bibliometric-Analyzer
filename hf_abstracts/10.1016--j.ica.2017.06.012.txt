© 2017 Elsevier B.V.A generally applicable synthetic protocol for preparing early transition metal and lanthanide metallocenes bearing dihydroazulenide ligands has been developed. Lithium dihydroazulenide precursors such as lithium 4-methyldihydroazulenide (2, = LiC11H11), lithium 7-isopropyl-1,4,8-trimethyldihydroazulenide (4, = LiC16H21), and lithium 7-isopropyl-1,4-dimethyl-8-phenyldihydroazulenide (5, = LiC21H23) were prepared by treatment of azulene or guaiazulene with methyllithium or phenyllithium, resp. While variable-temperature 7Li NMR revealed the presence of monomeric and dimeric structures in solution, an X-ray diffraction study of the DME adduct LiC16H21(DME) (4a) showed a monomer with η5-coordination of the azulene-derived ligand in the solid state. Reactions of MCl4(THF)2 (M = Ti, Zr) with 2 equivalents of the lithium dihydroazulenides in THF solution provided the Ti and Zr metallocenes 6–11 as inseparable mixtures of stereoisomers. However, pure products could be isolated by introducing only one dihydroazulenide ligand as in the mixed-ligand zirconium sandwich complexes (C5Me5)(C11H11)ZrCl2 (12A) and (C5Me5)(guaiazulenide)ZrCl2 (13). In contrast, two related neodymium(III) sandwich complexes containing dihydroazulenide ligands (14, 15) also formed mixtures of stereoisomers.
