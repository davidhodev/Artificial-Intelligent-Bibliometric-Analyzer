Metallocene sulfides [Cp2M(μ-S)]2 (I, M Zr4+; II, M Hf4+ and Cp = cyclopentadienyl) have been synthesized. I and II show charge transfer absorption in the visible region. FT-Raman, Raman and IR spectra of these compounds are reported for the first time. The MS stretching bands have been assigned with the help of a pre-resonance effect. The approximate normal coordinate analysis of the coordination skeleton (D2h symmetry) aids the detailed assignment in the low frequency spectral region. Force constants of MCp and MS stretching imply that the bond order of HfL is higher than that of ZrL. © 1994.
