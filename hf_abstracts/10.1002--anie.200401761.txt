Structural limitations in small cyclic hydrocarbons are a longstanding challenge to chemistry, leading to molecules with unusual geometric parameters and reactivity. For example, incorporation of C=C=C=C or C-Câ‰¡C-C arrangements, which are normally linear in open-chain compounds, into small carbocyclic rings results in enormous ring strain as a result of the angle deformation. Nevertheless, such uncommon structures have been realized by complexation of zirconocene fragments with butadiynes and butatrienes, giving five-membered metallacyclocumulenes and metallacyclopentynes. The metal atom is essential for these molecules but complicates the simplified description because of internal interactions of the metals with the multiple bonds.
