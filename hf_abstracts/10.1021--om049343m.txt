The reaction of sodium metal with Cp 2ZrCl 2 and RGaCl 2 in hexane affords Cp 2Zr(GaR) 2 (R = -C 6H 3-2,6-(2,4,6-i-Pr 3C 6H 2) 2) as deep green-black air-sensitive crystals. Essentially, Cp 2Zr(GaR) 2 is isoelectronic with the well-known 18-electron zirconocene dicarbonyl, Cp 2-Zr(CO) 2, complex. The title compound is the first example of an organometallic compound containing Ga-Zr bonds (Ga-Zr = 2.6350(8) Ã…).
