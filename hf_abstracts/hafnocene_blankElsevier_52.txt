Treatment of the alkyl Group 4 metallocene cation reagent [ZrCp2{CH2Si(CH3)3}(THF)] +[BPh4]- 2b with bis(propynyl)zirconocene 1a yielded the cationic dimetallic complex [(ZrCp2)2(μ-η1 : η2-CH3CCCH3){μ-κ 2-C≡CCH2Si(CH3)3}]+ 3d with BPh4- anion. Complex 3d was characterized spectroscopically and by a crystal structure analysis. It contains a planar four-co-ordinate carbon atom, which is stabilized by the interaction with both Group 4 metal centres. Finding the CH2Si(CH3)3 substituent, that originates from the alkylzirconocene reagent, attached at the μ-acetylide ligand in the final product is unusual. A reversible alkynyl carbometallation sequence is proposed to account for the observed selective formation of 3d. Complex 3d reacted with alkyl isocyanides RN≡C (R = CMe2CH2CMe3, CMe3, or cyclohexyl) by replacement of the μ-η1 : η2-CH3CCCH3 ligand to form the μ-isocyanide complexes [(ZrCp2)2(μ-η1-C : η2-C,N-RNC){μ-κ2-C≡CCH 2Si(CH3)2}]+ (with BPh4- anion) of which one was characterized by a crystal structure analysis.
