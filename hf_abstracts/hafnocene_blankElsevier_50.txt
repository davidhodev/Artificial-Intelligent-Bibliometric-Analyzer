A review with 178 references covering metal-based photoinitiators (ferrocenium salts, ferrocene/polyhalogen systems, titanocene photoinitiators, metal carbonyl/onium salts systems, benzene/chromium tricarbonyl/polyhalogen systems, cationic metal coordination complexes/borate systems), camphorquinone systems, dye/co-initiator systems (dye/amine, methylene blue/benzyltrimethylstannane, dyes/peroxide, xanthene dyes/borate, cyanine dyes/triazine/mercaptan, triarylmethane dyes/diphenyliodonium salts, lophine/julolidine/mercaptobenzoxazole, ketocoumarin/co-initiator systems) and applications of visible light photoinitiator systems in reprography, holographic recording, nano-scale micromechanics and in clinical photocuring of polymeric restorative resins used in dentistry.
