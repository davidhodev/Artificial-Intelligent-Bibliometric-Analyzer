The zirconocene alkyne complexes Cp2Zr(THF)(Me3SiCCSiMe3) (1) and Cp2Zr(py)(Me3SiC CSiMe3) (2) react with acetone to yield the new zirconadihydrofurane complex Cp2ZrOC(Me2) C(SiMe3)C(SiMe3) (3). Reaction of 3 with tolan gives, under substitution of the alkyne moiety, a further dihydrofurane compound Cp2ZrOC(Me2)C(Ph)C(Ph) (4). Complexes 3 and 4 are characterized by NMR and X-ray structure analyses. They are compared with the known titanocene complex Cp2 TiOC(Me2)C(Ph)C(Ph) (5) to study the influence of the metals M = Ti, Zr and the substituents R = Ph, SiMe3 in selected metalladihydrofuranes Cp2MOC(Me2)C(R) C(R). Although the structures of complexes 3 and 4 are similar, the complexes display different reactivities. Thus 3 is capable of reacting with tolan, CO2 and water at room temperature, while 4 is inactive towards these compounds under the same conditions. Â© 1994.
