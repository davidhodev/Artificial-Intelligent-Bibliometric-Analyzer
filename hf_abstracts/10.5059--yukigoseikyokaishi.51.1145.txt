This article deals with a recent development of selective reactions using zirconocene-alkene complexes in our group. The following reactions are reviewed. (i) Preparation of zirconocene-alkene complexes. (ii) Alkene-alkene coupling reactions on zirconocene. (iii) Reactions of alkene complexes with ketones or aldehydes. (iv) Selective skeleton transformation via C-C bond activation. (v) Selective functionalization of zirconacyclopentenes. (vi) Allylation reaction of alkynes using a zirconocene complex and allylic compounds. (vii) Zirconium catalyzed C-C bond formation reactions of alkenes on zirconocenes. (viii) Zirconocene catalyzed hydrosilation reactions using zirconocene-alkene complexes. (ix) Zirconocene catalyzed C-C bond formation reactions of alkynes on zirconocenes. (x) Zirconocene-catalyzed allylation reactions. Â© 1993, The Society of Synthetic Organic Chemistry, Japan. All rights reserved.
