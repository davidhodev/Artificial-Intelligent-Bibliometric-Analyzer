The reaction of ZrCl4 with four equivalents of the 6,6-dimethylcyclohexadienyl anion (6,6-dmch-) in the presence of PMe3 leads to the 18 electron Zr(6,6-dmch) 2(PMe3)2. This complex was found to undergo a coupling reaction with two equivalents of PhCH=NPh, such that the couplings involved the two termini of the same dienyl ligand, yielding a formal Zr(η5-dienyl)(η3-allyl) (π-amide)2 complex. Both metal complexes have been structurally characterized. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
