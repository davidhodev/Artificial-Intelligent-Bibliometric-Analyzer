Treatment of (cod)IrCl dimer with Li(allyl)cyclopentadienide gave (C 5H4-CH2-CH=CH2)Ir(cod) (11). At 100 °C, 11 isomerizes cleanly into its ring-conjugated (trans-CH 3-CH=CH-C5H4)Ir(cod) isomer (13). Subsequent addition of HB(C6F5)2 results in the formation of a product (16) that contains an annelated five-membered borata heterocycle at the Cp ring. This is probably formed by means of a reaction sequence involving regioselective hydroboration, followed by an electrophilic substitution reaction at the Cp ring by the strongly Lewis acidic -B(C6F5) 2 group, in which the iridium metal base acts as the proton abstractor. Products 13 and 16 were characterized by X-ray diffraction. © Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 2008.
