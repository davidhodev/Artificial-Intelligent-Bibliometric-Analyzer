The reaction of the new ligand [2,6-(CH2C5H4)2C5H 3N]2-Na2+ (LNa2) with ZrCl4 in THF affords in good yield the trigonal-bipyramidal complex LZrCl2, where the two chlorine atoms are not equivalent. When LZrCl2 and RMgCl (R = CH3, n-butyl, CH2Si(CH3)3) are reacted in 1:1 and 1:2 molar ratios, the corresponding complexes LZr(Cl)R and LZrR2 can be isolated in good yields. Differently from the Cp2Zr(n-Bu)2, which has never been isolated due to Î²-H. elimination, the analogous LZr(n-Bu)2 is thermally stable and its X-ray crystal structure has been solved, confirming its trigonal-bipyramidal geometry with the alkyl groups occupying an equatorial and an axial position. An NMR study (1H, 13C, HMQC, NOE) allowed the complete structural characterization of the complexes in solution.
