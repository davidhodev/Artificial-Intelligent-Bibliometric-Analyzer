The pseudo-octahedral dichlorido imido hydridotris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl) borate niobium and tantalum compounds [MTp*Cl 2(NtBu)] (M = Nb (1a), Ta (1b); Tp* = BH(3,5-Me 2C 3HN 2) 3) were prepared in better yields by treatment of equimolar quantities of MCl 3(NtBu)py 2 and KTp* in toluene at reflux. Reactions of 1a,b with a small excess of LiNMe 2 (1:1.2 ratio) in toluene gave the corresponding chlorido dimethylamido derivatives [MTp*Cl(NMe 2)(NtBu)] (M = Nb (2), Ta (3)). Mixed methyl dimethylamido [MTp*Me(NMe 2)(NtBu)] (M = Nb (4), Ta (5)) complexes were synthesized in good yields by heating for several days a mixture of 2 or 3 and MgClMe, in a 1:1 molar ratio. However, the reactions of 1a,b with excess LiNMe 2 led to bis(dimethylamido) complexes [MTp*(NMe 2) 2(NtBu)] (M = Nb (6), Ta (7)) as unitary species. 4 and 5 reacted with B(C 6F 5) 3 to give the cation-like complexes [MTp*(NMe 2)(NtBu)] +[BMe(C 6F 5) 3] - (M = Nb (8), Ta (9)), whereas in the case of complexes 6 and 7 the reaction led to [MTp*(NMe 2){N(Me)=CH 2-κ 1N}(NtBu)] +[BH(C 6F 5) 3] - (M = Nb (10), Ta (11)) derivatives as result of the C-H methyl bond activation into a NMe 2 function. The restricted rotation process of the NMe 2 moiety around the M-N amido bond in complexes 2-7, the pseudo-rotation process of the Tp* ligand into the cationic species 8 and 9, and the CH 2 terminal group around the N=CH 2 bond in compounds 10 and 11 were observed and studied by 1H DNMR spectroscopy. The isomerization of two enantiomers in the mixtures of 4 and 5 with B(C 6F 5) 3 was detected, and their mechanism was proposed. All compounds were studied by IR and multinuclear NMR ( 1H, 13C, and 15N) spectroscopy, and the molecular structures of complexes 1a,b and 3 were determined by X-ray diffraction methods. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
