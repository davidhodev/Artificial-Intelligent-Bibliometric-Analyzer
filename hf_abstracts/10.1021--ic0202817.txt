Cyclic organohydroborate complexes of zirconium monocyclopentadienyl CpZr{(μ-H)2BC5H10}3, 1, and CpZr{(μ-H)2BC8H14}3, 2, were prepared from the reaction of CpZrCl3 with 3 mol of K[H2BC5H10] and K[H2BC8H10] respectively, in diethyl ether. Compounds 1 and 2 react with the hydride ion abstracting agent B(C6F5)3 to form the same salt [CpZr(OEt)(OEt2)(μ-OEt)]2 [HB(C6F5)3]2, 5. The complexes CpZr(Cl){(μ-H)2BC8H14}2, 3, and Cp*Zr(Cl){(μ-H)2BC8H14}2 [where Cp* = C5(CH3)5], 4, were prepared from the reaction of CpZrCl3 and Cp*ZrCl3 with K[H2BC8H10] in 1:2 molar ratios, respectively. An α-hydrogen of a BC8H14 unit forms an agostic interaction with Zr in compound 3 but not in 4. All of the compounds were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.
