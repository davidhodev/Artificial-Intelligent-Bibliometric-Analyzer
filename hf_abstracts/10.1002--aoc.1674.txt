The synthesis of long-chain branched polyethylene includes the generation of vinyl-terminated polyethylene macromonomers and the copolymerization of these macromonomers with ethylene. Four new bridged cyclopentadienyl indenyl (fluorenyl) zirconocene complexes 1a-b, 2a-b were prepared and showed high activities for ethylene homopolymerization upon the activation of methylaluminoxane. The steric bulk of bridged substituent has a profound effect on the catalytic activity as well as on the molecular weight of resulting polyethylene. Complex 1b showed the highest activity of up to 5.32 x 10 6 g PE/(mol Zr h) for ethylene homopolymerization at 70 °C, which was higher than that of Cp2ZrCl2. The polyethylenes produced with complexes 1a -d/MAO are mostly vinyl-terminated, possess low molecular weight and fit as macromonomers. The (p-MePh)2C-bridged cyclopentadienyl indenyl zirconocene complex 1a could produce polyethylene macromonomer with selectivity for the vinyl-terminal as high as 94.9%.
