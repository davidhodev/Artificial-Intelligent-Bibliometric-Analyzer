Treatment of water-stable Cp2TiMe2 with [Ph 3C][B(C6F5)4] in CD 2Cl2 gives the solvent-separated ion pair [Cp 2Ti(Me)(CD2Cl2)][B(C6F 5)4], which reacts rapidly with water at 205 K to give the corresponding aqua complex [Cp2Ti(Me)(H2O)][B(C 6F5)4]. The latter has been characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy at 205 K and is a rare, possibly unique, example of a complex containing aqua and methyl ligands within the coordination sphere of a titanium(IV) complex.
