The reduction of Cp2MCl2 (M = Ti, Zr) with magnesium in THF in the presence of PMe3 affords the complexes Cp2M(PMe3)2 in high yields. These compounds lose one or both PMe3 ligands under very mild conditions. Cp2Ti(PMe3)2 reacts readily with CH3I, CH3C(O)Cl, PhSSPh, Me2PCH2CH2PMe2, CO, RCN (R = Me, t-Bu) or (RN)2S (R = t-Bu, Me3Si) to give the corresponding titanocene products. The structure of Cp2Zr(PMe3)2 has been determined by X-ray diffraction; the structural parameters are similar to those of the titanium analog Cp2Ti(PMe3)2 except that the Zr-P and Zr-C distances are longer.
