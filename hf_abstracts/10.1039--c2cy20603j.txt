This perspective gives an overview of recent developments in the chemistry of heterometallacycles of group 4 metallocenes. This class of compounds has been known for several decades now, however, in recent years significant efforts were made in order to further explore the structural scope of these complexes and their potential in catalytic applications. This overview shows some special heterometallacycles which could be of great interest for theoretical and synthetic chemists, owing to their unusual structural and bonding parameters as well as their applicability in a wide range of synthetic and catalytic transformations.
