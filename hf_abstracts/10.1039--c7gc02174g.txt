Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.A highly efficient way for the direct (trans)esterification of acyl acids (esters) and alcohols in a strict 1:1 ratio using a zirconocene complex (1, 1 mol%), a strong Lewis acid of good water tolerance, as a catalyst under solvent-free conditions has been developed. A wide range of acid and alcohol (esters) substrates undergo (trans)esterification to produce carboxylic ester motifs in moderate to good or excellent yields with good functional tolerance, such as that towards C-Br as well as CC and CC bonds. And complex 1 can be recycled six times without showing a significant decline in catalytic efficiency. It was demonstrated that cyclandelate, which is used to treat high blood pressure as well as heart and blood-vessel diseases, can be directly synthesized on a gram scale with 81% yield (6.70 g) using complex 1.
