Ethylene and styrene derivatives reacted with various propargylic ethers in the presence of zirconocene(II) to afford allenic products in high yields. The reaction proceeded via formation of zirconacyclopentenes by selective coupling of an olefin and a propargylic ether, which was followed by Î²-elimination of the siloxy group. Deuterolysis confirmed that the final product had a zirconium-carbon bond.
