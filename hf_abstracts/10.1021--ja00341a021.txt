Photolysis of a hexane solution of Cp2Ti(C18O)2 in the presence of excess C16O results in the facile formation of Cp2Ti(C16O)2, demonstrating that the carbonyl ligands of Cp2Ti(CO)2 (1) are photolabile. Photolysis of a hexane solution of 1 in the presence of excess PF3 results in the formation of Cp2Ti(PF3)2 (3) in 86% yield. The monophosphine complex Cp2Ti(CO)(PEt3) (2) can be prepared from either photochemical or thermal reactions of 1 and PEt3 in hydrocarbon solvents, whereas Cp2Ti(CO)(PPh3) (5) can be obtained from a thermal reaction between 1 and PPh3. The phosphine ligands in both 2 and 5 are very labile in solution. Complex 2 reacts readily with PF3 and with P(OPh)3 to produce Cp2Ti(CO)(PF3) (4) and Cp2Ti(CO)[(OPh)3] (6), respectively. Reactions of 2 with C6H5C=CC6H5 or C6F5C=CC6F5 likewise lead to the respective π-acetylenic complexes Cp2Ti(CO)(2-C6H5C=CC6H5) (7) and Cp2Ti(CO)(ti2-C6F5C=CC6F5) (8) in high yields. Reactions between 2 and either dimethyl maleate or dimethyl fumarate in toluene solution at 0°C lead to a single air- and heat-sensitive product, formulated as the monoolefin π complex Cp2Ti(CO)(O2-trans/ts-CH3O2CCH=CHCO2CH3) (9) on the basis of elemental analysis, molecular weight, and degradative and spectroscopic studies. Dimethyl maleate is also catalytically isomerized to dimethyl fumarate under these conditions. The 1H NMR spectrum of 9 in toluene-d8 solution is temperature dependent. The crystal and molecular structures of phosphine complexes 2 and 3 have been determined by X-ray diffraction techniques. Complex 2 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbca with unit cell parameters a = 11.972 (5) Å, b = 16.977 (7) Å, c = 16.674 (7) Å, and Dc = 1.27 g cm-3 for Z = 8. Least-squares refinement based on 2111 observed reflections led to a final R value of 0.044. Complex 3 belongs to the orthorhombic space group C2cm with a = 7.811 (4) Å, 6 = 13.724 (5) Å, c = 37.649 (11) Å, and Dc = 1.75 g cm-3 for Z = 12. The final R value based on 1037 independent observed reflections was 0.038. In 2, the triethylphosphine ligand is coordinated to the titanium atom at a Ti-P separation of 2.585 (1) Á. The Ti-P lengths in the trifluorophosphine derivative 3, however, average 2.34 (4) Å. These two extremes are probably due to steric crowding in the former (2) and appreciable back-bonding in the latter (3). The Ti-C(η5) bond distances average 2.37 (2) Å in 2 and 2.34 (1) Å in 3. © 1983, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
