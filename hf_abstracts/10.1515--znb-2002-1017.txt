Treatment of (butadiene)zirconocene with two molar equivalents of benzylmercaptane results in the formation of Cp2Zr(SCH2Ph)2 (11). Subsequent reaction of 11 with [Cp2ZrCH3 +][CH3B(C6F 5)3 -] (12) leads to rapid elimination of methane to yield the dinuclear [μ-(η2-thiobenzaldehyde)(μ-SCH2Ph)(ZrCp 2)2 +] cation complex 14. A similar reaction is observed upon treatment of Cp2Zr(SC2H5)2 (15) with 12 to yield the thioacetaldehyde-bridged dinuclear metallocene cation complex Cp2Zr-μ-(η2-MeCHS)-μ-(SEt)ZrCp2 (16).
