It is again easier to identify areas of activity than to point towards specific advances, with active research dominated by organometallics with a view to catalytic activity; alkoxides, amides and related compounds that can afford thin films of compounds like TiO2; and TiO2 itself. Lesser delights include the identification of the TBPY [ZrCl5]- anion and the giant titanium polyoxotungstate with four tri-Ti IV-1,2,3-substituted Î±-Dawson substructures.
