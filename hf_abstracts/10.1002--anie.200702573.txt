(Chemical Equation Presented) Worth the wait! Hafnium, a largely underrated element, showed unexpected C-H and Si-C bond activation chemistry, which was found during the course of the first synthesis of hafniumbis(silyl)alkyne complexes. As for the case of N2-activation, hafnium proves to be superior to zirconium in this respect. Â© 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.
