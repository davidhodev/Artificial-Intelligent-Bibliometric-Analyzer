The reactions of several α,ω-diynes with half-open titanocene complexes [M(C5H5)(2,4-C7H11)(PR3)] (C7H11 = dimethylpentadienyl) lead to 5 + 2 + 2 ring constructions, yielding nine-membered rings fused to four-membered and larger rings. These reactions tolerate significant functionalization, even allowing for the presence of heteroatoms such as oxygen and nitrogen. The nine-membered rings provide both allyl and diene coordination to the Ti(C5H5) fragments, resulting in 16 electron configurations. On standing, these species undergo cage rearrangements, via C{single bond}C bond activation reactions. Structural data have been obtained for a number of the fused ring species, as well as one of the rearrangement products. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
