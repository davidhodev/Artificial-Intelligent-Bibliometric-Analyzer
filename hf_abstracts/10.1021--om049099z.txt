The zirconocene methyl cations [(C 5R 5)ZrMe(ClC 6D 5)] [B(C 6F 5) 4] (C 5R 5 = C 5H 5 (1a), C 5H 4Me (1b)) react with PhSiH 3 in the dark to yield [{(C 5R 5) 2Zr(μ-H)} 2][B(C 6F 5) 4] 2 (5a, b) and a mixture of Ph xMe yH zSi products. The reaction proceeds by initial Zr-C/Si-H σ-bond metathesis via a four-center transition state in which Si is β to Zr. In the presence of light, significant amounts of [{(C 5R 5) 2Zr(μ-Cl)} 2] [B(C 6F 5) 4] 2 (4a,b) are formed by photochemical reaction of (C 5R 5) 2ZrH + species with the chlorobenzene solvent. The azazirconacycle [rac-(EBI)Zr{η 2(C,N)-CH 2CHMe(6-phenyl-2-pyridyl)}] [B(C 6F 5) 4] (2, EBI = 1,2-ethylene-bis-indenyl) does not react with PhSiH 3 at 23°C. However at 85°C, 2 deinserts propene to afford the η 2-pyridyl complex [rac-(EBI)Zr{η 2(C,N)-(6-phenyl-2-pyridyl)}][B(C 6F 5) 4] (6), which is catalytically isomerized to [rac-(EBI)Zr{η 2(C,N)-2-(2-pyridyl)phenyl}][B(C 6F 5) 4] (7) by PhSiH 3. The key step in this process is Zr-G/Si-H σ-bond metathesis of 6 with PhSiH 3 via a transition state in which Si is α to Zr. The less crowded azazirconacycle [Cp 2Zr{η 2(C,N)-CH 2CHMe-(6-methyl-2-pyridyl) }][B(C 6F 5) 4] (3) reacts with PhSiH 3 directly to afford [{Cp 2Zr(SiPhH 2)} 2]-[B(C 6F 5) 4] 2 (8) via a transition state in which Si is α to Zr. Steric factors may play a role in determining the selectivity of these reactions. © 2005 American Chemical Society.
