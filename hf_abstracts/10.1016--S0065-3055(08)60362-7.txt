This chapter discusses the synthesis, structural aspects, and basic chemical properties of formally divalent and trivalent titanium and zirconium metallocene complexes. The synthesis and handling of low-valent titanium and zirconium metallocenes require special experimental procedures because of the extreme sensitivity of the compounds toward oxygen, moisture, and sometimes even dinitrogen. The elements of the first transition series from vanadium to nickel form stable bis(η-cyclopentadienyl) complexes having the normal η-sandwich structure, typical of ferrocene. Other attempts have been made at preparing dinitrogen reactive titanocenes. Several possible routes to the preparation of [η-C5(CH3)5]2Ti have been explored. The best method for preparing pure permethyltitanocene is via dinitrogen adduct. This interesting reduction of the C10H7moiety probably occurs via a successive protonation of the relatively electron-rich naphthyl ligand. The exceptional chemical inertness of dinitrogen, which is related to its high ionization potential, low electron affinity, and the abnormal strength of the N≡N bond are well recognized. The chemistry of titanium and zirconium, bis(η-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) systems is essentially that of monomeric [η-C5(CH3)2]2M units. © 1981, Academic Press, Inc.
