PhCH(K)NMe2 and LiCH2NMe2 react with zirconocene or hafnocene chlorides in THF to give satisfactory yields of their (dimethylamino)alkyl derivatives. Cp2Zr(R)CH(Ph)NMe2 (R = Cl, 5; R = Me, 6) was prepared by treating Cp2Zr(R)Cl with PhCH(K)NMe2. Cp(η5-C5H4R)M(Cl)CH2N(CH3)2 (M = Zr, X = Cl, R = H, 7; M = Hf, X = Cl, R = H, 8; M = Zr, X = Cl, R = CPh(CH3)2, 11) was prepared by treating the appropriate metallocene dichloride with LiCH2N(CH3)2. Acidic reagents (CF3CO2H, CpMo(CO)3H, [n-Bu3NH][BPh4]) cleaved the methyl ligand from 6 and gave the -O2CCF3 complex (10), the -(μ-OC)Mo(CO)2Cp complex (12), or the solvated cation (13). Complex 7 did not react with excess LiCH2N(CH3)2, LiPh, MeI, CO(g) (1 atm), or Na(Hg), but a low yield of its methyl derivative was obtained by treating it with LiCH3. The inequivalence of the N-methyl groups in the 1H NMR spectra of complexes 5, 6, and 10–13 at low temperatures showed that the CH(R)NMe2 ligands were bound in an η2 fashion. Simulation of the temperature-dependent 1H NMR spectra of CDCl3 solutions of 11 gave ΔH‡ and ΔS‡ values of 17.1 ± 0.8 kcal/mol and 2.3 ± 2.7 eu, respectively, for N-methyl exchange. The Zr-N interaction energy in 11 can thus be estimated at 8 kcal/mol. © 1992, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
