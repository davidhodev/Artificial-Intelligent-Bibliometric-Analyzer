This review presents developments in the young field of dehydrogenative coupling reactions of phosphines. Catalytic phosphorus-element bond formation via dehydrocoupling has rapidly expanded since the first discoveries in the mid 1990s. A survey of the available catalysts, P-P and P-E products, and mechanistic understanding is presented with emphasis on the emerging synthetic applications of this reaction.
