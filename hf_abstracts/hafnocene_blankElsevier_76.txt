6 , 6-Dialkylfulvenes and 6 , 6-polymethylenefulvenes only undergo exocyclic double-bond addition with treatment of benzylsodium. Twenty-two novel titanocenes and zirconocenes with chiral or achiral substituents have been synthesized by complexation of substituted cyclopentadienyl anions obtained from the above reactions with TiCl4 , ZrCl4 or (CpTiCl2)2O. Reaction mechanism and 1H NMR spectra have been discussed.
