This paper describes ethylene polymerization using four kinds of zirconocene with different substituents in the Cp ring as catalysts and aluminoxane as cocatalyst. Polymerization activities, polymerization kinetics and Mη of resultant polyethylene were compared. It was found basically that polymerization activities were in the following order: A2 ≅ B2 > A1 > B1 [A1: (CH2 = CH - CH2 - CH2 - Cp)2 ZrCl2; B1: (CH2 = CH - CH2 - CH2 - CH2-CP)2 ZrCl2; A2: (CH2 = C(CH3) - CH2 - Cp)2 ZrCl2; B2: (CH3 (CH3) C = CH - CH2CP)2 ZrCI2]. A novel kinetic model was developed based on the consideration of reactivation reaction. A possible mechanism of influence of different substituents in the Cp ring on polymerization activities was discussed.
