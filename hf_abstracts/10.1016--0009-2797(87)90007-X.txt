Dichloro-bis(η 5 -cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) and some related complexes were compared with cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum(II) in rats for 1. (a)|acute anti-inflammatory activity against carrageenan paw oedema 2. (b)|anti-arthritic activity against developing and established adjuvant-induced polyarthritis 3. (c)|immunosuppressant activity in a local graft-vs.-host assay 4. (d)|irritant effects at sites of administration (paw, skin, peritoneum) and 5. (e)|nephro- and gastro-toxicities. These titanium complexes, like cisplatin and its hydrolysis products, in vivo exhibited both anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic activity as well as immunosuppressant effects. Nephro- and gastro-toxicity were much less severe than in rats given platinum complexes. In vitro they selectively inhibited [ 3 H] thymidine incorporation by isolated thymocytes and prevented the germination of radish seeds. When given intraperitoneally, the anti-inflammatory activity may partly be due to a counter-irritant phenomenon since the titanium derivatives elicited an acute peritoneal effusion if they were injected towards the omentum. However, when injected subcutaneously or applied in dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide to the skin, they manifested both anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic activity without irritancy or much local skin damage. They might therefore have the potential of being useful drugs, especially if released slowly. © 1987.
