The termination processes of zirconocene-MAO olefin polymerization catalyst under high pressure of 100-1500 MP were studied. It was found that the ratios of olefinic polymer ends depend on the reaction pressure, and trans-vinylene groups predominantly form under high pressures. The Î²-hydrogen transfer to olefin was accelerated under 500 MPa in hexene polymerization with (C5H4Me)2ZrCl2.
