An ansa-zirconocene complex having a vicinally di-tert-butyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand, Me 2 Si(C 5 H 4 )(C 5 H 2 -3,4-t-Bu 2 )ZrCl 2 (1), has been synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction (orthorhombic, space group: Pbca, a=18.3690(8), b=18.0749(12), c=13.2039(9) Å, V=4383.9(4) Å 3 , Z=8, R=0.0283, R w =0.0291). Complex 1 has a very much twisted structure due to its steric repulsion. In solution, however, the two tert-butyl groups are magnetically equivalent even at -80°C, indicating very fast oscillation of the bridged cyclopentadienyl unit with respect to the metal center. Complex 1 and nonbridged zirconocene dichlorides with tert-butyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl ligands, (C 5 H 4 -t-Bu) 2 ZrCl 2 (2), (C 5 H 3 -1,2-t-Bu 2 ) 2 ZrCl 2 (3) and (C 5 H 3 -1,3-t-Bu 2 ) 2 ZrCl 2 (4), have been employed as methylaluminoxane (MAO)-activated catalysts for polymerization of 1-hexene under high pressure conditions (100-750 MPa=ca. 1000-7500 atm). Comparison with some non and methyl-substituted metallocenes are also discussed.
