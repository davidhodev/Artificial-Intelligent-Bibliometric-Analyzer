Reaction of Et2NSi(SiMe3)3 with potassium tert-butoxide gives the silylenoid Et2N(Me3Si) 2SiK. Structural characterisation and reactivity of this compound was studied. It was found that while Et2N(Me3Si) 2SiK exhibits the typical NMR spectroscopic properties for a silylenoid species it does not undergo self-condensation under ambient conditions. Its reaction with zirconocene and hafnocene dichlorides gave the expected silyl metallocene chloride. However, there seems to be no strong interaction between the amino nitrogen atom and the group-4 metal. Besides the synthesis of Et2N(Me3Si)2-SiK also the preparation of the related silylenoid compound (Et2N) 2(Me3Si)SiK and was accomplished. Â© Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 2008.
