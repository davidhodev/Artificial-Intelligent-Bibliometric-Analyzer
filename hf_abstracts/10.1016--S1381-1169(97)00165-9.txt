The (conjugated diene) group 4 metallocenes la-d (diene - butadiene, isoprene; metallocene = CP2Zr, Cp2Hf, MeCp2Zr) add B(C6F5)3 to yield the metallacyclic M ··· F-C bridged metallocene-borate-betaine complexes 3a-d. These add one equivalent of acetylene to give the chiral metallacyclic insertion products 5a-d that can be described as either intramolecular ion-pair type complexes involving interaction of the negatively polarized terminal -CH=CH-CH2-[B] group of the resulting σ-ligand system with the positively polarized metallocene moiety of the dipolar betaine product or ρ2-internal alkene metallocene complexes, respectively, as it is revealed by a comparison with the related acyclic THF-addition products 10 and 12. Propyne inserts unselectively into the terminal Zr-C bond of the complexes 3a-c. In each case a 1:1 mixture of the regioisomers 6a-c (methyl at C2) and 7a-c (methyl group at Cl) is obtained.
