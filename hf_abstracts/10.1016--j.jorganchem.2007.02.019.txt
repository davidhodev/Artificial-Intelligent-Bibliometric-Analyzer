The synthesis and characterization of the new, 16 electron half-open zirconocenes, Zr(C5H5)(c-C8H11)(PR3) (R = Me, Et) are reported, together with a structural study of the PEt3 complex. As with other low valent half-open zirconocenes, the Zr-C distances are significantly shorter on average for the electronically open dienyl ligand than those for the C5H5 ligand, 2.343 vs. 2.512 Å. Reaction of either of these compounds with PhC2Ph led to the incorporation of two equivalents of the alkyne, resulting in a formally 14 electron complex with coordination from cyclopentadienyl, allyl, σ-alkyl, and σ-vinyl units. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.
