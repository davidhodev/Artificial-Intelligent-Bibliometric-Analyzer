Complexes of Group 4 metallocenes in the +3 oxidation state and amidoborane or phosphidoborane function as efficient precatalysts for the dehydrocoupling/dehydrogenation of amine-boranes, such as Me 2NH·BH3 (see scheme). Such TiIII- amidoborane complexes are generated in [Cp2Ti]-catalyzed amine-borane dehydrocoupling reactions, for which diamagnetic MII and M IV species have been previously postulated as precatalysts and intermediates. © 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
