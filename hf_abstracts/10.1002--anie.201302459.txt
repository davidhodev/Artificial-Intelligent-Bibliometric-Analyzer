The more, the better: Treatment of [Pt(H)2(dcpe)] (dcpe=1,2-bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane) with stoichiometric amounts of silane leads to the bis(silyl) complex [Pt{Si(OMe)3} 2(dcpe)], whereas the use of an excess silane results in hydrodealkoxylations by repetitive Si-O bond activation and the formation of SiH3 ligands (see scheme; Cy=cyclohexyl).
