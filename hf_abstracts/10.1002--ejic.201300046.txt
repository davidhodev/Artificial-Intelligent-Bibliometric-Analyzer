Borylation of hafno-and zirconocene complexes [(η5-C 5H2- 1,2,4-Me3)2M] 2(μ2,η2,η2-N 2), containing strongly activated dinitrogen ligands, with pinacolborane (HBPin) resulted in N-B and M-H bond formation. Treatment of the borylated products with carbon monoxide triggered N-N bond scission with concomitant N-C bond formation to produce μ-borylimido and μ-formamidido fragments. Conversely, addition of tBuNC resulted in insertion of the isocyanide ligand into the M-H bonds and furnished the corresponding η2- iminoacylhafnocene complexes. © 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
