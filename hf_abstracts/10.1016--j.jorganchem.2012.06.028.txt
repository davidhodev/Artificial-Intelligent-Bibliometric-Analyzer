Several titanocene(IV) complexes with different carboxylato ligands such as 3-methoxyphenylacetic acid (3-mpa-COOH), 4-methoxyphenylacetic acid (4-mpa-COOH), 1,4-benzodioxane-6-carboxylic acid (bdo-COOH), 2,5-dimethyl-3-furoic acid (dmf-COOH) and 4-(4-morpholinyl)benzoic acid (mbz-COOH) have been synthesized. All the novel titanocene(IV) carboxylate complexes have been characterized by traditional spectroscopic methods, with the molecular structures of [Ti(η 5-C 5H 5) 2(OOC-dmf) 2] (7) and [Ti(η 5-C 5H 4Me) 2(OOC-dmf) 2] (8) being determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Complexes were tested against the tumour cell line A2780 (ovarian cancer) and showed notable cytotoxicity. In addition, a study of the interaction of 7 and 8 with DNA (probably one of the biological target-molecules of the titanocene derivatives) monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy has been carried out. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
