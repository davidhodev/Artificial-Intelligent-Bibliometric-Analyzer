Three procedures were developed for the preparation of Cp2ZrH{(μ-H)2BC4H8}, 1. It can be prepared from the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with K[H2B2(μ-H)(μ-C4H8) 2] in a 1:2 molar ratio; the reaction of Cp2ZrCl{(μ-H)2BC4H8} with K[H2B2(μ-H)(μ-C4H8) 2] in a 1:1 molar ratio; and the reaction of Cp2ZrCl{(μ-H)2BC4H8} with LiH in a 1:1 molar ratio. Although the first and second procedures imply the possible synthesis of Cp2Zr{(μ-H)2BC4H8}2, this compound is not formed. © 1999 American Chemical Society.
