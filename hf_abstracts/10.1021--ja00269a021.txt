The reaction of lithiated benzhydryl methyl ether with zirconocene dichloride yields Cp2ZrCl(CPh2OCH3) (8). The molecular structure of 8 in the crystal was determined by X-ray diffraction. 8 crystallizes in the space group P212121 with cell constants a = 7.593 (2) A, b = 11.599 (3) A, c = 22.933 (6) A, and gcalcd= 1.49 g cm-1for Z = 4. The most remarkable structural feature of 8 is the strong intramolecular coordination of the ether oxygen to the zirconium center. The oxygen binds to the available central position in the bent metallocene σ-ligand plane. The resulting metallaoxirane structural subunit is characterized by bond distances 2.395 (6) A (Zr-C), 2.215 (4) A (Zr-O), and 1.450 (7) A (O-C). Upon heating to 40 °C, 8 decomposes to give tetraphenylethylene and Cp2Zr(OCH3)Cl as the major components. With zirconium hydrides Cp2Zr(H)Cl or Cp2ZrH2 8 reacts by intra- and intermolecular insertion reactions of the CPh2 group into the zirconium-hydrogen bond to give two pairs of compounds: Cp2Zr(OCH3)Cl (9)/Cp2Zr(CHPh2)Cl (24) and Cp2ZrCl2 (6)/Cp2Zr(CHPh2)OCH3(25). These reactions are strongly reminiscent of the chemistry of the CH2 species on a Fischer-Tropsch catalyst surface. Metallaoxiranes as 8 might, therefore, be considered to serve as molecular models for Fischer-Tropsch type chemistry on metal oxide surfaces. This view is supported by the observation that the bridging metallaoxirane unit in (μ-formaldehyde)(Cp2ZrCl)2(1) undergoes the same type of insertion reaction. Its CO-derived methylene unit is transferred to form (Cp2ZrCl)2O (29) and Cp2Zr(CH3)Cl (22) when treated with the oligomeric zirconocene (hydrido) chloride 3 at 55 °C. © 1986, American Chemical Society.
