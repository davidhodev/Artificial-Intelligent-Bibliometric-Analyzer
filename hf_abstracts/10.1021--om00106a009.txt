Bis(alkynyl)zirconocene and -hafnocene complexes (R1Cp)2M(C≡CR)2 (6) were prepared by reacting metallocene dihalides (R1Cp)2MCl2 (R1 = H, CH3, terf-butyl) with alkynyl anion equivalents. Subsequent comproportionation of 6 with additional (R1Cp)2MCl2 yielded mono(alkynyl)metallocene chlorides 7. Complexes 6 and 7 were treated with zirconocenes (R2Cp)2Zr, generated in situ from the corresponding (η4-butadiene)metallocene systems to give binuclear alkynyl-bridged complexes (R1Cp)2M(μ-Cl)(μ-C≡ CR)Zr(CpR2)2 (9) or (R1Cp2)M(μ-C≡CR)2Zr(CpR2)2 (10), respectively (M = Zr, Hf; R1 R2= H, CH3, t-Bu; R = CH3, Ph). The X-ray crystal structure analysis of Cp2Zr(C≡CCH3)2 (6a) revealed no noticeable conjugative interaction of the 16-electron d0-configurated early-transition-metal center with the acetylenic π-system. Complex 6a crystallizes in space group Pnc2 with cell constants a = 7.3099 (7) Å, b = 14.2440 (9) Å, c = 6.5299 (5) Å; d(Zr-C(1)) = 2.249 (3), C(1)-C(2) = 1.206 (4) Å; C(1)-Zr-C(1*) = 103.6 (1)°, Zr-C(1)-C(2) = 177.0 (3) °. In contrast, the metal-acetylide unit in the Cm symmetric (H3CCp)2Zr(C≡CPh) dimer (10f) has a much shorter Zr-Cα bond (2.188 (2) Å), as revealed by X-ray diffraction. Together with the other pertinent bonding features [d(Cα≡Cβ) = 1.261 (2) Å;. Zr*-Cα/Cβ = 2.431 (2)/2.407 (2) Å; Zr•••Zr* = 3.506 (1) Å; Cα•••Cα* = 3.018 (2) Å] this indicates a substantial π-interaction between the metal and the C≡CR unit of the binuclear complexes of type 10. Nevertheless, complexes 10 are highly fluxional—the alkynyl ligands undergo rapid intramolecular exchange between adjacent metal centers (ΔG* ≈ 12–15 kcal/mol). For one example, the (t-BuCp)2Zr(μ-C≡CCH3)2ZrCp2 system, the temperature-dependent dynamic NMR spectra have disclosed the presence of a novel C2v symmetric binuclear species (13a) equilibrating with the Cs symmetric doubly alkynyl-bridged complex 10d. This may indicate that in such systems the automerization process by sequential σ-alkynyl ligand migrations (via 13) is favored over the concerted exchange involving the common D2h symmetric transition state. © 1989, American Chemical Society.
