Binary metallocene-MAO and ternary diphenylzinc-metallocene-MAO initiator systems have been tested as initiators in the homopolymerization of styrene and also in its copolymerization with several diverse comonomers including substituted styrenes, styrene derivatives, α-olefins and dienes. Various titanocenes and zirconocenes and some exploratory experiment with hafnocene were carried out. The results indicate that titanocenes were more effective than zirconocenes in the homopolymerization of styrene while zirconocenes did better in α-olefin polymerization. It was found that titanocenes generated mainly syndiotactic polystyrene, s-PS, while zirconocenes yielded atactic polystyrene or, depending on the zirconocene, a low percentage of s-PS. For these types of initiators the polymerization process depends largely on the inductive effect of the substituents linked to the benzene ring of styrene and on its position (ortho, meta or para). Substituent multiplicity reduced markedly the effectiveness of these initiator systems. Styrene/isoprene polymerization was also studied using binary zirconocene-MAO initiator systems that yielded low conversions and also low molecular weight polymers.
