The reaction of Cp2Zr(CH 2 CH2R 1 )2 with a monosubstituted terminal alkene (H 2 C=CHR 2 ) can produce, in a highly regio- and diastereoselective manner, zirconacyclopentane derivatives; the trans-3,4-disubstituted derivatives may be formed to the extents of >98% in cases where both R 1 and R 2 are alkyl, while the trans-2-aryl-4-alkyl derivatives may be formed to the extents of >98% in the coupling between a monoalkyl-substituted olefin and styrene or its derivative.
