A new method has been developed to synthezise group 4 metallocene ylides. Ph3PCH2 reacts with in situ generated (η2-ethene)MCp2 (M = Zr, Hf), (η2-aryne)MCp2 (M = Ti, Zr), or with (η4-conjugated diene)MCp2 (M = Zr, Hf) via intramolecular hydrogen transfer to form metallocene ylides Cp2M(R)CHPPh3. In some cases competitive methylene transfer occurs leading to four-membered metallacycles. The metallocene ylides all exhibit a substantial metal to carbon π-interaction, increasing in strength on going from hafnium to titanium as the central metal atom. Ylide reactivity is greatly reduced. With a non-enolizable ketone, Cp2Zr(CH2CHCHCH3)CHPPh3 reacts via the reverse of the metallocene ylide forming reaction. With enolizable ketones, zirconocene or hafnocene ylides serve as bases and form metal enolates. The resulting enolate (E)/(Z) ratio strongly depends on the group R of the metallocene ylide base Cp2Zr(R)CHPPh3. © 1987.
