Zirconocene and hafnocene dichlorides react with appropriate organolithium reagents to form stable dimethyl and diphenyl derivatives, in the same manner as does titanocene dichloride. The bis(π-indenyl) dihalides of titanium, zirconium, and hafnium likewise lead to dimethyl and diphenyl compounds which in general appear to be more stable than the corresponding π-cyclopentadienyl derivatives. An analysis has been undertaken of trends in the nmr spectra of these new series of organometallic compounds, both with respect to the nature of the metal and to the nature of the π-bonded ligand. The formation and properties of bis(π-indenyl)bis(σ-pentafluorophenyl) titanium and the new titanium metallocycle 5,5-bis(π-indenyl)dibenzotitanole are also described. © 1973, American Chemical Society.
