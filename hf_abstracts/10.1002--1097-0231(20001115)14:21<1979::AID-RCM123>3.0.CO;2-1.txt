The electron ionisation mass spectrometric behaviour of a new series of hafnocene and zirconocene chioroalcoholates is discussed. These data are also compared with those of mass-analysed ion kinetic energy spectrometry. With respect to dialcoholato complexes previously studied by us, the monochloro-alcoholato species show rather high intensities in their molecular ion peaks, which reflects their higher volatility and sufficient stability in the vapour phase. Fragmentation patterns of the complexes in question give relevant information on their gas-phase behaviour and also on the influence of the ligand structure on the decomposition pathways. The complexes in question appear to be promising precursors for metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.
