The reduction of symmetric, fully-substituted titanocene dichlorides bearing two pendant ω-alkenyl groups, [TiCl2(η5-C5Me4R)2], R = CH(Me)CH= CH2 (1a), (CH2)2CH=CH2 (1b) and (CH2)3CH=CH2 (1c), by magnesium in tetrahydrofuran affords bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanacyclopentanes [TiIV{η1:η1: η5:η5-C5Me 4CH(Me)CH(Ti)CH2CH(CH2-(Ti))CH(Me)C 5Me4}] (2a), [TiIV{η1:η1:η5 η5-C5Me4(CH2) 2CH(Ti)(CH2)2CH(Ti)-(CH2) 2C5Me4}] (2b) and [TiIV{η1:η1:η 5:η5-C5Me4(CH2) 2CH(Ti)CH(Me)CH(Me)-CH(Ti)(CH2)2C 5Me4}] (2c), respectively, as the products of oxidative coupling of the double bonds across a titanocene intermediate. For the case of complex 1c, a product of a double bond isomerisation is obtained owing to a preferred formation of five-membered titanacycles. The reaction of the titanacyclopentanes with PbCl2 recovers starting materials 1a from 2a and 1b from 2b, but complex 2c affords, under the same conditions, an isomer of 1c with a shifted carbon-carbon double bond, [Ti-Cl2{η5-C5Me4(CH 2CH2CH=CHMe)}2] (1c′). The titanacycles 2a-c can be opened by HCl to give ansa-titanocene dichlorides ansa-[{η5:η5-C5Me 4CH(Me)-CH2CH2CH(Me)CH(Me)C5Me 4}TiCl2] (3a), ansa-[{η5:η5-C5Me4(CH 2)8C5Me4}-TiCl2] (3b), along with a minor product ansa-[{η5:η5-C5Me4CH 2CH=CH(CH2)5-C5Me 4}TiCl2] (3b′), and ansa-[{η5:η5-C5Me4(CH 2)3CH(Me)CH(Me)CH=CH-CH2C5Me 4}TiCl2] (3c), respectively, with the bridging aliphatic chain consisting of five (3a) and eight (3b, 3b′ and 3c) carbon atoms. The course of the acidolysis changes with the nature of the pendant group; while the cyclopentadienyl ring-linking carbon chains in 3a and 3b are fully saturated, compounds 3c and 3b′ contain one asymetrically placed carbon-carbon double bond, which evidently arises from the β-hydrogen elimination that follows the HCl addition.
