The new compounds [Zr{Me2C(η-C5H4) 2}(cis-η-C4H6)] (2*), [Zr{Me2C(η-C5H4)2}Ph 2] (3), [Zr{Me2C(C5H4)2}-(cis-η 4C4H4Me2)] (4*), [Zr{Me2C(η-C5H4) 2}(cis-η4-PhC4H4Ph)] (5), [Zr{Me2C(η-C5H4)2Cl} 2-μ-O] (6*), [Zr{Me2-C(η-C5H4)2}{η 3-C4H6B(C6F5) 3}] (7), [Zr{Me2C(η-C5H4) 2}{exo-η3-C4H6B(C 6F5)3}PMe3] (8*), [Zr{Me2C(η-C5H4) 2}-{endo-η3-C4H6B(C 6F5)3}C6H5N] (9*), and [Zr{Me2C(η-C5H4)2}{Endo- and exo-η3-C4H6B(C6F 5)3}NC′Bu] (10a) and (10b) have been prepared. An asterisk indicates the crystal structure has been determined. The photoelectron spectra of 2 and 4 have been determined and assigned with the assistance of density functional methods. The factors relating to the relative stability of cis- and frans-butadiene structures for 2 and 4 are discussed. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2000.
