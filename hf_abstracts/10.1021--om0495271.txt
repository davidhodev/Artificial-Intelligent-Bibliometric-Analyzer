A series of a half-sandwich trihydrides of ruthenium was synthesized and investigated using x-ray diffraction. The reaction of ruthenium trihydrides with chlorosilanes occurred in complex manner and resulted in various products. With more acidic silanes, HSiCl2Me and HSiCl3, the formation of the Ru-Cl bond becomes reaction route. Results show that Ruthenium compound can support the occurrence of H-Si interaction in its silyl hydride derivatives.
