Methylzirconocene cation [Cp2ZrCH3+] (2) adds readily to (butadiene)zirconocene to yield the dimetallic cationic complex [(Cp2Zr)(μ-CH3)(μ-butadiene)(ZrCp2) +] (4) (both cations with CH3B(C6F5)3- (a) or B(C6F5)4- (b) counteranion). The spectroscopic analysis indicates the presence of a C2-symmetrical bridging mode of the transoid μ-η2:η2-conjugated diene ligand. Treatment of 4a with Cp2Zr(CH3)Cl results in the formation of the μ-chloro-bridged system [(Cp2Zr)2(μ-Cl)(μ-C4H6) +] (4d), that yields [(Cp2Zr)2(μ-CC-CH3)(μ-C4H 6)+] (4e) upon treatment with propynyl lithium.
