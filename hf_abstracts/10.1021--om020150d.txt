The reactions initiated by the magnesium reduction of silicon-modified titanocene dichlorides [TiCl2(Î·5-C5Me4SiMe2 R)2] were reported. The features in subsequent oxidative addition reactions due to the presence of the silylene groups and different lengths of the silylalkenyl groups were showed. Pendant double bonds were used as reactive functionalities for modification of the parent bent metallocene structures.
