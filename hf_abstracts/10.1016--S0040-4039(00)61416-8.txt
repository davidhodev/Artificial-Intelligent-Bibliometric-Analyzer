The carbon-carbon bond formation reactions of diynes with EtMgBr can be catalysed by Cp2ZrCl2. The final products, magnesiated enynes, readily undergo stereoisomerization to give a mixture of (E) and (Z) isomers. The stoichiometric reaction of diynes with ethylene zirconocene gives zirconacyclopentenes with alkynyl substituents in the α position with high regioselectivities. © 1993.
