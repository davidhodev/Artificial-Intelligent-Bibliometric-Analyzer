The metallatricyclic (η2-formaldehyde)zirconocene dimer 10 reacts with metal carbonyl complexes LnM(CO) 4 [LnM = Mo(CO)5, W(CO)5, CpCo(CO), CpRh(CO), CpV(CO)3, (C6F5)2Pt(CO)] to give the metallatricyclic zirconoxycarbene complexes Cp2Zr(μ-OCH2)ZrCp2(μ-OCH2C[=MLn]O) 12a-f in good yield. In each case, only one of the two Cp2ZrOCH2 metallaoxirane units of 10 can be reacted with the [M]-C=O functionality. Under equilibrium conditions, the oxygen atom in the five-membered metallacycle adjacent to the CH2 group bridges the zirconium center of the Cp2ZrOCH2 structural subunit. In the photochemical-assisted W(CO)6 addition to [Cp2Zr(μ-OCH2)]2, a mixture of regioisomeric zirconoxycarbene complexes 12b and 16 is formed under kinetic control. In 16, an oxonium type oxygen atom is adjacent to the carbene carbon center. The metallatricyclic zirconoxycarbene rhodium complex Cp2Zr(μ-OCH2)ZrCp2(μ-OCH2C-[=RhCp(CO)]O) (12d) was characterized by X-ray diffraction. Complex 12d crystallizes in space group P21/n with cell parameter a = 11.537 (2) Å,b = 26.442 (5) Å, c = 12.249 (2) Å, β = 92.00 (2)°, Z = 4, R(Fo2) = 0.051, and Rw(Fo2) = 0.083. The Rh=C(carbene) bond is rather short at 1.930 (5) Å. © 1991, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
