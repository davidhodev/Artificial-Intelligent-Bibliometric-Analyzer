The first 77Se NMR was carried out on a titanocene diselenopyrocatechol derivative with Se bonded directly to the transition metal. Surprisingly, the Ti metallacycle shows, compared with Zr, a reversed shielding effect by proceeding from the non-cyclic Se system to the five-membered Se,Se′ co-ordinated heterocycle. This reflects the different bonding system in Ti and Zr bis (cyclopentadienyl) dichalcogenolene complexes. The results are discussed on the basis of the 77Se NMR spectra, the dynamic 1H NMR spectra (1H DNMR), and the V. B. and M. O. bonding theories. © 1988.
