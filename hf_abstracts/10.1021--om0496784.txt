Density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP level have been performed to investigate the mechanism of the zirconocene-catalyzed addition of the ortho C-H bond of α-picoline to propene to produce 2-Me-6- iPr-pyridine. The computational results support the proposed mechanism, which involves (i) 2-Me-pyridine dissociation from [Cp 2Zr(2-Me-6-pyridyl)(2-Me-pyridine)] + followed by the insertion of propene into the Zr-C bond of the η 2-pyridyl complex Cp 2Zr(η 2-2-Me-6-pyridyl) + (1) to yield the azametallacycle Cp 2Zr{η 2-C,N-CH 2CHMe-(2- Me-6-pyridyl)} + (2), (ii) hydrogenolysis of 2 to produce Cp 2Zr(H)(2-Me-6- iPr-pyridine)+ (3), (iii) ligand substitution of 3 by a-picoline to release 2-Me-6- iPr-pyridine and form Cp 2Zr(H)(2-Me-pyridine) + (4), and (iv) C-H activation of 4 to release H 2 and regenerate 1. Consistent with the experimental results, the 2-Me-pyridine dissociation from [Cp 2Zr(2-Me-6-pyridyl)(2-Me-pyridine)] + followed by the propene insertion of 1 and the hydrogenolysis of 2 are calculated to be the rate-determining steps. The calculations provide new insights into the role of the cocatalyst H 2, the origin of the regioselectivity of the C-H activation and insertion steps, and the preference for a-picoline/propene coupling over propene hydrogenation.
