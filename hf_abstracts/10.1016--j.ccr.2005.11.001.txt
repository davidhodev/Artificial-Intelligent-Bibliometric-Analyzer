A review with 172 references. Cyclopentadienyl (Cp) and its substituted congeners are among the most common ligands in organometallic chemistry. Ring substituents attached to Cp can influence the structure, physico-chemical properties, and reactivity of coordinated metal fragments. This article describes the synthesis of perfluoroaryl-substituted cyclopentadienes and indenes and their use as transition metal ligands. Emphasis is placed on trends in spectroscopic and electrochemical behavior, structure, and reactivity that arise from the highly electron-withdrawing character of the perfluoroaryl substituents.
