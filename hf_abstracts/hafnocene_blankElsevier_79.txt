The novel zirconocene complexes [Cp′2Zr(μ-H)(SiHR)]22+[BR′ n(C6F5)4-n]22- (Cp′ = Cp, MeCp, Me5Cp; R = Ph or PhCH2; R′ = Bu or H) were isolated from silane dehydropolymerization reaction mixtures catalyzed by Cp′2ZrCl2/2BuLi/B(C6F5) 3 or by [Cp′Zr(μ-H)H]2/2B(C6F5)3 combination catalysts. A total structure analysis of these compounds, performed by multinuclear, multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, shows that each zirconocene fragment bears a positive charge, which is delocalized between the metal center and hydrosilane ligand.
