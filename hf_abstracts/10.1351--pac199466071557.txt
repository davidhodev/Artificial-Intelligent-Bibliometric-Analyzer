Cationic zirconocene or hafnocene complexes serve as a novel class of Lewis acid with unique reactivities, which are to be exploited in organic synthesis. Four categories of reactivities are discussed, that is, (A) C-F bond activation/cleavage, (B) Coordinative activation of ether linkages, (C) Carbonyl activation, and (D) C-O bond cleavage via zirconocene alkoxide.
