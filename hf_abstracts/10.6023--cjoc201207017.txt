In the presence of 1.0 mol% zirconocene bis(perfluorooctanesulfonate)s, indoles reacted with aldehyde/ketone at room temperature in tetrahydrofuran for 10∼25 min to give diindolylmethane derivatives in 86%∼96% yields. The catalyst zirconocene bis(perfluorooctanesulfonate)s can be reused 6 times, and the conversion rate is still as high as 90%. This reaction does not require strict anhydrous conditions. This procedure provides a new and efficient way for preparing diindolylmethane derivatives.
