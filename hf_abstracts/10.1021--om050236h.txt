A series of 2-R 2P-substituted indenes, where R 2P = Ph 2P, Cy 2P, iPr 2P, and tBu(H)P, were obtained via Pd-catalyzed reactions of 2-bromo-1H-indene (or 1H-inden-2-yl trifluoromethane sulfonate) with R 2PH/Et 3N. Analogous indenes bearing Me 2P, tBu(Cl)P, and tBu 2P substituants at position 2 were obtained through the reaction of 1H-inden-2-ylphosphonous dichloride with MeLi, tBuMgCl, and tBuMgCl/ tBuLi-CuCN, respectively. Diethyl 1H-inden-2-ylphosphonate, prepared via the Ni-catalyzed Arbuzov reaction of 2-bromo-1H-indene with P(OEt) 3, was found to be a convenient starting material for the synthesis of 2-H 2P-substituted indene. 1H-Inden-2-yl(phenyl)phosphine, prepared via the Pd-catalyzed arylation of 2-H 2P-substituted indene by PhI, turned out to react with 2-bromo-1H-indene in the presence of Pd(PPh 3) 4 and Et 3N to form di(1H-inden-2-yl)(phenyl)phosphine in almost quantitative yield. Analogously, di(1H-inden-2-yl)(tert-butyl)phosphine was prepared via catalytic reaction of tBuPH 2 with 2 equiv of 2-bromo-1H-indene. Triethylamine-promoted condensation of indenes bearing P(H) tBu and P(Cl) tBu fragments gave a mixture of cis- and trans-bis-indenyldiphosphines. Zirconium complexes (2-R 2P-indenyl) 2ZrCl 2 (R 2P = Ph 2P, Me 2P, Cy 2P, iPr 2P, tBu 2P), as well as ansa-zirconocenes RP(2-indenyl) 2ZrCl 2 (R = Ph, tBu), were obtained in good yields from ZrCl 4(THF) 2 and lithium salts of the respective 2-P-substituted indenes. Ansa-zirconocene ( tBuP) 2(2-indenyl) 2ZrCl 2 including a P 2R 2 bridge was synthesized in a similar manner and isolated as the pure rac-isomer. Â© 2005 American Chemical Society.
