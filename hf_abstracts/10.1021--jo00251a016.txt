Group IVA metallocene complexes such as bis(n5-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dihydrides, Cp2ZrH2 (1), and hafnium dihydrides, Cp2HfH2 (8), catalyze the chemoselective reduction of polycarbonyl compounds to hydroxy carbonyl compounds. For instance, the reduction of keto aldehydes 3-ketobutanal (2g) and 2-phenyl-2-ketoethanal (2h) proceeded selectively at aldehyde group to provide the corresponding hydroxy ketones 3g and 3h in 91% and 93% yields, respectively. Under similar conditions, however, cyclohexanediones were easily aromatized to benzenediols. On the other hand, 1 and 8 also catalyze the selective 1,2-reduction of various types of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, giving the corresponding allylic alcohols in good to excellent yields. Thus, steroidal dicarbonyl compounds, having an enone framework in their molecules Δ4-androstene-3,17-dione (11a) and Δ4-progestene-3,20-dione (11b) were reduced by 1 to 17-hydroxy-Δ4-androsten-3-one (12a) and 20-hydroxy-Δ4-progest-3-one (12b), which are essential human hormones, in 80% and 67% yields, respectively. © 1988, American Chemical Society.
