Other zirconium catalysts, (N3N)ZrX [(N3N) = N(CH2CH2NSiMe2CH2)3, X = NMe2 (2), Cl (3), and OtBu (4)], were found to exhibit comparable activities to that of 1. Compound 1 reacts with Me2NHBH3 to give (N3N)Zr(NMe2BH3) (5), which was structurally characterized and features an η2 B-H σ-bond amido borane ligand. Because 5 is unstable with respect to borane loss to form 2, rather than β-hydrogen elimination, and 2-4 do not exhibit X ligand loss during catalysis, dehydrogenation is hypothesized to proceed via an outer-sphere-type mechanism. This proposal is supported by the catalytic hydrogenation of alkenes by 2 using amine boranes as the sacrificial source of hydrogen.
