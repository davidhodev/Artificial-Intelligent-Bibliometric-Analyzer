Bis[(5-hexenyl)cyclopentadienyl]zirconium dichloride (3) underwent ring-closure olefin metathesis with loss of ethylene when treated with 10 mol % of the [Cl2(PCy3)2Ru=CHPh] catalyst in refluxing dichloromethane, to yield the large ansa-zirconocene complex [dec-5-ene-1,10-diylbis(η5-cyclopentadienyl)]ZrCl2 (trans-4). Characterization by NMR and by X-ray diffraction revealed that the isolated complex contained a trans-C=C double bond inside the ansa bridge. Similarly, bis[(allyl)cyclopentadienyl]ZrCl2 (7) gave the ansametallocene [but-2-ene-1,4-diylbis(η5-cyclopentadienyl)]zirconium dichloride (cis-8) when treated with the same ruthenium metathesis catalysts (10 mol %) under similar conditions, except that a cis-C=C double bond was now found to be present (shown by NMR and X-ray diffraction). The cis-8 complex was used as a homogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalyst for ethylene polymerization [after activation of the metallocene dichloride 8 with MAO (methylalumoxane) or treatment of the corresponding dimethylmetallocene complex 9 with B(C6F5)3]. Complex 8 was also converted into a mixture of (scis- and s-trans-η4-butadiene)-ansa-metallocene complexes (s-cis-15/s-trans-15 = 4:5) by treatment with (butadiene)-magnesium. The C=C double bond of cis-8 could be hydroborated with 9-BBN or with the H-B(C6F5)2 reagent. Li+[B(C6F5)4-] added to cis-8 to yield an interesting solid-state chain structure in which the [Zr]Cl2 unit and the o-/mF pairs of two -C6F5 groups were found to be in contact with the central lithium cation in a distorted octahedral coordination environment (as shown by X-ray diffraction). © Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, 69451 Weinheim, Germany, 2002.
