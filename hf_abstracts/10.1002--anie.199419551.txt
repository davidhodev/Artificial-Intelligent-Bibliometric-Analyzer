Reminiscent of the chemistry of methylene on metal oxide surfaces, the cyclopropanation of the (formaldehyde)zirconocene dimer 1 with the alkenyl complexes 2 leads to the cyclopropyl complexes 4. The intermediates 3 were characterized by NMR spectroscopy. This reaction might contribute to the understanding of reactions on the metal oxide surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts.
