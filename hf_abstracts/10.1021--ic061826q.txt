The bis(stibido) complex CpCp*Hf(SbMes2)2 (2) was prepared and structurally characterized. Complex 2 reacts with 2 equiv of xylylisocyanide to give the bis-insertion product CpCp*Hf[C(SbMes 2)= N(2,6-MeC6H3)]2 (4). The reaction of 2 with oxidants (I2 and O2) or donors (carbon monoxide and diphenylacetylene) or thermolysis promotes the reductive elimination of Sb2Mes4. Â© 2006 American Chemical Society.
