© 2018 Elsevier Inc.This review gives an overview over the synthesis, properties, and new developments of fulvenes and fulvalenes as well as ammonium, pyridinium, phosphonium, and sulfonium cyclopentadienylides with respect to their use as (potential) ligands in addition reactions for the synthesis of cyclopentadienide complexes. The syntheses and properties of Cp-complexes bearing α-onium substituents (not necessarily prepared from the free onium-cyclopentadienylides) are also reviewed, and a comparison of the electronic properties of the ligands on the metal fragment is given. Other group 15 and group 16 as well as group 17 onium-cyclopentadienylides are also mentioned.
