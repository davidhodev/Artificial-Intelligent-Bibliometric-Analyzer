There are some striking reports, concerning the reduction of a titanium phosphine complex, under a N2 atmosphere, which afford P-N bonds; a deprotonation of a titanium formate complex, resulting in decarbonylation leading to a Ti(iv) oxoanion complex; and theoretical calculations that predict the possibility of titanium-substituted hydrocarbons.
