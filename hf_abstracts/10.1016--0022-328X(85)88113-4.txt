Polymer-attached Cp2ZrCl2, Cp2HfCl2, CpZrCl3, CpHfCl3, Cp2ZrCl and Cp3HfCl have been prepared. The polymer-attached Cp2ZrCl2, on reduction with BuLi, produced an active catalyst whose efficiency for olefin hydrogenation is about eight times as great as that of the corresponding homogeneous species under the same conditions. The reduction products of supported zirconocene and hafnocene complexes are active hydrogenation catalysts for diphenylacetylene which was hydrogenated to 1,2-diphenylethane through intermediate stilbene. The similar reduction products have also been employed in catalytic isomerization of allylbenzene, cis-stilbene and 1,5-cyclooctadiene. Allylbenzene was converted into a mixture of trans- and cis-propenylbenzene, cis-stilbene was isomerized to trans-stilbene, and 1,5-cyclooctadiene was isomerized to 1,3-cyclooctadiene through the 1,4-cyclooctadiene intermediate. Polymer-attached Cp2ZrCl2, CpZrCl3, Cp2HfCl2, and CpHfCl3 can be used directly, without going through the reduction process, for the low yield epoxidation of cyclohexene. Polymer-attached Cp2ZrCl2 was used in hydrozirconation and carbon monoxide reduction studies. Â© 1985.
