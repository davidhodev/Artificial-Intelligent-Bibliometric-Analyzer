The reactions of Î·2-(1-butene)zirconocene with (4R,5R)-di[(1S)-phenylethyl]amino-1,7-octadienes, carrying two vinyl or two phenyl substituents at C3 and C6, followed by protonation, gave a mixture of diastereomeric, fully substituted cyclohexanes. In the case of (4R,5R)-di[(1S)-phenylethyl]amino-(3R,6R)-diphenyl-1,7-octadiene, the main diastereomer of the product was isolated with 41% yield, then reductive removal of the N-substituents afforded (1R,2R)-diamino-(4R,SS)-dimethyl-(3R,6R)-diphenylcyclohexane with 91% yield.
