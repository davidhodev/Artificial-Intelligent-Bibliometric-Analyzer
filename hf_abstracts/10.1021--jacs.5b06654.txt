© 2015 American Chemical Society.We have investigated the reaction of isonitriles (RNC) with electronically unsaturated diene complexes of Ti and Hf. Cp (Cl)Ti(2,3-dimethylbutadiene) (1) reacts with 2 equiv of RNC to give Î•<sup>1</sup>,Î•<sup>2</sup>-diimine complexes 2 (R = <sup>t</sup>Bu) and 3 (R = 1-adamantyl). Cp(Cl)Ti(N,N-di-<sup>t</sup>Bu-Î•<sup>1</sup>,Î•<sup>2</sup>-diimine) (2), in the presence of pyridine, fragments to Cp(Cl)Ti(N<sup>t</sup>Bu)(NC<inf>5</inf>H<inf>5</inf>) (10) and an α-methylene cyclopent-3-enimine (11). The hafnium analogue of 1, Cp(Cl)Hf(2,3-dimethylbutadiene) (14), has been reported to give a cyclic amidine complex when treated with 2 equiv of 2,6-dimethylphenyl isonitrile. By X-ray crystallography, however, we find that 14 and 2,6-dimethylphenyl isonitrile give instead a 2,5-diazahafnacyclopentane that features a Ïinteraction between the C-C bond of a cyclopropane ring and the Hf.
