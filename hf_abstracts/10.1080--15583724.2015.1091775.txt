Â© 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.This review describes the recent advances in the chemistry of titanium-, zirconium-, and hafnium-containing polymers. The paper does not focus on the catalytic role of molecules including metal in their structure, but instead, on the different ways to incorporate these group 4 metals in macromolecular structures. The synthetic approaches of these structures are exposed, according to the three different routes listed, which are the blending, the chemical modification, and the direct polymerization. A particular interest is accorded to the applications of these group 4 metal-containing polymers, which impact various fields such as ceramic, biomedical, and photovoltaic materials.
