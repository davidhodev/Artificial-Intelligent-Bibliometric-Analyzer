Retentions following (n, γ) reactions in solid state and in solution in benzene were measured for 1,1′-trimethylenetitanocene dichloride and for the corresponding derivatives of zirconocene dichloride and hafnocence dichloride. Comparisons are made of these retentions with those previously measured for the parent compounds. Retentions in solution are best interpreted as due to a fast three-body recombination reaction for the parent compounds and to a fast two-body recombination reaction for the bridged derivatives. © 1977.
