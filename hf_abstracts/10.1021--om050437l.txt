The mixed silyl-stannyl-cyclopentadiene C5H 4[SiMe2(CH2CH=CH2)][Sn(nBu) 3] was synthesized by reaction of the lithium salt Li[C 5H4{SiMe2(CH2CH=CH2)}] with the corresponding chlorotrialkyltin and then reacted with HfCl4 to prepare the monocyclopentadienyl complex [Hf{η5-C 5H4SiMe2(CH2CH=CH 2)}Cl3-DME] (DME = dimethoxyethane). Reaction of this compound with Na(C5H5) or Li(C6H5) afforded low yields of the dichloro hafnocene [Hf(η5-C 5H5){η5-C5H4SiMe 2(CH2CH=CH2)}Cl2], which was also isolated more efficiently by transmetalation of the lithium salt Li[C 5H4{SiMe2(CH2CH=CH2)}] with [Hf(η5-C5H5)Cl3·DME] . Alkylation of the mono- and dicyclopentadienyl complexes with MgCl(CH 2Ph) or LiMe gave the tribenzyl monocyclopentadienyl [Hf{η{η5-C5H4SiMe2(CH 2CH=CH2)}(CH2Ph)3] or the dialkyl hafnocene derivatives [Hf(η5-C5H5) {η5-C5H4SiMe2(CH 2CH=CH2)}R2] (R = Me, CH2Ph). The reaction of the dibenzyl hafnocene with the Lewis acid B(C6F 5)3 was monitored by NMR spectroscopy at variable temperature. Formation of the hafnocenium cationic species [Hf- (η5-C5H5){η5-C 5H4SiMe2(CH2-η2-CH= CH2)}(CH2Ph)]+ was initially observed, which then slowly transformed into the metallacyclic alkyl [Hf(η5C 5H5){η5-C5H4SiMe 2CH2CH(CH2Ph)-η1-CH 2}]+ cation, resulting from the benzyl migratory insertion of the allylic alkene moiety. Reaction of these intermediate cationic species with KOtBu gave the neutral dicyclopentadienyl hafnocene compounds [Hf(η5-C5H5){η5-C 5H4SiMe2(CH2CH=CH 2)}(CH2Ph)(OtBu)] and [Hf(η5-C 5H5){η5-C5H4SiMe 2[CH2CH(CH2Ph)-η1-CH 2]}(OtBu)], which were characterized by elemental analyses and NMR spectroscopy. © 2005 American Chemical Society.
