Novel zirconocene or hafnocene-containing silsesquioxanes with a vinyl group Cp2M{[(vinyl)Me2Si](c-C5H9)7Si7O12} (Cp = cyclopentadienyl, M = Zr, Hf) were synthesized, as well as a derivative with a trimethylsilyl group Cp2Zr[(Me3Si)(c-C5H9)7Si7O12]. A derivative containing a dimethylethoxysilyl group was also synthesized.
