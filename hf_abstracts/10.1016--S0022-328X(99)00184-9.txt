A series of complexes Si2Me4L2ZrCl2 (L=Ind (1b), 2-Me-Ind (2b), 3-SiMe3-Ind (3b) and Ind-H4 (4)) was prepared. The syntheses of 1b, 3b and 4 gave predominantly the meso-isomers, whereas a 1:1 meso:rac mixture was obtained for 2b. X-ray analysis of meso-3b revealed large steric hindrance on the metal center (Cp°-Zr-Cp° is 134.6°). The 1:1 mixture of meso-2b and rac-2b (activated with MAO) produced a 2.2:1 mixture of elastic atactic and isotactic polypropylene with low activity. © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.
