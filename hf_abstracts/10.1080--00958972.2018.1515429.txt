Inverse coordination complexes are formed around a non-metal species as central atom (ion or small molecule) surrounded by a number of metal atoms (ions) connected or not by internal bridging (intramolecular) linkers. This article illustrates the diversity of species described under this concept with structures in which the coordination center is nitrogen (mono- and poly-nitrogen moieties).
