A protocol for asymmetric synthesis of chiral-at-metal complexes is described, but enantiomerically-enriched products can not be isolated due to formation of complexes between the Group 4 metallocene products and the borane by-products. An efficient method for synthesis of racemic chiral-at-metal metallocenes, through lithium chloride catalysed ligand redistribution reactions, is described. Sterically-hindered racemic chiral-at-metal complexes are prepared by nucleophilic substitution of prochiral dichlorides. Â© 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.
