The electron ionisation mass spectrometric behaviour of a new series of hafnocene and zirconocene dialcoholates is discussed. Deprotonated moieties of borneol and fenchyl alcohol were used as Ïƒ-ligands. These data are also compared to those of mass-analysed ion kinetic energy spectroscopy of the molecular ions. Fragmentation patterns of the complexes in question give relevant information on their gas-phase behaviour and also on the influence of the ligand structure on the decomposition pathways. The complexes in question appear to be promising metal-organic chemical vapour decomposition precursors.
