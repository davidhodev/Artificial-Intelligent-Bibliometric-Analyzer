The use of 'cation-like' metallocene combination catalysts (Cp′2MCl2-2BuLi-B(C6F5)3; Cp′ = η5-cyclopentadienyl, or substituted η5-cyclopentadienyl; M = Ti, Zr, Hf, U) for dehydropolymerization of silanes significantly improves the polymer molecular weight. For example, under the same conditions a Cp(C5Me5)ZrCl2-2BuLi catalyst gives Mn = 1890, while a Cp(C5Me5)ZrCl2-2BuLi-B(C6F5)3 gives Mn = 7270. The influence of various factors (steric and electronic effects of the cyclopentadienyl ligands, the nature of the metal, temperature, solvent, concentration and structure of silane) on the build-up of polysilane chains are systematically analyzed.
