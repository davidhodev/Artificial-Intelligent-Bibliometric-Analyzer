Some new 6,6-diaryl fulvenes were synthesized from the diaryl ketones. Their structures were characterized by IR, 1H NMR, MS spectra and elemental analysis. The different substituents on the aryl ketones determined the different base used in the reactions. For the electron withdrawing diaryl ketones, EtONa was used as base to yield satisfied results. But for the electron donating diaryl ketones, it was a good method to synthesize fulvenes using CpNa as base.
