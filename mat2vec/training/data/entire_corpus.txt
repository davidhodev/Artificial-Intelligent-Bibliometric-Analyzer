this paper represents an initial analysis of unsteady gaseous flows in a rectangular microchannel under usual pressure and temperature conditions the effect of depth and aspect ratios of the crosssection is investigated with most fluidbased mechanical microsystems of small internal dimensions and subject to normal pressure and temperature conditions flow is rarefied with slip at the walls this flow is then modeled by the navierstokes equations combined with slip and temperature jump conditions at the walls these conditions are represented by maxwellsmoluchowski first order equations by concentrating essentially on the pulsed sinusoidal regime it is shown that the instantaneous flow rate amplitude as well as the band pass of the microchannel are underestimated when slip at the walls is not taken into account the frequency response of two microchannels connected in series with different crosssectional areas is also studied finally the proposed model can serve as a tool giving information about the current feasibilities of pressure sensors for the measurement of the dynamic characteristics of gaseous flows in microchannels © elsevier paris
presented is an analytical description of the rapid two dimensional shearing flow of granular materials which results in expressions for the normal as well as the shear stress in terms of various flow parameters the rapid flow regime here is in accord with the graininertiadominated flow of granular materials as described by bagnold both gradients of velocity and microrotation of grains are taken into account and the final constitutive equations resemble those of a nonnewtonian microfluid for which the stresses depend on the square of the velocity gradients the square of microrotation gradients as well as the product of velocity gradients and microrotation gradients © 1981

as the field of microfluidics continues to grow it is becoming increasingly important to understand the mechanisms involved with heat transfer in twophase flow through microgeometries this importance is reiterated by the increasing number of applications which use phase change as the principal mechanism to conduct or remove heat the purpose of this study was to investigate fluid mechanic and heat transfer characteristics of twophase twocomponent flow in rectangular microchannels experiments were conducted using rectangular aluminum channels with hydraulic diameters ranging between 56 μm and 256 μm and aspect ratios which varied from 05 to 15 both single and twophase tests yielded excellent correlations of the friction factor reynolds number and the combination of reynolds number and prandtl number were the dominant parameters in the prediction of pressure drop and heat transfer rate respectively the pressure drop predictions based on available semiempirical relations for twophase flows were shown to substantially over predict the measured pressure drop other findings showed that for singlephase flow the transition from laminar to turbulent regimes of the friction factor was suppressed as the channel hydraulic diameter decreased twophase friction factor data indicated a definite transition from laminar to turbulent regimes at a reynolds number of 3000 for all channel configurations tested it is believed that the transition was due to the intense pressure fluctuations associated with twophase flows in both single and twophase experiments nusselt number data exhibited a trend similar to the macroscale turbulent regime correlations however the data were somewhat less than the macroscale predictions in contrast to the friction factor data both singleand twophase nusselt number data suggested no change in flow regimes occurred

emerging microfluidic systems have spurred an interest in the study of electrokinetic flow phenomena in complex geometries and a variety of flow conditions this paper presents an analysis of the effects of fluid inertia and pressure on the velocity and vorticity field of electroosmotic flows in typical onchip electrokinetics applications the flow field can be separated into an inner flow region dominated by viscous and electrostatic forces and an outer flow region dominated by inertial and pressure forces these two regions are separated by a slip velocity condition determined by the helmholtzsmoulochowski equation the validity of this assumption is investigated by analyzing the velocity field in a pressuredriven twodimensional flow channel with an impulsively started electric field the regime for which the innerouter flow model is valid is described in terms of nondimensional parameters derived from this example problem next the inertial forces surface conditions and pressuregradient conditions for a fullfield similarity between the electric and velocity fields in electroosmotic flows are discussed a sufficient set of conditions for this similarity to hold in arbitrarily shaped insulating wall microchannels is the following uniform surface charge low reynolds number low reynolds and strouhal number product uniform fluid properties and zero pressure differences between inlets and outlets last simple relations describing the generation of vorticity in electroosmotic flow are derived using a walllocal streamline coordinate system
gaseous flows in microfluidic devices are often characterized by relatively high knudsen numbers for such flows the continuum approximation is not valid and direct simulation monte carlo dsmc may be used to find an appropriate solution for lowvelocity flows where the fluid velocity is much smaller than the mean molecular velocity large statistical fluctuations in the solution mean that the features of the flow may be obscured by noise in the solution the use of a highorder nonlinear monotone convection algorithm fluxcorrected transport fct as a filter to extract the solution from the noisy dsmc calculation is described the diffusion antidiffusion and fluxlimiting properties of fct are discussed in terms of their filtering properties the effects of filtering with fct are demonstrated for a series of test problems including a square wave with superimposed random noise and low and highvelocity and low and highknudsennumber microchannel flows it is shown that fct filtering removes highfrequency statistical fluctuations and can extract a solution from a noisy dsmc calculation when the flow velocity is much less than the molecular thermal velocity and when the ratio of real to simulated particles is relatively high although the application described has been limited to microflows this filter has significant potential for a wide variety of dsmc problems used in physical regimes where statistical noise must be eliminated because it is a postprocessing operation and does not affect the dsmc calculation as it is running filtering can be applied to any dsmc solution this includes calculations with complex geometries the presence of many interacting species with chemical reactions varied and complicated boundary conditions and timedependent solutions

electroosmotic flow in microfluidic systems is limited to the low reynolds number regime as a result species mixing in electroosmotic flow systems is inherently diffusion dominated requiring both a long mixing channel and retention time to attain a homogeneous solution recent studies have shown that the introduction of oppositely charged surface heterogeneities to microchannel walls can result in regions of localized flow circulation within the bulk flow in this study we seek to investigate these circulation regions through 3d finiteelement based numerical simulations and then use them as a method of enhancing species mixing in a tshaped micromixer while all cases of surface heterogeneity are shown to enhance mixing efficiency greater improvement is found when both the size of the heterogeneous region and the degree of heterogeneity ie the difference between the heterogeneous and homogeneous ζpotentials are increased in some cases the presence of heterogeneous regions is shown to reduce the required mixing channel length by as much as 70

the design and calculation of micro mixers is done by conventional analytical and numerical calculations due to the small dimensions laminar flow is expected and the mass transfer is supposed to be dominated by diffusion a detailed cfdstudy by cfdrcace of simple static mixers shows a deviation from strictly laminar flow in a wide range of re numbers and channel dimensions the static mixers under test have a tprofile with rectangular cross sections and characteristic dimensions of 50 to 400 μm the mean flow velocity is varied from 001 ms to 5 ms which are typical values for chemical and biological applications chemical analysis and microfluidics with acceptable pressure losses with increasing flow velocity and increasing re numbers the flow starts to develop a vortex at the entrance of the mixing channel with further increasing velocity the flow tends to instabilities which causes the break up of the flow symmetry with the onset of the vortex formation and with the occurrence of the flow instabilities the mass transfer is enhanced by the exchange of fluid elements the laminar diffusion model can not describe this mixing effect a simple analytical model for first calculations is proposed

the wetting of microstructured surfaces is studied both experimentally and theoretically even relatively simple surface topographies such as grooves with rectangular cross section exhibit a large variety of different wetting morphologies as observed by atomic force microscopy this polymorphism arises from liquid wedge formation along the groove corners and from contact line pinning along the groove edges a global morphology diagram is derived that depends only on two system parameters i the aspect ratio of the groove geometry and ii the contact angle of the underlying substrate material for microfluidics the most interesting shape regimes involve extended liquid filaments which can grow and shrink in length while their cross section stays essentially constant thus any method by which one can vary the contact angle can be used to switch the length of the filament as is demonstrated in the context of electrowetting

effective and fast mixing is important for many microfluidic applications in many cases mixing is limited by molecular diffusion due to constrains of the laminar flow in the microscale regime according to scaling law decreasing the mixing path can shorten the mixing time and enhance mixing quality one of the techniques for reducing mixing path is sequential segmentation this technique divides solvent and solute into segments in axial direction the socalled tayloraris dispersion can improve axial transport by three orders of magnitudes the mixing path can be controlled by the switching frequency and the mean velocity of the flow mixing ratio can be controlled by pulse width modulation of the switching signal this paper first presents a simple timedependent onedimensional analytical model for sequential segmentation the model considers an arbitrary mixing ratio between solute and solvent as well as the axial tayloraris dispersion next a micromixer was designed and fabricated based on polymeric micromachining the micromixer was formed by laminating four polymer layers the layers are micro machined by a co2 laser switching of the fluid flows was realized by two piezoelectric valves mixing experiments were evaluated optically the concentration profile along the mixing channel agrees qualitatively well with the analytical model furthermore mixing results at different switching frequencies were investigated due to the dynamic behavior of the valves and the fluidic system mixing quality decreases with increasing switching frequency © springer science business media llc 2006
electroosmotic flow in microchannels is restricted to low reynolds number regimes since the inertia forces are extremely weak in such regimes turbulent conditions do not readily develop and hence species mixing occurs primarily as a result of diffusion consequently achieving a thorough species mixing generally relies upon the use of extended mixing channels this paper aims to improve the mixing performance of conventional side channel type micromixers by specifying the optimal driving voltages to be applied to each channel in the proposed approach the driving voltages are identified by constructing a simple theoretical scheme based on a flowrateratio model and kirchhoffs law the numerical and experimental results confirm that the optimal voltage control approach provides a better mixing performance than the use of a single driving voltage gradient © springer science business media llc 2006
background in vitro mechanotransduction studies are designed to elucidate cell behavior in response to a welldefined mechanical signal that is imparted to cultured cells eg through fluid flow typically flow rates are calculated based on a parallel plate flow assumption to achieve a targeted cellular shear stress this study evaluates the performance of specific flowperfusion chambers in imparting the targeted stress at the cellular level methods to evaluate how well actual flow chambers meet their target stresses set for 1 and 10 dyncm2 for this study at a cellular level computational models were developed to calculate flow velocity components and imparted shear stresses for a given pressure gradient computational predictions were validated with microparticle image velocimetry μpiv experiments results based on these computational and experimental studies as few as 66 of cells seeded along the midplane of commonly implemented flowperfusion chambers are subjected to stresses within ± 10 of the target stress in addition flow velocities and shear stresses imparted through fluid drag vary as a function of location within each chamber hence not only a limited number of cells are exposed to target stress levels within each chamber but also neighboring cells may experience different flow regimes finally flow regimes are highly dependent on flow chamber geometry resulting in significant variation in magnitudes and spatial distributions of stress between chambers conclusion the results of this study challenge the basic premise of in vitro mechanotransduction studies ie that a controlled flow regime is applied to impart a defined mechanical stimulus to cells these results also underscore the fact that data from studies in which different chambers are utilized can not be compared even if the target stress regimes are comparable © 2006 anderson et al licensee biomed central ltd

we have utilized a computational model of the expansion of a microbubble in a liquidfilled flexible tube to investigate the potential for acoustic vaporization of perfluorocarbon droplets to damage blood vessels during a novel gas embolotherapy technique for the potential treatment of tumors this model uses a fixed grid multidomain interface tracking direct numerical simulation method that treats all interfaces and boundaries as sharp discontinuities for high accuracy in the current work we examined effects of initial bubble size on the flows and wall stresses that result from droplet vaporization the remaining dimensionless parameters that govern the system response reynolds weber and strouhal numbers initial bubble pressure and wall stiffness and tension were selected to model an arteriole the results for a flexible tube are significantly different from those for a rigid tube two major flow regimes occur due to the combined effect of bubble and tube deformation inflow at the tube ends and outflow near the bubble surface the flexibility of the tube largely dissipates the extreme pressure that develops in the rigid tube model both the magnitude and the overall expansion time of the rapidly changing pressure are greatly reduced in the flexible tube smaller initial bubble diameters relative to the vessel diameter result in lower wall stresses this study indicates that wall flexibility can significantly influence the wall stresses that result from acoustic vaporization of intravascular perfluorocarbon droplets and suggests that acoustic activation of droplets in larger more flexible vessels may be less likely to damage or rupture vessels than activation in smaller and stiffer vessels copyright © 2006 by asme

we propose a new test method for investigating which macroscopic continuum models among the many existing models give the best description of rarefied gas flows over a range of knudsen numbers the merits of our method are no boundary conditions for the continuum models are needed no coupled governing equations are solved while the knudsen layer is still considered this distinguishes our proposed test method from other existing techniques such as stability analysis in time and space computations of sound speed and dispersion and the shock wave structure problem our method relies on accurate essentially noisefree solutions of the basic microscopic kinetic equation eg the boltzmann equation or a kinetic model equation in this paper the bgk model and the esbgk model equations are considered our method is applied to test whether onedimensional stationary couette flow is accurately described by the following macroscopic transport models the navierstokesfourier equations burnett equations grads 13 moment equations and the regularized 13 moment equations two types the original and that based on an order of magnitude approach the gas molecular model is maxwellian for knudsen numbers in the transitioncontinuum regime kn ≤ 01 we find that the two types of regularized 13 moment equations give similar results to each other which are better than grads original 13 moment equations which in turn give better results than the burnett equations the navierstokesfourier equations give the worst results this is as expected considering the presumed accuracy of these models for cases of higher knudsen numbers ie kn 01 all macroscopic continuum equations tested fail to describe the flows accurately we also show that the above conclusions from our tests are general and independent of the kinetic model used © 2006 elsevier inc all rights reserved

the solutions of the flow over a plate and a cylinder with suction and anisotropic partial slip are discussed viscous flow with partial slip occurs in a variety of situations such as the slip regime of rarefied gases and also models the boundary of rough or grooved surfaces the anisotropy may be caused by parallel slits on the surface through which suction occurs if there are no slips the solution reduces to the exact asymptotic suction flow the noslip boundary condition on a rough or striated surface is very difficult to enforce the theoretical determination of the slip coefficient can be obtained from microfluid dynamics study of the roughness because the local reynolds number is small the slip coefficients are determined under the stokes assumption for surfaces composed of parallel semiinfinite fins parallel thin slats in the same plane and parallel grooves of infinite of finite depths

electroosmotic flow in microfluidic systems is limited to the low reynolds number regime as a result species mixing in the microchannel is inherently diffusion dominated requiring both a long mixing channel and retention time to attain a homogeneous solution in this paper we apply an external transverse electric field on the twodimension microchannel and discuss the influence of the intensity of the transverse electric field the arrangement of the micro electrode and the zeta potential on the micromixing the results show that the method can effectively increase the mixing efficiency increasing the external transverse electric field and the density of the micro electrode can increase the mixing efficiency obviously the lower zeta potential leads to the better micromixing effect
this paper investigates the mixing characteristics of electrokineticallydriven flow in microchannels with different wavy surface configurations numerical simulations are performed to analyze the influence of the wave amplitude and the length of the wavy section on the mixing efficiency within the microchannel typically straight channels have a poor mixing performance because the fluid flow is restricted to the low reynolds number regime and hence mixing takes place primarily as a result of diffusion effects however the wavy surfaces employed in the current microchannels increase the interfacial contact area between the two species in the microchannel and therefore improve the mixing efficiency the mixing performance is further enhanced by the application of a heterogeneous charge pattern on the wavy surfaces the numerical results show that the heterogeneous charge pattern generates flow circulations near the microchannel walls these circulations are shown to provide an effective enhancement in the mixing performance overall the present results show that the mixing performance is improved by increasing the magnitude of the heterogeneous surface zeta potential upon the wavy surface or by increasing the wave amplitude or the length of the wavy section in the microchannel © 2007 elsevier inc all rights reserved

we use a mesoscopic simulation technique to study the transport of polymers in dilute solution flowing through a cylindrical tube the simulations use an explicit solvent model to include all the relevant hydrodynamic couplings and a coarse grained ideal chain model for the polymers appropriate for systems near the theta temperature for the interactions between the solvent and the tube wall we use a novel method that ensures continuity of the stress at the interface we show that the results for the polymer drift velocity are independent of the degree of coarse graining further for the case where the size of the chains is small but not negligible compared to the tube radius our results are in excellent agreement with experiment however they also show that in this regime the accelerated drift relative to the average solvent flow velocity is described by the steric effect of the tube wall excluding the polymer center of mass from sampling the full cross section of the tube hydrodynamic interactions have a negligible influence in this regime consequently the agreement between experiment and theories that approximates the former but includes the latter is fortunate when the undisturbed polymer radius approaches or exceeds the tube radius the hydrodynamic interactions do have a significant effect they reduce the drift velocity in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions the accelerated drift still approaches the maximum value one would expect based on a poiseuille flow but more slowly than if one neglects hydrodynamics finally we propose an empirical fit that accurately describes data in the intermediate regime © 2007 american institute of physics

we describe the results of a numerical investigation of the dynamics of breakup of streams of immiscible fluids in the confined geometry of a microfluidic tjunction we identify three distinct regimes of formation of droplets squeezing dripping and jetting providing a unifying picture of emulsification processes typical for microfluidic systems the squeezing mechanism of breakup is particular to microfluidic systems since the physical confinement of the fluids has pronounced effects on the interfacial dynamics in this regime the breakup process is driven chiefly by the buildup of pressure upstream of an emerging droplet and both the dynamics of breakup and the scaling of the sizes of droplets are influenced only very weakly by the value of the capillary number the dripping regime while apparently homologous to the unbounded case is also significantly influenced by the constrained geometry these effects modify the scaling law for the size of the droplets derived from the balance of interfacial and viscous stresses finally the jetting regime sets in only at very high flow rates or with low interfacial tension ie higher values of the capillary number similar to the unbounded case © 2008 cambridge university press
high quality factor of dynamic structures at micro and nano scale is exploited in various applications of micro electromechanical systems mems and nano electromechanical system the quality factor of such devices can be very high in vacuum however when vacuum is not desirable or not possible the tiny structures must vibrate in air or some other gas at pressure levels that may vary from atmospheric to low vacuum the interaction of the surrounding fluid with the vibrating structure leads to dissipation thus bringing down the quality factor depending on the ambient fluid pressure or the gap between the vibrating and the fixed structure the fluid motion can range from continuum flow to molecular flow giving a wide range of dissipation the relevant fluid flow characteristics are determined by the knudsen number which is the ratio of the mean free path of the gas molecule to the characteristic flow length of the device this number is very small for continuum flow and reasonably big for molecular flow in this paper we study the effect of fluid pressure on the quality factor by carrying out experiments on a mems device that consists of a double gimbaled torsional resonator such devices are commonly used in optical crossconnects and switches we only vary fluid pressure to make the knudsen number go through the entire range of continuum flow slip flow transition flow and molecular flow we experimentally determine the quality factor of the torsional resonator at different air pressures ranging from 760 torr to 0001 torr the variation of this pressure over six orders of magnitude ensures required rarefaction to range over all flow conditions finally we get the variation of quality factor with pressure the result indicates that the quality factor q follows a power law qαp r with different values of the exponent r in different flow regimes in the second part of the paper we propose the use of effective viscosity for considering velocity slip conditions in solving navierstokes equation numerically this concept is validated with analytical results for a simple case and then compared with the experimental results presented in this paper the study shows that the effective viscosity concept can be used effectively even for the molecular regime if the airgap to length ratio is sufficiently small h 0l001 as this ratio increases the range of validity decreases © society for experimental mechanics 2007
this paper investigates the effect of rotation in split and recombination sar mixing one of the specific cases in which chaotic advection is applied to lamination in a microchannel three types of sar micromixers were designed nor cor and countr they are defined by their rotation effect and by the direction of the rotation the mixing efficiency for the rotation effect was compared at various flow rates between 1 μlmin re 012 and 100 μlmin re 12 in an experiment and between 100 μlmin re 12 and 1000 μlmin re 120 for numerical analysis it is concluded that there are three regions sar dominant mixed and rotation dominant regions following mixed regimes for the reynolds number when rotation is applied to sar in the mixed region the sar is distorted by rotation and the efficiency rapidly decreases as the reynolds number increases in order to increase the mixing efficiency for a wide range of reynolds numbers in a microchannel the second region mixed region must be diminished by optimizing the intensity of the rotation © 2007 elsevier bv all rights reserved

background a major stumbling block for researchers developing experimental models of mechanotransduction is the control of experimental variables in particular the transmission of the mechanical forces at the cellular level a previous evaluation of state of the art commercial perfusion chambers showed that flow regimes applied to impart a defined mechanical stimulus to cells are poorly controlled and that data from studies in which different chambers are utilized can not be compared even if the target stress regimes are comparable methods this study provides a novel chamber design to provide both physiologicallybased flow regimes improvements in control of experimental variables as well as ease of use compared to commercial chambers this novel design achieves controlled stresses through five gasket designs and both single and dualflow regimes results the imparted shear stress within the gasket geometry is well controlled fifty percent of the entire area of the 10 × 21 mm universal gasket gasket i designed to impart constant magnitude shear stresses in the center of the chamber where outcome measures are taken is exposed to target stresses in the 8 mm diameter circular area at the center of the chamber where outcome measures are made over 92 of the area is exposed to the target stress ± 25 in addition other gasket geometries provide specific gradients of stress that vary with distance from the chamber inlet benchtop testing of the novel chamber prototype shows improvements in the ease of use as well as in performance compared to the other commercial chambers the design of the chamber eliminates flow deviations due to leakage and bubbles and allows actual flow profiles to better conform with those predicted in computational models conclusion the novel flow chamber design provides predictable and well defined mechanical forces at the surface of a cell monolayer showing improvement over previously tested commercial chambers the predictability of the imparted stress improves both experiment repeatability as well as the accuracy of interstudy comparisons carefully controlling the stresses on cells is critical in effectively mimicking in vivo situations overall the improved perfusion flow chamber provides the needed resolution standardization and in vitro model analogous to in vivo conditions to make the step towards greater use in research and the opportunity to enter the diagnostic and therapeutic market © 2007 anderson and tate licensee biomed central ltd

the need of developing advanced microelectromechanical systems mems has motivated the study of fluidthermal flows in devices with microscale geometries in many mems applications the knudsen number varies in the range from 102 to 102 this flow regime can be treated neither as a continuum nor as a free molecular flow in order to describe these flows it is necessary to implement the boltzmann equation be or simplified kinetic model equations the aim of the present work is to propose an efficient methodology for solving internal flows of binary gaseous mixtures in rectangular channels due to small pressure gradients over the whole range of the knudsen number the complicated collision integral term of the be is substituted by the kinetic model proposed by mccormack for gaseous mixtures the discrete velocity method is implemented to solve in an iterative manner the system of the kinetic equations even more the required computational effort is significantly reduced by accelerating the convergence rate of the iteration scheme this is achieved by formulating a set of moment equations which are solved jointly with the transport equations the velocity profiles and the flow rates of three different binary mixtures hear near and hexe in 2d microchannels of various height to width ratios are calculated the whole formulation becomes very efficient and can be implemented as an alternative methodology to the classical method of solving the navierstokes equations with slip boundary conditions which in any case is restricted by the hydrodynamic regime © 2004 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
the geometric and transport properties of trabecular bone are of particular interest for medical engineers active in orthopaedic applications and more specifically in hard tissue implantations this article resorts to computational methods to provide some understanding of the geometric and transport properties of vertebral trabecular bone a fuzzy distance transform algorithm was used for geometric analysis on the pore scale and a lattice boltzmann method lbm for the simulation of flow on the same scale the transport properties of bone including the pressure drop elongation and shear component of dissipated energy and the tortuosity of the bone geometry were extracted from the results of the lbm flow simulations whenever suitable dimensionless numbers were used for the analysis of the data the average pore size and distribution of the bone were found to be 746 μm and between 75 and 2940 μm respectively the permeability of the flow in the cavities of the specific bone sample was found to be 505 × 108 m2 for the superiorinferior direction which was by a factor of 1517 higher than the permeability in the other two anatomical directions anteriorposterior these findings are consistent with experimental results found 3 years prior independently tortuosity values approached 105 for the superiorinferior direction and 113 and 111 for the other two perpendicular directions the low tortuosities result mainly frorn the large bone porosity of 092 the flow on the pore scale seems to be shear dominated but 30 per cent of the energy dissipation was because of elongational effects the converging and diverging geometry of the bone explains the significant elongation and deformation of the fluid elements the transition from creeping flow the darcy regime which is of interest to vertebral augmentation and this study to the laminar region with significant inertia effects took place at a reynolds number of about 110 as usual for porous media finally the authors wish to advise the readers on the significant computational requirements to be allocated to such a virtual test bench © imeche 2008
chaotic flow was generated in a smooth microchannel of a uniform width at arbitrarily low reynolds number with a polymer solution the chaotic flow regime was characterized by randomly fluctuation threedimensional velocity field and significant growth of the flow resistance the chaotic flow leads to quite efficient mixing which is almost diffusion independent it is observed that for macromolecules mixing time in this microscopic flow can be three to four orders of magnitude shorter than due to molecular diffusion
molecular dispersion is caused by both molecular diffusion and nonuniform bulk fluid motion while the tayloraris dispersion regime is the most familiar regime in microfluidic systems an oftoverlooked regime is that of purely kinematic or ballistic dispersion in most microfluidic systems this dispersion regime is transient and quickly gives way to tayloraris dispersion in electrophoretic focusing methods such as temperature gradient focusing tgf however the characteristic time scales for dispersion are fixed and focused peaks may never reach the taylor limit in this situation generalized taylor dispersion analysis is not applicable a heuristic model is developed here which accounts for both molecular diffusion and advective dispersion across all dispersion regimes from pure diffusion to taylor dispersion to pure advection this model is compared to results from tgf experiments and accurately captures both the initial decrease and subsequent increase in peak widths as electric field strength increases the results of this combined analytical and experimental study provide a useful tool for estimation of dispersion and optimization of tgf systems © 2007 the royal society
double emulsion droplets encapsulating crystalline colloidal arrays ccas with a narrow size distribution were produced using an optofluidic device the shell phase of the double emulsion was a photocurable resin that was photopolymerized downstream of the fluidic channel within 1 s after drop generation the present optofluidic synthesis scheme was very effective for fabricating highly monodisperse spherical ccas that were made structurally stable by in situ photopolymerization of the encapsulating shells the shell thickness and the number of core emulsion drops could be controlled by varying the flow rates of the three coflowing streams in the dripping regime the spherical ccas confined in the shell exhibited distinct diffraction patterns in the visible range in contrast to conventional filmtype ccas as a result of their structure the spherical ccas exhibited photonic band gaps for normal incident light independent of the position on the spherical surface this property was induced by heterogeneous nucleation at the smooth wall of the spherical emulsion drop during crystallization into a facecentered cubic fee structure on the other hand the solidified shells did not permit the penetration of ionic species enabling the ccas to maintain their structure in a continuous aqueous phase of high ionic strength for at least 1 month in addition the evaporation of water molecules inside the shell was slowed considerably when the coreshell microparticles were exposed to air it took approximately 6 h for a suspension encapsulated in a thick shell to evaporate completely which is ∼1000 times longer than the evaporation time for water droplets with the same volume finally the spherical ccas additionally exhibited enhanced stability against external electric fields the spherical geometry and high dielectric constant of the suspension contributed to reducing the electric field inside the shell thereby inhibiting the electrophoretic movement of the charged particles © 2008 american chemical society

a theoretical investigation is presented that characterizes the interaction dynamics of a double deoxyguanonsine molecular system where two guanine bases are coupled via a sugarphosphate backbone that is bound to the surface of silicon molecular dynamical simulations show that the influence of the coupling between the guanine bases ie as compared with individual deoxyguanonsine molecules leads to a significant increase of the absorption intensity from microwave to infrared ir frequencies furthermore these results show that the strong coupling between the guanine bases leads to a much larger number of distinguishable vibrational modes at frequency below the ir at ∼ 1350 cm1 these effects also produce doublepeak features in the farir absorption intensity which represent a splitting of the individual peaks associated with a single deoxyguanonsine molecule guanine base coupling also leads to a general shifting of all the absorption peaks towards the terahertz frequency regime ie ∼ 10 thz and below which is also accompanied by a reduction of the absorption intensity as one progresses to longer wavelengths most importantly this interaction phenomenon creates additional spectral features which may be useful in a longwavelength opticsbased technique for dna sequencing © 2008 ieee

an experimental study of droplet breakup in tshaped microfluidic junctions is presented in which the capillary number and flow rate ratio are varied over a wide range for several different viscosity ratios and several different ratios of the inlet channel widths the range of conditions corresponds to the region in which both the squeezing pressure that arises when the emerging interface obstructs the channel and the viscous shear stress on the emerging interface strongly influence the process in this regime the droplet volume depends on the capillary number the flow rate ratio and the ratio of inlet channel widths which controls the degree of confinement of the droplets the viscosity ratio influences the droplet volume only when the viscosities are similar when there is a large viscosity contrast in which the dispersedphase liquid is at least 50 times smaller than the continuousphase liquid the resulting size is independent of the viscosity ratio and no transition to a purely squeezing regime appears in this case both the droplet volume and the droplet production frequency obey powerlaw behavior with the capillary number consistent with expectations based on mass conservation of the dispersedphase liquid finally scaling arguments are presented that result in predicted droplet volumes that depend on the capillary number flow rate ratio and width ratio in a qualitatively similar way to that observed in experiments © 2008 the american physical society

this paper identifies a new mechanism for amplification of stochastic disturbances in channel flows of strongly elastic polymer solutions for streamwise constant flows with high elasticity numbers μ and nonvanishing reynolds numbers re the oμre3 scaling of the variance amplification is established using singular perturbations techniques this demonstrates that large variances can be maintained in stochastically driven flows occurring in weak inertialstrong elastic regimes mathematically the amplification arises due to nonnormality of the governing equations and physically it is caused by the stretching of the polymer stresses by the background shear the reported developments provide a possible route for a bypass transition to elastic turbulence and suggest a novel method for efficient mixing in microfabricated straight channels © 2009 aacc

the fluidstructure interaction of resonating microcantilevers immersed in fluid has been widely studied and is a cornerstone in nanomechanical sensor development in many applications fluid damping imposes severe limitations by strongly degrading the signaltonoise ratio of measurements recently burg et al nature vol 446 2007 pp 10661069 proposed an alternative type of microcantilever device whereby a microfluidic channel was embedded inside the cantilever with vacuum outside remarkably it was observed that energy dissipation in these systems was almost identical when air or liquid was passed through the channel and was 4 orders of magnitude lower than that in conventional microcantilever systems here we study the fluid dynamics of these devices and present a rigorous theoretical model corroborated by experimental measurements to explain these observations in so doing we elucidate the dominant physical mechanisms giving rise to the unique features of these devices significantly it is found that energy dissipation is not a monotonic function of fluid viscosity but exhibits oscillatory behaviour as fluid viscosity is increaseddecreased in the regime of low viscosity inertia dominates the fluid motion inside the cantilever resulting in thin viscous boundary layersthis leads to an increase in energy dissipation with increasing viscosity in the highviscosity regime the boundary layers on all surfaces merge leading to a decrease in dissipation with increasing viscosity effects of fluid compressibility also become significant in this latter regime and lead to rich flow behaviour a direct consequence of these findings is that miniaturization does not necessarily result in degradation in the quality factor which may indeed be enhanced this highly desirable feature is unprecedented in current nanomechanical devices and permits direct miniaturization to enhance sensitivity to environmental changes such as mass variations in liquid copyright © cambridge university press 2010
the formation of bubbles in a flowfocusing ff junction comprising multiple rectangular sections is described the simplest junctions comprise two sections throat and orifice systematic investigation of the influence on the formation of bubbles of the flow of liquid and the geometry of the junction identifies regimes that generate monodisperse bidisperse and tridisperse trains of bubbles the mechanisms by which these junctions form monodisperse and bidisperse bubbles are inferred from the shapes of the gas thread during breakup these mechanisms differ primarily by the process in which the gas thread collapses in the throat andor orifice the dynamic selfassembly of bidisperse bubbles leads to unexpected groupings of bubbles during their flow along the outlet channel © 2010 wileyvch verlag gmbh co kgaa weinheim

the development of mems requires deliberate designs for controlling fluids in the low reynolds number regime arranging surface charges in rectangular channels to obtain inplane or outofplane vortices have been studied by previous researchers however previous surface modification techniques require different signs of zeta potentials from the other wall surfaces which made it difficult in selecting and coating microchannels previously the opposite polarities are usually adjusted by changing the ph value of the solution with acid chemicals in other researches which made the solution complicated and difficult to simulate a real application meanwhile the acid chemicals may also destroy the coating it is convenient to use same polarity patches if a vortex flow can also be generated however it is not clear if the patterned surface charges have the same polarity of zeta potentials as the other walls what kind flow pattern will be generated and what mechanism behind the flow pattern furthermore the crosssection of previously studied microchannels is usually limited to a rectangular shape therefore the surface charge patterns are usually in 2d since the sidewalls of the rectangular microchannels are difficult to be patterned however a channel with round crosssection has better leakproof performance of the membrane valve furthermore a round channel is also advantageous in mimicking the human vein when a vascular structure is needed in tissue scaffolding the round microfluidic channel is considered as a good candidate for an artificial capillary vessel it is anticipated that there will be no stagnation occurs at the corner edges which occurs at the corners of a rectangular channel for a round microchannel owing to the perfectly symmetrical velocity profile this is important when the microfluidic chip is subjected to a separation process such as liquid chromatography in this paper effects of patterned surface modification on 3d vortex flows generation in a micro capillary tube under very low reynolds number have been investigated microfabrication technology was successfully employed to pattern surface charges on inner surfaces of round capillary tubes which form nonuniform zetapotentials this technique extends the heterogeneous surfaces from flat surface to curved surface 3d vortices are visualized and measured at the vicinity of tube walls when an electric field is applied across the surfaces utilizing micro resolution piv it demonstrated that 3d vortices can also be generated by the patterned surface charges with a same polarity experimental results have been compared with the numerical simulations using cfdace copyright © 2009 by asme

the flow of polymer solutions in microfluidic devices is inherently threedimensional especially in the nonlinear flow regime and often results in flow phenomena that might not even be encountered in macrodevices using a multimode phanthientanner model threedimensional 3d simulations of a semidilute polyethylene oxide peo solution through 81 planar contraction microchannels with various depths have been carried out to systematically study the effect of the aspect ratio on the flow fields vortex dynamics in the upstream flow section and excess pressure drop are quantified in detail a transition from a salientcorner vortex mechanism to a lip vortex mechanism is observed as the aspect ratio is varied from 1 to 14 which corresponds to the elasticity numbers el 363 to 483 the numerical results show that varying the aspect ratio of microfluidic channels has similar effects to varying other parameters such as fluid properties which influence the elasticity number thus our results support the view that vortex growth mechanism is determined by the elasticity number which is fixed for a given fluid and geometry the principle is of significance to the design of new microfluidic chips for a wide range of applications © 2010 springerverlag

the goal of this study was to determine laminar pressure loss coefficients for flow in microelbows with circular and trapezoidal crosssections flow conditions and pressure losses in these elbows are of interest in microfluidic devices in porous media and in other types of microfluidic networks the literature focuses almost exclusively on loss coefficients due to turbulent flow in macroelbows with very little data on laminar flow in macroelbows the pressure loss coefficients determined in this study are intended to aid in realistic simulation of existing laminar flow networks or the design of these networks this study focused on an elbow of constant crosssection with inlet and outlet tubes of sufficient length so as to allow fully developed laminar flow at the entrance to the elbow and at the outlet tube exit for the circular elbow both the ratio of elbow radius to inner diameter and inlet reynolds number were allowed to vary over the ranges of 05105 and 12500 respectively the laminar pressure loss coefficients were determined by simulating incompressible flow over the range of geometries and reynolds numbers in the commercial cfd software fluent the pressure and velocity distributions in the inlet and outlet tubes were averaged at multiple upstream and downstream positions and were then used to extrapolate the loss coefficient due to the elbow the results showed that the loss coefficient for larger ratios tended to be higher in some cases in excess of 100 at low reynolds number flows but as the flow approached the transitional regime the loss coefficients leveled out to roughly their accepted turbulent values of between 04 and 10 these results show good qualitative and quantitative agreement with limited laminar elbow experimental data available for macroelbows for the trapezoidal elbows the loss coefficient levels off to about two for reynolds numbers greater than 100 copyright © 2009 by asme

we study the production and motion of monodisperse double emulsions in microfluidics comprising series coflow capillaries both two and three dimensional simulations are performed flow was determined by dimensionless parameters ie reynolds number and weber number of continuous and dispersed phases the coflow generated droplets are sensitive to the reynolds number and weber number of the continuous phase but insensitive to those of the disperse phase because the inner and outer drops are generate by separate coflow processes sizes of both inner and outer drops can be controlled by adjusting re and we for the continuous phase meanwhile the disperse phase has little effect on drop size thus a desirable generation frequency of inner drop can be reached by merely adjusting flow rate of the inner fluid leading to desirable number of inner drops encapsulated by the outer drop thus highly monodisperse double emulsions are obtained it was found that only in dripping mode can droplet be of high monodispersity flow begins to transit from dripping regime to jetting regime when the re number is decreased or weber number is increased to ensure that all the droplets are produced over a wide range of running parameters tiny tapered tip outlet for the disperse flow should be applied smaller the tapered tip wider range for re and we can apply copyright © 2009 by asme

high quality factor of dynamic structures at micro and nano scale is exploited in various applications of micro electromechanical systems mems and nano electromechanical system the quality factor of such devices can be very high in vacuum however when vacuum is not desirable or not possible the tiny structures must vibrate in air or some other gas at pressure levels that may vary from atmospheric to low vacuum the interaction of the surrounding fluid with the vibrating structure leads to dissipation thus bringing down the quality factor depending on the ambient fluid pressure or the gap between the vibrating and the fixed structure the fluid motion can range from continuum flow to molecular flow giving a wide range of dissipation the relevant fluid flow characteristics are determined by the knudsen number which is the ratio of the mean free path of the gas molecule to the characteristic flow length of the device this number is very small for continuum flow and reasonably big for molecular flow in this paper we study the effect of fluid pressure on the quality factor by carrying out experiments on a mems device that consists of a double gimbaled torsional resonator such devices are commonly used in optical crossconnects and switches we only vary fluid pressure to make the knudsen number go through the entire range of continuum flow slip flow transition flow and molecular flow we experimentally determine the quality factor of the torsional resonator at different air pressures ranging from 760 torr to 0001 torr the variation of this pressure over six orders of magnitude ensures required rarefaction to range over all flow conditions finally we get the variation of quality factor with pressure the result indicates that the quality factor q follows a power law q ∝ pr with different values of the exponent r in different flow regimes in the second part of the paper we propose the use of effective viscosity for considering velocity slip conditions in solving navierstokes equation numerically this concept is validated with analytical results for a simple case and then compared with the experimental results presented in this paper the study shows that the effective viscosity concept can be used effectively even for the molecular regime if the airgap to length ratio is sufficiently small h0l 001 as this ratio increases the range of validity decreases © society for experimental mechanics 2007
in a previous article we studied the basics of emulsification in microfluidic yjunctions however without considering the effect of viscosity of the disperse phase as it is known from investigations on many different microstructures that viscosity and viscosity ratio are governing parameters for droplet size we here investigate whether this is also the case for microfluidic yjunctions and do so for a wide range of process conditions the investigated yjunctions have a width of 199 or 128 μm and a depth of 50 μm and the formed monodisperse droplets cv 1 are between 3 and 20 μm we varied the dispersephase viscosity using different oils 1105 mpa s and continuousphase viscosity using glycerolwater and ethanolwater mixtures 1062 mpa s which corresponds to dispersetocontinuousphase viscosity ratios from 04 to 1050 through the variation of the liquids also a range in interfacial tensions 1255 mn m1 is assessed the dispersephase flow rate is varied from 0039 to 180 μl h1 the continuousphase flow rate from 139 μl h1 to 041 ml h1 and this corresponds to flow rate ratios from 11 × 103 to 014 which is once again based on wide range of conditions for all these conditions in which droplets are formed in the dripping and jetting regime the droplet size could be described with a model based on the existing forcebalance model but now extended to incorporate the crosssectional area of the droplet and the resistance with the wall surprisingly enough it was found that the droplet size is not influenced by the dispersephase viscosity or the viscosity ratio but it is dominated by the resistance with the wall and the continuousphase properties because of this emulsification with yjunctions is intrinsically simpler than any other shearbased method as droplet size is only determined by the continuous phase © 2010 american institute of chemical engineers aiche

with the growing interest and development of microfluidic systems the need for microscale laminar flow mixing techniques is evident traditional mixing methods often rely upon turbulent flow for mixing which is generally not present on the microscale and so alternative approaches must be sought in this work we report on the impact of flow pulsatility on the laminar mixing surfaceinterface formed between two converging microchannel flows the motivation behind the study is to assess the potential for pulsatility as a possible memsmixing strategy a 3d computational model of the converging flow at a 90° junction is developed using the fluent6® cfd software and the volumeoffluid algorithm is used to track timedependent behavior of the interface downstream of the junction results thus far have shown that for certain parametric regimes a complex evolving interfacial distortion can form which propagates and persists downstream of the junction timeseries for the total interfacial area and the interfacial motion have been extracted from numerical data and spectral analyses have been performed some interesting nonlinear behavior has been observed of particular importance the results also show that the complexity of the interfacial structure is only significant at higher frequencies order of khz which is appropriate for memsbased pumping devices copyright ©2002 by asme

an experimental study of pulsatile flow in microchannel is reported in this paper such a study is important because timevarying flows are frequently encountered in microdevices the hydraulic diameter of the microchannel is 144 μm and deionized water is the working fluid the pressure drop across the microchannel as a function of time is recorded from which the average and rms pressure drops are obtained the experiments have been performed in the quasisteady flow regime for a wide range of flow rate frequency of pulsations and duty cycle the results suggest that the pressure with pulsations lies between the minimum and maximum steady state pressure values the average pressure drop with pulsation is approximately linear with respect to the flow rate the theoretical expression for pressure has also been derived wherever possible and the experimental data is found to lie below the corresponding theoretical values the difference with respect to the theoretical value increases with an increase in frequency and a decrease in flow rate with a maximum difference of 327 this is attributed to the small size of the microchannel an increase in frequency of square waveform leads to a larger reduction in pressure drop as compared to rectangular waveform irrespective of the duty cycle the results can be interpreted with the help of a firstorder model proposed here the model results are found to compare well against the experimental results a correlation for friction factor in terms of the other nondimensional governing parameters is also proposed experimental study of massdriven pulsatile flow in microchannel is being conducted for the first time at these scales and the results are of both fundamental and practical importance © 2010 springerverlag
the reynolds number in nanofluid studies depends on the inlet velocity and the kinematic viscosity of nanofluid the nanofluid kinematic viscosity increases with an increase in nanoparticles volume fraction while the inlet velocity should be increased to keep the reynolds number constant therefore it is not clear that either increasing the nanoparticles volume fraction or increasing the inlet velocity has a major role on heat transfer enhancement in nanofluids flow studies which are done at constant reynolds numbers in this study forced convection al 2o 3water nanofluid flows in twodimensional rectangular microchannels have been investigated to study heat transfer enhancement due to addition of the nanoparticles to the base fluid especially in microchannels at low reynolds number three different cases are examined to evaluate proportion impact of increasing nanoparticles volume fraction φ and the inlet velocity u in on heat transfer enhancement twodimensional navierstokes and energy equations accompany with the slip velocity and the jump temperature boundary conditions expressions have been discretized using the finite volume method fvm the brownian motions of nanoparticles have been considered to determine the thermal conductivity of nanofluids the calculated results show good agreement with the previous numerical and analytical data it is found that at a given reynolds number the major enhancement in the nusselt number is not due to increasing the nanoparticle concentrations but it is due to the increasing the inlet velocity to reach a constant re constant reynolds number studies of nanofluids are not sufficient approach to evaluate the heat transfer and the skin friction factor due to the nanofluids usage © 2010 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
jammed systems all have a yield stress among these materials some have been shown to shearband but it is as yet unclear why some materials develop shearband and some others do not in order to rationalize existing data concerning the flow characteristics of jammed systems and in particular understand the physical origin of such a difference we propose a simple approach for describing the steady flow behaviour of yield stress fluids which retains only basic physical ingredients within this framework we show that in the liquid regime the behaviour of jammed systems turns from that of a simple yield stress fluid exhibiting homogeneous flows to a shearbanding material when the ratio of a characteristic relaxation time of the system to a restructuring time becomes smaller than 1 thus suggesting a possible physical origin of these trends © 2010 edp sciences sif springerverlag berlin heidelberg
the laminar flow regime prevailing in pressuredriven flow through a yshaped microfluidic channel was utilized to create a stable boundary between two aqueous liquids transverse transport of ions between these two liquids gave rise to a diffusion potential which was monitored by measurement of the open circuit potential in this report the influence on the crosschannel potential distribution of protonation reactions occurring in the boundary zone between the two coflowing liquids is presented the proton source was present in one of the coflowing streams and an uncharged proton acceptor was present in the other aqueous stream the timedependent transport equation for diffusion and migration was augmented by chemical reaction terms and was solved for all species present in both streams as a theoretical basis for the analysis within this model the system was assumed to be homogeneous along the channel height and effects of nonuniform velocity profiles were neglected a reduction in potential by several millivolts was predicted for a protonation reaction occurring close to the boundary between the two aqueous streams provided that the mobility of the protonated species was lower than the mobility of the cocation in the background electrolyte alkali metal cation in this case the magnitude of the decrease in the potential was greater for protonated molecules with lower mobility or if the mobility of the background electrolyte cation was increased experimental results are presented for imidazole and dhistidine as proton acceptors present in 10 mm kcl 10 mm nacl or 10 mm cscl solution and coflowing with a stream of 10 mm hydrochloric acid which served as the proton source decreases in measured potential in line with the predicted diminished potential were obtained © 2010 american chemical society

the dynamics and stability of a thin viscous film of volatile liquid flowing under the influence of gravity over a nonuniformly heated substrate are investigated using lubrication theory attention is focused on the regime in which evaporation balances the flow due to gravity the film terminates above the heater at an apparent contact line with a microscopically thin precursor film adsorbed due to the disjoining pressure the film develops a weak thermocapillary ridge due to the marangoni stress at the upstream edge of the heated region as for spreading films a more significant ridge is formed near the apparent contact line for weak marangoni effects the film evolves to a steady profile for stronger marangoni effects the film evolves to a timeperiodic state results of a linear stability analysis reveal that the steady film is unstable to transverse perturbations above a critical value of the marangoni parameter leading to finger formation at the contact line the streamwise extent of the fingers is limited by evaporation the timeperiodic profiles are always unstable leading to the formation of periodicallyoscillating fingers for rectangular heaters the film profiles after instability onset are consistent with images from published experimental studies © 2010 elsevier inc

the time evolution of a passive scalar advected by parallel shear flows is studied for a class of rapidly varying initial data such situations are of practical importance in a wide range of applications from microfluidics to geophysics in these contexts it is wellknown that the longtime evolution of the tracer concentration is governed by taylors asymptotic theory of dispersion in contrast we focus here on the evolution of the tracer at intermediate time scales we show how intermediate regimes can be identified before taylors and in particular how the taylor regime can be delayed indefinitely by properly manufactured initial data a complete characterization of the sorting of these time scales and their associated spatial structures is presented these analytical predictions are compared with highly resolved numerical simulations specifically this comparison is carried out for the case of periodic variations in the streamwise direction on the short scale with envelope modulations on the long scales and show how this structure can lead to anomalously diffusive transients in the evolution of the scalar onto the ultimate regime governed by taylor dispersion mathematically the occurrence of these transients can be viewed as a competition in the asymptotic dominance between large péclet pe numbers and the longshort scale aspect ratios lvelltracer≡k two independent nondimensional parameters of the problem we provide analytical predictions of the associated time scales by a modal analysis of the eigenvalue problem arising in the separation of variables of the governing advectiondiffusion equation the anomalous time scale in the asymptotic limit of large k pe is derived for the short scale periodic structure of the scalars initial data for both exactly solvable cases and in general with wkbj analysis in particular the exactly solvable sawtooth flow is especially important in that it provides a short cut to the exact solution to the eigenvalue problem for the physically relevant vanishing neumann boundary conditions in linearshear channel flow we show that the life of the corresponding modes at large pe for this case is shorter than the ones arising from shear free zones in the fluids interior a wkbj study of the latter modes provides a longer intermediate time evolution this part of the analysis is technical as the corresponding spectrum is dominated by asymptotically coalescing turning points in the limit of large pe numbers when large scale initial data components are present the transient regime of the wkbj anomalous modes evolves into one governed by taylor dispersion this is studied by a regular perturbation expansion of the spectrum in the small wavenumber regimes © 2010 american institute of physics

we investigate the role of interfacial slip on evaporation of a thin liquid film in a microfluidic channel the effective slip mechanism is attributed to the formation of a depleted layer adhering to the substratefluid interface either in a continuum or in a rarefied gas regime as a consequence of intricate hydrophobic interactions in the narrow confinement we appeal to the fundamental principles of conservation in relating the evaporation mechanisms with fluid flow and heat transfer over interfacial scales we obtain semianalytical solutions of the pertinent governing equations with coupled heat and mass transfer boundary conditions at the liquidvapor interface we observe that a general consequence of interfacial slip is to elongate the liquid film thereby leading to a film thickening effect thicker liquid films in turn result in lower heat transfer rates from the wall to liquid film and consequently lower mass transfer rates from the liquid film to the vapor phase nevertheless the total mass of evaporation or equivalently the net heat transfer turns out to be higher in case of interfacial slip due to the longer film length we also develop significant physical insights on the implications of the relative thickness of the depleted layer with reference to characteristic length scales of the microfluidic channel on the evaporation process under combined influences of the capillary pressure disjoining pressure and the driving temperature differential for the interfacial transport © 2010 springerverlag

the electrokinetic behavior of nanofluidic devices is dominated by the electrical double layers at the device walls therefore accurate predictive models of double layers are essential for device design and optimization in this paper we demonstrate that density functional theory dft of electrolytes is an accurate and computationally efficient method for computing finite ion size effects and the resulting ionion correlations that are neglected in classical double layer theories such as poissonboltzmann because dft is derived from liquidtheory thermodynamic principles it is ideal for nanofluidic systems with small spatial dimensions high surface charge densities high ion concentrations andor large ions ionion correlations are expected to be important in these regimes leading to nonlinear phenomena such as charge inversion wherein more counterions adsorb at the wall than is necessary to neutralize its surface charge leading to a second layer of coions we show that dft unlike other theories that do not include ionion correlations can predict charge inversion and other nonlinear phenomena that lead to qualitatively different current densities and ion velocities for both pressuredriven and electroosmotic flows we therefore propose that dft can be a valuable modeling and design tool for nanofluidic devices as they become smaller and more highly charged © 2011 elsevier inc

in this numerical study we investigate the flow induced by metachronal coordination between beating cilia arranged in a densely packed layer by means of a continuum model the continuum approach allows us to treat the problem as twodimensional as well as stationary in a reference frame moving with the speed of the metachronal wave the model is used as a computationally efficient design tool to investigate ciliainduced transport of a newtonian fluid in a plane channel contrary to prior continuum models the present approach accounts for spatial variations in the porosity along the metachronal wave and thus ensures conservation of mass within the cilia layer using porousmedia theory the governing volumeaveraged navierâ€stokes vans equations are derived and closure formulations are given explicitly for the model this makes it possible to investigate ciliainduced flow with a continuum model in both the viscous regime and the inertial regime the results show that metachronal coordination can act as a transport mechanism in both regimes porosity variations appear to be the key mechanism for correct prediction of the fluid transport in the viscous flow regime the reason is that spatial variations in the porosity break the symmetry of the drag distribution along the metachronal wave a new insight that has been gained is that the fluid transport reverses thus switches from plectic to antiplectic metachronism for the same cilia beat cycle when the wavespeed is increased such that inertial effects occur based on a parameter study the net transport in the channel is described by a powerlaw relation of the amplitude length and speed of the metachronal wave it is found that the wavelength has the strongest effect on the viscositydominated fluid transport © 2011 cambridge university press
we study a liquid jet that breaks up into drops in an external coflowing liquid inside a confining microfluidic geometry the jet breakup can occur right after the nozzle in a phenomenon named dripping or through the generation of a liquid jet that breaks up a long distance from the nozzle which is called jetting traditionally these two regimes have been considered to reflect the existence of two kinds of spatiotemporal instabilities of a fluid jet the dripping regime corresponding to an absolutely unstable jet and the jetting regime to a convectively unstable jet here we present quantitative measurements of the dripping and jetting regimes both in an unforced and a forced state and compare these measurements with recent theoretical studies of spatiotemporal instability of a confined liquid jet in a coflowing liquid in the unforced state the frequency of oscillation and breakup of the liquid jet is measured and compared to the theoretical predictions the dominant frequency of the jet oscillations as a function of the inner flow rate agrees qualitatively with the theoretical predictions in the jetting regime but not in the dripping regime in the forced state achieved with periodic laser heating the dripping regime is found to be insensitive to the perturbation and the frequency of drop formation remains unaltered the jetting regime on the contrary amplifies the externally imposed frequency which translates into the formation of drops at the frequency imposed by the external forcing in conclusion the dripping and jetting regimes are found to exhibit the main features of absolutely and convectively unstable flows respectively but the frequency selection in the dripping regime is not ruled by the absolute frequency predicted by the stability analysis © 2011 american institute of physics

in this study we present experiments on the generation and control of droplets with a wide range of size in a microfluidic device composed of flowfocusing crossjunction geometry with a convergingdiverging nozzleshaped section the microfluidic structure was made of polydimethylsiloxane pdms for the generation of waterinoil droplets it is found that adding the convergingdiverging section to the crossjunction significantly reduces the droplet size without greatly increasing the overall flow resistance and still achieves good uniformity the throat of the convergingdiverging section determines the breakup location of the droplet emulsion the effects of the throat width on the scaling for the size of droplets are most pronounced in the higher range of the continuousphase to dispersedphase flow rate ratio where the sheardriven mechanism dominates the breakup in this regime the shearing effects are largely enhanced by the strong acceleration and deceleration created in the convergingdiverging section these effects enable us to generate droplets with a wide range of diameter including those as small as 10 μm or less in the microfluidic devices having channel dimensions on the order of 100 μrn © 2011 the japan society of applied physics

in this work we report a rich sequence of elastic transitions captured experimentally using a viscoelastic shearthinning solution the experiments were carried out in a microchannel with a sudden contraction followed by a smooth expansion taking advantage of the distinctive conditions provided by microfluidic viscoelastic flows ie the capability of achieving high deborah numbers de while keeping the reynolds numbers low enough so that inertia does not have a significant impact we studied the effect of de on the flow patterns and were able to achieve a flow regime at sufficiently high de in which the flow becomes unsteady with the main vortices formed upstream of the contraction varying in size substantially and very rapidly resembling what afonso et al 1 coined as the backshedding regime this process is accompanied by the formation of secondary vortices which are shed in the upstream flow direction a similar phenomenon was also captured by our preliminary numerical simulations performed using the oldroydb constitutive equation
we consider the stability of a thin liquid film with a free charged surface resting on a solid charged substrate by performing a general orrsommerfeld os analysis complemented by a longwave lw analysis an externally applied field generates an electroosmotic flow eof near the solid substrate and an electrophoretic flow epf at the free surface the epf retards the eof when both the surfaces have the same sign of the potential and can even lead to the flow reversal in a part of the film in conjunction with the hydrodynamic stress the maxwell stress is also considered in the problem formulation the electrokinetic potential at the liquidair and solidliquid interfaces is modelled by the poissonboltzmann equation with the debyehückel approximation the os analysis shows a finitewavenumber shear mode of instability when the inertial forces are strong and an lw interfacial mode of instability in the regime where the viscous force dominates interestingly both the modes are found to form beyond a critical flow rate the shear interfacial mode is found to be dominant when the film is thick thin the electric field applied is strong weak and the zetapotentials on the liquidair and solidliquid interfaces are high small the lw analysis predicts the presence of the interfacial mode but fails to capture the shear mode the change in the propagation direction of the interfacial mode with the zetapotential is predicted by both os and lw analyses the parametric range in which the lw analysis is valid is thus demonstrated © 2011 wileyvch verlag gmbh co kgaa weinheim

achievement of efficient mixing in microfluidic systems appears to be a highly challenging proposition as attributable to typical low reynolds number hydrodynamics over small scales to circumvent these constraints numerous strategies either relying upon a modulation in the microchannel geometry or involving active flow perturbations have been proposed in the literature however while the geometric or passive means suffer from a lack of dynamic control on the mixing process the active methods can be unfavorably energy expensive here we show that the problem of controllability and energy efficiency can be optimized to a large extent by combining the active and passive strategies within an integrated microfluidic platform in the form of serpentine microchannel geometry with embedded electrodes we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that in specific operating regimes the mixing effectiveness expressed in terms of a quantifiable index of the designed system can be nontrivially higher than the algebraic sum of effectivenesses realized from pure active and passive mixing configurations leading to a nonlinear amplification in the separation efficiency results of our experiments may be used a generic design principle for optimized mixing performance of labonachip microdevices with a judicious combination of the active and passive mixing paradigms © 2012 american institute of physics

a dual lab on a chip dloc approach that enables simultaneous optical and electrochemical detection working in a continuous flow regime is presented both detection modes are integrated for the first time into a single detection volume and operate simultaneously with no evidence of crosstalk the electrochemical cell was characterized amperometrically by measuring the current in ferrocyanide solutions at 04 v vs gold pseudoreference electrode at a flow rate of 200 μl min 1 the experimental results for ferrocyanide concentrations ranging from 0005 to 2 mm were in good agreement with the values predicted by the levich equation for a microelectrode inside a rectangular channel with a sensitivity of 2059 ± 0004 μa mm 1 and a limit of detection lod of 2303 ± 0004×10 3 mm besides optical detection was evaluated by measuring the absorbance of ferricyanide solutions at 420 nm the results obtained therein coincide with those predicted by the beerlambert law for a range of ferricyanide concentrations from 0005 to 03 mm and showed an estimated lod of 0553 ± 0001×10 3 mm the dloc was finally applied to the analysis of llactate via a bienzymatic reaction involving lactate oxidase lox and horseradish peroxidase hrp here the consumption of the reagent of the reaction ferrocyanide was continuously monitored by amperometry whereas the product of the reaction ferricyanide was recorded by absorbance the dloc presented good performance in terms of sensitivity and limit of detection comparable to other fluidic systems found in the literature additionally the ability to simultaneously quantify enzymatic reagent consumption and product generation confers the dloc a selfverifying capability which in turn enhances its robustness and reliability © 2012 american chemical society
in microducts deviation from continuum flow behaviour of a gas increases with rarefaction when using navierstokes equations to calculate a flow under slightly and moderately rarefied conditions slip boundary conditions are used which in turn refer to the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient tmac here we demonstrate that in the socalled slip and transition regime the flow in microducts can be reliably described by a consistently nonempirical model without considering the tmac we obtain this equation by superposition of convective transport and fickian diffusion using twodimensional solutions of navierstokes equations and a description for the knudsen diffusion coefficient as derived from kinetic theory respectively for a wide variety of measurement series found in the literature the calculation predicts the data accurately surprisingly only size of the duct temperature gas properties and inlet and outlet pressure are necessary to calculate the resulting mass flow by means of a single algebraic equation from this and taking the discrepancies of the tmac concerning surface roughness and nature of the gases into account we could conclude that neither the diffusive proportions nor the total mass flow rates are influenced by surface topology and chemistry at knudsen numbers below unity compared to the tube geometry the model slightly underestimates the flow rate in rectangular channels when rarefaction increases likewise the dimensionless mass flow rate and the diffusive proportion of the total flow are distinctly higher in a tube thus the crosssectional geometry has a significant influence on the transport mechanisms under rarefied conditions © 2012 cambridge university press
the aim of this work was to quantify the performance of two wellknown mixing mechanisms used in microreactors the splitandrecombination sar and the multilamination by means of an interdigital structure the residence time distribution rtd and the mixing performance in laminar flow regime were experimentally characterized by the tracer pulseinput technique and the iodideiodate villermauxdushman method rtd analysis indicates bypassing caused by uneven flow distribution in the manifolds of both microreactors a decrease of the quadratic dependence of axial dispersion on fluid velocity is produced by the improved tracer homogenization achieved in the microfluidic structures the iodideiodate method shows that below a critical damköhler number the microreactors exhibit a superior mixing performance than a conventional tjunction the interdigital microreactor displayed the best mixing capabilities for all the flow conditions investigated however the estimation of energy dissipation confirms that the improved mixing performance of the interdigital unit is obtained at the expense of greater energy expenditure when compared with the splitandrecombination microreactor © 2011 american chemical society

we report a microfluidic approach which allows selective and controlled 11 21 or 31 droplet fusion a surfactantstabilized droplet with an interfacial surfactant coverage γ of 98 will fuse spontaneously with a second droplet when γ of the latter droplet is 16 however when γ of the second droplet is ∼66 the two droplets will not fuse unless they have previously been brought into contact for critical time τ therefore controlling the number of droplets in contact for time τ allows precise control over the number of fused droplets we have demonstrated efficient proportion of droplets coalesced pc 10 n 1000 and selective 11 21 or 31 droplet fusion proportion of correctly fused droplets ps 099 n 1000 coalescence in this regime is induced by hydrodynamic flow causing interface separation and is efficient at different ca numbers and using different dispersed phases continuous phases and surfactants however when γ of the second droplet is ∼96 coalescence is no longer observed dropletbased microfluidic systems in which each droplet functions as an independent microreactor are proving a promising tool for a wide range of ultrahighthroughput applications in biology and chemistry the addition of new reagents to preformed droplets is critical to many of these applications and we believe the system described here is a simple and flexible method to do so as well as a new tool to study interfacial stability phenomena © 2012 the royal society of chemistry
the process by which a protein folds into its native conformation is highly relevant to biology and human health yet still poorly understood one reason for this is that folding takes place over a wide range of timescales from nanoseconds to seconds or longer depending on the protein conventional stoppedflow mixers have allowed measurement of folding kinetics starting at about 1 ms we have recently developed a microfluidic mixer that dilutes denaturant 100fold in 8 μs unlike a stoppedflow mixer this mixer operates in the laminar flow regime in which turbulence does not occur the absence of turbulence allows precise numeric simulation of all flows within the mixer with excellent agreement to experiment laminar flow is achieved for reynolds numbers re ≤100 for aqueous solutions this requires micron scale geometries we use a hard substrate such as silicon or fused silica to make channels 510 μm wide and 10 μm deep see figure 1 the smallest dimensions at the entrance to the mixing region are on the order of 1 μm in size the chip is sealed with a thin glass or fused silica coverslip for optical access typical total linear flow rates are 1 ms yielding re10 but the protein consumption is only 05 nls or 18 μlhr protein concentration depends on the detection method for tryptophan fluorescence the typical concentration is 100 μm for 1 trpprotein and for fret the typical concentration is 100 nm the folding process is initiated by rapid dilution of denaturant from 6 m to 006 m guanidine hydrochloride the protein in high denaturant flows down a central channel and is met on either side at the mixing region by buffer without denaturant moving 100 times faster see figure 2 this geometry causes rapid constriction of the protein flow into a narrow jet 100 nm wide diffusion of the light denaturant molecules is very rapid while diffusion of the heavy protein molecules is much slower diffusing less than 1 μm in 1 ms the difference in diffusion constant of the denaturant and the protein results in rapid dilution of the denaturant from the protein stream reducing the effective concentration of the denaturant around the protein the protein jet flows at a constant rate down the observation channel and fluorescence of the protein during folding can be observed using a scanning confocal microscope © 2012 creative commons attribution license

particle concentration is a key unit operation in biochemical assays although there are many techniques for particle concentration in continuousphase microfluidics relatively few are available in multiphase plugbased microfluidics existing approaches generally require external electric or magnetic fields together with charged or magnetized particles this paper reports a passive technique for particle concentration in waterinoil plugs which relies on the interaction between particle sedimentation and the recirculating vortices inherent to plug flow in a cylindrical capillary this interaction can be quantified using the shields parameter θ a dimensionless ratio of a particles drag force to its gravitational force which scales with plug velocity three regimes of particle behavior are identified when θ is less than the movement threshold region i particles sediment to the bottom of the plug where the internal vortices subsequently concentrate the particles at the rear of the plug we demonstrate highly efficient concentration 100 of 38 μm glass beads in 500 μm diameter plugs traveling at velocities up to 5 mms as θ is increased beyond the movement threshold region ii particles are suspended in welldefined circulation zones which begin at the rear of the plug the length of the zone scales linearly with plug velocity and at sufficiently large θ it spans the length of the plug region iii a second effect attributed to the corotating vortices at the rear cap causes particle aggregation in the cap regardless of flow velocity region i is useful for concentratingcollecting particles while the latter two are useful for mixing the beads with the solution therefore the two key steps of a beadbased assay concentration and resuspension can be achieved simply by changing the plug velocity by exploiting an interaction of sedimentation and recirculation unique to multiphase flow this simple technique achieves particle concentration without onchip components and could therefore be applied to a range of heterogeneous screening assays in discrete nl plugs © 2012 american institute of physics

fluid flow phenomena in the stokesian regime abounds in nature as well as in microfluidic applications discretizations based on boundary integral formulations for such flow problems allow for a reduction in dimensionality but have to deal with dense matrices and the numerical evaluation of integrals with singular kernels the focus of this paper is the discretization of wall confinements and specifically the numerical treatment of flat solid boundaries walls for which a set of highorder quadrature rules that accurately integrate the singular kernel of the stokes equations are developed discretizing by nyströms method the accuracy of the numerical integration determines the accuracy of the solution of the boundary integral equations and a higher order quadrature method yields a large gain in accuracy at negligible cost the structure of the resulting submatrix associated with each wall is exploited in order to substantially reduce the memory usage the expected convergence of the quadrature rules is validated through numerical tests and this boundary treatment is further applied to the classical problem of a sedimenting sphere in the vicinity of solid walls © 2012 elsevier ltd

flow in unsaturated porous media or in engineered microfluidic systems is dominated by capillary and viscous forces consequently flow regimes may differ markedly from conventional flows reflecting strong interfacial influences on small bodies of flowing liquids in this work we visualized liquid transport patterns in open capillary channels with a range of opening sizes from 06 to 50 mm using laser scanning confocal microscopy combined with fluorescent latex particles 10 μm as tracers at a mean velocity of ∼050 mm s 1 the observed velocity profiles indicate limited mobility at the air water interface the application of the stokes equation with mixed boundary conditions ie no slip on the channel walls and partial slip or shear stress at the air water interface clearly illustrates the increasing importance of interfacial shear stress with decreasing channel size interfacial shear stress emerges from the velocity gradient from the adjoining noslip walls to the center where flow is trapped in a region in which capillary forces dominate in addition the increased contribution of capillary forces relative to viscous forces to flow on the microscale leads to increased interfacial curvature which together with interfacial shear stress affects the velocity distribution and flow pattern eg reverse flow in the contact line region we found that partial slip rather than the commonly used stressfree condition provided a more accurate description of the boundary condition at the confined air water interface reflecting the key role that surfaceinterface effects play in controlling flow behavior on the nanoscale and microscale © 2012 american chemical society
moderately rarefied gas flows are clearly distinguished from viscous flow in the continuum regime and from molecular diffusion at high rarefaction they are an intermediate of the two border cases referred to as slip flow and transition regime flow here we present a new pencilandpaper approach for modeling flows in these regimes by a superposition of convection and fickian diffusion it allows us to predict mass flows for helium argon nitrogencarbon dioxide in microducts with parallel walls and with slightly varying cross section the model was validated by measurement series taken from literature and by own permeation experiments on tapered microchannels analytical investigation of the approach showed that the diffusive flow is proportional to the crosssectional area at the channel entrance hence the mass flow in a tapered channel is unequal in both directions when diffusion dominates due to increased rarefaction in contrary to the common maxwellian slip approach the superposition model describes the data reliably from this we conclude that deviations from continuum behavior in the intermediate can not be explained by slip flow at the walls and tangential momentum accommodation but by fickian diffusion now predictions are possible without any usage of fitted parameters such as the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient © 2012 american institute of physics

a timeresolved micropiv method is presented to measure in an eof the particles zeta potential in situ during the transient startup of a microdevice the method resolves the electrophoretic velocity of fluorospheres used as tracer particles in micropiv this approach exploits the short transient regime of the eof generated after a potential drop is imposed across a microchannel and before reaching quasisteady state during the starting of the transient regime the electrophoretic effect is dominant in the center of the channel and the eof is negligible by measuring the velocity of the tracer particles with a micropiv system during that starting period their electrophoretic velocity is obtained the technique also resolves the temporal evolution of the eof with three regions identified the first region occurs before the electroosmotic effect reaches the center of the channel the second region extends until the eof reaches steady state and thereafter is the third region the two time constants separating these regions are also obtained and compared to the theory the zeta potential of 860 nm diameter polystyrene particles is calculated for different solutions including borate buffer sodium chloride and deionized water results show that the magnitudes of the electrophoretic and electroosmotic velocities are in the range of 300 to 700 μms for these measurements the zeta potential values are compared to the wellestablished closed cell technique showing improved accuracy the method also resolves the characteristic response time of the eof showing small but important deviations from current analytical predictions additionally the measurements can be performed in situ in microfluidic devices under actual working eof conditions and without the need for calibrations © 2012 wileyvch verlag gmbh co kgaa weinheim
droplet formation and breakup dynamics in either dripping or jetting regimes in microfluidic flowfocusing devices were investigated experimentally more viscous liquids were dispersed into less viscous liquids in square microchannels with 600 and 400 μm wide respectively in the dripping regime for low viscosity ratio of both phases the variation of the minimum width of the dispersed thread with the remaining time could be scaled as a powerlaw relationship with exponent related to initial conditions and the droplet size could be correlated with the flow rate ratio of both phases and the capillary number of the continuous phase while for high viscosity ratio of both phases the dispersed thread experiences a linear thinning procedure and the droplet size can be scaled with the weber number of the continuous phase in the jetting regime the stable jet width was affected by the viscosity ratio and flow rate ratio of both phases and the relationship between the droplet size and the flow rate ratio of both phases could be scaled as a powerlaw relation with the exponent dependent on the viscosity ratio of both phases the analysis of the mode of the maximum instability of the oil jet indicated that the most unstable instability is related to the viscosity ratio of both phases and is almost independent on the flow rate ratio of both phases © 2012 elsevier ltd

during the last two decades most of the studies on microchannels shows deviations with respect to traditional laws as unusual friction factors or shifts in the transition between laminar and turbulent flow our study consists in characterizing the dynamic field and heat transfer aspect of a flow in smooth circular minichannels using a commercial code cfx 571 this code use the finite volume method to solve the equations of navierstokes and offer several turbulences models in this study the shear stress turbulence model sst is used the results obtained are rich in information in addition to the results from the theory established for the traditional pipes we have experimental results obtained for a minichannel of size similar to those of our study the validation of our calculations is thus made by a comparison with experimental measurements reynaud and theoretical values a good agreement is observed note however that a light deviation is observed concerning the transition zone between laminar and turbulent regime this zone seems to be located for values of reynolds number going from 1000 and 5000 this result was confirmed by many researchers working in the field of the mini and microfluidics these values show that the transition zone is more precisely pointed than the classical theory predicted it the results of this study are not likely to give in cause validity of the traditional laws in the case of the minichannels until a diameter of 01mm we showed that deviations are observed compared to the traditional correlations but generally a good agreement is noted
one of the fundamental problems in supramolecular chemistry as well as in material sciences is how to control the selfassembly of polymers on the nanometer scale and how to spontaneously organize them towards the macroscopic scale to overcome this problem inspired by the selfassembly systems in nature which feature the dynamically controlled selfassembly of biopolymers we have previously proposed a selfassembly system that uses a dynamic liquidliquid interface with dimensions in the micrometer regime thereby allowing polymers to selfassemble under precisely controlled nonequilibrium conditions herein we further extend this system to the creation of hierarchical selfassembled architectures of polysaccharides a natural polysaccharide β13glucan spg and water were injected into opposite legs of microfluidic devices that had a yshape junction so that two solvents would gradually mix in the down stem thereby causing spg to spontaneously selfassemble along the flow in a headtotail fashion mainly through hydrophobic interactions in the initial stage several spg nanofibers would selfassemble at the yjunction owing to the shearing force thereby creating oligomers with a threeway junction point this unique structure which could not be created through conventional mixing procedures has a divergent selfassembly capability the dynamic flow allows the oligomers to interact continuously with spg nanofibers that are fed into the yjunction thus amplifying the nanostructure along the flow to form spg networks consequently we were able to create stable centimeterlength macroscopic polysaccharide strands under the selected flow conditions which implies that spg nanofibers were assembled hierarchically in a supramolecular fashion in the dynamic flow microscopic observations including sem and afm analysis revealed the existence of clear hierarchical structures inside the obtained strand the network structures selfassembled to form submicrometersized fibers the long fibers further entangled with each other to give stable micrometersized fibers which finally assembled to form the macroscopic strands in which the final stabilities in the macroscopic regime were governed by that of the network structures in the nanometer regime thus we have exploited this new supramolecular system to create hierarchical polymeric architectures under precisely controlled flow conditions by combining the conventional supramolecular strategy with microfluidic science you spin me right round a new supramolecular system is described for the hierarchical organization of selfassembling polymers which combines conventional supramolecular strategies with microfluidic science by using this system stable macroscopic polysaccharide strands with centimeterscale lengths were created in which polysaccharide nanofibers were assembled hierarchically in a supramolecular fashion by the dynamic flow see figure copyright © 2012 wileyvch verlag gmbh co kgaa weinheim

we present a mathematical model and corresponding series of microfluidic experiments examining the flow of a viscous fluid past an elastic fibre in a threedimensional channel the fibres axis lies perpendicular to the direction of flow and its base is clamped to one wall of the channel the sidewalls of the channel are close to the fibre confining the flow experiments show that there is a linear relationship between deflection and flow rate for highly confined fibres at low flow rates which inspires an asymptotic treatment of the problem in this regime the threedimensional problem is reduced to a twodimensional model consisting of heleshaw flow past a barrier with boundary conditions at the barrier that allow for the effects of flexibility and threedimensional leakage the analysis yields insight into the competing effects of flexion and leakage and an analytical solution is derived for the leadingorder pressure field corresponding to a slit that partially blocks a twodimensional channel the predictions of our model show favourable agreement with experimental results allowing measurement of the fibres elasticity and the flow rate in the channel © 2013 cambridge university press

the bubble formation in a square microchannel with a converging shape mixing junction has been investigated under gasliquid taylor flow using a highspeed camera a typical bubble formation process was found to consist of two steps including the expansion and rupture steps the bubble length could be approximated as the product of the rupture time and twophase mixture velocity significant influence of liquid viscosity and twophase mixture velocity on the bubble length was observed although a linear dependence of the bubble length on gasliquid flow ratio is present for a given twophase mixture velocity or liquid viscosity this indicates that shear stress plays an important role in determining the bubble length in the current microfluidic device even at low capillary numbers where the squeezing regime is expected to predominate an empirical correlation expressing the bubble length as a function of gasliquid flow ratio liquid viscosity and twophase mixture velocity was developed to describe the experimental results the bubble frequency was found to reach a maximum as gasliquid flow ratio is increased from 05 to 1 the crosssectional shape of taylor bubble was close to be square at low capillary numbers which is in agreement with the literature results © 2013 elsevier bv

a generalised form of the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic fene model for modelling nonlinear flow of semidilute polymer solutions is proposed it accounts for conformationdependent polymer elasticity and predicts shearthinning shear viscosity nonlinear elongational viscosity and first and second normal stress differences the rheometric material functions predicted by the model are critically compared with the results of the linear phanthientanner model the predictabilities of these constitutive models under benchmark flow problems are evaluated by timedependent simulations using finite volume method based on a cfd simulation toolbox the effects of the model parameters the inertia and the contraction ratio are numerically studied the modified fene model qualitatively captures the nonlinear flow phenomena of polymer solution in the high elasticity number el flow regime observed in experiments the results show that an accurate growth function of the elongational viscosity is the key to the prediction of the timedependent highly asymmetric flow patterns © 2013 springerverlag berlin heidelberg
the majority of bacteria in nature live in biofilms where they are encased by extracellular polymeric substances eps and adhere to various surfaces and interfaces investigating the process of biofilm formation is critical for advancing our understanding of microbes in their most common mode of living despite progress in characterizing the effect of various environmental factors on biofilm formation work remains to be done in the realm of exploring the interrelationship between hydrodynamics microbial adhesion and biofilm growth we investigate the impact of secondary flow structures which are created due to semiconfined features in a microfluidic device on biofilm formation of shewanella oneidensis mr1 secondary flows are important in many natural and artificial systems but few studies have investigated their role in biofilm formation to direct secondary flows in the creeping flow regime where the reynolds number is low we flow microbeladen culture through microscale confinement features we demonstrate that these confinement features can result in pronounced changes in biofilm dynamics as a function of the fluid flow rate © 2012 springerverlag berlin heidelberg
this paper investigates the hydrodynamics of the twophase liquidgas taylor or slug flow regime commonly encountered in micro and minichannel flows the primary focus is on understanding the mechanisms that lead to variations in the thickness of deposited liquid films and their effect on flow dynamics a variety of test fluids are utilised over a range of experimental velocities leading to significant variations in capillary and reynolds number slug flow regimes and liquid films formed under these conditions are observed using high speed optical microscopy with refractive index matching used to account for tube external curvature an analytical correction procedure is also employed to correct for refraction errors due to light transmission through differing depths of liquid film on the interior tube surface since each fluid has differing refractive index experimental data is found to correlate well with an existing model for film thickness when bubble velocity is used in evaluating capillary number while this model was developed for capillary numbers up to 03 the present data significantly extends its application range to capillary numbers as high as 19 a significant difference between the bubble and mean two phase velocity was also observed and related to the ratio of crosssectional areas between the channel and the bubble which is shown to be valid when the viscosity ratio between phases is sufficiently high furthermore a new model is put forward for predicting bubble velocity in taylor flows when the viscosity ratio between phases is low and velocity within the film becomes appreciable expansion of the gaseous phase due to pressure drop along the channel was also shown to contribute to a significant increase in mean two phase velocity and this was successfully accounted for using pressure drop correlations and ideal gas relations overall the study provides a greater understanding of liquid film deposition and bubble dynamics in taylor flows and should enable future studies to more accurately model parameters of interest in microfluidic devices incorporating such flows © 2013 elsevier ltd

we analyse the steadystate convectiondiffusion mixing of a solute by a creeping circulatory flow in a long sealed rectangular twodimensional channel with impermeable sidewalls and fixed different solute concentrations at the two opposite edges solution circulation is due to a constant velocity slip along the sidewalls and a back flow along the channel axis this simple model distils the essence of circulation in concentration polarization of an electrolyte solution under a dc electric current in a microchannel sealed by an ionselective element a nanochannel or a cation exchange membrane it is observed that in the slow circulation regime small pe numbers the solute flux through the channel is governed by the tayloraris dispersion mechanism ie the flux is driven by the crosssectional average axial concentration gradient whereas upon increase in pe this mechanism fails the general question addressed is where the system goes after the breakdown of the tayloraris dispersion regime in order to find out the answer the following specific questions have to be addressed 1 how does the tayloraris dispersion mechanism break down upon increase in pe 2 why does it break down 3 what is the role of the channel aspect ratio in this breakdown the answers to these questions are obtained through analysing a hierarchy of suitable auxiliary model problems including the unidirectional zero discharge channel flow and the circulatory analogue of planeparallel couette flow for which most of the analysis is done they may be summarized as follows upon increase in circulation velocity the tayloraris dispersion mechanism fails due to the formation of lateral nonuniformities of longitudinal solute concentration gradient driving the dispersion flux these nonuniformities accumulate in protrusionlike disturbances of the solute concentration wall fingers emerging near the channel sidewall at the flow exit from the edge wall fingers propagate along the sidewalls with increase in pe and eventually reach the opposite channel edges transforming into narrow surface convection layers these layers together with the edge diffusion layers form a closed mass transport pattern carrying most of the mass flux through the channel with the bulk largely excluded from the transport the formation of this pattern finalizes the transition from tayloraris dispersion to the surface convection regime for large circulation velocities concentration distribution in the surface convection layers attains an oscillatory spiral structure reminiscent of thermal waves in heat conduction © 2013 cambridge university press

as global energy usage increases maximizing oil recovery from known reserves becomes crucial to meet the rising demand in this work we present the development of a microfluidic sandstone platform capable of quickly and inexpensively testing the performance of fluids with different rheological properties on the recovery of oil specifically in this study we utilized these microfluidic devices to examine how shearthinning shearthickening and viscoelastic fluids affect oil recovery initial baseline experiments were performed by displacing oil with both water and a watersurfactant solution over a wide range of flow rates the surfactant was found to reduce the interfacial tension of the water by a factor of ten and increased oil recovery by approximately 15 when compared to oil displaced by water at the same flow rates flopaam a commercially available fluid thickener that is shearthinning and viscoelastic was also studied it was found to displace more oil then either the water or the surfactant solution and increase oil recovery at all flow rates studied finally a shearthickening nanoparticle solution was studied which was designed to thicken at a shear rate of approximately 10s1 the shear rate corresponds to typical shear rates in the oil reservoirs and values easily attainable in our microfluidic sandstone device these shearthickening fluids were found to be particularly effective at oil recovery this was especially true for flowrates that closely matched the shear rates associated with the shearthickening regime when the appropriate choice of shear rate dependent viscosity was used to the capillary number the oil recovery obtained from both the newtonian and nonnewtonian was found to collapse quite well onto a single master curve additionally it was shown that a twostage recovery process that starts with an initial water flood followed by a flood with a secondary fluid can recover as much oil as a single stage recovery with that secondary fluid alone these results clearly demonstrate that the microfluidic sandstone devices presented in this paper both reduce the time and cost required to investigate the effectiveness of enhanced oil recovery fluids using traditional methods and can serve to quickly focus searches for customized oil recovery fluid selection © 2013 elsevier bv

microfluidic mixing devices are increasingly popular tools for probing the nonequilibrium dynamics of biomolecular systems commonly hydrodynamic focusing is used to reduce the length scales that limit the time of diffusive mixing in the laminar flow regime such that even submillisecond dead times for triggering a reaction have been achieved detection of a suitable signal at different points along the channel downstream of the mixing region corresponding to different times after mixing then allows the kinetics of the reaction to be obtained however the requisite accurate conversion of the positions in the channel to times after mixing is complicated by taylor dispersion the combined effect of diffusion and shear flow on the dispersion of the molecules in the microfluidic device as a result an accurate positiontotime conversion has only been possible in the limiting regimes ie for very early times where sample diffusion can be neglected and for very long times where the molecules have uniformly sampled the entire channel crosssection here we use detailed threedimensional timedependent finiteelement calculations to obtain an accurate positiontotime conversion that bridges these two limits and allows us to quantify the effects of taylor dispersion on the time resolution of a representative mixing device optimized for singlemolecule fluorescence detection the accuracy of the calculations is confirmed by direct comparison of the calculated velocity field with dualfocus fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements © 2014 the royal society of chemistry

the combination of microarray technologies with microfluidic sample delivery and realtime detection methods has the capability to simultaneously monitor 101000 s of biomolecular interactions in a single experiment despite the benefits that microfluidic systems provide they typically operate in the laminar flow regime under mass transfer limitations where large analyte depletion layers act as a resistance to analyte capture by locally stirring the fluid and delivering fresh analyte to the capture spot the use of passive mixing structures in a microarray environment can reduce the negative effects of these depletion layers and enhance the sensor performance despite their large potential little attention has been given to the integration of these mixing structures in microarray sensing environments in this study we use passive mixing structures to enhance the mass transfer of analyte to a capture spot within a microfluidic flow cell using numerical methods different structure shapes and heights were evaluated as means to increase local fluid velocities and in turn rates of mass transfer to a capture spot these results were verified experimentally via the realtime detection of 20mer ssdna for an array of microspots both numerical and experimental results showed that a passive mixing structure situated directly over the capture spot can significantly enhance the binding rate of analyte to the sensing surface moreover we show that these structures can be used to enhance mass transfer in experiments regarding an array of capture spots the results of this study can be applied to any experimental system using microfluidic sample delivery methods for microarray detection techniques © 2013 elsevier bv

we report a novel electrical control in droplet microfluidics using an ac electric field the method can be used to actively control and tune the size of waterinoil droplets formed in a microfluidic flow focusing device electrodes fabricated using microsolidics technique are not in contact with the fluids and hence prevent undesirable electrochemical reactions the proposed electrical control is able to change the size of the droplets in the order of millisecond and also to manipulate the size of the droplets formed at single droplet level through the change in applied voltages and signal an electromediated droplet formation regime transition from dripping to jetting is also observed due to the changes in the maxwell stress arising from the application of the ac electric field at applied frequency of between 50 to 5 khz the change in droplet sizes follow similar trend for the case of pure di water but is different for the case of nacl solution copyright © 2013 by asme
investigation of fluid flow and heat transfer in rotating microchannels is important for centrifugal microfluidics which has emerged as an advanced technique in biomedical applications and chemical separations the pseudo forces namely the centrifugal force and the coriolis force arising as a consequence of the rotating reference frame change the flow pattern significantly from the parabolic profile in a nonrotating channel the convective heat transfer process is also influenced by the secondary flow introduced by the rotational effect moreover if the microchannel wall is hydrophobic slip flow can occur inside the channel when the conventional no slip boundary condition is no longer valid in this work we have numerically investigated the flow and heat transfer inside a straight rotating rectangular microchannel in the slip flow regime a pressure based finite volume technique in a staggered grid was applied to solve the steady incompressible navierstokes and energy equations it has been observed that depending on the rotational velocity different slip velocities are induced at the channel walls the average fluid temperature increases with the increase of rotation as convective heat transfer mechanism is increased due to the secondary flow however the slip boundary condition has a negligible effect on the temperature profiles copyright © 2012 by asme
very high heat transfer enhancement can be achieved in singlephase flows by using twistedtape inserts in circular tubes the primary convection mechanism is the generation of helical swirl or secondary fluid motion that is induced by the helical curvature of the tape insert this promotes crossstream mixing and sharper wall gradients which are further aided by the increased flow velocity due to the tube partitioning and blockage along with an effectively longer helical flow length these phenomena are scaled for both laminar and turbulent flow regimes and an evaluation of the transition is also given to highlight the damping effects of tapegenerated swirl the nature of swirl and its dimensionless scaling and concomitant development of predictive correlations for heat transfer coefficients and friction factors are discussed finally a brief discussion of the quantification of heat transfer enhancement by means of twisted tapes is given so as to extend their application in heat exchanger design copyright © 2012 by asme
the main aim of this study is to examine how the droplet formation in microfluidic tjunctions is influenced by the crosssection and aspect ratio of the microchannels several studies focusing on droplet formation in microfluidic devices have investigated the effect of geometry on droplet generation in terms of the ratio between the width of the main channel and the width of the side arm of the tjunction however the contribution of the aspect ratio and thus that of the crosssection on the mechanism of break up has not been examined thoroughly with most of the existing work performed in the squeezing regime two different microchannel geometries of varying aspect ratios are employed in an attempt to quantify the effect of the ratio between the width of the main channel and the height of the channel on droplet formation as both height and width of microchannels affect the area on which shear stress acts deforming the dispersed phase fluid thread up to the limit of detaching a droplet it is postulated that geometry and specifically crosssection of the main channel contribute on the droplet breakup mechanisms and should not be neglected the above hypothesis is examined in detail comparing the volume of generated microdroplets at constant flowrate ratios and superficial velocities of continuous phase in two microchannel systems of two different aspect ratios operating at dripping regime highspeed imaging has been utilised to visualise and measure droplets formed at different flowrates corresponding to constant superficial velocities comparing volumes of generated droplets in the two geometries of area ratio near 15 a significant increase in volume is reported for the larger aspect ratio utilised at all superficial velocities tested as both superficial velocity of continuous phase and flowrate ratio are fixed superficial velocity of dispersed phase varies however this variation is not considered to be large enough to justify the significant increase in the droplet volume therefore it can be concluded that droplet generation is influenced by the aspect ratio and thus the crosssection of the main channel and its effect should not be depreciated the paper will present supporting evidence in detail and a comparison of the findings with the existing theories which are mainly focused on the squeezing regime copyright © 2013 by asme
characteristics of gasliquid twophase flow under elevated pressures up to 30 mpa in a microchannel are investigated to provide the guidance for microreactor designs relevant to industrial application the results indicate that a strong leakage flow through the channel corners occurs although the gas bubbles block the channel with a simplified estimation the leakage flow is shown to increase with an increase in pressure leading to a bubble formation shifting from transition regime to squeezing regime during the formation process the twophase dynamic interaction at the tjunction entrance would have a significant influence on the flow in the main channel as the moving velocity of generated bubbles varies periodically with the formation cycle other characteristics such as bubble formation frequency bubble and slug lengths bubble velocities gas holdup and the specific surface area are also discussed under different system pressures © 2013 american institute of chemical engineers

gaseous flows in microfluidic devices are often characterized by relatively high knudsen numbers for such flows the continuum approximation is not valid and directsimulation monte carlo dsmc may be used to find an appropriate solution for lowvelocity flows where the fluid velocity is much smaller than the mean molecular velocity large statistical fluctuations in the solution mean that the features of the flow may be obscured by noise in the solution this paper describes the use of a highorder nonlinear monotone convection algorithm fluxcorrected transport fct as a filter to extract the solution from the noisy dsmc calculation we examine the results of filtering a dsmc solution of a noisy lowvelocity microchannel flow using both the fct filter and a stochastic estimator commonly used to remove noise from noisy sensor measurements it is shown that fct filtering removes the highfrequency statistical fluctuations from the noisy dsmc solution while the stochastic estimator eventually tends toward the wrong solution although the application in this paper has been limited to microflows this filter has significant potential for a wide variety of dsmc problems used in physical regimes where statistical noise must be eliminated because it is a postprocessing operation and does not affect the dsmc calculation as it is running filtering can be applied to any dsmc solution this includes calculations with complex geometries the presence of many interacting species with chemical reactions varied and complicated boundary conditions and timedependent solutions

electrical circuit analogies are often used to design microfluidic systems because they simplify device design providing simple relationships between fluid flow rate driving forces and channel dimensions however such approximations often significantly overestimate flow rates in situations where startup energy losses from establishing kinetic head are similar in magnitude to the energy required to overcome viscous shear stresses as is often the case within complex microfluidic networks these reduced flows can be more accurately predicted within an electrical analogy framework that accounts for the nonlinear flow resistance generated on the transient regime of startup flow in this work standard flow resistance expressions are modified to account for such effects and the onset of nonlinear resistance is predicted by a dimensionless parameter xi refracdl ξ re d l which is dependent on the reynolds number and the channel length as a demonstration variable fluid resistance is shown to dramatically affect the flow performance of common microfluidic units such as tjunctions and serpentine channels and the change in performance is accurately predicted experimental and theoretical analysis of tjunctions further shows that variable flow resistance causes the ratio of flows through the junction to converge toward unity with respect to an increasing total flow rate in addition serpentine channels are shown to exaggerate these startup effects owing to compounded energetic demand associated with changing a flows direction as a result serpentine channels cause the ratio of flow rates exiting a tjunction to diverge from unity with respect to an increasing flow rate © 2013 springerverlag outside the usa

a fully coupled electrothermal flow model is developed to simulate the electrothermal flow inside a droplet under ac electrowetting on dielectric ewod with a needleplanarelectrode configuration the variations of electrothermal flow velocity and droplet temperature with frequency are compared with a classical electrothermal model and a previous experimental study the investigated frequency range is extended to include dielectrophoretic dep force dominant regime and differences of characteristics of velocity and temperature fields in the coulomb and dep force dominant regimes are discussed and compared effects of solution concentration and needle electrode position and size are also examined the results show that peak frequency to achieve the maximum electrothermal flow underestimated by the classical model is correctly predicted by the present fully coupled model after peak frequency the velocity decreases till the valley frequency where the minimum electrothermal flow can be achieved and then increases again and finally keeps almost unchanged after the valley frequency the rotation of internal flow changes from counterclockwise to clockwise when frequency is smaller the smaller the solution concentration the larger the electrothermal flow while when frequency is larger the result is opposite the peak frequency and its corresponding electrothermal flow velocity increase with the increase of solution concentration the needle electrode size has no influence on peak frequency but the maximum electrothermal flow velocity at the peak frequency increases with decreasing electrode size the smaller is the distance of needle electrode from the substrate the larger are the peak frequency and the corresponding maximum electrothermal flow velocity the numerical model developed and the results obtained in this study are useful for the design of droplet based electrothermal flow mixer in microfluidics © 2014 elsevier ltd

in a knudsen pump gas flows from the cold side to the hot side when a temperature gradient is established for the pump to operate the gas channels must be small such that the flow regime is transitional or free molecular in this paper a model for a thermoelectric based knudsen pump is presented the thermoelectric element which is nanoporous serves as a generator for the temperature gradient and as a medium for gas flow equations for the maximum mass flow rate and maximum pressure were obtained which can be used to optimize a knudsen pump using the model the authors found that the higher the thermoelectric figure of merit z the higher the generated pressure and mass flow rate the maximum pressure is independent of the thermoelectric dimensions which makes it readily integrated into many applications such as labona chip microelectromechanical systems and microfluidic devices © 2014 american vacuum society
we analyze the effect of confinement on the transient dynamics of liquid drops suspended in another immiscible liquid medium under the influence of an externally applied uniform dc electric field for our analysis we adhere to an analytical framework conforming to a newtonianleakydielectric liquid model in the stokes flow regime under the small deformation approximation we characterize the transient relaxation of the drop shape towards its asymptotic configuration attributed by the combined confluence of the chargerelaxation time scale and the intrinsic shaperelaxation time scale while the former appears due to the charge accumulation process on the drop surface over a finite interval of time the genesis of the latter is found to be intrinsic to the hydrodynamic situation under consideration in an unbounded condition the intrinsic shaperelaxation time scale is strongly governed by the viscosity ratio defined as the ratio of dynamic viscosities of the droplet and the background liquid however when the wall effects are brought into consideration the combined influence of the relative extent of the confinement and the intrinsic viscosity effects acting in tandem alter this time scale in a rather complicated and nontrivial manner we reveal that the presence of confinement may dramatically increase the effective viscosity ratio that could have otherwise been required in an unconfined domain to realize identical timerelaxation characteristics we also bring out the alterations in the streamline patterns because of the combinations of transient and confinement effects thus our results reveal that the extent of fluidic confinement may provide an elegant alternative towards manipulating the transient dynamics of liquid drops in the presence of an externally applied electric field bearing farranging consequences towards the design and functionalities of several modernday microfluidic applications © 2014 american physical society

© 2014 elsevier ltd double emulsion drop formation in flowfocusing microfluidic device is investigated numerically by computational fluid dynamics simulation using vof method the simulation produces two typical drop formation modes including dripping and jetting and provides the detailed hydrodynamic information underlying these two modes in addition the effects of viscosity ratio flow rate ratio and interfacial tension ratio on the double emulsion formation by the flowfocusing system are clarified quantitatively it is indicated that the cooperation of the interfacial tension and viscous drag of the outer fluid induce the detaching of the double emulsion droplet under both dripping and jetting modes while the large viscous drag from the outer fluid under jetting mode generates a long stretched neck which leads to the different formation behaviors the drop formation mode transits from dripping to jetting abruptly when the middle fluid is more viscous than other fluids and the size of the generated drops increases with the rise in viscosity ratio of the middle fluid to the inner one the flow rate of the outer fluid determines the drop formation mode as well as the generated drop size while the flow rate of the middle fluid contributes only to the drop size but have no obvious effect on drop formation regime in a wide range of flow rate ratio in addition the interfacial tension ratio shows little influence on drop sizes but large effect on the interface shapes

© 2016 authorsdroplet migration in a heleshaw cell is a fundamental multiphase flow problem which is crucial for many microfluidics applications we focus on the regime at low capillary number and threedimensional direct numerical simulations are performed to investigate the problem in order to reduce the computational cost an adaptive mesh is employed and high mesh resolution is only used near the interface parametric studies are performed on the droplet horizontal radius and the capillary number for droplets with an horizontal radius larger than half the channel height the droplet overfills the channel and exhibits a pancake shape a lubrication film is formed between the droplet and the wall and particular attention is paid to the effect of the lubrication film on the droplet velocity the computed velocity of the pancake droplet is shown to be lower than the average inflow velocity which is in agreement with experimental measurements the numerical results show that both the strong shear induced by the lubrication film and the threedimensional flow structure contribute to the low mobility of the droplet in this lowmigrationvelocity scenario the interfacial flow in the droplet reference frame moves toward the rear on the top and reverses direction moving to the front from the two side edges the velocity of the pancake droplet and the thickness of the lubrication film are observed to decrease with capillary number the droplet velocity and its dependence on capillary number can not be captured by the classic heleshaw equations since the depthaveraged approximation neglects the effect of the lubrication film

microscopic flows are almost universally linear laminar and stationary because the reynolds number re is usually very small that impedes mixing in microfluidic devices which sometimes limits their performance here we show that truly chaotic flow can be generated in a smooth microchannel of a uniform width at arbitrarily low re if a small amount of flexible polymers is added to the working liquid the chaotic flow regime is characterized by randomly fluctuating threedimensional velocity field and significant growth of the flow resistance although the size of the polymer molecules extended in the flow may become comparable to the microchannel width the flow behavior is fully compatible with that in a macroscopic channel in the regime of elastic turbulence the chaotic flow leads to quite efficient mixing which is almost diffusion independent for macromolecules mixing time in this microscopic flow can be three to four orders of magnitude shorter than due to molecular diffusion © 2004 the american physical society

© 2016 iop publishing ltdthere is an increasing demand for builtin flow sensors in order to effectively control microfluidic processes due to the high number of available microfluidic applications the possible solutions should be inexpensive and easy to connect to both the microscale features and the macro setup in this paper we present a novel approach to integrate a printed thermal flow sensor with polymeric microfluidic channels this approach is focused on merging two high throughput production processes namely inkjet printing and fast prototyping technologies in order to produce trustworthy and low cost devices these two technologies are brought together to obtain a sensor located outside the microfluidic device this avoids the critical contact between the sensor material and the fluids through the microchannels that can seriously damage the conducting paths under continuous working regimes in this way we ensure reliable and stable operation modes for this application a silver nanoparticle based ink and cyclic olefin polymer were used this flow sensor operates linearly in the range of 010 μl min1 for water and 020 μl min1 for ethanol in calorimetric mode switching to anemometric mode the range can be expanded up to 40 μl min1
we investigate the failure of bacterial floc mediated streamers in a microfluidic device in a creeping flow regime using both experimental observations and analytical modeling the quantification of streamer deformation and failure behavior is possible due to the use of 200 nm fluorescent polystyrene beads which firmly embed in the extracellular polymeric substance eps and act as tracers the streamers which form soon after the commencement of flow begin to deviate from an apparently quiescent fully formed state in spite of steady background flow and limited mass accretion indicating significant mechanical nonlinearity this nonlinear behavior shows distinct phases of deformation with mutually different characteristic times and comes to an end with a distinct localized failure of the streamer far from the walls we investigate this deformation and failure behavior for two separate bacterial strains and develop a simplified but nonlinear analytical model describing the experimentally observed instability phenomena assuming a necking route to instability our model leads to a power law relation between the critical strain at failure and the fluid velocity scale exhibiting excellent qualitative and quantitative agreeing with the experimental rupture behavior

© 2016 iop publishing ltd understanding the particlescale transition from elastic deformation to plastic flow is central to making predictions about the bulk material properties and response of disordered materials to address this issue we perform experiments on flowstabilized solids composed of micronscale spheres within a microfluidic channel in a regime where particle inertia is negligible each solid heap exists within a stress field imposed by the flow and we track the positions of particles in response to single impulses of fluiddriven compression or decompression we find that the resulting deformation field is welldecomposed into an affibne field with a constant strain profile throughout the solid and a nonaffibne field the magnitude of this nonaffibne response decays with the distance from the free surface in the longtime limit suggesting that the distance from jamming plays a significant role in controlling the length scale of plastic flow finally we observe that compressive pulses create more rearrangements than decompressive pulses an effect that we quantify using the dmin 2 statistic for nonaffibne motion unexpectedly the time scale for the compression response is shorter than for decompression at the same strain but unequal pressure providing insight into the coupling between deformation and cagebreaking

© 2016 asme miniaturized laboratoryonachip systems have been extensively developed over the past decade as promising tools for a wide range of applications specifically in chemical synthesis and biomedical diagnostics dropletbased microfluidic systems have become ubiquitous in such applications by providing essential tools to perform rapid as well as high throughput measurements on small volumes of fluids thus far the majority of the research endeavors have been focused on liquidliquid systems for generating microscale drops typically water in oil droplets generated in liquidliquid microfluidic systems tend to be very uniform in size and due to high surface area to volume ratio of microdroplets heat and mass transfer occurs at higher rates as compared to continuousflow microfluidics generation of droplets in a gaseous medium on the other hand have been widely used in applications that involve open environment liquid spraying such as inkjet printers however usually in such applications there is no control over either the size or frequency of the generated droplets and as a result droplets formed in these systems are widely distributed in size here we demonstrate an alternative scheme for controlled generation of liquid droplets in a microfluidic chip using a high speed gas stream we have incorporated the inertial effect of a highspeed gaseous medium with the flowfocusing geometry fabricated in a pdms chip in order to generate droplets with controlled size flow regimes involved in this scheme may be divided in three main regions ie coflow jetting and dripping among which only dripping regime is capable of producing distinct aqueous droplets in the channel it should be noted that poor surface conditions and high gas flow rates may result in generation of satellite droplets together with the main droplet in the dripping region which substantially affects the monodispersity of the droplets the generated drops were collected thereafter and it is shown that monodisperse droplets with known size ranging from 50 μm to 100 μm in diameter can be achieved within the dripping flow regime we believe this method offers beneficial opportunities for the next generation of labonachip devices in which the introduction of a gaseous medium is required namely oxidation detection of airborne particles and formation of microparticles and microgels furthermore the high speed droplets generated in this method represent the basis for a new approach based on droplet pair collisions for fast efficient micromixing which provides a significant development in modern loc and mtas devices
© 2016 asmeenhancing advection is of uttermost importance in many laminar microfluidic devices in order to thin boundary layers which limit both mass and heat transfer we address this challenge by integrating herringboneinspired flow promoters in channels for microfluidics due to the small dimensions of microchannels microfluidic devices typically experience a purely laminar flow regime and are thus limited by diffusion by augmenting diffusion limited transport to the wall of species and heat with advective transport mechanisms the performance per unit area of microfluidic devices can be significantly improved in the present contribution we demonstrate that herringbone microstructures are a very promising class of flow promoters to passively increase both mass transfer in chemical reactions as well as heat transfer within the same device this combined use of the same passive flow promoter microstructure is for example attractive for onchip microfluidic redox flow cells for microprocessor power delivery with integrated cooling by using the same electrolyte as an energy carrier and as a coolant
in this paper we present a novel method for vortex generation and control in a resonatorshaped microfluidic chamber with actuations by varying the actuation conditions including the working transducers frequency and voltage two regimes of vortices clockwise vortex cw vortex and counterclockwise vortex ccw vortex are generated in the chamber we show that the direction of the vortex can be conveniently shifted from clockwise to counterclockwise by switching the working transducers without interrupting the flow and the intensity of the vortex can be regulated by the actuation frequency and voltage it is proposed that the vortex generation in the present case is due to the instability of the actuationinduced pulsatile flow through the sudden expansion part at the outlet of the chamber while the vortex control is realized through the asymmetric flows in the chamber induced by the upper or lower transducers the reported method of vortex generation and control can be applied in microfluidic operations for mixing enhancement of multiple reagents and distribution of microparticles and nanoparticles

mixing fluid samples or reactants is a paramount function in the fields of micro total analysis system μtas and microchemical processing however rapid and efficient fluid mixing is difficult to achieve inside microchannels because of the difficulty of diffusive mass transfer in the laminar regime of the typical microfluidic flows it has been well recorded that the mixing efficiency can be boosted by migrating from twodimensional 2d to threedimensional 3d geometries although several 3d chaotic mixers have been designed most of them offer a high mixing efficiency only in a very limited range of reynolds numbers re in this work we developed a 3d finethreaded lemniscateshaped micromixer whose maximum numerical and empirical efficiency is around 97 and 93 respectively and maintains its high performance ie 90 over a wide range of 1re1000 which meets the requirements of both the μtas and microchemical process applications the 3d micromixer was designed based on two distinct mixing strategies namely the inducing of chaotic advection by the presence of dean flow and diffusive mixing through threadlike grooves around the curved body of the mixers first a set of numerical simulations was performed to study the physics of the flow and to determine the essential geometrical parameters of the mixers second a simple and costeffective method was exploited to fabricate the convoluted structure of the micromixers through the removal of a 3dprinted wax structure from a block of cured polydimethylsiloxane finally the fabricated mixers with different threads were tested using a fluorescent microscope demonstrating a good agreement with the results of the numerical simulation we envisage that the strategy used in this work would expand the scope of the micromixer technology by broadening the range of efficient working flow rate and providing an easy way to the fabrication of 3d convoluted microstructures

© 2017 cambridge university press when an acoustic wave travels in a lossy medium such as a liquid it progressively transfers its pseudomomentum to the fluid which results in a steady flow called acoustic streaming this phenomenon involves a balance between sound attenuation and shear such that the streaming flow does not vanish in the limit of vanishing viscosity hence the effect of viscosity has long been ignored in acoustic streaming experiments here we investigate the acoustic streaming in sessile droplets exposed to surface acoustic waves according to experimental data the flow structure and velocity magnitude are both strongly influenced by the fluid viscosity we compute the sound wave propagation and hydrodynamic flow motion using a numerical method that reduces memory requirements via a spatial filtering of the acoustic streaming momentum source terms these calculations agree qualitatively well with experiments and reveal how the acoustic field in the droplet which is dominated by a few caustics controls the flow pattern we evidence that chaotic acoustic fields in droplets are dominated by a few caustics it appears that the caustics drive the flow which allows for qualitative prediction of the flow structure finally we apply our numerical method to a broader span of fluids and frequencies we show that the canonical case of the acoustic streaming in a hemispherical sessile droplet resting on a lithium niobate substrate only depends on two dimensionless numbers related to the surface and bulk wave attenuation even in such a baseline configuration we observe and characterize four distinct flow regimes

© 2017 american chemical society surface wettability is typically characterized by measuring the static contact angle of a sessile droplet placed on the surface for extremely wetting surfaces on which liquid spontaneously spreads into a thin liquid film the nearzero static contact angle is not amenable to measurement and does not fully describe the wetting behavior there are unmet needs in microfluidics boiling heat transfer enhancement and antifogging applications for a metric to characterize highly wetting ie superhydrophilic textured surfaces based on their capillarydriven liquid pumping performance as a supplement to the contact angle for this highly wetting regime to describe the wetting behavior the textured surface can be approximated as a thin porous layer through which the liquid spreads an analytical model is developed for the volumetric flow in this layer which reveals a single superhydrophilicity metric that captures the wetting behavior for a given liquid a simple experimental approach is proposed to characterize this metric by measuring the volumetric liquid intake into the surface from a filled capillary tube this approach is validated by characterizing micropillared superhydrophilic surfaces of known geometry the predicted and measured wetting behaviors show good agreement the metric proposed in this study offers a simple approach for accurately characterizing and differentiating highly wetting surfaces based on their liquid pumping ability

© 2017 american physical society we consider pressuredriven flows in wide microchannels and discuss how a transverse shear generated by misaligned superhydrophobic walls impacts crosssectional spreading of brownian particles we show that such a transverse shear can induce an advective superdiffusion which strongly enhances dispersion of particles compared to a normal diffusion and that maximal crosssectional spreading corresponds to a crossover between its subballistic and superballistic regimes this allows us to argue that an advective superdiffusion can be used for boosting dispersion of particles at smaller péclet numbers compared to known concepts of passive microfluidic mixing this implies that our superdiffusion scenario allows one efficient mixing of much smaller particles or using much thinner microchannels than methods which are currently being exploited

© 2017 elsevier bvthe combination of microfluidics with magnetism has led to the emergence of a new scientific domain known as micromagnetofluidics the present study aims to investigate the interfacial dynamics of ferrofluid droplet formation under magnetic field in a microfluidic tjunction a nonuniform magnetic field was constructed by placing a permanent magnet at one side of the tjunction three typical flow regimes including the slug slugdripping transition and dripping flow were observed the external magnetic field promotes the transition from the slugdripping transition flow to the slug flow prolongs the generation cycle of ferrofluid droplets and hinders the ferrofluid droplet formation as the magnetic flux density increases both the increasing rate of the length for the thread tip and the expanding rate of the dispersed neck decrease and the peak value of the minimum width of the dispersed neck increases the ferrofluid droplet size increases with increasing the magnetic flux density while decreases with increasing the twophase flow rate ratio and the capillary number a scaling law is proposed to predict the size of ferrofluid droplets by taking the twophase flow rate ratio capillary number and magnetic bond number into account

© 2017 cambridge university press in this paper we analyse numerically the stability of the steady jetting regime of gaseous flow focusing the base flows are calculated by solving the full navierstokes equations and boundary conditions for a wide range of liquid viscosities and gas speeds the axisymmetric modes characterizing the asymptotic stability of those flows are obtained from the linearized navierstokes equations and boundary conditions we determine the flow rates leading to marginally stable states and compare them with the experimental values at the jettingtodripping transition the theoretical predictions satisfactorily agree with the experimental results for large gas speeds however they do not capture the trend of the jettingtodripping transition curve for small gas velocities and considerably underestimate the minimum flow rate in this case to explain this discrepancy the navierstokes equations are integrated over time after introducing a small perturbation in the tapering liquid meniscus there is a transient growth of the perturbation before the asymptotic exponential regime is reached which leads to dripping our work shows that flow focusing stability can be explained in terms of the combination of asymptotic global stability and the system shortterm response for large and small gas velocities respectively

© 2018 the royal society of chemistryfoams can be stabilized for long periods by the adsorption of solid particles on the liquidgas interfaces although such longterm observations are common mechanistic descriptions of the particle adsorption process are scarce especially in confined flows in part due to the difficulty of observing the particles in the complex gasliquid dispersion of a foam here we characterise the adsorption of micronscale particles onto the interface of a bubble flowing in a colloidal aqueous suspension within a microfluidic channel three parameters are systematically varied the particle size their concentration and the mean velocity of the colloidal suspension the bubble coverage is found to increase linearly with position in the channel for all conditions but with a slope that depends on all three parameters the optimal coverage is found for 1 μm particles at low flow rates and high concentrations in this regime the particles pass the bubbles through the gutters between the interface and the channel corners where the complex 3d flow leads them onto the interface the largest particles can not enter into the gutters and therefore provide very poor coverage in contrast particle aggregates can sediment onto the microchannel floor ahead of the bubble and get swept up by the advancing interface thus improving the coverage for both large and medium particle sizes these observations provide new insight on the influence of boundaries for particle adsorption at an airliquid interface

© 2018 american physical societyimmiscible fluidfluid displacement in partial wetting continues to challenge our microscopic and macroscopic descriptions here we study the displacement of a viscous fluid by a less viscous fluid in a circular capillary tube in the partial wetting regime in contrast with the classic results for complete wetting we show that the presence of a moving contact line induces a wetting transition at a critical capillary number that is contact angle dependent at small displacement rates the fluidfluid interface deforms slightly from its equilibrium state and moves downstream at a constant velocity without changing its shape as the displacement rate increases however a wetting transition occurs the interface becomes unstable and forms a finger that advances along the axis of the tube leaving the contact line behind separated from the meniscus by a macroscopic film of the viscous fluid on the tube wall we describe the dewetting of the entrained film and show that it universally leads to bubble pinchoff therefore demonstrating that the hydrodynamics of contact line motion generate bubbles in microfluidic devices even in the absence of geometric constraints

© 2018 the authors the operational lifetime of filtration membranes is reduced by the clogging of pores and subsequent buildup of a fouling or cake layer designing membrane operations in which clogging is delayed or even mitigated completely requires indepth insight into its origins due to the complexity of the clogging process simplified model membranes fabricated in microfluidic chips have emerged as a powerful tool to study how clogs emerge and deteriorate membrane efficiency however to date these have focussed solely on deadend filtration while crossflow filtration is of greater practical relevance at the industrial scale as such the microscopic mechanisms of clogging in crossflow geometries have remained relatively illexplored here we use a microfluidic filtration model to probe the kinetics and mechanisms of clogging in crossflow our study exposes two findings i the primary clogging rate of individual pores depends only on the transmembrane flux whose strong effects are explained quantitatively by extending existing models with a term for fluxcontrolled flowenhanced barrier crossing ii crossmembrane flow affects the porepore communication leading to a transition from correlated to uncorrelated clogging of the membrane which we explain qualitatively by deriving a dimensionless number which captures two essential regimes of clogging at the microscale
© 2018osteoblast migration is a crucial process in bone regeneration which is strongly regulated by interstitial fluid flow however the exact role that such flow exerts on osteoblast migration is still unclear to deepen the understanding of this phenomenon we cultured human osteoblasts on 3d microfluidic devices under different fluid flow regimes our results show that a slow fluid flow rate by itself is not able to alter the 3d migratory patterns of osteoblasts in collagenbased gels but that at higher fluid flow rates increased flow velocity may indirectly influence cell movement by altering the collagen microstructure in fact we observed that high fluid flow rates 1 µlmin are able to alter the collagen matrix architecture and to indirectly modulate the migration pattern however when these collagen scaffolds were crosslinked with a chemical crosslinker specifically transglutaminase ii we did not find significant alterations in the scaffold architecture or in osteoblast movement therefore our data suggest that high interstitial fluid flow rates can regulate osteoblast migration by means of modifying the orientation of collagen fibers together these results highlight the crucial role of the matrix architecture in 3d osteoblast migration in addition we show that interstitial fluid flow in conjunction with the matrix architecture regulates the osteoblast morphology in 3d

© 2017 cambridge university press previous work on solute transport with sorption in poiseuille flow has reached contradictory conclusions some have concluded that sorption increases mean solute transport velocity and decreases dispersion relative to a tracer while others have concluded the opposite here we resolve this contradiction by deriving a series solution for the transient evolution that recovers previous results in the appropriate limits this solution shows a transition in solute transport behaviour from early to late time that is captured by the first and zerothorder terms mean solute transport velocity is increased at early times and reduced at late times while solute dispersion is initially reduced but shows a complex dependence on the partition coefficient k at late times in the equilibrium sorption model the time scale of the early regime and the duration of the transition to the late regime both increase with ln k for large k the early regime is pronounced in strongly sorbing systems k 1 the kinetic sorption model shows a similar transition from the early to the late transport regime and recovers the equilibrium results when adsorption and desorption rates are large as the reaction rates slow down the duration of the early regime increases but the changes in transport velocity and dispersion relative to a tracer diminish in general if the partition coefficient k is large the early regime is well developed and the behaviour is well characterized by the analysis of the limiting case without desorption

© 2016 avestia publishing when a solid surface in contact with a rarefied gas possesses a tangential temperature gradient a thin knudsen layer of the fluid adjacent to the surface will flow along with the gradient this phenomenon is well known as thermal creep which provides a mechanism for the thermophoresis of an aerosol particle in the slipflow regime thermophoresis refers to the particle motion in response to a temperature gradient in the bulk gas against its direction being a mechanism for the capture of aerosol particles on cool surfaces thermophoresis plays an important role in many practical applications such as aerosol sampling air cleaning microelectronic manufacturing scale formation on heat exchanger surfaces removal of soot particles for combustion exhaust gas systems modified chemical vapour deposition and nuclear reactor safety 1 2 in most real applications of thermophoresis in microfluidic devices the dimensions of the aerosol particles and confining microchannels are comparable and it is needed to ascertain if the proximity of the channel wall significantly influences the particle velocity the thermophoretic motions of a spherical particle parallel and perpendicular to a single plane wall or a pair of plane walls were examined by using the methods of boundary collocation and successive reflections 3 4 beyond that the thermophoresis of a spherical particle in a spherical cavity was also analytically investigated 5 in this paper a theoretical study is presented for the axially symmetric thermophoresis of a spherical particle in a microtube filled with a gaseous medium the uniformly applied temperature gradient is tangential to the tube wall which is either prescribed with the linear temperature distribution or well insulated the knudsen number is small and the fluid motion is characterized by a continuum flow with temperature jump thermal creep and frictional slip at the solid surfaces the general solution to the thermal and aerodynamic governing equations is presented in both spherical and cylindrical coordinates and the boundary conditions at the particle surface are enforced by a collocation technique the collocation solutions for the particles thermophoretic velocity which are in good agreement with the asymptotic formula resulting from the method of reflections are obtained for different particle tube wall and fluid characteristics a tube wall prescribed with the farfield temperature distribution and an insulated tube wall influence the thermophoresis of the particle differently the mobility of a particle confined by a tube wall without thermal creep is a decreasing function of the particletotube radius ratio when the thermal creep coefficients of the particle and of the tube wall are comparable the thermoosmotic fluid flow caused by the wall strongly dominates the particle movement and can simply reverse its direction in general the influence of the confining tube on thermophoresis is significant the thermophoretic velocity of an aerosol sphere parallel to two plane walls was determined previously for different values of the relevant parameters 3 for the cases of the insulated walls at small particle conductivity and of the walls with the prescribed temperature distribution at large particle conductivity the velocity of the particle first decreases but then increases with an increase in the particletotube radius ratio as the particlewall separation distance turns small the particle mobility can even be greater than that in an unbounded fluid by as much as 22 for a typical case this distinction in boundary effects on thermophoresis between tube and slit channels is pronounced indicating that the effects of hydrodynamic retardation in comparison with that of thermal interactions are much stronger in a tube than in a slit the overall boundary effects on thermophoresis are generally more substantial in a tube than in a slit
© 2018 national academy of sciences all rights reservedthe morphological dynamics instabilities and transitions of elastic filaments in viscous flows underlie a wealth of biophysical processes from flagellar propulsion to intracellular streaming and are also key to deciphering the rheological behavior of many complex fluids and soft materials here we combine experiments and computational modeling to elucidate the dynamical regimes and morphological transitions of elastic brownian filaments in a simple shear flow actin filaments are used as an experimental model system and their conformations are investigated through fluorescence microscopy in microfluidic channels simulations matching the experimental conditions are also performed using inextensible euler–bernoulli beam theory and nonlocal slenderbody hydrodynamics in the presence of thermal fluctuations and agree quantitatively with observations we demonstrate that filament dynamics in this system are primarily governed by a dimensionless elastoviscous number comparing viscous drag forces to elastic bending forces with thermal fluctuations playing only a secondary role while short and rigid filaments perform quasiperiodic tumbling motions a buckling instability arises above a critical flow strength a second transition to strongly deformed shapes occurs at a yet larger value of the elastoviscous number and is characterized by the appearance of localized highcurvature bends that propagate along the filaments in apparent “ snaking ” motions a theoretical model for the as yet unexplored onset of snaking accurately predicts the transition and explains the observed dynamics we present a complete characterization of filament morphologies and transitions as a function of elastoviscous number and scaled persistence length and demonstrate excellent agreement between theory experiments and simulations
© 2018 national academy of sciences all rights reservedthe formation of droplets is ubiquitous in many natural and industrial processes and has reached an unprecedented level of control with the emergence of milli and microfluidics although important insight into the mechanisms of droplet formation has been gained over the past decades a sound understanding of the physics underlying this phenomenon and the effect of the fluid ’ s flow and wetting properties on the droplet size and production rate is still missing especially for the widely applied method of step emulsification in this work we elucidate the physical controls of microdroplet formation in step emulsification by using the wetting of fluidic channels as a tunable parameter to explore a broad set of emulsification conditions with the help of highspeed measurements we unequivocally show that the final droplet pinchoff is triggered by a rayleigh–plateautype instability the droplet size however is not determined by the rayleigh–plateau breakup but by the initial wetting regime where the fluid ’ s contact angle plays a crucial role we develop a physical theory for the wetting process which closely describes our experimental measurements without invoking any free fit parameter our theory predicts the initiation of the rayleigh–plateau breakup and the transition from dripping to jetting as a function of the fluid ’ s contact angle additionally the theory solves the conundrum why there is a minimal contact angle of α 2π3 120° for which droplets can form
© 2018 elsevier ltdsurfactant flooding is one of the most widely adopted enhanced oil recovery strategies whereby microemulsion is formed in situ during immiscible displacement it is expected that local equilibrium is achieved during surfactant flooding and that resulting microemulsion phase properties directly influence the flow physics and thus oil recovery we consider phase behaviour of a surfactant–oil–water system that can form either winsor type ii− iii or ii microemulsion water polymer and winsor type surfactant solutions are injected into oil saturated polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic chips and imaged under continuous flow at various capillary numbers and viscosity ratios images are analysed for displacement patterns and oil recovery flow regimes are explained by considering the equilibrium interfacial tension ift and viscosity of the formed microemulsion phase displacement of oil by injected fluids was dominated by capillary fingering at low flow rates at higher flow rates type iii microemulsion develops viscous fingering while type ii− develops stable displacement due to the microemulsion phases being of high and low viscosity respectively this report highlights that the difference between stableunstable displacement during surfactant flooding is influenced by surfactant–oil–water phase behaviour

© 2018 authorscavitation and the energy associated with the collapse of resulting cavitation bubbles constitute an important research subject the collapse of the hydrodynamic cavitation bubbles at the outlet of the flow elements leads to a high energy release and generates localized shock waves and a large temperature rise on exposed surfaces the concept of hydrodynamic cavitation on chip is an emerging topic which emphasizes phase change phenomena in microscale and their utilizations in energy and biomedical applications this study is aimed to investigate the potential of polyvinyl alcohol pva microbubbles mbs to generate cavitation bubbles and to evaluate their effects on flow regimes and energy dissipation for this three different microchannel configurations with different roughness elements were considered the structural side wall and surface roughened channels were fabricated along with the smooth channel according to the techniques adopted from semiconductor based microfabrication the upstream pressure varied from 1 to 7 mpa and the flow patterns were recorded and analyzed using a highspeed camera the pressure was locally measured at three locations along the microfluidic devices to determine the conditions for fully developed cavitating flows the results were compared to the pure water case and different trends for the cavitating flow pattern transitions were obtained for the waterpva mb solution case accordingly the twin cavity clouds extended to the end of the side wall roughened channel at a lower upstream pressure for the case of pva mbs while the smooth and surface roughened channels do not demonstrate this flow pattern in addition the cavitation number has the lowest values under the same working conditions for the case of pva mbs moreover the impact pressure generated by the bubble collapse inside the side wall roughened channel for the case of pva mbs was notably higher than that for pure water

© 2018 elsevier bvthis work details a simple and original approach for the generation of linear gradients inside straight cylindrical microchannels such as a capillary column the concept takes advantage of an oftoverlooked regime of dispersion of flowing liquids inside narrow channels the ballistic regime the ballistic regime is a pure convective regime and is produced by imposing a high velocity flow in a prefilled capillary thus limited diffusion takes place this is obtained by forcing the injection of a plug of solution on a short time scale t much shorter than tformula presented×dr2 d is the diffusion coefficient and r the capillary radius the result is a stretched solution of a given length or depth of penetration inside the capillary column this leads to a linear mean concentration field through the mixing zone forming a linear gradient in miniaturized systems this transient regime is followed by mainly radial diffusion of the solution inside the capillary due to the short characteristic diffusion time of narrow channels a convectiondiffusion simulation was used to model the gradient formed under this ballistic regime a specific experimental prototype setup was designed to investigate this ballistic regime and the formation of a linear gradient of titrant naoh solution inside a capillary tubing of 500 µm inner diameter and 35cm total length prefilled with nitric acid solution with this prototype the linear gradient was then pushed in a nonballistic regime over a confocal fluorescence point detection system in order to measure the fluorescence emission of a fluorescent dye added to the solutions considering strong acidbase reaction fluorescein was used due to its strong fluorescence dependency with ph near its pka ie 64 a first set of experiments was realized to demonstrate the validity of such an approach and to determine the optimal condition for the formation of a linear gradient over 300 mm of the 350mm capillary length an injection pressure of 1000mbars over 075 s was chosen the first result was the stability of the system in its ability to produce reproducible linear gradients as further proofs of feasibility samples of different nitric acid concentrations were titrated with a 025 m naoh solution the result was rapid and reproducible titration curves obtained with a fully automated system that consumes less than approximately 70 µl of sample solution

© 2018 ieeeactive transport such as fluid flow is sought in molecular communication to extend coverage improve reliability and mitigate interference flow models are often oversimplified assuming onedimensional diffusion with constant drift however diffusion and flow are usually encountered in threedimensional bounded environments where the flow is highly nonuniform such as in blood vessels or microfluidic channels for a qualitative understanding of the relevant physical effects inherent to these channels based on the péclet number and the transmitterreceiver distance we study when simplified models of uniform flow and advectiononly transport are applicable for these two regimes analytical expressions for the channel impulse response are derived and validated by particlebased simulation furthermore as advectiononly transport is typically overlooked and hence not analyzed in the molecular communication literature we evaluate the symbol error rate for exemplary onoff keying as performance metric

© 2019 elsevier ltd the formation process of alternating droplets at the tjunction with a crosssectional area of 400 μm × 400 μm was investigated using a highspeed camera the alternating droplets were consisted of glycerol aqueous solution and ferrofluid droplets two formation types of alternating droplets were observed normal formation and the upstream droplet squeezing formation the existence of the magnetic field delayed the transition from the normal farmation to the upstream droplet squeezing formation the effects of twophase flow rate and magnetic flux density on the dynamics of the tip and the neck of the ferrofluid and the formation period were studied the results show that the neck evolution of ferrofluid could be divided into the expansion stage and pinchoff stage the expansion stage was dominated by the flow of ferrofluid and the pinchoff stage was insensitive to fluid flow and was a selfsimilar process the length of the tip of ferrofluid increases almost linearly with time during the pinchoff stage and the increasing rate rose with the flow rates the formation period of the droplets reduces as the fluid flow rate increases when the formation type is normal formation the existence of the magnetic field shortens the formation period when the formation type is the upstream droplet squeezing regime the existence of the magnetic field prolongs the formation period this paper provides a new method for the generation of alternating droplets

© 2019 elsevier ltdmicro and nanoscale surface roughness within subsurface rocks is ubiquitous due to weathering and diagenesis to assess the impacts of surface roughness on nonwetting gas flooding operations we conducted immiscible drainage experiments in glass micromodels representing singlescale rock matrices with identical pore topology but varying degrees of surface roughness the experiments were performed in capillarydominated regimes where air was the nonwetting phase and crude oil was the wetting phase emulating an enhanced oil recovery or nonaqueous phase liquid phase remediation process we find that for approximately constant porespace topology surface roughness quantified with the average hillock height to pore depth ratio ω has minor impact on sweep efficiency when ω 55 however once a critical threshold value of ω 125 is reached recovery becomes consistently 10 higher and gas breakthrough occurs at later times in addition the roughest micromodel displays the highest repeatability of dendrite pathways validating diagenetic controls on gas flood sweep efficiency we also find that surface roughness does not considerably affect the morphology of nonwetting phase dendrites and phase topology versus air saturation curves subpore scale visualizations in the micromodels indicate that contactline pinning the phenomenon responsible for higher sweep and greater dendrite tortuosity only occurs in the roughest micromodel with ω 125 whereas pendular rings and grainlining thin films occur in all of the micromodels nonlocal snapoff occurs in micromodels regardless of roughness the effects of isolated fracture surface roughness on capillary trapping saturations is found to be negligible for both drainage and imbibition saturation cycles however the presence of an isolated fracture diverts gas dendrites from sweeping the matrix and therefore increases oil trapping by approximately 10–30 compared to the micromodels without fractures the workflow and experimental results in this paper provide benchmarking opportunities for direct numerical simulation algorithms for porous geomaterials in addition the paper aims to highlight the nontrivial implications of surface roughness for reservoir quality assessment and various subsurface operations
© 2019 elsevier ltdthe vertical integration of microelectronics is an appealing approach that offers significant performance advantages over conventional planar devices however one of the main challenges for implementing such technology is the limited volume for heat dissipation microfluidic interlayer cooling is a feasible solution for the thermal management of such devices but several challenges remain to achieve a comprehensive solution that is compatible with electrical and structural parameters in the present study a thermal demonstration vehicle tdv is numerically and experimentally investigated in an effort to provide a practical cooling solution for vertically integrated devices with heterogeneous heating the flow boiling of the dielectric refrigerant hfe7200 is investigated to provide insights regarding the twophase flow regimes heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics in this type of microgaps the physics of the flow boiling mechanisms are also explored through a mechanistic phase change model which can be used with commercial computational fluid dynamics and heat transfer cfdht codes the numerical modeling approach is validated with experimental results in representative layouts with variable density of pin fins and nonuniform power inputs making this technique an attractive alternative for the design of practical twophase microcooling layers operating in realistic conditions with hotspots
© 2019 cambridge university pressthis work focuses on the mass transfer around unconfined bubbles in cylindrical microchannels when they are arranged in a train we characterise how the mass transfer quantified by the sherwood number is affected by the channel and bubble sizes distance between bubbles diffusivity mean flow velocity deformation of the bubble the presence of surfactants in the limit of rigid interface and offcentred positions of the bubbles we analyse the influence of the dimensionless numbers and especially the distance between bubbles and the péclet number which we vary over eight decades identifying five different mass transfer regimes we show different concentration patterns and the dependence of the sherwood numbers these regimes can be classified by either the importance of the diffusion along the streamlines or the interaction between bubbles for small the diffusion along the streamlines is not negligible as compared to convection whereas for large convection dominates in the streamlines direction and thus crosswind diffusion becomes crucial in governing the mass transfer through boundary layers or the remaining wake behind the bubbles interaction of bubbles occurs for very small where the mass transfer is purely diffusive or for very large where long wakes eventually reach the following bubble we also observe that the bubble deformability mainly affects the in the regime for very large in which bubbles interaction matters and also that the rigid interface affects the boundary layer and the remaining wake the effect of offcentred position of the bubble determined by the transverse force balance is also limited to large the boundary layers on rigid bubble surfaces are thicker than those on stressfree bubble surfaces and thus the mass transfer is weaker for centred bubbles the influence of inertia on the mass transfer is negligible finally we discuss the implication of our results on the dissolution of bubbles

© 2019 elsevier bvwe demonstrate for the first time the application of ftir spectroscopic imaging approach in situ to monitor the precipitation process of oil asphaltenes induced by nheptane under flow using microfluidic devices the aggregation of asphaltenes induced by nheptane flow with subsequent precipitation and formation of the deposits was studied for solution containing 5 wt of asphaltenes in benzene the ftir spectroscopic approach with an array detector allowed us to assess the spatial distribution of the chemical components and their amounts in the system and display the process of aggregates formation with a spatial resolution of few micrometres this chemical imaging technique shows that the flow of heptane results in nonequilibrium condition when the local content of the flocculants reaches the threshold amount needed for the asphaltenes aggregation the relatively slow process of heptane diffusion into the benzene induces the asphaltenes aggregation followed by their precipitation and compaction fast asphaltene aggregation process under heptane flow leads to the formation of the deposit firmly fixed to the surface while the precipitates formed during the diffusion process of heptane into the benzene can be easily taken from the channel the ftir spectroscopic imaging of the deposits formed revealed the spatial inhomogeneity of the precipitated asphaltenes in the direction of the heptane flow in microfluidic channel which is reflected in their different chemical composition and the presence of different functional groups ch2–ch3 cdbndo sdbndo in particular it was found that asphaltenes of different types and different ch2ch3 ratios gradually start to precipitate in the direction of nheptane flow the data obtained demonstrate the importance of local concentration of flocculants as well as local characteristics of the system for asphaltenes aggregation and overall precipitation process in flow regime

we present an experimental study of the aggregation of paramagnetic particles in the presence of controlled laminar shear flow conducted in microchannels subjected to an external magnetic field the microfluidic channels are made of either glasssilicon or polydimethylsiloxane in ranges of time up to hundreds of seconds the growth mechanism of the linear chain consists of the accumulation of isolated particles or small clusters onto existing chains which are all moving at different speeds in this time regime the chain length increases linearly and has a growth rate that increases as a power law with the shear at longer times the chain lengths saturate the smoluchovski model which assumes single particlechain interactions only closely reproduces the observations both qualitatively and quantitatively in particular the evolution of the growth rate of the mean chain length with respect to the shear rate s predicted as s14 is found to be consistent with the experiments © 2004 elsevier inc all rights reserved
