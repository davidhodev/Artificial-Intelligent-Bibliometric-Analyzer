the concept of molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) tailoring using metallocene catalyst is visualized a follows : catalyst which individually produce polymer of narrow MWD but of different average molecular weight can be selectively combined in varying amount in order to achieve a high degree of control over the final polymer MWD . although widely lauded , this concept is seldom put to the test in the open literature . we have observed that soluble metallocene / methylalumoxane catalyst individually produce polymer of a very consistent and reproducible MWD , although the rate at which they produce polymer is subject to high variability . In semi-batch polymerization , this cause difficulty in controlling both the reaction rate and the MWD of the final product . In this study we present the result of several polymerization experiment combining rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride with both biscyclopentadienylzirconium dichloride and bisdicyclopentadienyltitanium dichloride . we also present a model in an attempt to predict the final MWD of a polymerization combining two catalyst . by considering the variance of catalyst activity , it is possible to generate a confidence interval around the prediction for a future polymerization . these prediction are compared with the result of actual experiment . it is observed that precise control is hindered by an inability to predict the activity of the catalyst combined in a polymerization . some mean of improving the prediction of MWD are given . the electron ionization mass spectrometric behaviour of a new series of hafnocene and zirconocene dialcoholates is discussed . deprotonized norborneol and 3-methyl-2-norbornanemethanol were used a lateral ligand . these data are also compared to those of mass - analysed ion kinetic energy spectrometry . fragmentation pattern of the complex in question give relevant information on their gas - phase behaviour and on an influence of the ligand 's structure on decomposition pathway a well . the electron ionization mass spectrometric behaviour of a new series of hafnocene and zirconocene dialcoholates is discussed . deprotonized moiety of menthol , verbenol and hydroxypinanone were used a s-ligands . these data are also compared to those of mass - analysed ion kinetic energy spectrometry . the fragmentation pattern of the complex in question give relevant information on their gas - phase behaviour and on the influence of the ligand 's structure on the decomposition pathway a well . the electron ionisation mass spectrometric behaviour of a new series of hafnocene and zirconocene dialcoholates is discussed . deprotonated moiety of borneol and fenchyl alcohol were used a s-ligands . these data are also compared to those of mass - analysed ion kinetic energy spectroscopy of the molecular ion . fragmentation pattern of the complex in question give relevant information on their gas - phase behaviour and also on the influence of the ligand structure on the decomposition pathway . the complex in question appear to be promising metal - organic chemical vapour decomposition precursor . ethylene polymerization by zirconocene-B(C6F5)3 catalyst with various aluminum compound ha been investigated . it is found that the catalytic activity depended on zirconocenes used , and especially on the type of aluminum compound . for Et(H4Ind)2ZrCl2 ( H4Ind : tetrahydroindenyl ) , the activity decrease in the following order : Me3Al > i-Bu3Al > Et3Al ≫ Et2AlCl . while for Cp2ZrCl2(Cp : cyclopentadienyl ) , it varies a follows : i-Bu3Al > Me3Al ≫ Et3Al . furthermore , the activity is significantly affected by the addition mode of the catalytic component , which may imply that the formation of active center is associated with an existing concentration of catalytic component . result of thermal behavior of polyethylene ( PE ) studied by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) show that crystallinity of the polymer prepared with Et3Al is higher than that with Me3Al or i-Bu3Al . it is also found that the number - average molecular weight ( m ) of the polymer prepared with Me3Al or i-Bu3Al is much higher than that with Et3Al . 1H - NMR study substantiate that i-Bu3Al is a more efficient alkylation agent of Cp2ZrCl2 in comparison with Me3Al . nonisothermal , uncontrolled polymerization , conducted in varying mixing regime , offered a facile methodology to evaluate the influence of several important process development factor such a mixing , reaction exotherm , and thermal perturbation on the catalytic activity and kinetic stability , polymerization performance , and property of the resulting polymer . ethylene wa homo- and copolymerixed with hexene-1 under varying impeller speed ( hence , thermal perturbation ) , using Ind2ZrCl2 and Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and the MAO cocatalyst . with respect to the effect of the above process development actor , the following wa observed : the reaction exotherm profile , tracing the polymerization history , qualitatively represented the kinetic profile and the catalytic stability . the unbridged Ind2ZrCl2 wa shown to be more stable than the bridged Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 . with change in the level of stirring from a diffusion - controlled regime to a noodiffusion - controlled , external gas - liquid mass - transfer resistance - free one , the reaction exotherm and the run time - average catalytic activity increased . so far a the influence of the chiral versus the achiral zironocene structure is concerned , the copolymer composition distribution and soluble fraction generated by chiral Et(Ind)2ZiCl2 were more sensitive to the mixing condition and thermal perturbation than were those produced by achiral Ind2ZrCl2 . Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 produced higher molecular weight backbone , incorporated more hexene-1 and chain branching , and introduced le crystallinity in the copolymer than did Ind2ZrCl2 . the influence of Ind2ZrCl2 on higher - weight homopolymer backbone wa opposite to that of Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 . incorporation of hexene-1 significantly decreased the average molecular weight and density and increased the run - time - dependent average catalyst activity . A positive comonomer effect took place . the bulk polymer property did not critically depend on the mixing state . thermal perturbation broadened the polydispersity index . copolymerizations of ethylene with endo-dicyclopentadiene ( DCP ) were performed by using Cp2ZrCl2 ( cp = cyclopentadienyl ) , Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( ind = indenyl ) , and Ph2C(Cp)(FIu)ZrCl2 ( flu = fluorenyl ) combined with MAO a cocatalyst . among these three metallocenes , Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 showed the highest catalyst performance for the copolymerization . from 1H - NMR analysis , it wa found that DCP wa copolymerized through enchainment of norbornene ring . the copolymer wa then epoxidated by reacting with m-chloroperbenzoic acid . 13C - NMR spectrum of the resulting copolymer indicated the quantitative conversion of olefinic to epoxy group . ethylene-propylene-diene monomer ( EPDM ) terpolymers were prepared using either vanadium ( Cl3OV / Al2Et3Cl3 ) or zirconocene ( Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO ) catalyst system . residual metal content in EPDM film were determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry . metallocene catalyst system exhibited a higher activity , producing EPDM with lower molecular weight and narrower molecular weight distribution . the highest activity guaranteed lower residual metal content ( Zr / C = 10-5 ) than in the case of EPDM produced by Cl3OV / Al2Et3Cl3 ( V / C = 10-4 ) . subsequent step of dissolution of the polymer and it reprecipitation were seen to reduce the metal content in both metal system . concerning the cocatalyst retention , despite initial use of a very high amount of methylaluminoxane / metallocene ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) in the reactor , only about <nUm> % of this initial concentration remained in the polymer . on the other hand , in the case of vanadium - based catalyst , almost all Al present in the initial condition ( [?]8.3 ) remained in the polymer . In both case , the residual Al / m ratio wa close to the value generally proposed for the generation / stabilization of the active specie . In the case of vanadium system , a test in the synthesis of ethylene propylene rubber indicated that the absence of diene in the polymer structure lead to a reduction in the residual vanadium content , indicating that the diene double bond might be responsible for partially vanadium coordination . the kinetics of propylene polymerization initiated by ansa - metallocene diamide compound rac - (EBI)Hf(NMe2)2 ( EBI = C2H4-(indenyl)2 , rac-1 ) were investigated . the rac-1 compound could be directly utilized for catalyst formation without converting to a dihalide or dialkyl complex in the presence or absence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the MAO - free system rac-1 / AlR3 / [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] ( 2 ) is much more effective than the rac - <nUm> / MAO catalyst . the activity of the rac - <nUm> / Al(iBu)3 / <nUm> system is much higher than that of the rac - (EBI)HfCl2 / MAO or rac - (EBI)ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst , and almost same a that of the rac - (EBI)Zr(NMe2)2 / Al(iBu)3 / <nUm> catalyst under similar condition . the alkylation of rac-1 to rac - (EBI)HfR2 by using AiR3 need more time than the corresponding zirconocene analogue . the activity increase by a factor of <nUm> by increasing the aging time from <nUm> min to more than <nUm> h . the activity of the rac - <nUm> / AlR3 / <nUm> catalyst is very sensitive to the type and concentration of AlR3 , and decrease in the order : Al(iBu)2H > Al(iBu)3 > AlEt3 > AlMe3 . the catalyst keep high activity in a narrow range of the [Al] / [Hf] ratio . In addition , the activity is influenced by the concentration of <nUm> , and a a result , the maximum activity is observed when <nUm> / rac-1 = <nUm> . the activity of the rac - <nUm> / AlR3 / <nUm> catalyst is also sensitive to the polymerization temperature . the activation energy for the initiation and overall reaction are calculated a <nUm> and <nUm> kcal / mol , respectively . the property of polymer such a isotacticity ( a [mmmm] ) , molecular weight ( MW ) , molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) , melting temperature ( Tm ) , and crystallinity are similar level with those obtained with the rac - (EBI)HfCl2 / MAO system . the MW and isotacticity of the polymer produced by MAO - free system decrease monotonically a tp increase , and MWD becomes narrow from <nUm> to <nUm> when tp increase from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C because of the compositional homogeneity of the polymer produced at high tp , which is demonstrated by fractionation of the polymer . both MW and [mmmm] value of polymer decrease a aging time and anion concentration increase . the process of partial hydrolysis reaction of TMA with water and the interaction of zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) with TMA , MAO , and the in situ partially hydrolyzed product of TMA were studied by in situ 1H- and 27Al - NMR spectroscopy . the 1H - NMR spectrum of MAO sample and the in situ hydrolyzed product of TMA with water under different condition are different . A new peak at δ = <nUm> ppm in 1H - NMR spectrum is observed , and is supposed to be due to the methyl resonance of MAO with low molecular weight . alkylation reaction is observed between Cp2ZrCl2 and TMA , MAO , and the in situ hydrolyzed product of TMA , and TMA is supposed to be the actual alkylating agent . 27Al - NMR study show that MAO is tetra-coordinated . the polymerization of ethylene wa studied by using a series of polysiloxane - bridged dinuclear zirconocenes [ (SiMe2O)nSiMe2 C5H4 ] [(C9H7)ZrCl2]2 ( <nUm> , n = <nUm> ; <nUm> , n = <nUm> ; <nUm> , n = <nUm> ) , the corresponding mononuclear zirconocene C14Cl2H12Zr , <nUm> , and the pentamethylene-bridged dinuclear zirconocene [(CH2)5(C5H4)2][(C 9H7)-ZrCl2]2 , <nUm> . from the polymerization study using these catalyst it wa found that ( i ) activity of the polysiloxane dinuclear zirconocenes 7-9 were lower than that of the corresponding mononuclear zirconocene <nUm> , ( ii ) molecular weight of polyethylene produced by the dinuclear metallocenes are greater than that of polyethylene produced by the mononuclear metallocene , ( iii ) the complex <nUm> holding the longest bridging ligand exhibited the highest activity but produced a polymer having the smallest molecular weight among the polysiloxane - bridged dinuclear zirconocenes , and ( iv ) the pentamethylene-bridged dinuclear metallocene <nUm> showed higher activity than the complex 7-9 and the mononuclear zirconocene <nUm> . the formation of the lowest molecular weight of polyethylene by <nUm> wa attributed to the influence of electron withdrawal caused by the lewis acid - base interaction between the acidic aluminum of the cocatalyst and the basic oxygen at the polysiloxane linkage a well a the lack of a steric problem . an increase in steric congestion around the metal center led to not only a decrease in catalytic activity due to preventing facile monomer access to the active site but also an increase in the molecular weight of polyethylene due to supressing b-H elimination . poly(siloxane)s with bisindenyl , bisfluorenyl , bis(1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadienyl ) , bis(2,4,7-trimethylindenyl) and monoindenylmethyl side group were synthesized by condensation of the corresponding dichlorosilanes and water . for reference , diphenylsilanediol or hydroquinone wa also employed in place of water . A series of poly (siloxane)-supported zirconocene catalyst were then prepared from these precursor and applied to ethene and propene polymerization a well a to the copolymerization of ethene with 1-octene in the presence of methylalumoxane . the polymerization activity of the new supported metallocenes depends drastically upon the substituents in the siloxane backbone . the zirconocene catalyst supported on poly(bisindenylsiloxane) and poly(bisfluorenylsiloxane) give the highest activity for ethene and propene polymerization , respectively . the weight - average molecular weight of the polymer are also markedly dependent upon the substituents . on the other hand , the molecular mass distribution ( MMD ) are generally not so sharp , suggesting that the active specie formed in these supported catalyst are not uniform . the PM3(tm) semiempirical method ha been used to optimize the structure for the reactant and transition state of the first and second ethylene insertion process into zirconocene catalytic system . the result obtained for these reaction are compared with calculation published in the literature performed at different abinitio theoretical level . the agreement between our calculation and those reported in the literature is satisfactory . taking advantage of the reduced computational effort required in semiempirical calculation two additional process related with the socalled comonomer effect were also studied : ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization , and chain termination reaction , both in the homopolymerization and in copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene comonomer . the calculated activation energy support some experimental finding such a the higher polymerization activity in the presence of comonomers and also the molecular weight reduction of the copolymer due to the more favorable b-elimination reaction . both the rac- and meso-dinuclear ansa - zirconocene catalyst ( m-C12H8{[SiPh(Ind)2]ZrCl2} <nUm> ) were prepared by a coupling reaction between <nUm> equiv of diindenylphenylchlorosilane ( rac- and meso-isomers ) and <nUm> equiv of p-dilithiobiphenyl in diethyl ether at <nUm> ° C , followed by a successive reaction with Cl4Zr · 2THF in THF at <nUm> ° C . polymerization of ethene and propene were conducted in a <nUm> dm high - pressure glass reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer at <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> ° C using methylalumoxane ( MAO ) a cocatalyst and toluene or decahydronaphthalene a the solvent . copolymerization of ethene and 1-octene wa also checked in brief . for ethene polymerization , the meso-catalyst wa found to be more active , which displayed an extremely high activity to give linear polyethene with a high molecular weight and a narrow molar mass distribution ( MMD ) . the apparent activity increased monotonously with rising polymerization temperature from <nUm> ° C up to <nUm> ° C , indicating that the active specie are stable even at a high temperature . on the other hand , both the rac- and meso-catalysts showed very poor activity for propene polymerization . however , copolymerization of ethene and 1-octene proceeded at a high speed . the use of crosslinked poly(styrene-co-4-vinylpyridine) having functional group a the support for zirconocene catalyst in ethylene polymerization wa studied . several factor affecting the activity of the catalyst were examined . condition like time , temperature , Al / N ( molar ratio ) , Al / Zr ( molar ratio ) , and the mode of feeding were found having no significant influence on the activity of the catalyst , while the state of the support had a great effect on the catalytic behavior . the activity of the catalyst sharply increased with either the degree of crosslinking or the content of 4-vinylpyridine in the support . via aluminum compound , AlR3 or methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , zirconocene wa attached on the surface of the support . IR spectrum showed an intensified and shifted absorption band of C-N in the pyridine ring , and a new absorption band appeared at about <nUm> cm-1 indicating a stable bond Al-N formed in the polymer - supported catalyst . the formation of cationic active center wa hypothesized and the performance of the polymer - supported zirconocene wa discussed a well . ansa - zirconocene diamide complex rac-Me2Si(CMB)2Zr(NMe2)2 ( rac-1 , CMB = l-C5H2-2-Me-4-'Bu ) reacts with AlR3 ( r = me , et , i-Bu ) and then with [CPh3] + [ B(C6F5)4l ~ ( 2 ) in toluene in order to in situ generate cationic alkylzirconium specie . In the sequential NMR - scale reaction of rac-1 with various amount of AlMe3 and <nUm> , rac-1 transforms first to rac-Me2Si(CMB)2Zr(Me)(NMe2) ( rac-3 ) and racMe2Si(CMB)2ZrMe2 ( rac-4 ) by the reaction with AlMe2 , and then to [rac-Me2Si(CMB)2ZrMe]1 ( 51 ) cation by the reaction of the resulting mixture with <nUm> . the activity of propylene polymerization by rac - l / al( £ -Bu)3 / <nUm> system are dependent on the type and concentration of AlR3 , resulting in the order of activity : rac-l / Al(i-Bu)3 / <nUm> > rac - l / AlEt3 / <nUm> > rac - <nUm> / MAO > rac - l / AlMe3 / <nUm> system . the bulkier isobutyl substituents make inactive catalytic specie sterically unfavorable and give rise to more separated ion pair so that the monomer can easily access to the active site . the dependence of the maximum rate CRp,max ) on polymerization temperature ( tp ) obtained by rac - l / al( £ -Bu)3 / <nUm> system follows arrhenius relation , and the overall activation energy corresponds to <nUm> kcal / mol . the molecular weight ( MW ) of the resulting isotactic polypropylene ( zPP ) is not sensitive to Al(i-Bu)3 concentration . the analysis of regiochemical error of iPP show that the chain transfer to Al(z-Bu)3 is a minor chain termination . the 1,3-addition of propylene monomer is the main source of regiochemical sequence and the [mr] sequence is negligible , a a result the mesa pentad ( [mmmm] ) value of iPPs are very high ( [mmmm] <nUm> % ) . these result can explain the fact that rac-l / Al(i-Bu)o / <nUm> system keep high activity over a wide range of [Al(i-Bu)3] / [Zr] ratio between <nUm> and <nUm> . an on - line electron spin resonance ( ESR ) technique wa applied to investigate the oxidation state of the metallocene catalyst CpTiCl3 , CpZrCl3 , Cp2TiCl2 , and Cp2ZrCl2 . these metallocene catalyst were activated by modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) . it wa found that the titanocene catalyst ( CpTiCl3 and Cp2TiCl2 ) were readily reduced to the trivalent state while the zirconocene catalyst ( CpZrCl3 and Cp2ZrCl2 ) were quite stable with respect to reduction . the concentration of the trivalent specie Ti (III) and Zr (III) showed linear relationship with the concentration of metallocene catalyst precursor . however , their slope were always smaller than unity indicating the existence of bimetallic interaction of the active site . the ESR detectable Ti (III) and Zr (III) concentration initially increased with the MAO / catalyst ratio and then leveled off after an 800-1000 Al / catalyst molar ratio . the deactivation process were followed a a function of aging time over a range of temperature ( 25-100 ° C ) . the decay curve strongly depended on aging temperature with higher temperature giving faster decay rate . ansa - zirconocene diamide complex rac - (EBI)Zr(NMe2)2 [ rac-1 , EBI = ethylene-1,2-bis(1-indenyl) ] reacted with AlR3 ( r = me , et , iBu ) or Al(iBu2)H and then with [CPh3][B(C6F5)4] ( 2 ) in toluene in order to perform propylene polymerization by cationic alkylzirconium specie , which are in situ generated during polymerization . through the sequential NMR - scale reaction of rac-1 with AlR3 or Al(iBu2)H and then with <nUm> , rac-1 wa demonstrated to be transformed to the active alkylzirconium cation via alkylated intermediate of rac-1 . the cationic specie generated by using AlMe3 , AlEt3 , and Al(iBu2)H a alkylating reagent tend to become heterodinuclear complex ; however , those by using bulky Al(iBu)3 become base - free [rac-(EBI)Zr(iBu)]+ cation . the activity of propylene polymerization by rac - <nUm> / AlR3 / <nUm> catalyst wa deeply influenced by various parameter such a the amount and the type of AlR3 , metallocene concentration , [Al] / [2] ratio , and polymerization temperature . generally the catalytic system using bulky alkylaluminum like Al(iBu)3 and Al(iBu)2H show higher activity but lower stereoregularity than those using le bulky AlMe3 and AlEt3 . the alkylating reagent Al(iBu)3 is not a transfer agent a good a AlMe3 or AlEt3 . the polymerization activity show maximum around [Al] / [2] ratio of <nUm> and increase monotonously with polymerization temperature . the overall activation energy of both rac - <nUm> / Al(iBu)3 / <nUm> and rac-1 / Al(iBu)2H catalyst is <nUm> kcal / mol . As the polymerization temperature increase , the stereoregularity of the resulting polymer decrease markedly , which is demonstrated by the decrease of [mmmm] pentad value and by the increase of the amount of polymer soluble in low boiling solvent . the physical property of polymer produced in this study were investigated by using 13C - NMR , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , viscometry , and gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) . the effect of polymerization condition were evaluated on the production of polyethylene by silica - supported (n-BuCp)2ZrCl2 grafted under optimized condition and cocatalyzed by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the Al : Zr molar ratio , reaction temperature , monomer pressure , and the age and concentration of the catalyst were systematically varied . most reaction were performed in toluene . hexane , with the addition of triisobutilaluminum ( TIBA ) to MAO , wa also tested a a polymerization solvent for both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst system . polymerization reaction in hexane showed their highest activity with MAO : TIBA ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> and <nUm> : <nUm> for the homogeneous and supported system , respectively . catalyst activity increased continuously a Al : Zr molar ratio increased from <nUm> to <nUm> , and remained constant up to <nUm> . the highest activity wa observed at <nUm> K . high monomer pressure ( ≈ <nUm> atm ) appeared to stabilize active specie during polymerization , producing polyethylene with high molecular weight ( ≈ <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 ) . catalyst concentration had no significant effect on polymerization activity or polymer property . catalyst aging under inert atmosphere wa evaluated over <nUm> month ; a pronounced reduction in catalyst activity [ from <nUm> to <nUm> × <nUm> g PE ( mol Zr h)-1 ] wa observed only after the first two day following preparation . isotactic polypropylene ( i-PP ) and syndiotactic polypropylene ( s-PP ) obtained with single - site C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocenes , respectively , activated with triphenyl carbenium tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl)borate ( 3 ) are immiscible with one another . physical mixture of the two PPs is macrophase separated and crystallizes very slowly a is characteristic of s-PP . A solution of C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocenes with <nUm> also produce an incompatible mixture of i-PP and s-PP . however , in the presence of an excess of a crossover agent such a triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) , a new polymeric material is obtained that exhibit lower Tm and DHf than either of the two homosteric polymer and a much faster rate of crystallization than that of s-PP or it physical mixture with i-PP . thermal annealing of this product markedly reduces the relative amount of crystalline phase compared to the amorphous phase and atomic force microscopy find only microphase separation but not macroscopic phase separation . fractionation and 13C - NMR showed the material to contain not only the homosteric i-PP and s-PP but also a stereoblock PP ( i-PP-b-s-PP ) . the stereoblock fraction act a a compatibilizing agent ; it probably is produced by the exchange of propagating polymer chain between the syndiospecific and the isospecific site assisted by the crossover agent . A new class of organometallic polymer having a backbone of conjugated poly-yne and Zr - metal atom ha been prepared . trichloroethylene ( TCE ) and hexachlorobutadiene ( HCB ) are quantitatively converted by n-butyllithium to dilithioacetylene ( LiCfeCLi ) and dilithiodiacetylene ( Li-C = C-C = C-Li ) respectively . quenching with Cp2*ZrCl2 affords high yield of the polymer |Zr(Cp2*)C = c}n and { Zr(Cp2*)C = C-CfeCln where cp* = C2H3 = pentamethyl cyclopentadienyl . the Cp2*ZrCl2 and the polymer were characterized by viscosity , molecular weight , elemen - tal analysis , FTIR , NMR spectrum , and TGA . the PM3(tm) semiempirical method wa used to show the effect of a second ethylene molecule in the backside position on the frontside ethylene insertion in the Cp2Zr-nPr+ g-agostic resting state . the same calculation without a companion second ethylene molecule were performed to compare geometrical parameter , energy , and electrostatic charge . the result obtained show that the geometrical parameter for both case were identical , but difference in the electrostatic charge were observed . the energy profile presented two barrier , the first corresponding to the alkyl-chain rotation along the Zr-Ca bond and the second relating to the insertion process itself . the presence of a companion second ethylene molecule affected the energetic profile by lowering the energy barrier of the first stage with respect to the process without the companion second ethylene molecule . these result provide some theoretical support to the well - known trigger effect . the influence of metal , alkyne substituents , cp substitution and additional ligand on the stability of bridged and unbridged e2-alkyne - titanocene and - zirconocene complex ha been investigated . the reduction of the complex [ (e5-C5H4)-SiMe2-(e 5-C5H4)]TiCl2 with magnesium in the presence of tolan ( PhC2Ph ) doe not give the expected alkyne - titanocene complex [ ( e5-C5H4 ) - SiMe2- (e5-C5H4)]Ti(e2-PhC 2Ph ) but by coupling of two tolan molecule the corresponding titanacyclopentadiene [ (e5-C5H4)-SiMe2-(e 5-C5H4)]TiC4Ph4 ( 1 ) wa obtained . In the analogous reaction with Me3SiC2SiMe3 the stable e2-alkyne complex without additional ligand [ (e5-C5H4)-SiMe2-(e 5-C5H4)]Ti(e2-Me 3-SiC2SiMe3 ) ( 2 ) wa formed , due to the sterical influence of the alkyne substituents . the compound without additional ligand (thi)2Ti(e2-PhC2Ph) ( 3 ) and (thi)2Ti(e2- Me3SiC2-SiMe3 ) ( 5 ) were isolated from the unbridged titanocene complex (thi)2TiCl2 ( thi = tetrahydroindenyl ) . two equivalent of complex <nUm> reacted with one equivalent of water to yield the dimeric alkylidene-m-oxo complex [ (thi)2Ti(CPh = CHPh)]2(m-O) ( 6 ) . the reaction of the unbridged zirconocene compound (thi)2ZrCl2 gave the alkyne complex (thi)2Zr(THF)(e2-Me3-SiC 2SiMe3 ) ( 7 ) which is stabilized by THF . At higher temperature THF wa eliminated from the orange complex <nUm> forming the green complex (thi)2Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) . this behaviour wa investigated in detail using NMR spectroscopy and compared to similar complex such a Cp2Zr(e2-Me3-SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ( not stable without THF ) , (ebthi)2Zr(e2-Me3SiC2-SiMe <nUm> ) ( ebthi = ethylenebistetrahydroindenyl ; stable without THF ) and Cp*2Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ( cp* = pentamethyl-Cp , stable without THF ) . all complex were characterized by spectroscopic method . x-ray structural determination were conducted for the complex <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> . compound <nUm> is the first example of a structurally characterized tolan - titanocenc complex without additional ligand . bis(alkynyl)zirconocene and -hafnocene complex <nUm> react with (butadiene)zirconocene or -hafnocene , respectively , to yield the binuclear s,p-acetylide bridged complex [ ( cp <nUm> m ) <nUm> ( m-C ≡ C-R ) <nUm> ] <nUm> ( m = Zr , Hf ; r = CH <nUm> , C <nUm> H <nUm> , or CH <nUm> ph ) . the complex <nUm> are selectively protonated upon treatment with N,N-dimethylanilinium tetraphenylborate or tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate to yield the dinuclear metallocene cation complex [ ( cp <nUm> m <nUm> )(m-RCC <nUm> -H)(m-C = C-R)M <nUm> cp <nUm> + ] <nUm> ( m <nUm> = m <nUm> = Zr , a-c ; m <nUm> = Zr , m <nUm> = Hf , h ; m <nUm> = m <nUm> = Hf , i ) that contain a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom ( C <nUm> -H ) bearing a hydrogen substituent . complex 13a wa characterized by x-ray diffraction . it reveals an agostic interaction of the C <nUm> -H moiety with the m <nUm> cp <nUm> unit . the planar-tetracooidinate carbon unit C <nUm> -H of 13a exhibit <nUm> C / <nUm> H NMR chemical shift of δ = <nUm> and <nUm> and a coupling constant of <nUm> J CH = <nUm> Hz . selective protonation of (m-alkynyl)bis(group <nUm> metallocene ) complex containing other additional bridging ligand provides a rather general synthetic entry to planar-tetracoordinate carbon containing complex of this type : [ cp <nUm> m <nUm> ( m-C ≡ C-CH <nUm> )(m-Cl)M <nUm> cp <nUm> ] ( 10a-c , m <nUm> , m <nUm> = Zr , Hf ) and [ cp <nUm> m <nUm> ( m-C ≡ C-CH <nUm> )(m-CH <nUm> )M <nUm> cp <nUm> ] ( 11a.b ) selectively add a proton from [ ( HNMe <nUm> ph ) + ( ArB <nUm> ) - ] at carbon atom C <nUm> of the acetylide ligand to yield the corresponding " anti-va n't hoff / LeBel complex " [ cp <nUm> m <nUm> ( m-CH <nUm> CC <nUm> -H)(m-X)M <nUm> cp <nUm> + ] ( 13d-g and k , x = Cl , CH <nUm> ) , respectively . when a mixture of stereoisomers of rac- and meso-1,2-bis(phenylphosphanyl)-1,2-dicarba-doso-dodecaborane(12) ( 1a , b ; 1a / 1b = <nUm> : <nUm> ) is treated with [Cp2ZrMe2] in boiling toluene for <nUm> h , the formation of three phosphorus - containing product , namely meso-[Cp2Zr(PPh)3] ( 3 ) , (PPh)4 ( 4 ) and (PPh)5 ( 5 ) , ratio <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> , wa observed by <nUm> P - NMR spectroscopy . In the <nUm> B - NMR spectrum of the reaction mixture , only signal for 1,2-dicarba-closo-dodecaborane(12) were observed . when zirconocene , prepared in situ from [Cp2ZrCl2] and BuLi , wa treated with 1a , b at low temperature and then heated to reflux in toluene for <nUm> h , only formation of <nUm> and 1,2-dicarba-closo-dodeca-borane(12) wa observed . the mixture of stereoisomers of 1a , b reacts with ClCu in THF to give me- and meso-[CuCl(THF){l,2-(PHPh)2C2B10H <nUm> } ] ( 7a , b ) , which is only stable in THF solution and loses THF in vacuo over several hour to yield the insoluble colorless complex [CuCl{1,2-(PHPh)2C2B10H10}]. , ( 8 ) . In THF solution , <nUm> reacts with PPh3 to give the stable isolable complex [ CuCl(PPh3){l,2-(PHPh)2C2B10H <nUm> } ] ( 9 ) . No reaction of 1a , b is observed with [Cp'Mo(CO)3]2 ( cp' = C5H4Me ) in boiling THF , while only decomposition occurs in boiling toluene . however , [(NBD)Mo(CO)4] ( NBD = norbornadiene ) reacts smoothly with 1a in toluene at room temperature to give cis-rac-[Mo(CO)4{1 ,2-(PHPh)2C2B10H10 } ] ( 10 ) . compound <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were characterized spectroscopically ( 1H , 31P , 11B , 13C NMR , IR ) , and an x-ray structure determination wa carried out on <nUm> . hydrozirconation of propyne followed by treatment with propynyllithium yield the (s-propenyl)(s-propynyl)zirconocene complex <nUm> . it treatment with the organometallic lewis acid BC18F15 result in transfer of the s-propynyl group from zirconium to boron followed by insertion of the alkynylborate triple bond into the zirconium carbon bond of the remaining metallaallyl cation to furnish the zirconocene-(m-hydrocarbyl)borate betaine complex <nUm> . this reacts with three molar equivalent of tert-butyl isocyanide to give <nUm> . complex <nUm> contains a five - membered carbocyclic ring , formed by carbon-carbon coupling of the former propenyl and propynyl group with the C ≡ N-R reagent , to which a (e2-iminoacyl)(k-tert-butyl isocyanide)zirconocene moiety is attached . complex <nUm> wa characterized by an x-ray crystal structure analysis . the reaction of cp <nUm> Zr(L)(e <nUm> -Me <nUm> CSi <nUm> SiMe <nUm> ) ( L = THF , pyridine ) with e-caprolactone , cyclohexanone and cycloheptanone result in an insertion of the carbonyl group into the zirconacyclopropene ring system of the alkyne complex to yield the five - membered metallacyclic spirozirconadihydiofurane complex <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> . the product with e-caprolactone is not stable at room temperature and wa identified only by NMR spectrum and chemical reaction . starting from rac-(ebtru)Zr(e <nUm> -Me <nUm> CSi <nUm> SiMe <nUm> ) with e-caprolactone and ethylene carbonate under analogous condition more stable complex ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) were obtained . complex <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by x-ray crystal - structure analysis . complex <nUm> and <nUm> react with further e-caprolactone in a catalytic ring - opening polymerization . the polymerization reaction were monitored by NMR spectroscopy . treatment of the [ Cp2Zr(e2-acetaldehyde) / H(CH3)ZrCp2 ] adduct <nUm> with BC18F15 yield the dimetallabicyclic salt [ Cp2Zr(m-e1-O:e2-C,O- OCHMe)(m-H)(ZrCp2)]+[CH3B(C6F5)3]- 18b . similarly , hydride abstraction from the related neutral dimetallabicyclic [ Cp2Zr(OCHR) / H2ZrCp2 ] adduct <nUm> ( r = CH3 ) or <nUm> ( r = C2H5 ) with BC18F15 yield the system [ Cp2Zr(m-e1-O:e2-C,O-OCHR)(m- H)(ZrCp2)]+[HB(C6F5)3]- ( 18a , c ) and the reaction of BC18F15 with [ Cp2Zr(OCHCH2Ph) / H(PhCH2)ZrCp2)]+ <nUm> give [ Cp2Zr(m-e1-O:e2-C,O- (OCHCH2Ph)(m-H)ZrCp2]+[PhCH2B(C6F5)3]- 18d . A variety of nitrile R2-C ≡ N ( r = CH3 , CMe3 , p-tolyl , or ethyl ) cleanly reacts with the cation <nUm> by addition of the Zr2(m-H) moiety to the nitrile functionality to yield the respective aldiminium - bridged cation [ Cp2Zr(m-e1-O:e2-C,O- (OCHR1)(m-N = CHR2)ZrCp2]+ ( 21-24 ) . complex 24d ( R1 = PhCH2 , R2 = C2H5 ) wa characterized by an x-ray crystal structure analysis . similarly , treatment of the system 18a-d with isocyanate RN = C = O ( r = CMe3 , SiMe3 , p- tolyl , or adamantyl ) gave the related m-formamidato complex 27-30 . 6-Amino-6-methylfulvene ha been coupled with benzoic acid by treatment with 7-azahydroxybenzotriazole and DCC . subsequent two-fold deprotonation , at the NH and 6-methyl group , generated the vinylidene-bridged cp / benzoylamido ligand <nUm> . treatment of <nUm> with ZrCl4(THF)2 gave the spirometallocene complex 3a ( characterized by x-ray crystal structure analysis ) , while reaction of <nUm> with (Et2N)2ZrCl2(THF)2 yielded the bridged half - sandwich complex 3b . treatment of 3a with two molar equivalent of the strongly electrophilic borane BC12F10H resulted in hydroboration of the exocyclic C = C double bond with concomitant intramolecular N-B adduct formation to yield the azaboretidine - type system <nUm> ( three diastereoisomers , one of which ha been characterized by x-ray diffraction analysis ) . similarly , hydroboration of 3b with BC12F10H yielded the azaboretidine derivative <nUm> . activation of the complex <nUm> and <nUm> with methylalumoxane led to active homogeneous ziegler - type propene polymerization catalyst . the first 1,2-azaphosphindoles 14a,b , 15a,b were obtained in a straightforward manner upon heating diphenylzirconocene in the presence of a cyanophosphane , which afforded azazir-conacyclopentenes 11a,b which can be reacted with various dichlorophosphanes . the use of the tetrachlorodiphosphane CCl2H2P instead of a dichlorophosphane allowed the preparation of the bis(1,2-azaphosphindoles) <nUm> , 19' . the monosulfur adduct of the azaphosphindole 14a , i.e. 16a , wa characterized by x-ray structure analysis . alkylation of 14a or 16a with methyltrifluoromethane sulfonate occurred selectively on the intracyclic phosphorus atom or on the sulfur atom , giving the salt <nUm> or <nUm> , respectively . the acetylene exchange in [L2Ti(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3)] ( L = cp ( e5-C5H5 ) , cp* ( e5-C5Me5 ) , THI ( e5-tetrahydroindenyl ) , L2 = Me2Si(e5-C5H4)2 ) by corresponding alkynylsilanes RC ≡ CSiMe2H or , alternatively , the reduction of [L2TiCl2] with magnesium in THF in the presence of alkynylsilanes led to the formation of titanocene silylalkyne complex [L2Ti-(RC2SiMe2H)] ; L = cp , r = tBu <nUm> , ph <nUm> , SiMe3 <nUm> , SiMe2H <nUm> ; L = cp* , r = tBu <nUm> , r = SiMe2H <nUm> ; L = THI , r = tBu <nUm> and L2 = Me2Si(e5-C5H4)2 , r = tBu <nUm> . the zirconocene alkyne complex with additional ligand [Cp2Zr(thf)(e2-RC2SiMe2H)] ; r = tBu 9a , ph 10a , SiMe3 11a , and SiMe2H 12a were also prepared by an acetylene exchange reaction starting from [ Cp2Zr(thf)(e2-Me3 . SiC2SiMe3 ) ] and the corresponding alkynylsilanes r ≡ CSiMe2H . dynamic NMR investigation in [D8]THF show an equilibrium between [Cp2Zr(thf)(e2-RC2SiMe2H)] and the solvent - free derivative [Cp2Zr(RC2SiMe2H)] . upon dissolving in n-hexane a complete elimination of the THF ligand yield zirconocene alkyne complex without additional ligand [Cp2Zr(RC2SiMe2H)] ; r = tBu 9b , ph 10b , SiMe3 11b , and SiMe2H 12b . IR spectrum , x-ray structural , and NMR investigation indicate that the characteristic feature of the titanocene complex 1-4 and <nUm> and the zirconocene complex without THF ligand <nUm> b-12b is an agostic interaction between the Si-H bond and the metal center . the effect of this Si-H - metal interaction is considerably stronger at low temperature and in the solid state . the L2M moiety showing this bond activation are active catalyst in hydrosilylation and dehydrogenative polysilane formation reaction . In the case of PhC ≡ CSiMe2H a coupling of two acetylene to give titana- ( 13 ) and zirconacyclopentadienes ( 14 ) wa observed ; the unsymmetrically substituted compound 13a , 14a are kinetically favored and formed first . subsequent cycloreversion lead to the thermodynamically more stable symmetrical metallacyclopentadienes 13b and 14b . both compound do not show any interaction of the Si-H group with the metal . herein we describe different C-C coupling reaction of permethyltitanocene and -zirconocene with disubstituted 1,3-butadiynes . the outcome of these reaction vary depending on the metal and the diyne substituents . the reduction of [Cp*2MCl2] ( cp* = C5Me5 ; m = Ti , Zr ) with Mg in the presence of disubstituted butadiynes RC ≡ C-C ≡ CR' is suitable for the synthesis of different C-C coupling product of the diyne and the permethylmetallocenes , and provides a new method for the generation of functionalized pentamethyl-cyclopentadienyl derivative . for m = Zr and r = R' = tBu , the reaction give , by a twofold activation of one pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand , the complex [ Cp*Zr{-C( = C = CHtBu)-CHtBu-CH2-e5-C 5Me3-CH2- } ] ( 3 ) , containing a fulvene ligand that is coupled to the modified substrate ( allenic subunit ) . when using the analogous permethyltitanocene fragment " Cp*2Ti " , the reaction depends strongly on the substituents r and R' . the coupling product of the butadiyne with two methyl group of one of the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ring system , [ Cp*Ti{e5-C5Me3-(CH 2-CHR-e2-C2-CHR'-CH2 ) } ] , is obtained with r = R' = tBu ( 4 ) and r = tBu , R' = SiMe3 ( 5 ) . In these complex one pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand is annellated to an eight - membered ring with a C-C triple bond , which is coordinated to the titanium center . A different activation of both pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand is observed for r = R' = me , resulting in the complex [ { e5-C5Me4(CH 2)-}Ti{-C( = CHMe)-C( = CHMe)-CH2-e5-C 5Me4 } ] ( 6 ) , which display a fulvene a well a a butadienyl-substituted pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand . the influence exerted by the size of the metal is illustrated in the reaction of [Cp*2ZrCl2] with MeC ≡ C-C ≡ CMe . here the five - membered metallacyclocumulene complex [Cp*2Zr(e4-1,2,3,4-MeC4Me)] ( 7 ) is obtained . the reaction path found for r = R' = me are identical to those formerly described for r = R' = ph . treatment of the BC12F11 OEt2 ( 3 ) complex with n-pyrrolyl lithium give bis(pentafluorophenyl)(N-pyrrolyl)borane ( 2 ) , a strong organometallic lewis acid , which wa characterized by x-ray diffraction ( B-N bond length : <nUm> Å ) . it exhibit a columnar superstructure in the crystal and contains p-stacks of pyrrolyl unit . compound <nUm> readily abstract alkyl anion from a variety of alkyl group <nUm> metallocene - type complex and lead to the clean formation of the respective metallocene ion or ion pair . for example , the treatment of Cp3ZrCH3 ( 9 ) with <nUm> transfer a methyl anion to yield the ion pair [Cp3Zr]+[(C4H4N)B(CH 3)(C6F5)2]- ( 12 ) . the x-ray crystal structure analysis of <nUm> show a close contact between zirconium and the pyrrolyl-b-carbon ( <nUm> Å ) . the borane <nUm> add to (butadiene)zirconocene ( 13 ) to yield the betaine system [Cp2Zr]+ [ (C4H6)B-(NC4H4)(C6F 5)2]- ( 15 ) . complex <nUm> contains a distorted e3-allyl moiety inside the metallacyclic framework and it feature an internal zr+ ⋯ (pyrrolyl)B- ion pair interaction with a Zr ⋯ pyrrolyl-a-carbon separation of <nUm> Å ( determined by x-ray diffraction ) . from the dynamic NMR spectrum of <nUm> the bond strength of the internal ion pair interaction wa estimated to be DG[?]diss ( <nUm> K ) ≈ <nUm> kcal mol-1 . treatment of dimethylzirconocene ( 16 ) with <nUm> yield the metallocene borate salt [Cp2ZrCH3]+[(C4H 4N)B(CH3)(C6F5)2 ] - ( 17 ) , which is an active catalyst for the polymerization of ethene . polycyclic zwitterionic complex that incorporate one or two phosphonium unit ( s ) a cationic center ( s ) and zirconocene - ate moiety(ies) a the anionic counterpart ( s ) can be easily prepared by either [1+3] or [1+3] and [2+3] cycloadditions which involve bi-or tricyclic a-zirconated phosphanes <nUm> or <nUm> and various azide . some of these specie exhibit unprecedented phosphazide chelation with bonding between the zirconium and a nitrogen atom in the a position relative to phosphorus . when heated , the phosphazide complex lose dinitrogen to form stable polycyclic zwitterionic phosphonium mono-or dinuclear complex . the solid - state structure of the two zwitterionic complex <nUm> and <nUm> wa determined by x-ray crystallography . As homoenolate equivalent , zirconocene-1-aza-1,3-diene complex were used for the first time in stereoselective synthesis . by insertion of an unsymmetrical ketone in the Zr-C σ bond , sterically demanding trisubstituted dihydro- and tetrahydrofuran derivative were prepared in good overall yield and with high diastereoselectivities ( see below ) . none vinylsilanes and / or allylsilanes are formed upon silylation of terminal alkene with R3SiCl in the presence of a grignard reagent and a catalytic amount of [Cp2ZrCl2] [ eq. ( a ) ] . the reaction also proceeds under mild condition when silylsulfides ( x = SPh ) , silylselenides ( x = SePh ) , and silyltellurides ( x = TePh ) are used in place of chlorosilanes ( x = Cl ) . r ' = alkyl , aryl , alkylsilyl ; r ' = me , et , nPr ; r = CH2R , aryl , H . the systematic regulation of the molecular weight distribution in the MAO - activated polymerization of ethylene ha been realized by using amino- functionalized ansa - zirconocene dichloride a precatalysts ( one of the active specie is shown ) . the formation of high- and low-molecular-weight polyethylene with a unimodal distribution a well a the formation of polyethylene with a bimodal distribution is possible by varying the polymerization temperature . the electronic structure and geometry of polymethylaluminoxane ( MAO ) [-Al(CH3)O-]n with different size ( n = 4-12 ) have been studied using quantum - chemical DFT ( density functional theory ) calculation . it ha been found : <nUm> ) starting from n = <nUm> , the three - dimensional oxo-bridged ( cage ) structure of MAO is more stable than the cyclic structure . <nUm> ) both for cage structure and for cyclic structure the lewis acidity of Al atom characterized by their net positive charge amplifies with increasing size of MAO ( n ) . <nUm> ) trimethylaluminium ( AlMe3 ) reacts with the cage structure of MAO with cleavage of an Al-O dative bond and formation of acidic tri-coordinated alv and basic di-coordinated ov atom in the MAO molecule . two molecule AlMe3 are associated with acidic alv and basic ov center . As the MAO increase in size , the acidity of alv center amplifies and the distance alv - ( AlMe3 ) shortens ; on the contrary , interaction of AlMe3 with ov center weakens and the distance ov - ( AlMe3 ) increase with increasing n value . the total heat of Al2Me6 interaction with MAO ( sum interaction of alv - ( AlMe3 ) and ov - ( AlMe3 ) ) noticeably decrease a the size of MAO increase ( from <nUm> kcal / mol for n = <nUm> to <nUm> kcal / mol for n = <nUm> ) . it is proposed that acidic alv and basic ov center formed in the cage structure of MAO interact with zirconocene yielding ' cation - like ' zirconium active center . the cationic alkyl zirconocene complex Cp2Zr+Me[CH3B-(C6F 5)3 ] is found to initiate the ring - opening polymerization of 1,5,7,11-tetraoxaspiro[5,5]undecane under mild condition to give poly(oxypropylenepropylenecarbonate) with low polydispersity . the rate of the polymerization is first - order with respect to monomer and catalyst concentration . At high monomer concentration , the initial rate of polymerization becomes zero - order with respect to monomer concentration . In this paper we report on a zirconocene dichloride / methylaluminoxane catalyst system supported on a crosslinked polystyrene in order to provide ethylene polymerization catalyst for gas phase or slurry process . our novel approach us the diels - alder reaction of cyclopentadiene function a the final , crosslinking synthetic step . this provides polymer supported zirconocene catalyst with a homogeneous distribution of active site . the catalyst were shown to be highly active and to form spherical bead a proven by scanning electron microscopy . nanocomposites of high density polyethylene ( HDPE ) , linear low density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) and highly branched polyethylene rubber were prepared both by mean of melt compounding and ethene homo- and copolymerization in the presence of layered silicate which were rendered organophilic via ion exchange with various quaternary alkyl ammonium cation . In comparison to melt compounding , in-situ ethene homo- and copolymerization , catalyzed with MAO - activated zirconocene ( MBI ) , nickel ( DMN ) and palladium ( DMPN ) catalyst , proved more effective in nanocomposite formation , a evidenced by larger interlayer spacing and formation of exfoliated anisotropic nanosilicates with high aspect ratio . four non-bridged dimethylzirconocene complex , i.e. , bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)dimethylzirconium ( 1 ) , ( e5-cyclopentadienyl ) (e5-fluorenyl)dimethylzirconium ( 2 ) , bis(e5-indenyl)dimethylzirconium ( 3 ) and (e5-cyclopentadienyl)(e 5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)dimethylzirconium ( 4 ) were synthesized and used a a catalyst for the methyl methacrylate polymerization combined with triphenylmethyl tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate in the presence of ZnEt2 or Al(i-Bu)3 . the catalyst activity strongly depends on the zirconocene compound and decrease in the order <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> ≫ <nUm> . the polymerization proceeds in a living manner when <nUm> and <nUm> are used combined with ZnEt2 . on the other hand , stereoregularities of the resulting polymer are independent of the zirconocene compound , and syndiotactic - rich polymer are formed by a chain - end controlled mechanism . propene polymerization were performed using the two ansa - zirconocene catalyst system dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride / methylaluminoxane and dimethylsilylbis(2-methyl-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride / methylaluminoxane . the polymerization rate wa observed by continuously monitoring the monomer consumption . reaction rate profile were obtained in the temperature range from <nUm> ° C to <nUm> ° C at pressure between <nUm> and <nUm> bar and catalyst concentration from 4.6*10-6 m to 4.2*10-5 m . isotacticity , a measured by NMR , melting point and molecular weight decrease markedly at higher temperature . small amount of 1,3-inserted monomer ( < <nUm> mol- % ) wa observed at polymerization temperature above <nUm> ° C . No 2,1-inserted monomer wa detected . A kinetic model wa developed that describes the polymerization rate for Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 a the catalyst over the entire observed temperature range , and the polymerization rate for Me2Si(2-Me-Ind)2ZrCl2 in a limited temperature range . the model includes an activation reaction , latent site that may revert to active site and a permanent deactivation that is second order with respect to the active site . the activation energy for the propagation reaction wa found to be <nUm> kJ / mol for Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 and <nUm> kJ / mol for Me2Si(2-Me-Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO . several kinetic model are compared and discussed . stereospecific polymerization and asymmetric oligomerization of allylsilanes were investigated by using C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocene catalyst . isotactic and syndiotactic poly(allylsilane)s were produced with rac-ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) and diphenylmethylene(e5-cyclopentadienyl)(e 5-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 6 ) , respectively . bulky allylsilanes afforded optically active oligomers in the reaction using optically active ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium and -hafnium complex . A magnesium chloride supported zirconocene catalyst wa synthesized using a soluble tetrahy-drofuran complex of magnesium chloride . the supported catalyst polymerizes ethylene with high activity in the presence of methylaluminoxane . the siginificant feature of the supported catalyst is that it polymerizes ethylene even at temperature a high a <nUm> ° C at low Al / Zr ratio . the polymer molecular weight obtained using supported catalyst are found to be higher compared to the unsupported catalyst . the molecular weight distribution index is in the range of <nUm> - <nUm> . the active site concentration of the supported catalyst wa found to be five time lower than that of the unsupported catalyst . the olefin polymerization catalytic system iPr(CpFluo)ZrCl <nUm> / MAO wa investigated by UV / visible absorption spectroscopy in solvent of various polarity at <nUm> ° C . it wa shown that the UV / visible main absorption band of the zirconocene , which can be related to the ligand to metal charge transfer band ( LMCT ) , varies greatly upon incremental addition of MAO or AlMe <nUm> . for low [ AlMe <nUm> ] / [Zr] or [MAO] / [Zr] ratio ( Al : Zr < <nUm> ) , a hypsochromic shift of the initial iPr(CpFluo)ZrCl <nUm> absorption band , corresponding to the monomethylation of the metallocene dichloride , is observed . on the contrary , for higher Al / Zr ratio ( with MAO uniquely ) , a bathochromic shift of the metallocene absorption band proceeding in two distinct step is observed . these two step are interpreted by the successive formation of associated ( or complexed ) and dissociated active zirconocenium specie . the change in the absorption spectrum of iPr(CpFluo)ZrCl <nUm> / MAO are correlated with the initial activity observed for hex-1-ene polymerization in the various solvent examined . In the same way , the catalytic activity loss with polymerization time observed at elevated Al / Zr ratio ( > <nUm> ) with this system is attributed to a reduction of active specie concentration , a indicated by the intensity decrease of their UV / visible absorption band . this reveals the low stability of active specie formed from iPr(CpFluo)ZrCl <nUm> compared to those from rac - Et(Ind) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> . propylene / 1-hexene copolymer were prepared with the isospecific Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst by using a wide range of solvent . In the order of increasing dielectric constant ( ε ) they are : heptane ( 1.92 ) , methylcyclohexane ( 2.02 ) , toluene ( 2.38 ) , chlorobenzene ( CB ) ( 5.68 ) , methylene chloride ( 8.93 ) and o-dichlorobenzene ( o-DCB ) ( 10.12 ) . the effect of solvent structure and polarity on yield , composition , and microstructure of copolymer wa investigated . the data show that solvent polarity , which ha an enormous effect on the activity , ha a negligible effect on the copolymer composition . very close 1-hexene content are obtained with all the solvent used except for toluene , in which the comonomer content is remarkably lower than that in the other solvent for all composition . detailed 13C NMR analysis of the copolymer obtained wa performed : the reactivity ratio obtained by statistical elaboration of the experimental value of triad and tetrad comonomer composition confirm the actual lower accessibility of the active site to 1-hexene in toluene than in the other solvent . this fact can be explained by the competition of the nucleophilic toluene with 1-hexene in the coordination to the active site . our work of the last two year concerning the use of zirconocene catalyst in the production of polyethylene ( PE ) is reviewed . In earlier study , using Cp2ZrCl2 , the metal loading capacity of different commercial silica , namely grace <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> wa determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) . the adsorption isotherm of Al from methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) cocatalysts were determined using the 27Al(p , g)28Si nuclear reaction at <nUm> MeV . In the present work we could determine the Al / Si ratio with the simultaneous induction of nuclear reaction with 27Al and 28Si using proton of <nUm> MeV . after replacing Cp2ZrCl2 by (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 , an exhaustive search of activation , grafting and polymerization condition ( monitored by RBS , infrared spectroscopy , differential scanning calorimetry , and gel permeation chromatography ) allowed u to set an optimized protocol that yielded polyethylene with thermal , molecular weight and composition characteristic typical of high - density PE . the ab initio hartree - fock theory ha been demonstrated to give accurate geometry prediction for bridged zirconocene dichloride . equilibrium geometry of crystallographically characterized bridged zirconocene dichloride were optimized by hartree - fock , MP2 , BLYP , and B3LYP method , with basis set ranging from 3-21G* to 6-311G** . selected geometrical parameter were compared with experimental crystal structure . the least expensive HF / 3-21G* method proved to be notably accurate . the accuracy of HF / 3-21G* wa verified by a comprehensive data set of <nUm> bridged zirconocene dichloride . furthermore , experimental correction were applied to the optimized geometry parameter to eliminate systematic deviation . correction resulted in considerably improved accuracy for systematically overestimated metal - ligand distance , with maximum deviation falling from <nUm> to <nUm> Å , and absolute average deviation from <nUm> to <nUm> A. ligand - metal - ligand angle were predicted accurately with absolute average deviation of <nUm> - <nUm> ° . zirconium-chlorine distance and chlorine-zirconium-chlorine angle are relatively constant in the studied molecule . zirconium-cyclopentadienyl distance can be influenced mainly by modifying the ligand structure , whereas cyclopentadienyl-zirconium-cyclopentadienyl angle and cyclopentadienyl-cyclopentadienyl plane angle can be controlled by bridge modification . the HF / 3-21G* method can be applied for the estimation of steric effect in zirconocene catalyzed polymerization reaction , therefore being suitable for the construction of structure - polymerization property correlation . [ Me2C(Cp) (Ind)]ZrCl2 metallocene catalyst ha been prepared and employed in a study of ethene polymerization in the presence of the cocatalyst methylaluminoxane . C1 and C2 signal are detected in the 13C NMR spectrum of the resultant polymer ; this reveals that the resultant polymer is a branched polyethene ( polyethylene ) . the influence of polymerization temperature , catalyst concentration and [Al] / [Zr] ratio on catalytic activity and polymerization kinetics is investigated . A plausible mechanism for forming branched polyethene is suggested . the electron ionisation mass spectrometric behaviour of a new series of hafnocene and zirconocene chioroalcoholates is discussed . these data are also compared with those of mass - analysed ion kinetic energy spectrometry . with respect to dialcoholato complex previously studied by u , the monochloro-alcoholato specie show rather high intensity in their molecular ion peak , which reflects their higher volatility and sufficient stability in the vapour phase . fragmentation pattern of the complex in question give relevant information on their gas - phase behaviour and also on the influence of the ligand structure on the decomposition pathway . the complex in question appear to be promising precursor for metal - organic chemical vapour deposition ( MOCVD ) . zirconocene dichloride and bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride are used a catalyst precursor for the heterogeneous polymerization of ethene . A methyl-substituted microgel a support material for heterogeneous cocatalysts on the basis of MAO is compared with different commercially available silica - supported cocatalysts . the catalyst performance and the property of the obtained polyethenes show considerable difference . poly-a - olefin ranging from poly-1-pentene to poly-1-octadecene with narrow polydispersities were synthesized with (CH3)2Si(2-methylbenze[e]indenyl)2ZrCl2 and methylaluminoxane at polymerization temperature ( tp 's ) ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C and were characterized by gel permeation chromatography , NMR spectroscopy , and differential scanning calorimetry . the molar mass of the homopolymers obtained with (CH3)2Si(2-methylbenz[e]indenyl)2ZrCl2 were notably higher than those of poly-a - olefin synthesized with other zirconium - based metallocenes under similar condition . the temperature dependence of the molar mass distribution of the poly-a - olefin can be described by a common exponential decay function regardless of the investigated monomer . At tp 's ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C , moderate isotacticity prevailed , but outside this temperature range , the polymer were le stereoregular . ethene homopolymerization and copolymerization with 1-hexene were catalyzed by methyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl ( cp ) zirconium dichloride , (RnC5H5-n)2ZrCl2 ( Rn = H , me , 1,2-Me2 , 1,3-Me2 , 1,2,3-Me3 , 1,2,4-Me3 , me4 , or me5 ) , and methylaluminoxane . the polymer were characterized with fourier transform infrared , nuclear magnetic resonance , gel permeation chromatography , and differential scanning calorimetry technique . generally , an increasing number of methyl substituents on the cp ligand result in lower 1-hexene incorporation in the copolymer . the two catalyst with split methyl substitution ( Rn = 1,3-Me2 and Rn = 1,2,4-Me3 ) show a higher comonomer response than their disubstituted and trisubstituted counterpart ( Rn = 1,2-Me2 and r = 1,2,3-Me3 ) . they even incorporate more 1-hexene than Rn = H and Rn = me . these finding are qualitatively in agreement with the result of a theoretical study based on density functional calculation . the presence of comonomer doe not influence the termination reaction after the insertion of ethene . there is more frequent termination after each hexene insertion with increasing comonomer incorporation except for the two catalyst with split methyl substituents . the termination probability per inserted comonomer is highest for the le substituted catalyst . 1-Hexene wa polymerized by rac-(dimethylsilyl)bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride catalyst and methylaluminoxane cocatalyst over the temperature range 0-100 ° C . the polymerization rate , polymer molecular weight , and polymer microstructure ( stereospecificity and regiospecificity ) were studied a a function of the temperature and the concentration of monomer , catalyst , and cocatalyst . the synthesis and characterization of rac-[ethylenebis(1-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-3-indenyl)] zirconium dichloride is reported . the silyl substituted <nUm> / MAO wa compared to it siloxy substituted analogue in ethylene homo- and in ethylene-1-hexene copolymerizations to elucidate the effect of the heteroatom on polymerization performance . the influence of monomer and cocatalyst concentration and the polymerization temperature wa investigated . the oxygen between the indenyl ligand and the bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl group in the siloxy substituted <nUm> / MAO wa found to have a positive influence on polymerization activity and copolymerization performance . treatment of the tris(cyclopentadienyl) cation ( 1+ ) with zirconocene dichloride <nUm> gave , in almost quantitative yield , the <nUm> : <nUm> adduct 7+ , which wa isolated with [(CH3)B(C6F5)3]- a the counterion . reaction of 1+ with the organometallic ligand Cp3ZrCl afforded the <nUm> : <nUm> adduct 8+ , again isolated with [(CH3)B(C6F5)3]- . the x-ray analysis revealed that 7+ display a strongly bent Zr-Cl-Zr coordination mode , in contrast to 8+ , which ha a tendency to linear coordination . A theoretical analysis suggests that a subtle balance between steric and electronic factor determines the geometry in such organometallic adduct . treatment of bis(propynyl)zirconocene ( 5 ) with a stoichiometric quantity of BC18F15 lead to C-C coupling of the alkynyl ligand to form the zirconocene-(m-hexadiyne)-borate betaine complex <nUm> . this apparently is in an endothermic equilibrium with a methylenecyclopropene - type isomer <nUm> , formed by intramolecular alkyne insertion into the (sp2-carbon)-zirconium linkage , which is very effectively trapped by added scavenger reagent such a organic nitrile or isonitriles , to yield the stable unsaturated three- membered ring product <nUm> or <nUm> , respectively . subsequent hydrolysis remove the zirconocene moiety from the product , but the newly formed (sp2-carbon)- BC18F15 linkage remains intact . the resulting product <nUm> and <nUm> formally contain a central methylenecyclopropene framework , but their structural property point to a substantial p-delocalization , that indicates a pronounced participation of an enamino-substituted cyclopropenylium-borate betaine resonance structure . the description of the neutral betaine compound <nUm> and <nUm> a approaching cyclopropenylium cation - type compound that have their counteranion covalently bonded to them , is further supported by the observation of low activation barrier of the rotation around the exocyclic C3-C4 bond [ DG(CCrot) / ( ≠ ) ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 for 17a ] and around the C5-N linkage [ DG(CNrot) / ( ≠ ) ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 for 16a ] . the neutral cyclopropenylium-betaine compound 17a show a carbocation - like chemical reactivity , and insert tert-butyl isocyanide to yield the ring - expanded four - membered carbocyclic product <nUm> . n-pyrrolyllithium ( 1 ) add to BC18F15 to yield [(C4H4N)B(C6F5)3]Li ( 3 ) . the corresponding monoetherate ( 3*OEt2 ) wa characterized by x-ray diffraction and show an e5 coordination of the pyrrolyl moiety to the lithium cation . treatment of <nUm> with ClH in ether lead to H+ addition at a pyrrolyl a-position to yield the neutral dipolar bronsted acid system [(C4H5N)B(C6F5)3] ( 4 ) . the reagent <nUm> can be used to protonate Cp2Zr(CH3)3 to yield [ Cp2Zr(CH3)+(C4H 4N)B-(C6F5)3- ] ( 6 ) and methane . H+ transfer from <nUm> to (butadiene)-zirconocene result in the formation of the (p-allyl)metallocene salt [ (C4H7)ZrCp2+(C4H 4N)B(C6Fs)3- ] ( 8 ) .

A crystal structure determination of <nUm> show two molecule in the unit cell , one in which the (Me3Si)2NSiMe2 group are accommodated in a nearly synperiplanar conformation directly above and below the Cl2Zr group , and one in which these group exhibit a synclinal conformation . the reaction of <nUm> with a mixture of Cl2OS / Cl2O2S lead to the formation of [(e5-C5H4SiMe2Cl] 2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) . the ab initio hartree - fock method ha been utilized to rationalize the conformational preference of racemic ethylene-bridged bis(indenyl) - type zirconocenes in dichloride and cationic methyl form . this group of catalyst is characterized by conformational isomerism due to fluxionality of the ethylene bridge resulting in two distinct orientation of the indenyl ligand , indenyl-forward ( π ) and indenyl-backward ( υ ) . A systematic investigation of the influence of methyl and trialkylsiloxy substitution on the relative stability of π and υ conformation wa performed . for the dichloride catalyst precursor the stability and orientation of the equilibrium structure are determined on the basis of repulsive interaction within the ligand framework . In the cationic methyl intermediate of the olefin polymerization catalytic cycle , the electron - rich indenyl ligand appears to reduce the electron deficiency of the cation by tilting towards the metal . the metallocene alkyne complex [Cp2M(L)(e2-Me3SiC2R)] react with diisobutylaluminium hydride at room temp. by addition of HAl(iBu)2 to yield the heterobimetallic complex [ {Cp2M}(m-e1:e2-RC C SiMe3)(m-H){Al(iBu)2} ] [ {Cp2M} : (e5C5H5)2Ti , r = ph <nUm> , r = SiMe3 <nUm> ; {Cp2M} : (e5-C5H5)2Zr , r = SiMe3 <nUm> ; {Cp2M} : (ebthi)Zr , r = SiMe3 <nUm> ] { ebthi : rac-[1,2ethylene-1,1'-bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl)] } . complex 1-4 were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> investigated by x-ray crystal structure analysis . compound 1-4 were tested a initiator in the ring - opening polymerization of lactones . the result are discussed in comparison to the corresponding monometallic titanocene and zirconocene alkyne complex . the bridging function Me2Si , [(CH2)3(CMe2)2N]B and CH2 have been used to connect two imidazole in the 1,1'-position . the bisimidazolyl compound were treated with BH3 or BEt3 , and the resulting N,N'-bisborane - protected product <nUm> , 3b , 4a , and 5b were characterized by x-ray structure analysis . reaction of 1,1'-bis(4,5-dimethylimidazolyl) methane with BBr3 yielded the macrocyclic dicationic tetraimidazolyl compound <nUm> . the behavior of the N - protected bisimidazoles <nUm> and 3-5 towards deprotonating agent wa investigated and it wa found that 1,1'-bis(3-borane-4,5-dimethylimidazolyl)methane ( 5b ) is deprotonated to give a dianionic dicarbene compound . it reaction with Cp2MCl2 allowed the formation of the corresponding titanocene and zirconocene complex <nUm> and <nUm> , which were characterized by x-ray structure analysis . In <nUm> a 3c,2e B-H-Zr bond is present . the reaction of the mercaptocarboxylic acid HOOC(CH2)nSH ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) with H[AuCl4] followed by treatment with PMe2Ph led to the (phosphane)gold f [Au{S(CH2)nCOOH}(PMe2Ph)] [ n = <nUm> , ( 1 ) <nUm> ( 2 ) ] , which can act a metalloligands towards complex fragment of a second metal . compound <nUm> and <nUm> react with [ cp ° 2ZrMe2 ] ( cp ° = C5EtMe4 ) to give the trinuclear Zr / Au complex [ cp ° 2Zr{K1O-OOC(CH2)n SAu(PMe2Ph)}{K2O , O'-OOC(CH2)n-SAu(PMe2Ph) } ] [ n = <nUm> ( 3 ) , n = <nUm> ( 4 ) ] . complex 1-4 were characterized by 1H , 13C , 31P NMR and IR spectroscopy . the crystal structure of <nUm> show mono- and bidentate coordination of two metalloligands to one zirconocene fragment .

In addition , a single crystal x-ray crystallographic analysis wa performed for complex <nUm> . the metallacyclic zirconocene complex <nUm> wa synthesized by the reaction of the dichloride derivative <nUm> with two equivalent of n-butyllithium . after activation of complex 10-13 and <nUm> with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) they were used for the catalytic polymerization of ethene and propene . bis[(5-hexenyl)cyclopentadienyl]zirconium dichloride ( 3 ) underwent ring - closure olefin metathesis with loss of ethylene when treated with <nUm> mol % of the [ Cl2(PCy3)2Ru = CHPh ] catalyst in refluxing dichloromethane , to yield the large ansa - zirconocene complex [dec-5-ene-1,10-diylbis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)]ZrCl2 ( trans-4 ) . characterization by NMR and by x-ray diffraction revealed that the isolated complex contained a trans-C = C double bond inside the ansa bridge . similarly , bis[(allyl)cyclopentadienyl]ZrCl2 ( 7 ) gave the ansametallocene [but-2-ene-1,4-diylbis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)]zirconium dichloride ( cis-8 ) when treated with the same ruthenium metathesis catalyst ( <nUm> mol % ) under similar condition , except that a cis-C = C double bond wa now found to be present ( shown by NMR and x-ray diffraction ) . the cis-8 complex wa used a a homogeneous ziegler - natta catalyst for ethylene polymerization [ after activation of the metallocene dichloride <nUm> with MAO ( methylalumoxane ) or treatment of the corresponding dimethylmetallocene complex <nUm> with BC18F15 ] . complex <nUm> wa also converted into a mixture of ( scis- and s-trans-e4-butadiene)-ansa-metallocene complex ( s-cis-15 / s-trans-15 = <nUm> : <nUm> ) by treatment with (butadiene)-magnesium . the C = C double bond of cis-8 could be hydroborated with 9-BBN or with the H-B(C6F5)2 reagent . Li+[B(C6F5)4-] added to cis-8 to yield an interesting solid - state chain structure in which the [Zr]Cl2 unit and the o- / mF pair of two -C6F5 group were found to be in contact with the central lithium cation in a distorted octahedral coordination environment ( a shown by x-ray diffraction ) . (Butadiene)zirconocene ( s-trans- / s-cis-1 equilibrium mixture ) reacts with the imine MeN = CHPh ( 7a ) to form the <nUm> : <nUm> carbon-coupling product [ kN-MeN-CHPh-CH2-e3- (CHCHCH2)]ZrCp2 ( 8a ) . the x-ray crystal structure analysis of 8a revealed a metallacyclic structure featuring a distorted p-allyl moiety and a planar - tricoordinate nitrogen atom . only one of the two possible diastereoisomers is found in the crystal ( cis-8a ) a well a in solution . treatment of <nUm> with the more bulky aldimine PhCH2N = CHPh ( 7b ) selectively gave the corresponding <nUm> : <nUm> addition product trans-8b . ketimines PhCH2N = C5H8 ( 7c ) , HN = CPh2 ( 7d ) , or d1-2-methylpyrroline ( 7e ) also reacted selectively with (butadiene)zirconocene to yield the analogous metallacyclic C-C coupling product 8c-e . treatment of 8e with BC18F15 proceeded cleanly by abstraction of a hydride anion from the carbon atom α to the nitrogen atom to form the intramolecularly coordinated imine product 10a { with the [HB(C6F5)3-] anion } . similarly , Ph3C+ abstract a hydride ion from 8e to yield 10b { isolated with the [B(C6H5)4-] anion } . proton addition from HNR3+ reagent take place selectively at the Zr - amido nitrogen atom of the complex 8a or 8d to yield the substituted (p-allyl)zirconocene cation complex <nUm> or <nUm> , respectively . the cationic complex <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> polymerize ethene at room temperature / <nUm> bar of ethene with moderate catalytic activity . ( the cross-conjugated 1,1-diethynylethylene derivative 8b-10b were prepared from the corresponding bromide <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> by sonogashira coupling with trimethylsilylethyne and hydrolysis of the TMS-protected intermediate thus formed . coupling of the tetrabromide <nUm> with (trimethylsilylethynyl)magnesium bromide in the presence of 1,3-[bis(diphenylphosphanyl)propane] nickel (II) chloride yielded the protected tetraalkyne <nUm> , from which the 7,7,8,8-tetraethynyl-tetrahydro-p-quinodimethane <nUm> wa liberated by fluoride treatment . although <nUm> is a highly unstable cross-conjugated hydrocarbon , it could be converted into it tetraphenyl derivative by sonogashira coupling with phenyl iodide . both <nUm> and the corresponding tetraphenyl derivative were oxidized to the 7,7,8,8-tetraethynyl-dihydro-p-quinodimethane derivative <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively , on treatment with DDQ in dioxane . further dehydrogenation of <nUm> to <nUm> failed , however . alkylation of 9b with trimethylaluminium in the presence of zirconocene dichloride a catalyst yielded the semicyclic dendralene <nUm> , which on irradiation isomerized to the tricyclic diene <nUm> , presumably via the bicyclobutane <nUm> and a vinylcyclopropane rearrangement . hydration of 9b furnished <nUm> and <nUm> , the primary hydration product <nUm> either undergoing ketene elimination ( formation of <nUm> ) or a 1,5-hydrogen shift reaction ( to <nUm> ) from it tautomer <nUm> . analogously , the still more highly unsaturated derivative <nUm> wa alkylated to give the [5]dendralene derivative <nUm> and hydrated to give a mixture of the b-diketones <nUm> and <nUm> , the latter being produced from <nUm> by 1,2-methyl migration . the thermal cyclization of 10b to the homoacepentalene derivative <nUm> failed . A direct preparation of a-amino ketone derivative through treatment of acylzirconocene chloride with n-benzylideneaniline derivative , in which acylzirconocene chloride react a " unmasked " acyl anion donor , wa carried out under Yb(OTf)3 / TMSOTf - catalyzed condition . the same reaction were also carried out with the use of bronsted acid a catalyst in place of Yb(OTf)3 / TMSOTf . the operationally simple three - component reaction with aldehyde , aniline , and acylzirconocene chloride affords a-amino ketone derivative essentially in the absence of a catalyst . [Cp'2ZrCl(PHTipp)] ( 1 ) ( cp' = e5-C5MeH4 , tipp = 2,4,6-Pr3iC6H2 ) reacts with methyl formate with insertion and substitution to give [Cp'2ZrCl{OCH(PHTipp)2}] ( 2 ) . <nUm> wa characterized spectroscopically ( 1H , 31P NMR , IR , MS ) and by x-ray structure determination . only the meso-trans isomer is present in the solid state . the reaction of [e5-Cp2ZrCl2] ( cp = e5-C5H5 ) with [K(THF)n][N(PPh2)2] ( n = <nUm> - <nUm> ) and K[CH(PPh2NSiMe3)2] are reported the first reaction led to the monoamido complex [e5-Cp2Zr(Cl)N(PPh2)2] in which the { (Ph2P)2 N}- ligand - via a phosphorous and the nitrogen atom - is coordinated to the zirconium atom in a chelating ( e2 ) fashion . reaction of the potassium methanide compound , K{CH(PPh2NSiMe3)2} with zirconocene dichloride yield the carbene - like mono cyclopentadienyl complex [ e5-CpZr(Cl){C(PPh2NSiMe3) <nUm> } ] . the complex is formed by a salt metathesis and concomitant a cyclopentadiene extrusion . cyclopentadiene and metallocenes , typically zirconocene dichloride , are suitable substrate for multiple arylations with aryl bromide in palladium - catalyzed reaction . thus , various aryl bromide bearing either an electron - donating or an electron - withdrawing substituent can react with these substrate to afford the corresponding 1,2,3,4,5-pentaaryl-1,3-cyclopentadienes in a single preparative step . derivative of cyclopentadiene , including di-and trisubstituted cyclopentadienes , and indene are arylated in a similar fashion . the bridged , C1 - symmetric , single - component zirconocene [Zr{(Cp)-(Ind)CMe2}(Me)(thf)](BPh4) ( ind = indenyl , cp = cyclopentadienyl ) polymerises methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) selectively to isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) without further cocatalysts or activator . to elucidate the stereoselective step of the polymerisation of MMA by using this catalyst we studied the propagation step occurring with the derivative [ Zr{(Cp)(Ind)CH2}-{-O-C(OMe) = C(Me)(Et)}(MMA)]+ by ab initio calculation at the hartree - Fock(HF) level of theory . after the initiation step , which consumes the first two MMA molecule , each new catalytic cycle begin with the stereoselective addition of a new MMA molecule at the indenyl side of the zirconocene fragment . At the same time the enolate ring undergoes a stereoselective inplane ring shift to the side opposite to the indenyl ring . these finding are used to postulate a mechanism for the polymerisation that explains the stereoselective synthesis of isotactic PMMA . A series of silyl-terminated diynes of varying length and substitution pattern have been prepared . these diynes undergo zirconocene coupling with selective formation of trimeric macrocycles from linear alkyne , while nonlinear diynes give cyclodimeric product . the length of the linear diynes can be increased for the preparation of macrocycles with large nanoscale cavity . reaction of the zirconium - containing macrocycles with acid result in the synthesis of metal - free cyclophanes . all of these macrocycles were prepared in multigram quantity , in the absence of high - dilution condition , to give product in > <nUm> % yield that are easily purified a crystalline solid . alkenyl zirconocene complex are readily obtained by diverse process including hydrozirconation , carbozirconation , and cyclozirconation of alkyne , transmetalations , and bond insertion . In combination with other metal , novel reaction manifold can emerge and provide access to useful synthetic building block . both catalytic asymmetric process and highly diastereoselective multicomponent transformation that involve the formation of three or more new carbon-carbon bond are feasible . this concept paper summarizes the current state of the art and opportunity for future reaction discovery in this field of research , with particular emphasis on synergistic effect of bimetallic combination of zirconocenes and zinc . one - pot procedure for the preparation of highly substituted indene , tetrahydroindenes , and cyclopentadienes have been developed by using a combination of zirconocene - mediated C-C - bond - forming reaction with lewis acid mediated activation of carbonyl group . the carbonyl group of aldehyde were deoxygenated in the reaction and behaved formally a a one-carbon unit . A variety of lewis acid were checked and showed different reactivity in this reaction . conversion of a racemic mixture of a chiral allene into a single enantiomer requires selective inversion of the absolute configuration of one specie . this can be accomplished a shown in equation ( 1 ) : the enantiopure imido complex <nUm> reacts more rapidly with one enantiomer of chiral 1,3-disubstituted allenes , and more slowly with the other , so a deficiency of <nUm> give an efficient kinetic resolution . for equimolar amount of <nUm> and a 1,3-disubstituted allene , both allene enantiomer are transformed into the same metallacycle . the enantioenriched allene , which now ha the same configuration a the fast reacting enantiomer , is released in high yield and high ee recovery upon treatment of the metallacycle with 1,2-propadiene . narrow band gap and high electron affinity are associated with the new oligomers containing thiophene-1-oxide and thiophene-dioxide that have been prepared by zirconocene coupling method . A series of oligomers with 3-11 ring ( x = 2H , S , and S( = 0)2 ; see picture ) allow the electronic property of conjugated chain to be investigated . of particular note is that the le electronic - withdrawing sulfoxide group result in the narrowest band gap . cleavage of the aldehyde C = O bond take place in the zirconocene- and AlCl3 - mediated cyclization of two molecule of an alkyne with an aldehyde to afford cyclopentadiene derivative [ eq. ( 1 ) ] . only one of the possible double - bond isomer is formed . the same method can also be used to couple two different alkyne with an aldehyde . In a single experiment , several supported zirconocene catalyst for a-olefin polymerization can be evaluated by a combinatorial concept . polyethylene particle produced by fluorescent dye tagged catalyst can be easily identified by their emission color , separated , and characterized ( see fluorescence microscope image ) . none the template - controlled synthesis of π ligand offer new method for synthesizing endohedral metallocenophanes . this strategy allows the assembly of previously inaccessible bridged metallocenes , for example , the doubly bridged cobaltocenes <nUm> , prepared from <nUm> , n = <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> . multiply metalated oligosilanes : treatment of bridged bis[tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl] compound with two equivalent of potassium tert-butoxide lead to the formation of 1,3- and 1,4-dipotassium silanes [ eq. ( 1 ) ] . reaction of the latter with zirconocene dichloride and hafnocene dichloride , respectively , give the corresponding metallacyclopentasilanes . how do alumoxane activator activate ? reaction ( 1 ) may help to answer this question . the product of this reaction is a zirconocene alkyl cation ( cp* = C5Me5 ) with it methylated boralumoxane anion . the structure of this compound is in accord with barron 's " latent lewis acidity " concept for alumoxane activator . the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) in toluene with Cp2ZrMe2 ( 1 ) - Ph3C+B(C6 F5)4- ( 4 ) a initiating system wa kinetically investigated . this system can be regarded a a combination of the system described by collins and soga . only if the ratio of <nUm> / <nUm> wa larger than <nUm> , monomer conversion of more than <nUm> % and polymer with number - average molecular weight higher than <nUm> <nUm> and polydispersities <nUm> - <nUm> were obtained . from a kinetic analysis of time - conversion curve using the software package predici , it can be deduced that the mechanism is consistent with that proposed by collins et al. however , the mechanism ha to be extended by incorporating a first - order termination reaction of the active specie . rate coefficient of all elementary reaction were determined from time - conversion curve . the kinetic investigation were accompanied by ab initio calculation , which support the assumed kinetic model . combined system including diphenylzinc , Ph2Zn , a metallocene , and methylaluminoxane , MAO , have been employed to initiate styrene polymerization . these initiator system have been also used to initiate the copolymerization of styrene with p-alkylsubstituted styrene and with a-olefins . both polymerization and copolymerization process depend on the nature of the metallocene included in the initiator system , the presence of Ph2Zn , the temperature and the solvent used . titanocenes produced syndiotactic polystyrene , s-PS , while zirconocenes gave atactic polystyrene , a-PS , with a certain content , le the <nUm> % of s-PS . for copolymerizations the conversion to polymer wa also influenced by the comonomer nature and it molar proportion in the initial feed , a well a the sort of metallocene , titanocene or zirconocene included . sterically hindered olefin like norbornene , dimethanooctahydronaphthalene ( DMON ) , 4-methylpentene , and 3-methylbutene can be copolymerised with ethene by metallocene / MAO catalyst . different C2- , cs- and C1 - symmetric and meso-zirconocenes were used . only isolated and alternating norbornene sequence but no norbornene block are formed by substituted [Me2C(Cp-R)(Flu)]ZrCl2 catalyst . the alternating microstructure lead to melting point up to <nUm> ° C for ethene - norbornene copolymer and up to <nUm> ° C for the semi ycrystalline alternating copolymer of ethene and DMON . other sterically hindered olefin such a 3-methylpentene build more blocky structure with high glass transition temperature . the mechanism for the insertion reaction of the different catalyst is discussed . the combination of the copolymerisation ability and vinyl end group selectivity of siloxy substitution of ethylene-bridged bis(indenyl) zirconium dichloride suggest these catalyst a potential one for the production of polyethylene containing small amount of long chain branching . the role of the polymerisation condition with these highly active catalyst can clearly be seen . furthermore low content of multiple branch may occur , even though the probability of attaching several macromonomers into one chain is low . the effect on melt rheological behaviour depends on both the amount of long chain branching and the length of the branch . moreover the position of the siloxy group is very important . polymer synthesized with catalyst , where the siloxy group is in position <nUm> , give peculiar rheological behaviour resembling cross-linked network although the polymer are completely soluble . the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) with the neutral enolate cp 2ZrMe[OC(OMe) = CMe <nUm> ] in the absence and in the presence of zirconocene cation cp 2ZrMe + to bypass the rate- limited initiation of the system wa investigated . only by itself the enolate is not active in polymerization , but a soon a the reaction system contains the cation MMA is quantitatively converted into syndiotactic - rich PMMA with high molecular weight ( m n > <nUm> <nUm> g mol <nUm> ) and very narrow molecular weight distribution ( m w / m n < <nUm> ) . the rate of polymerization wa found to be first order reffering to the neutral enolate and also reffering to the cation . rate coefficents of all elementary reaction were determined and compared to those received by the kinetic investigation of the polymerization using the initiator system cp 2ZrMe <nUm> / ph 3CB ( C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> . the agreement of both set of calculated coefficient is satisfying . these result confirm that the mechanism of collins et al. is suitable to describe the property of the polymerization process . the copolymerization of propene with small amount of ethene , catalyzed by tetrahydroindenyl zirconocenes such a [En(H4Ind)2]ZrCl22 or [Me2Si(H4Ind)2]ZrCl2 and MAO in liquid propene produce polymer with much higher activity and molecular weight than the homopolymerization of propene . the normal bisindenyl complex doe n't present such difference . the investigation of the microstructure show for the tetrahydroindenyl catalyst that after a 2,1-insertion of a propene unit the system is in a sleeping state and can be activated when an ethene unit is inserted . In this case these catalyst become faster than the ansa bis-indenyl catalyst . an active catalyst for the copolymerization of ethene and norbornene is the more temperature stable [Me3PhPen(Flu)]ZrCl2 . this catalyst produce atactic copolymer with high molecular weight of ' over <nUm> <nUm> g / mol at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> mol % of norbornene content . A series of asymmetric ansa - zirconocene dichloride were investigated in propene polymerization reaction with respect to monomer concentration and polymerization temperature . the two different coordination side of these " dual - side " catalyst allow a precise control of the total amount of randomly distributed isolated stereoerrors along the isotactic polymer chain leading to bulk property which can be adjusted from flexible , semicrystalline to excellent thermoplastic elastic . the obtained homopolypropenes have a great potential to come into competition with commercialized copolymer for possible industrial application . In this paper , we investigate different route to lower drastically the amount of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) required to activate racEt(Ind)2ZrX2 catalyst towards olefin polymerization . A first approach consists in replacing Cl ligand by more easily extractable x group such a me , CH2Ph or NMe2 group . A second method focus on the preparation of TMA - depleted MAO either by pumping off TMA from commercial MAO or by exploring new synthetic source to MAO via non-hydrolytic process such a the reaction of TMA with benzophenone . both method allowed u to produce polyolefins with a maximal catalytic activity for AI / Zr ratio not exceeding <nUm> , i.e. ratio <nUm> time lower than those required in the presence of commercial MAO . Meso-[Me2Si(2-Me-4,6-iPr2Ind)2 Cl2Zr wa synthesized in a pure form and used a catalyst for the copolymerization of ethene and a-olefins . the result are compared with polymer obtained by C1 - symmetric metallocenes and constrained geometry catalyst . the activity of the meso form is remarkable high and reach more than <nUm> <nUm> kg polymer / mol zr*h . the ligand structure ha large influence on the incorporation of 1-octene forming thermoplastic ( LLDPE ) and thermoplastic elastomer ( POE ) . this work examines a polymerisation catalyst based on zirconocene with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) a a cocatalyst on silica surface . calculation were carried out using the atom superposition and electron delocalisation method ( ASED-MO ) considering the ( 111 ) and ( 100 ) silica plane , both completely and partially hydrated . our result suggest the production of a cationic zirconocene a a final step for the active site formation for ( 111 ) silica plane , occurring preferentially on partially hydrated silica . on the contrary this may not be possible for the ( 100 ) plane resulting in this case in the formation of a MAO - zirconocene complex a a final and most stable state . this work present a proposal for a mechanism of olefin polymerization using metallocenes , taking into account the effect of the counter ion , solvent , and olefin . the ystenes mechanism is also evaluated for the different symmetry of zirconocenes and for soluble and supported catalyst . the mechanism is related to experimental evidence and analyzed taking into account publisbed result about polymer characterization , kinetic evidence , and other experimental fact . the model try to give a reasonable explanation for the different dependency of the kinetics on the monomer : between <nUm> and <nUm> for Cs and C2 catalyst and <nUm> for c2v . bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconocene dimethyl ( Cp2ZrMe2 ) combined with triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] ) wa brought into contact with a suspension of <nUm> % cross-linked poly(4-vinylpyridine) to give a new type of polymer - supported cationic zirconocene catalyst . the resulting polymer - supported catalyst system combined with Al(i-Bu3) showed markedly high activity for ethylene polymerization in even a non-polar solvent like hexane at 25-60 ° C and [Al] / [Zr] molar ratio 40-200 . by the analysis of Zr content of the hexane solution , it wa found that no Zr wa detected in the solution , i.e. no leaching of the cationic catalyst into the hexane medium . the catalytic activity wa found to increase with an increase of polymerization temperature and showed the highest at [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> . the molecular weight , crystalline melting temperature , crystallinity , and bulk density of polyethylene formed were higher than those of the polymer obtained from the homogeneous system . the cationic bridged zirconocene complex [iPr(Cp)(Ind)Zr(Me)(THF)][BPh4] ( 1-BPh4 ) wa synthesized . polymerization of methyl methacrylate with 1-BPh4 in CCl2H2 at temperature between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C led to the formation of isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate ) . the low polydispersity index of the polymer obtained and a successful two step polymerization of methyl methacrylate with 1-BPh4 are hint towards a living polymerization mechanism . 1H and 13C NMR analysis revealed an enantiomorphic site - controlled mechanism for the formation of isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate ) . communication : using two different zirconocene / MAO catalyst system , propene wa copolymerized with the comonomers 2-(9-decene-1-yl)-1,3-oxazoline and 2-(4-(10-undecene-1-oxo)phenyl)-1,3-oxazoline , respectively . the catalyst used were rac-Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 and rac-Me2:Si[2-Me-4 , 5-BenzInd]2ZrCl2 . up to <nUm> mol- % oxazoline could be incorporated into polypropene . oxazoline content , molecular weight , degree of isotacticity and melting behavior were dependent on the catalyst system , comonomer structure and comonomer concentration in the feed . ethylene wa polymerized with cycloalkylidene-bridged cyclopentadienyl metallocene catalyst 1-9 in the presence of methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) a the cocatalyst . unlike the normal titanocene catalyst , the cycloalkylidene-bridged cyclopentadienyl titanocene catalyst show much higher activity than the corresponding zirconocene and hafnocene catalyst and show the highest activity at higher temperature . this indicates that the cycloalkylidene-bridged cyclopentadienyl titanocene system is very thermally stable and maybe a very promising catalyst system for industrial application . C2 - symmetric zirconocenes activated by methylaluminoxane were utilized a catalyst in the polymerization of 1,3-diolefins . the result indicate that the most crowded catalytic precursor rac[CH2(3-tertbutyl-1-indenyl)2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) is also the most active one , giving 1,4-polymerization of 1,3-butadiene and (Z)-1,3-pentadiene and 1,2-polymerization of (E)-1,3-pentadiene and 4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene . probably , the different behavior of <nUm> with respect to other C2 - symmetric zirconocenes utilized is due to the different stability of the bond between the last inserted monomer unit and the metal , a well a to the coordination of incoming monomer . In this review , various synthetic and structural aspect of methylaluminoxane and the elementary process involved in olefin polymerization , a identified by various spectroscopic technique , are detailed . various boron - based counterions and their interaction with metal - locenium cation are discussed . A comparison between MAO and boron - based activator in term of catalytic activity and polymer characteristic is made . finally , the use of the above system in the polymerization of cationically polymerizable monomer and acrylate is discussed . we report the first successful block copolymerization of ethylene and methyl methacrylate using a zirconocene - based catalyst system . the catalyst is generated in situ from Me2C(Cp)(Ind)ZrMe2 and BC18F15 in toluene . block copolymerization is achieved via the sequential addition of the monomer , starting with ethylene . the composition of the block copolymer is shown to be dependent on the time allowed for ethylene polymerization . the solubility of the resulting polymer , NMR data and GPC measurement are discussed , and a polymerization mechanism is proposed . the kinetics of the ethylene-norbornene copolymerization , catalyzed by rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO , <nUm> % rac / <nUm> % meso-Et(4,7-Me2Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO and rac-H2C(3-tert-BuInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO wa followed by sampling from the reaction mixture at fixed time interval . catalyst activity , copolymer composition and molar mass were studied a a function of time . the polymer showed an unusually low polydispersity and a significant increase in their molar mass with time , suggesting a quasi-living polymerization . this work present a theoretical and experimental study of the active site formation in the system EtInd2ZrCl2 / MAO . result about the effect of additive a a lewis acid ( AlCl3 ) or a lewis base ( EB ) are also anaylzed . the theoretical study take into account all the known step in the active site formation : alkylation of zirconocene , formation of a polarized complex metallocene : MAO , formation of a contact ion pair and finally a solvent separated ion pair . other reaction of the zirconocene with other aluminum alkyl ( AlCl3 and AlMe3 ) are also presented and studied . UV - vi experimental result of the additive effect are reported and explained taking into account the theoretical result . A short review of our result and others is presented to complete and discus the idea . the most probable site are loosened contact ion pair , not the solvent separated ion pair . the central purpose of this work is to develop an to attach the metallocene to a support without diminishing it catalytic activity . this article describes several method to prepare supported EtInd2ZrCl2 ( EBI ) on MAO / O2Si , varying the washing step duration and washing step temperature . the best method is the one that support <nUm> % Zr on MAO / O2Si with a final content of Al near <nUm> % . it seems that this method combine high efficiency in MAO usage at the preparation step and high activity in propylene polymerization . the activity of the supported catalyst EBI / MAO / O2Si decrease to the third of the soluble catalyst EBI / MAO with the same Al / Zr molar ratio . Zr con tent higher than <nUm> % produce catalyst with lower productivity . probably , a MAO coverage in O2Si that is higher than a monolayer is not useful in order to stabilize the zirconocene on the MASO / O2Si support . this paper report the kinetics of the supported catalyst and a discussion about the shape of the curve and the stability of the catalyst is appended . the molecular weight of the poly(propylene) obtained with supported catalyst increase , especially for the best preparation , comparing it with material obtained with the soluble one . the regioregularity of poly(propylene) increase when a lewis base ( ethyl benzoate-E.B . ) is added a external additive to the system EBI / MAO / O2Si and the activity of the supported catalyst is improved . this paper report the effect of co- and non-copolymerizable lewis base in propylene polymerization with the soluble system EtInd2ZrCl2 / MAO . with non-copolymerizable lewis base , the activity and the molar mass of poly(propylene) are diminished . this result is unusual because there is agreement about the cationic nature of the active site in zirconocene / MAO system and the effect of a lewis base must be to decrease the termination constant versus the propagation constant , considering the diminished electrophilicity of Zr . In the case of copolymerizable lewis base , the negative effect on activity is higher . an explanation of the data is given , with a new model of lewis base / cationic Zr interaction , taking account of recent report about the structure of active site . ethylene wa polymerized using a combination of Ni(a-diimine)Cl2 ( 1 ) ( a-diimine = 1,4-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)acenaphthenediimine ) and rac-ethylene bis(IndH4)ZrCl2 ( 2 ) ( IndH4 = 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-ns-indenyl ) compound , activated with methylaluminoxane in toluene . the polymerization were performed at three different temperature ( <nUm> . 30. and <nUm> ° C ) , and the effect of varying the zirconium loading molar fraction ( xZr ) wa monitored . the polymerization run carried out of <nUm> and <nUm> ° C show that the productivity increase linearly with xZr . on the other hand , at <nUm> ° C the productivity reach a maximum of <nUm> × <nUm> kg of PE / mol[M]*h for xZr = <nUm> , indicating a non-linear correlation between the productivity and xZr . the polyethylene characteristic have been evaluated by mean of differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) , and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . the PE produced at <nUm> and <nUm> ° C showed monomodal molecular weight distribution with narrow polydispersities . At higher temperature ( <nUm> ° C ) , using xZr = <nUm> , two different polyethylene were produced ; an amorphous rubbery PE with mw of <nUm> × <nUm> g*mol-1 and a linear high density PE with mw of <nUm> × <nUm> g*mol-1 . DSC thermogram of the PE obtained at <nUm> ° C ( xZr = <nUm> - <nUm> ) showed the presence of two melting point corresponding to branched and linear PE , indicating a low compatibility between the phase . by SEM it wa observed that the branched polyethylene obtained at <nUm> ° C form very small aggregate dispersed in the linear polyethylene matrix , but the polymer obtained at <nUm> ° C form larger particle which show low compatibility with the linear polyethylene . phenol - functionalized polyethylene were prepared by copolymerization of ethylene with 4-allylanisole in the presence of metallocene / MAO catalysis , followed by demethylation . anisole group incorporated in polyethylene main chain were quantitatively converted to phenol functional group by treating the copolymer with AlCl3 . the copolymerization of ethylene with 4-allylanisole revealed that the bridged metallocene catalyst seemed to favor the incorporation of the polar comonomer compared to the hindered metallocene catalyst . increase of the MAO concentration markedly enhanced the activity of the catalyst , but it diminished the incorporation of the polar comonomer . the end group analysis of the copolymer showed that chain transfer to aluminium occured more frequently than other chain transfer reaction . detail of the preparation and polymerization behavior of two chiral zirconocene catalyst are presented . the result of experimental and molecular - mechanic evaluation of their stereoselectivity with respect to liquid - propene polymerization are compared with those of a related catalyst system . the elastic property of the obtained amorphous poly(propylene) , due to the presence of small g-form crystallite , are compared with those of a highmolecular weight atactic poly(propylene) obtained in the presence of a c2v catalyst . propylene polymerization wa conducted with the Cp2ZrHCl / BC18F15 / [tBuNSiMe2Flu]TiMe2 catalyst system with AlOct3 a a scavenger at <nUm> ° C . the polymer obtained displayed a bimodal molar mass distribution . it could be confirmed that the polymer with higher mn wa produced from Zr active site and the polymer with lower mn resulted from Ti active site . In both fraction , mn wa increased linearly with increasing polymerization time . the MWD ( mw / mn ) value of each fraction were around <nUm> . thus , it could be said that propylene polymerization proceeded in a living manner even with zirconocene active specie by using the mixed metallocene system . the living like polymerization of propylene with Cp2ZrMe2 / BC18F15 / Cp*TiCl3 wa also demonstrated at <nUm> ° C . under the reaction between carbon monoxide ( CO ) and this living polypropylene ( PP ) at <nUm> ° C , it could be found that CO wa quantitatively incorporated into living PP . propylene polymerization wa conducted with CS symmetric (Ph2C)CpFluZrCl2 / B(C6 F5)3 / cp* TiMe3 system using AlOct3 a a scavenger at <nUm> ° C . the polymer produced wa consisted by two kind of fraction ; i.e. , hexane soluble ( atactic ) fraction and hexane insoluble fraction . the insoluble polymer had highly syndiotactic structure , indicating that the polymer wa produced from CS symmetric zirconocene . mu 's increased linearly with increasing polymer yield , although the activity wa low . thus , it could be said that syndiospecific polymerization of propylene proceeded in a living like manner with CS symmetric zirconocene active specie by using the mixed metallocene system . and by the reaction of the syndiotactic poly(propylene) chain end with carbon monoxide ( CO ) , it could be found that CO wa quantitatively incorporated into the syndioPP-Zr chain end . the polymerization of 1-hexene with the catalyst system Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO and Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 / MAO is investigated in order to elucidate the nature of the active specie in zirconocene / MAO catalyzed polymerization . varying monomer concentration and monomer conversion doe not result in any unexpected behavior . however , changing catalyst and cocatalyst concentration lead to broadened , or even bimodal , molecular weight distribution under certain reaction condition . these result may be interpreted in term of a coexistence of two active specie with different rate of propagation and of termination . the effect of polymerization temperature on the polymerization of 1-hexene with the catalyst system Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO , Me2SiCp2ZrCl2 / MAO , EtInd2ZrCl2 / MAO , Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 / MAO and 1PrCpFluZrCl2 / MAO is investigated in this paper . the molecular weight and the molecular weight distribution of poly(1-hexene) provide experimental evidence for a deviation from single - site behavior at certain polymerization temperature , depending on the catalyst system . experimental result are interpreted in term of different active specie prevailing at different polymerization temperature , and coexisting under certain reaction condition . A series of Cp'(C5H5)ZrCl2 and Cp2'ZrCl2 precatalysts ( cp' = C5HMe4 , C4Me4P , C5Me5 , C5H4tBu , C5H3-1,3-tBu2 , C5H2-1,2,4tBu3 ) together with C10Cl2H10Zr wa used for the directed oligomerization of propene and 1-hexene in comparative experiment . oligomer characterization wa carried out by 1H NMR , SEC ( GPC ) , MALDI - TOF , MS , cryoscopy and raman spectroscopy . from 1H NMR the nature and relative ratio of the double - bond end group is determined together with Mn if every oligomer molecule contains such a double bond ( from b-hydrogen elimination ) are found . from 1H NMR and MALDI - TOF MS also vinyl end group ( from b-methyl elimination ) are observed in the case of oligopropenes with (C4Me4P)-(C5H5)ZrCl2 and with the symmetrical methyl containing Cp2'ZrCl2 pre-catalyst . the vinylidene / vinyl ratio depends on the ligand and increase from C5HMe4 ( <nUm> / <nUm> ) over C4Me4P ( <nUm> / <nUm> ) to C5Me5 ( <nUm> / <nUm> ) . A comparison of Mn from 1H NMR and SEC together with MALDI - TOF MS show that the phospholyl-zirconocenes and (C5HMe4)2ZrCl2 also exhibit chain transfer to aluminium , thereby giving saturated oligomers . copolymerization of ethylene and cyclopentene ( CPE ) wa carried out with various non-bridge and bridged zirconocene catalyst using methylaluminoxane a a cocatalyst . non-bridged metallocene catalyst effected ethylene homopolymerization without copolymerization . on the other hand , bridged zirconocene catalyst produced copolymer containing cis-1,2-cyclopentane unit . among the used catalyst , rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride [Et(Ind)2ZrCl2] gave copolymer containing the highest amount of CPE unit by 1,2-insertion of 1,3-insertion . temperature - rising elution fractionation of the copolymer using 1,2-dichlorobenzene a a solvent showed a broad distribution of copolymer composition in copolymer obtained by specific zirconocene catalyst . A series of sila - bridged dinuclear zirconocenes [ E(C5H4)2[Cp'ZrCl2]2 ( Cp'C5H5 , e = Me2Si ( 1 ) Me2SiSiMe2 ( 2 ) , Me2SiOSiMe2 ( 3 ) , Me2SiOSiMe2OSiMe2 ( 4 ) Cp'C5HME4 , e = Me2SiOSiMe2 ( 5 ) , Me2SiOSiMe2OSiMe2 ( 6 ) ) have been synthesized . these complex have been studied a catalyst for ethylene polymerizationin the presence of MAO . polymerization result indicated that the polymerization activity of the zirconocenes increased a the bridging ligand became longer for the same type of bridging ligand . complex <nUm> , holding trisiloxane bridging , exhibited greater activity than the mononuclear zirconocene [Cp2ZrCl2] . all the siloxane - bridged dinuclear zirconocenes showed the highest activity than at higher temperature ( <nUm> or <nUm> ° C ) in contrast to the corresponding siloxane - bridged dinuclear cyclopentadienyl and indenyl zirconocenes which showed a maximum activity at <nUm> ° C . the molecular weight of polyethylene with <nUm> wa very high at low temperature ( <nUm> × <nUm> g · mol at <nUm> ° C ) but decreased significantly with increasing temperature . the molecular weight distribution obtained for polyethylene were similar with the mononuclear metallocene catalyst at low temperature . the tetramethylcyclopentadienyl complex <nUm> and <nUm> showed lower polymerization activity than the corresponding cyclopentadienyl complex <nUm> and <nUm> a a result of steric effect . the relationship between structure and catalytic property of catalyst ha been discussed . the solvent effect observed in propene / 1-hexene copolymerizations performed with the isospecific catalyst rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO is studied . A range of solvent with increasing donor character and steric hindrance ha been tested , and their effect on copolymer yield , composition , and microstructure ha been thoroughly analyzed . our result demonstrate that the solvent can have a significant influence on the comonomer reactivity , even though the solvent polarity is not the relevant factor . At the same comonomer composition in solution , polymerization carried out in coordinating solvent ( e. g. , aromatic solvent ) , lead to the formation of product with considerably decreased content of 1-hexene . the reuced incorporation of the higher a-olifen is explained in term of competition between the nucleophilic medium and the olefin monomer for coordination to the active polymerization site . these result give u valuable information regarding the mechanism of polymerization at the active center . copolymerization of ethylene and 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) wa carried out with non-bridged or bridged zirconocene catalyst using methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) a a cocatalyst . the resulting copolymer were extracted with boiling o-dichlorobenzene ( ODCB ) to fractionate into soluble and insoluble part . the ligand structure of zirconocenes , the feed ratio of HD , and the catalyst concentration strongly affected the copolymer composition . In the copolymerization with non-bridged zirconocene catalyst , the amount of boiling ODCB - soluble part decreased with increasing HD content in the copolymer . on the other hand , with bridged zirconocene catalyst , it increased with increasing HD content in the copolymer . the bridged zirconocene catalyst were apt to take in more HD than non-bridged catalyst . effect of catalyst concentration wa investigated in relation to crosslinking reaction . temperature - rising elution fractionation ( TREF ) of the boiling ODCB - soluble part wa conducted to show the occurrence of heterogenous composition in copolymer obtained with some specific zirconocene catalyst . three series of novel unbridged bicyclic cyclopentadienyl zirconium complex , containing six- , seven- and eight - membered saturated ring fused to the cyclopentadienyl unit and bearing different substituents ( -H , -CH3 , -Ph ) in position <nUm> , were used in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) for the polymerization of propene at different temperature . all the catalyst have been shown to be active , the lowest activity being observed with the eight - membered ring system . with most catalyst the polymer obtained are fully atactic when the polymerization are conducted at <nUm> ° C , and become partially isotactic at lower temperature . the 13C NMR analysis show that in one case , that is , when the seven - membered ring is associated with the phenyl substituent in position <nUm> , a preponderance of the isotactic heptad in the methyl region of 13C NMR spectrum is observed , which allows u to hypothesize the formation of stereoblocks . the copolymerization of propene with ethene in feed concentration up to <nUm> mol- % ethene wa investigated in dependence on catalyst substitution , activation and process condition . polymerization reaction were performed using rac-[ethylene-bis(e5-1-indenyl)]ZrCl2 ( 1a ) , [bis(e5-1-indenyl)dimethylsilane]ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , and [bis(e5-1-(2-methylindenyl))dimethylsilane]ZrCl2 ( 3a ) after MAO- and rac-[ethylene-bis(e5-1-indenyl)]Zr(CH3)2 ( 1b ) a well a [bis-(e5-1-(2-methylindenyl))dimethylsilane]Zr CH3 ( 3b ) after borate - activation . A detailed study of the polymerization kinetics of the different metallocene catalyst wa performed by using an autoclave system that allowed to follow the change in concentration of propene and ethene in the gas and in the liquid phase , even for the first minute of the polymerization experiment . it is known that 2-methyl substitution retard the rate of chain transfer to propene monomer , leading to increased molecular weight of the resulting homopolypropenes . however , the catalyst system 3a / MAO , bearing a CH3 - substituent in 2,2'-position of the indenyl moiety , show a significant decline of the molecular mass of propene - ethene copolymer by rising the ethene concentration , while catalyst 1a and <nUm> , having no methyl substitution , give a distinct increase of molecular weight . our investigation show that the observed molecular weight decline is independent of the process condition , but it depends clearly on the catalyst substitution and , in some case , on the activation process . b-Hydride elimination to the Zr(IV) - center is the dominating chain termination process for metallocene catalyst bearing methyl group in the 2,2'-position . chain termination via transfer to monomer and to aluminum are the preferred termination mechanism for complex lacking the CH3 substituents . copolymerizations of ethylene and 1,7-octadiene ( OD ) and 1,9-decadiene ( DD ) were investigated with various non-bridged and bridged zirconocene catalyst using methylisobutylaluminoxane a a cocatalyst . the resulting copolymer were extracted with boiling o-dichlorobenzene ( ODCB ) , and the structure of the boiling ODCB - soluble part wa studied by 1H , 13C NMR and DEPT ( distortionless enhancement of polarization transfer ) spectroscopy . In the case of ethylene / OD copolymerization , the ligand structure of the zirconocene catalyst strongly affected the propagation mode of OD . the zirconocene catalyst having cyclopentadienyl or pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand gave copolymer having 1-hexenyl and 1,3-disubstituted cycloheptane unit , derived from 1,2-addition propagation and addition - cyclization propagation of OD , respectively . on the other hand , the zirconocene catalyst with indenyl ligand produced the copolymer having exclusively 1,3-disubstituted cycloheptane unit . furthermore , the copolymer prepared by diphenylmethylene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride wa crosslinked . the diastereostructure of the 1,3-disubstituted cycloheptane unit in the copolymer wa not influenced by the stereospecificity of the catalyst used , and a cis-structure wa preferentially formed . In the case of the copolymerization of ethylene and DD , the c2v- symmetric zirconocene catalyst produced the copolymer with 1-octenyl branch derived from 1,2-addition propagation of DD . other C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocene catalyst with bulky ligand yielded copolymer with crosslinking structure derived form addition propagation of sidechain unsaturated bond of 1,2-added DD unit . none none none none treatment of z-vinyl carbamate with dicyclopentadienyl(diethyl)zirconium [Et2ZrCp2] lead to cyclobutyl-zirconocene derivative in good yield and a a unique diastereoisomer . the reaction proceeds through a carbometalative ring - expansion followed by an intramolecular migratory insertion . polyethylene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PE-b-PMMA ) diblock copolymer ha important interfacial application . hence , a PE-b-isotactic PMMA diblock copolymer wa synthesized using SiMe2(Ind)2ZrMe2 and MAO cocatalyst . the polymerization mechanism and the origin of PMMA isotacticity were duly explained . an appropriate nonisothermal avrami - erofeev crystallization model wa developed to compare the crystallization kinetics of the above copolymer with that of a PE homopolymer . for both polymer , the model well matched the entire differential scanning calorimeter crystallinity profile , notably for a single avrami - erofeev index , and predicted cylindrical crystal growth . this model particularly overcomes the limitation of the published nonisothermal crystallization model , and provides interesting insight into PE crystallization . the PMMA block significantly decreased the heat of crystallization and fusion , % crystallinity , and the relative crystallization function ; increased the nonisothermal crystallization rate constant ; and introduced minimal dilution effect whereas the PE block formed a continuous or percolated phase . this study correlate catalyst structure , copolymer block tacticity , and PE nonisothermal crystallization and melting behavior . the complete manuscript of this communication appears in : angew. chem. suppl . <nUm> , <nUm> .

As a result dichalcogenated zirconacycles [ (t-BuCp)2ZrY2C6H3R ; Y = S , Se ] ( B ) were obtained . complex B constitute useful potential synthons in organic synthesis and a large family of new functionalized dichalcogenated benzenic compound wa prepared by reacting electrophiles . the structure of complex B a well a related benzenic derivative ha been confirmed by microanalysis , 1H NMR and mass spectrometry . soluble metallocene catalyst can be easily metered into high pressure polymerization reactor . the performance of a homogeneous zirconocene catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene under high pressure wa tested at <nUm> bar and temperature between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C in the presence of methyl aluminoxane a cocatalyst . besides the productivity of the catalyst and the overall rate of polymerization , the most important property of the prepared polymer were determined . the result were compared with those found earlier with a heterogeneous titanium catalyst supported on magnesium dichloride . A quantitative study wa carried out on the homogeneous zirconocene dichloride / methylalumoxane / trimethylaluminum ( Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO / TMA ) catalyst system in ethylene polymerization . the effect of variation of the AlMAO / Zr ratio , absolute Zr concentration , and addition of TMA on ethylene polymerization activity and polymer property were investigated . the polymerization profile for small AlMAO / Zr ratio and the change with the Zr concentration are explained with a complexation equilibrium for the active homogeneous complex and with the change to a heterogeneous catalyst upon polymer precipitation . good polymer productivity can be achieved at AlMAO / Zr < <nUm> when working at Zr concentration between <nUm> − <nUm> and <nUm> − <nUm> mol / l with addition of TMA ( AlMAO / AlTMA ≈ <nUm> ) . the system zirconocene dichloride / methylalumoxane wa supported on silica in order to provide ethylene polymerization catalyst for suspension or gas phase process . highest activity wa found for a sandwich-like , three layer anchoring of the zirconium center on the support surface . the new catalyst system show a decrease of activity compared to polymerization experiment in homogeneous phase . however , the molecular weight are increased and the weight distribution remain narrow by immobilization of the active catalyst site . those supported metallocene catalyst could find application for the synthesis of polyethylene material with controlled rheology . ethylene / propylene copolymer ( EPM ) have been prepared by a liquid propylene suspension process , using homogeneous catalyst based on nonbridged zirconocenes and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . when bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) , bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl) dimethyl zirconium ( Cp2ZrMe2 ) and bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl) , dibenzyl zirconium ( Cp2ZrBz2 ) were used a catalyst component , EPM having low average molecular weight ( MW ) were in general obtained in low yield . on the contrary , a very large improvement of productivity and MW wa observed when bis(e5-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( Ind2ZrCl2 ) and bis(e5-indenyl) dimethyl zirconium ( Ind2ZrMe2 ) a well a bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride [(IndH4)2ZrCI2] were employed in combination with MAO . In particular , this last catalytic system allowed one to obtain EPM with a narrower distribution of MW in addition to the above characteristic . better performance , in term of rheological and elastomeric property , were also found for the crude and vulcanized sample prepared by (IndH4)2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst . mesoporous molecular sieve , with pore diameter of 2.6-25 nm , were impregnated with methylaluminoxane and bis(butylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride and tested a catalyst for the gas - phase homopolymerization of ethylene at ethylene pressure of <nUm> psi and temperature of 50-100 ° C and for 1-hexene / ethylene copolymerization at <nUm> ° C . the activity and activity profile , at constant Zr and Al content , depended on the pore size of the support and the polymerization temperature . maximum activity for both the homopolymerizations and copolymerizations were observed for catalyst made with support having pore diameter of <nUm> and <nUm> nm . homopolymerization activity were highest at temperature of 70-80 ° C ; average homopolymerization and copolymerization activity up to <nUm> kg of polyethylene / ( mol of Zr h ) were obtained . the weight - average molecular weight ( mw 's ) were not a function of the support pore size but decreased with increasing reaction temperature , from about <nUm> at <nUm> ° C to about <nUm> at <nUm> ° C . the polydispersities were essentially constant at <nUm> ± <nUm> for the homopolymers . mw 's for the 1-hexene / ethylene copolymer had an average value of <nUm> with an average polydispersity of <nUm> . the amount of triisobutyl aluminum added to the reactor significantly affected the activity and activity profile . the activity of metallocene catalyst in ethylene polymerization can be increased by a factor of up to <nUm> when the corresponding metallocene catalyst precursor posse one or two bulky alkyl ligand such a benzyl group instead of the conventional chloro ligand . we assume that in the activation process with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) these bulky alkyl group are transferred from the metal to the MAO cocatalyst . the actual cocatalyst is supposed to be a cage with one or more monomeric AlMe3 molecule inside . the bulky alkyl group is transferred to such an AlMe3 unit and can act a a spacer separating the catalytically active metallocenium cation from the MAO anion . this effect is supposed to be responsible for the increase in activity . blend of polyethylene ( PE ) were produced in a single reactor using a combination of { [ ( 2-ArN = C(Me))2C5H3N]FeCl2 } [ Ar = 2,6-2CH3(C6H4) ] and rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 . the experimental result showed that the EsP obtained have a broad molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) and both the molecular weight and the MWD can be regulated through changing the mole ratio of the two active site . In addition , the polymerization activity decreased with the increase of the Fe / Zr mole ratio whereas the crystallinity of the PE obtained exhibited a contrary trend , decreasing a the Fe / Zr mole ratio went up . the morphology of the blend also directly relates to the Fe / Zr mole ratio , and more iron content in the bimetallic catalyst system give rise to compact EsP of high crystallinity . this reflects that the reactor blend are morphology controllable a well and can be easily applied to present processing technique because of adjustable molecular weight and their distribution . differential scanning calorimetry , thermogravimetric analysis , gel permeation chromatography , and scanning electron microscopy were employed to characterize the property of the reactor blend of EsP . A series of hybrid supported catalyst were prepared by combining (iBuCp)2ZrCl2 and ( TpMs*(TiCl <nUm> complex ( TpMs* = HB(3-mesityl-pyrazolyl) 2(5-mesityl-pyrazolyl)- ) sequentially grafted onto MAO (methylaluminoxane)-modified silica according to a plackett burmann <nUm> <nUm> design . supported catalyst were prepared taking into account the immobilization order , silica pretreatment temperature , and grafting temperature . grafted metal content wa comparatively determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) , x-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy ( XPS ) , and inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectroscopy ( ICP - OES ) . the resulting catalyst were evaluated in term of catalyst activity and polymer property . according to RBS measurement , grafted metal content remained comprised between <nUm> and <nUm> wt % Zr / O2Si and <nUm> and <nUm> wt % Ti / O2Si depending on the immobilization order and on silica pretreatment temperature . all the system were shown to be active in ethylene polymerization having external MAO a cocatalyst . catalyst activity seemed to be governed by the zirconocene specie , influenced slightly by Ti one . resulting polymer were characterized by DSC and GPC . the polyethylene mostly presented higher molecular weight than those produced by homogeneous catalyst or by zirconocene grafted on bare or on MAO - modified silica . new approach have been identified for the immobilization , on a ClMg 2-based support , of borate activator for metallocene - catalyzed olefin polymerization . immobilization of [HNEt3][B(C 6F5)3(C6H4-4-OH) ] wa carried out by reaction with a support of type Cl2Mg / AlR n(OEt)3-n , obtained by reaction of AlEt3 with an adduct of magnesium chloride and ethanol . use of the resulting immobilized borate in combination with zirconocene catalyst in ethylene and propylene polymerization resulted in significantly higher polymerization activity than were obtained using the same borate immobilized on a silica support . the Cl2Mg - based support also gave the better polymer particle morphology , cross-sectional imaging indicating uniform support fragmentation , a opposed to incomplete fragmentation using the silica support . high catalyst activity were obtained using a Cl2Mg / AlRn(OEt)3-n support impregnated with [Ph3C][B(C6F5) <nUm> ] . In this case , a highly porous polyethylene particle morphology wa obtained . In the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , ethylene polymerization wa successfully performed with homobinuclear zirconocene complex { [ ( C 5H5)ZrCl2](C5H4CH <nUm> C12H7 4)[(C5H5)ZrCl2] ; 3o , <nUm> m , and 5p } , which were prepared conveniently by the reaction of disodium(phenylenedimethylene)dicyclopentadienide[C6H 4(CH2C5H4Na)2 ] with <nUm> equiv of (N5-Cyclopentadienyl)trichlorozirconium dimethoxyethane ( CpZrCl3(DME) ) in tetrahydrofuran and characterized by 1NMR and elemental analysis . the effect of the polymerization parameter , such a the temperature , time , concentration of the catalyst , MAO / catalyst molar ratio , and isomeric difference of the homobinuclear metallocene complex 3o , <nUm> m , and 5p were studied in detail . the result showed that all three catalytic system had moderate activity in ethylene polymerization and afforded polyethylene with relatively broad polydispersities . the catalytic activity of <nUm> m wa somewhat higher than that of 3o and 5p but lower than that of 4,4'-bis(methylene)biphenylene-bridged zirconocene catalyst ; this indicated that the distance between the two metal center wa too short in comparison with a 4,4'-bis(methylene)biphenylene bridge to increase the catalytic activity . the leaching of the catalyst zirconocene dichloride ( cp 2ZrCl2 ) from an SBA-15 silica support during ethylene polymerization wa studied ; severe leaching wa observed when commercial methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) wa used a the cocatalyst . however , the removal of free trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) from an MAO solution with a sterically hindered phenol reduced the catalyst leaching by 97-100 % . the result obtained from the leaching experiment with TMA - free MAO suggested that the major reason for catalyst leaching wa the free TMA in the commercial MAO solution , not the pure MAO itself . A supported metallocene catalyst wa synthesized by sequentially loading methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) ( <nUm> wt % in toluene ) and ( nBuCp ) 2ZrCl2 on partially dehydroxylated silica ES <nUm> modified by nBuSnCl3 . it shock load hydrogen responsiveness wa evaluated by polymerizing ethylene for <nUm> h at <nUm> bar ( g ) and <nUm> ° C without separately feeding the MAP cocatalyst . the shock load hydrogen feeding increased the ethylene consumption ( at a fairly constant rate ) , catalyst productivity , a well a the resin bulk density and average particle size at DP ( of hydrogen ) ≥ ∼ <nUm> psi . the bulk density increased from <nUm> to <nUm> g / cm3 . this show a procedure for overcoming the inherent drop in catalyst productivity caused by heterogenization of metallocenes ( that is a method for catalyst activation ) and improving the resulting resin bulk density . the volume - weighted mean particle diameter of the resulting polyethylene wa found to be 5.80-11.12-fold that of the catalyst corresponding to DP = <nUm> - <nUm> psi , respectively . the resulting kinetic profile showed to be fairly stable . however , mw and polydispersity index were not affected . the particle size distribution , average particle size , and the scanning electron microscope photograph of the resulting resin particle confirmed the occurrence of the replication phenomenon . on the basis of the above finding , the mechanism of ethylene polymerization under the present experimental condition ha been revisited . tert-Butyl vinyl ether ( tBVE ) wa polymerized with the catalyst dimethyl[rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)] zirconium ( ansa - zirconocene ) with tri(pentafluorophenyl) borane [B(C6F5)3] a a cocatalyst . the effect of various polymerization condition , such a the polymerization time , type of polymerization solvent , polymerization temperature , and catalyst concentration , on the conversion of tBVE into poly(tBVE) , it molecular weight and molecular weight distribution , and it stereoregularity were investigated . the maximum conversion of tBVE into poly(tBVE) wa over <nUm> % at a polymerization temperature of <nUm> ° C with an ansa - zirconocene and BC18F15 concentration of <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> mol / mol of tBVE , respectively . the number - average molecular weight of poly(tBVE) ranged from approximately <nUm> to <nUm> , with a lower polydispersity index ( weightaverage molecular weight / number - average molecular weight ) ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> , at all polymerization temperature . the number - average molecular weight of poly(tBVE) increased with decrease in the polymerization temperature and catalyst concentration . the mm triad sequence fraction of poly(tBVE) polymerized with ansa - zirconocene / B(C6F 5)3 at <nUm> ° C wa much higher than that of poly(tBVE) polymerized with the BC18F15 catalyst at <nUm> ° C , and this indicated that the ansa - zirconocene / B(C6F 5)3 catalyst system affected the isospecific polymerization of tBVE . ethylene wa copolymerized with 10-undecen-1-ol and 5-hexen-l-ol using stereorigid [rac-ethylene(Ind)2ZrCl2] , [rac-ethylene(H4Ind)2ZrCl2] , and the new catalyst system [rac-norbornane(Ind)2TiCl2] and [mesonorbornane(Ind)2TiCl2] , activated with methylaluminoxane . the characterization of the copolymer by 13C NMR spectroscopy revealed that the polymerization product were copolymer and that the conversion of the polar comonomer wa strongly favored in the case of the zirconocene precursor . very high catalytic activity value , nearly independent on the amount of comonomer in the feed , and comonomer incorporation up to <nUm> % weight have been found for 10-undencen-1-ol comonomer . catalytic activity during the formation of polyethylene ( PE ) / clay nanocomposites by in situ polymerization with metallocenes wa studied . ethylene polymerization wa carried out with the homogeneous metallocene in the presence of the clay particle and using the clay - supported metallocene catalyst . it wa found that the catalytic activity of the homogeneous metallocene doe not decrease in the presence of the clay particle and only a slight decrease of activity occurs using the clay - supported catalyst . the modification of the clay with MAO cocatalyst a well a it intercalation with ODA surfactant were found to play an important role during the in situ formation of the PE / clay nanocomposite . ODA - intercalated clay apparently facilitates the activation and monomer insertion process on zirconocene center located in internal site of the clay structure . although metallocene supported on MAO- treated clay exhibited somewhat lower catalytic activity than that supported directly on the ODA - intercalated clay , both system favored the production of PE nanocomposites containing highly exfoliated clay particle . nano-sized and micro-sized silica particle were used to support a zirconocene catalyst [ racemic-dimethylsilbis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ] , with methylaluminoxane a a cocatalyst . the resulting catalyst wa used to catalyze the polymerization of ethylene in the temperature range of 40-70 ° C . polyethylene sample produced were characterized with scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , x-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , and gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) . nano-sized catalyst exhibited better ethylene polymerization activity than micro-sized catalyst . At the optimum temperature of <nUm> ° C , nano-sized catalyst 's activity wa two time the micro-sized catalyst 's activity . polymer obtained with nano-sized catalyst had higher molecular weight ( based on GPC measurement ) and higher crystallinity ( based on XRD and DSC measurement ) than those obtained with micro-sized catalyst . the better performance of nano-sized catalyst were attributed to it large external surface area and it absence of internal diffusion resistance . SEM indicated that polymer morphology contained discrete tiny particle with thin long fiberous interlamellar link . separation into narrow MWD fraction ( liquid - liquid fractionation ) and preparative TREF ( temperature rising elution fractionation ) with subsequent analysis of fraction by GPC , FTIR , and 13C NMR spectroscopy were used to study the comonomer distribution of ethylene / 1-hexene copolymer produced over highly active supported titanium- and vanadium - magnesium catalyst ( TMC and VMC ) and a supported zirconocene catalyst . these catalyst produce PE with different MWD : m w / m n value vary from <nUm> for zirconocene catalyst , <nUm> for TMC , and <nUm> for VMC . 1-Hexene increase polydispersity to <nUm> for copolymer produced over VMC and hardly affect MWD of the copolymer produced over TMC and zirconocene catalyst . the most broad short chain branching distribution ( SCBD ) wa found for ethylene / 1-hexene copolymer produced over TMC . VMC and supported zirconocene catalyst produce copolymer with uniform profile of SCB content vs. molecular weight in spite of great difference in m w / m n value ( <nUm> and <nUm> respectively ) . TREF data showed that majority of copolymer produced over supported zirconocene catalyst wa eluted at 70-90 ° C ( about <nUm> wt % ) . In the case of VMC copolymer 's fraction were eluted in the broad temperature interval ( 40-100 ° C ) . accordingly , TREF data indicate a more homogeneous SCBD in copolymer , produced over supported zirconocene catalyst . A series of ortho or meta lewis base functionalized unbridged zirconocenes , [ {1-(En-Ph)-3,4-Me2C5H2} 2ZrCl2](E = NMe2 , OMe ; n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) , and a half - functionalized zirconocene , [ { 1-(p-Me2NC6H 4)-3,4-Me2C5H2 } { 1-(p-tolyl)-3,4- Me2C5H2}ZrCl2 ] , were prepared . the crystal structure of these compound determined by x-ray diffraction revealed the presence of only C2 - symmetric rac - like isomer in the asymmetric unit . In combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) cocatalyst , the meta-functionalized complex afforded mixture of polymer that exhibit multimelting transition temperature and broad molecular - weight distribution ( MWDs ) in propylene polymerization at atmospheric monomer pressure , whereas the ortho-functionalized complex did not give rise to polymerization . stepwise solvent extraction of the polymer mixture showed that the polymer consist of amorphous , moderately isotactic , and highly isotactic portion , the weight ratio of which is dependent on the reaction temperature . 13C NMR spectral analysis indicated that the [mmmm] methyl pentad value of the isotactic portion reached around <nUm> % . among the meta-functionalized zirconocenes , the di-OMe - substituted one afforded the largest amount of the isotactic portion at all temperature , and the portion comprised <nUm> wt % of the crude polymer obtained at <nUm> ° C . In contrast , propylene polymerization with the half - functionalized unbridged zirconocene resulted in the formation of nearly atactic polypropylene with a narrow MWD of around <nUm> . these result corroborate the proposition that the rigid rac - like cation - anion ion pair of type [rac-L2ZrP] +[Me-MAO]- generated in situ , through lewis acid - base interaction between the functional group and [Me-MAO]- , is responsible for the isospecific propylene polymerization with the given class of functionalized unbridged zirconocenes and further indicate that the formation of such ion pair can be favored by difunctionalization at the meta position of the phenyl ring with OMe group . the zirconocene complex [ { (C6F5)2B- (CH2)3-Cp}(Cp-PtBu2)ZrCl2 ] ( <nUm> ; cp = cyclo-C5H4 ) wa prepared by hydroboration of [(allyl-Cp)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(Cp-PtBu2)ZrCl2] ( 5 ) with BC12F10H ( " pier ' borane " ) . it represents a frustrated lewis pair ( FLP ) in which both the lewis acid and the lewis base were attached at the metallocene framework . it reaction with 1-pentyne did not result in the 1,2-addition of or deprotonation reaction by the FLP , but rather in the 1,1-carboboration of the triple bond , thereby obtaining a z / e mixture ( <nUm> : <nUm> ) of the respective organometallic substituted alkene <nUm> . the analogous reaction of 1-pentyne with the phosphorous - free system [ { ( C 6F5)2B-(CH2)3-Cp ) } CpZrCl2 ] ( 9 ) gave the respective 1,1-carboboration product ( (Z)-10 / (E)-10 ≈ <nUm> : <nUm> ) . some zirconocene complex containing ferrocenylcarboxylate ligand , [(RC5H4)2ZrCl]nY , r = H or CH3 ; n = <nUm> , Y = ferrocenylcarbonyloxy , 2-ferrocenylacetoxy , 4-ferrocenylbutanoyloxy , 4-ferrocenyl-4-oxobutanoyloxy , and 3-(ferrocenylcarbony)lbicyclo[2,2,1]hept-5-ene-2-carbonyloxy ; n = <nUm> , y = bis[(3-carboxypropionyl)cyclopentadienyl]iron , have been prepared . their IR , -1H NMR , UV , and other determination show that the carboxyl group are bidentate ligand in these complex . the electronic structure and geometry of bent sandwich phosphinomethyl complex of IVZr and ZrIII have been investigated by mean of molecular orbital calculation . A fragment MO approach and perturbation argument are utilized to explain the unusual experimental structure of Cp2ZrCl(CH2PPh2) ( 1 ) . various factor influencing monodentate ( e1 ) vs. bidentate ( e2 ) ligand coordination of a phosphinomethyl ligand in zirconocene derivative are analyzed , allowing to extrapolate to other Cp2M(X)() system ( : potentially mono- or bidentate ligand ) in general . structural and chemical consequence of one electron reduction of <nUm> are interpreted on the basis of the MO calculation . is shown to posse an e1-phosphinomethyl ligand and to be unstable towards heterolytic loss of cl- or CH2PPh 2- . the ground state structure of d1-Cp2Zr(CH2PPh2) is calculated to contain an e2-phosphinomethyl group , consistent with the observed ESR spectrum of the reduction product of <nUm> . synthesis of a Heteroatom-Stabilized rhodiumcarbene complex by reaction of CpRh(CO)2 with (Butadiene)zirconocene (e4-Butadiene)zirconocene reacts at room temperature in toluene with CpRh(CO)2 to give the metallacyclic [(p-allyl)zirconoxy]rhodium carbene complex Cp2Zr(C4H6)(OC)Rh(CO)Cp <nUm> . the structure of <nUm> wa determined by x-ray analysis . the rh-carbene unit Cp(CO)RhC(R)OM is almost planar , featuring the O[Zr] and cp group in a z orientation at the RhC moiety [ dRhC(carbene) = <nUm> Å ] . die reaktion de zirconocendichlorids mit zwei aquivalenten n-Butyllithium und trimethylphosphan liefert (1-Buten)(trimethylphosphan)zirconocen ( 1 ) in <nUm> proz . ausbeute . komplex <nUm> ist ein ausgezeichnetes ausgansmaterial zur darstellung weiterer (Alken)- oder (Alkin)zirconocen-Komplexe ; so erhalt man durch verdrangung de 1-Butens mit ethylen , styrol oder tolan die Zirconocen-Komplexe <nUm> , <nUm> oder <nUm> in hohen ausbeuten . eine weitere darstellungsmethode fur (1-Alken)(trimethylphosphan)zirconocen-Komplexe ist die umsetzung von zirconocendichlorid mit 1-Alkylmagnesiumhalogeniden in gegenwart von trimethylphosphan bei raumtemperatur ; z . B. sind so der 1-Propen-Komplex <nUm> und der 1-Penten-Komplex <nUm> gut zuganglich . spektroskopische untersuchungen ( 1H- , 13C- und 31P-NMR ) zeigen , das alle dargestellten (1-Alken)(trimethylphosphan)zirconocen-Komplexe in losung bei <nUm> ° C al getrennt beobachtbare rotamerenpaare 1a , b , 3a , b , 9a , b und 10a , b im verhaltnis ca. <nUm> : <nUm> vorliegen . die strukturen de Ethylen-Komplexes <nUm> und de Styrol-Komplexes 3a wurden zusatzlich durch kristallstrukturanalysen ermittelt . reaction of the b-CH agostic alkenylzirconocene complex Cp2ZrCl[C(SiMe3)  CHPh ] ( 1 ) with benzyl isonitrile yield the (e2-iminoacyl)zirconocene complex ( 2 ) . complex <nUm> crystallizes in space group P21 / a with cell parameter a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> . carbon monoxide analogously insert only into the ZrC bond of <nUm> .

(Butadiene)zirconocene add to BC18F15 to form the metallacyclic metal- locene - boron betaine system <nUm> , which contains a C-F → Zr interaction . addition of tert-butylisocyanide or tert-butylcyanide lead to cleavage of the zirconium - fluorine linkage and formation of the adduct <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . with additional tert-butylisocyanide , <nUm> reacts further to yield the corresponding e2-imino- acyl betaine <nUm> and <nUm> ( <nUm> stereoisomers ) , whereas <nUm> insert additional tert-butylcyanide into the Zr-C bond to give a chiral metallacyclic n-zirconaketimine complex that is probably stabilized by an internal borate → Zr interaction . ethene and propene insertion reaction into the Zr-C bond of <nUm> follow a similar course : the mono-insertion product <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively , generated in situ and characterized by NMR spectroscopy at - <nUm> ° C in [D8]toluene solution , are chiral and are also stabilized by internal borate → Zr co-ordination . complex <nUm> and <nUm> are likely to be intermediate in the formation of active homogeneous ziegler polymerization catalyst . the development of a new method for the intramolecular coupling of terminal alkyne and for the synthesis of seven- and eight - membered benzoheterocyeles is reported . the key step involve the generation of zirconocene - alkyne complex from 2-bromoalkenes and the subsequent intramolecular carbometalation of olefin or acetylides . the 8-unsubstituted zirconabicyclopentenes were carbonylated to afford unexpected product and allow access to polyfunctionalized molecule from simple starting material . the organometallic cation [Cp2ZrCH3(thf)]+ , employed a the tetraphenylborate salt ( 1 ) , reacts cleanly in <nUm> : <nUm> stoichiometry with the isocyanate <nUm> derived from valine methyl ester or valylvaline methyl ester , respectively . In each case addition of the Zr - CH3 group to the isocyanate sp-carbon center is observed with formation of a functionalized zirconocene cation derivative containing a chelating n-metallated n-acetylvaline methyl ester ( 3a ) or n-acetylvalylvaline methyl ester ( 3b ) moiety , respectively , coordinated in the bent metallocene s-ligand plane . the spectroscopic data of <nUm> , supported by an x-ray crystal structure analysis of the zirconated dipeptide derivative 3b , have revealed the presence of chelating ( e1 -O : e1-N)-coordination of the terminal n-acetyl group in addition to a Zr-O = C interaction with the adjacent valyl amido group . the titanium complex (C5H4-allyl)TiCl3 ] ( 2 ) undergoes olefin metathesis coupling when treated with <nUm> mol % of [ Cl 2(L1)(L2)Ru = CHPh ] ( L1 = L <nUm> = PCy3 , 4a ; L1 = PCy3 , L <nUm> = ( H2IMes ) , 4b ) to yield the dimetallic complex [ Cl 3Ti(C5H4)-CH2CH = CHCH 2-(C5H4)TiCl3 ] ( 5 ) . the allyl-substituted titanocene complex [ Cp(C5H 4-allyl)TiCl2 ] ( 3 ) analogously yield the dimetallic system <nUm> when treated with <nUm> . the ansa - zirconocene complex [ me 2Si(C5H4)(C5H 3-allyl)ZrCl2 ] ( 7 ) cleanly yield the analogous dimetallic coupling product <nUm> ( > <nUm> % isomerically pure ) , when treated with catalytic amount of 4b in toluene . complex <nUm> give an active homogeneous ethene or propene polymerization catalyst , especially at elevated temperature , when treated with excess methylalumoxane . A diastereoselective synthesis of 1,3-butadiene or cyclobutene derivative by a zirconium - mediated reaction of alkenyllithium compound and vinyl bromide is reported . the key step involve the generation of zirconocene - alkyne complex from haloalkenes and subsequent coupling with alkenyl bromide . thus , formally the process supposes the cross-coupling reaction between a terminal alkyne and an alkenyl bromide . moreover , the use of butyl vinyl ether instead of vinyl bromide a the unsaturated system allows an alternative access to different 1,3-butadiene regioisomers . bis(alkynyl)silanes react with low valent zirconocene specie to afford zirconacyclobutene intermediate . these in situ generated reactive organometallic intermediate can react with alkyne , ketone , aldehyde , and isocyanate by mean of a novel skeletal rearrangement . when a zirconacyclobutene intermediate wa treated with an alkyne , an a-alkynylsilyl zirconacyclopentadiene wa formed . addition of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate ( DMAD ) and ClCu resulted in one - pot formation of an alkynylsilyl-benzene derivative from three different alkyne . At a higher temperature , the a-alkynyl-silylzirconacyclopentadiene wa transformed by mean of an intramolecular skeletal rearrangement to a zirconacyclohexadiene- silacyclobutene fused - ring compound , which reacted with DMAD in the presence of ClCu affording the same alkynylsilyl-benzene derivative . when treated with a ketone , an aldehdye , or an isocyanate , the zirconocyclobutene intermediate also underwent the above-mentioned skeletal rearrangement , generating zirconocene - mediated cross-coupling product . A series of cycloalkylidene-bridged cyclopentadienyl metallocene complex , [ (CH2)nC(C5H4)2MCl <nUm> ] ( m = Ti , n = <nUm> ( 4 ) , <nUm> ( 5 ) , <nUm> ( 6 ) ; m = Zr . n = <nUm> ( 7 ) , <nUm> ( 8 ) , <nUm> ( 9 ) ; m = Hf , n = <nUm> ( 10 ) , <nUm> ( 11 ) , <nUm> ( 12 ) ) , have been synthesized and applied to ethylene polymerization after activation with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) . the cycloalkylidene-bridged titanocene catalyst exhibit much higher activity than the corresponding zirconocene and hafnocene analogue , and have the highest activity at higher temperature . In comparison , the silacyclopentylidene- bridged metallocene complex [ (CH2)4Si(C 5H4)2MCl2 ] ( m = Ti ( 13 ) , Zr ( 14 ) ) and isopropylene-bridged metallocene complex [ Me2C(C 5H4)2MCl2 ] ( m = Ti ( 15 ) , Zr ( 16 ) ) have also been synthesized and applied to ethylene polymerization . In both case , the titanocene complex show much higher activity than the corresponding zirconocene analogue , especially at a lower temperature . the molecular structure of complex 4-9 have been determined by x-ray diffraction . the structure - activity relationship , especially the effect of the bridge of ansa - metallocene complex , are discussed . catalytic dehydrocoupling of phosphine wa investigated using the anionic zirconocene trihydride salt [ Cp*2Zr(m-H) 3Li]3 ( 1a ) or [ Cp*2Zr(m H ) 3K(thf)4 ] ( 1b ) , and the metallocycles [ CpTi(NPtBu 3)(CH2)4 ] ( 6 ) and [ Cp*M(NPtBu 3)(CH2)4 ] ( m = Ti <nUm> , Zr <nUm> ) a catalyst precursor . dehydrocoupling of primary phosphine RPH2 ( r = ph , C6H2Me3 , cy , C10H7 ) gave both dehydrocoupled dimer RP(H)P(H)R or cyclic oligophosphines (RP)n ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) while reaction of tBu3C6H2PH <nUm> gave the phosphaindoline fBu2(Me2C-CH 2)C6H2PH ( 9 ) . stoichiometric reaction of these catalyst precursor withprimary phosphine afforded [ cp* 2Zr((PR)2)H][K(thf)4] ( r = ph <nUm> , cy <nUm> , C 6H2Me3 <nUm> ) , [ Cp*2Zr((PPh) 3)H ] [K(thf)4] ( 5 ) , [ CpTi(NPtBu3)(PPh) <nUm> ] ( 7 ) and [CpTi(NPfBu3)(nrPHPh)]2 ( 8 ) , while reaction of <nUm> with (C6H2tBu3)PH2 in the presence of PMe3 afforded [ CpTi(NPtBu3)(PMe 3)(P(C6H2tBu3) ] ( 10 ) . the secondary phosphine Ph2PH and (PhHPCH2)2CH2 also undergo dehydrocoupling affording (Ph2P)2 and (PhPCH2)2CH2 . the bisphosphines ( CH 2PH2)2 and C6H4(PH 2)2 are dehydrocoupled to give ( C2H3P 2PH)v ( 12 ) and ( C6H5P2 ) <nUm> ( 13 ) while prolonged reaction of <nUm> gave ( C6H 4P2)8 ( 14 ) . the analogous bisphosphine me 2C6H4(PH)2 ( 17 ) wa prepared and dehydrocoupling catalysis afforded ( Me2C6H 2P(PH))2 ( 18 ) and subsequently [ ( Me2C 6H2P2)2(m-Me2C 6H2P2)]2 ( 19 ) . stoichiometric reaction with these bi-sphosphines gave [ Cp*2Zr(H)(PH)2C 6H4][Li(thf)4] ( 22 ) , [ CpTi(NPtBu 3)(PH)2C6H4]2 ( 23 ) and [Cp*Ti(NPfBu3)(PH)2C6H4] ( 24 ) . mechanistic implication are discussed . the complete catalytic cycle for the intramolecular hydroamination / cyclisation ( IHC ) of 4,5-hexadien-1-yl-amine ( 1 ) by a prototypical [ ZrCp 2Me2 ] precatalyst ( 2 ) ha been scrutinized by employing a reliable DFT method . the present study conducted by mean of a detailed computational characterisation of structural and energetic aspect of alternative pathway for all of the relevant elementary step complement the mechanistic insight revealed from experimental result . the operative mechanism entail an initial transformation of precatalyst <nUm> into the thermodynamically prevalent , but dormant , bis(amido)-Zr compound in the presence of aminoallene <nUm> . this complex undergoes a reversible , rate - determining a-elimination of <nUm> to form the imidoallene-Zr complex . the substrate - free form , which contains a chelating imidoallene functionality , is the catalytically active specie and is rapidly transformed into azazirconacyclobutane intermediate through a [2+2] cycloaddition reaction . this highly facile process doe not proceed regioselectively because the alternative pathway for the formation of five- and six - membered azacycles have comparable probability . degradation of cyclobutane intermediate by following the most feasible pathway occurs through protonolysis of the metallacycle moiety and subsequent proton transfer from the Zr - NHR moiety onto the azacycle . the five - membered allylamine is generated through protonation at carbon atom C6 followed by a-hydrogen elimination , whereas protonolysis of the cyclobutane moiety at the Zr-N bond followed by proton transfer onto carbon atom C5 is the dominant route for the six - membered product . of the two consecutive proton transfer step , the second one determines the overall kinetics of the entire protonation sequence . this process is predicted to be substantially slower than the cycloaddition reaction . the factor that regulate the composition of the cycloamine product have been elucidated . when triisobutylaluminum ( AliBu3 ) is added to solution containing methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and rac-[Me2Si(ind) 2ZrCl2 ] ( ind : indenyl ) in C6D6 , NMR spectrum show that methyl-bridged mixed - alkylaluminum dimer Al(m-Me) 2Me4-xiBux predominate . these dimer react with MAO under partial transfer of isobutyl group and induce a conversion of the initially prevailing cationic trimethylaluminum adduct rac - [ me 2Si(ind)2Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2 + ] to rac-[Me2Si(ind)2Zr(m-Me) 2AlMeiBu+ ] and rac-[Me2Si-(ind) 2Zr(m-Me)2AliBu2+ ] . these specie are unstable and release isobutene under formation of zirconocene hydride . this study examines alternative reaction channel for intramolecular hydroamination / cyclisation ( IHC ) of primary 4,5-hexadien-l-ylamine aminoallene ( 1 ) by a neutral [Cp2ZrMe2] zirconocene precatalyst ( 2 ) by using the density functional theory ( DFT ) method . the first channel proceeds through a [Cp2Zr(NHR)2] complex a the reactive specie and relevant step including the insertion of an allenic C = C linkage into the Zr - NHR s-bond and ensuing protonolysis . this is contrasted to the [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition mechanism involving a [ Cp2Zr = NR ] transient specie . the salient feature of the rival mechanism are disclosed . the cycloaddition route entail the first transformation of the dormant [ Cp2Zr-(NHR) <nUm> ] complex <nUm> B into the transient [ Cp2Zr = NR ] intermediate 3A' , which is turnover limiting . this route feature a highly facile ring closure together with a substantially slower protonolysis ( kcycloadd ≫ kprotonolysis ) and can display inhibition by high substrate concentration . In contrast , protonolysis is the more facile step for the channel proceeding through the [Cp2Zr(NHR)2] complex a the catalytically active specie . here , C = C insertion into the Zr-C s-bond of 3B , which represents the catalyst resting state , is turnover limiting and substrate concentration is unlikely to influence the rate . the regulation of the selectivity is elucidated for the two channel . DFT predicts that five - ring allylamine and six - ring imine are generated upon traversing the cycloaddition route , thereby comparing favourably with experiment , whereas the cycloimine should be formed solely along the s-bond insertion route . the mechanistic analysis is indicative of an operating [2+2] cycloaddition mechanism . the Zr - NHR s-bond insertion route , although appearing not to be employed for the reactant studied herein , is clearly suggested a being viable for hydroamination by charge neutral organozirconium compound . A zirconocene - mediated one - pot multicomponent synthesis process leading to the synthesis of pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridine ( 5-azaindoles ) and pyrrole derivative ha been developed starting from a silicon - tethered diyne and three or two different or identical organonitriles . pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridine and pyrrole derivative with diverse structure and substitution pattern have been highly selectively prepared by this protocol . A wide variety of organonitriles and silicon - tethered diynes , either aliphatic or aromatic with both electron - withdrawing and - donating group , have been used to afford 5-azaindoles and / or pyrroles in good - to - excellent isolated yield . A key intermediate formed in the Cp2ZrIImediated reaction of one ( PhC = C ) 2SiMe2 , two molecule of iPrCN and one p-tolylCN wa characterised by xray single - crystal structural analysis , which ha allowed u to gain a good understanding of the reaction process . an efficient multicomponent synthesis of 5-azaindoles and dihydropyrrolo[3,2-c]azepines wa achieved by zirconocene - mediated coupling of silicon - tethered diynes , nitrile , and isocyanides . the synthesis , structure , and intramolecular cyclization of mono- and bis(iminoacyl)-Zr intermediate were investigated to elucidate the reaction process . upon hydrolysis , the isolated mono(iminoacyl)-Zr intermediate underwent intramolecular cyclization to afford tetrasubstituted 5azaindoles , whereas intramolecular cyclization of bis(iminoacyl)-Zr intermediate led to the formation of dihydropyrrolo[3,2-c] azepines . the structure of a bis(iminoacyl)-Zr intermediate , formed through insertion of two molecule of CyNC into the Zr-C bond , and structure of two dihydropyrrolo[3,2-c]azepines were characterized by single - crystal x-ray structural analysis . tandem insertion of 1,1-dihalo-1-lithio specie ( halocarbenoids ) and lithium alkynides into zirconacyclopentenes and zirconcyclopentanes affords carbocyclic product in high yield via an unusual rearrangement that probably involves addition of an organolithium specie to the b-position of a zirconium - alkyne complex to give an alkenylidene-zirconate specie . A wide variety of cyclopentanoid organic structure are rapidly assembled in good yield using this multicomponent coupling . the main side reaction , which becomes exclusive in some case , is b-hydride elimination of an intermediate cyclopentyl- or cyclopentenyl zirconocene . zirconocene ' ate ' complex play several role in a versatile three - component one - pot assembly of bicyclic organic structure from a 1,6- or 1,7-enyne or -diene , an in situ generated halocarbenoid RCX2Li and a lithium acetylide . the most likely reaction pathway involves the unprecedented b-addition of an organolithium specie to an alkynyl zirconocene to give a zirconium alkenylidenate complex . 5-Azaindoles either with three different substituents at their 2- , 4- , and 6-positions or with two identical substituents at their 2-and 6-positions and a different one at the 4-position , were obtained in good to excellent isolated yield by a zirconocene - mediated multicomponent process . each reaction involved four organic partner , comprising a Si - tethered diyne , one tBuCN component , and two ( either different or identical ) nitrile . all these four component were combined through the action of a Cp2ZrII specie into a three - ring fused Zr / Si - containing organometallic complex in a perfectly chemo - and regioselective manner . this multicomponent reaction process consisted of three reaction step , all of which were made clear through the isolation and characterization of their corresponding organometallic intermediate : the zirconacyclopropene-azasilacyclopentadienes <nUm> , the allenyl-aza-zirconacycles <nUm> , and the three - ring fused complex <nUm> . x-ray single - crystal structural analysis of two three - ring fused Zr / Si - containing intermediate and two 5-azaindoles unambiguously showed the position of the different substituents and the regioselectivity . iminopyrrole derivative could be also highly selectively prepared from a Si - tethered diyne and two different nitrile . treatment of me 2S*B(C 6F <nUm> ) nH 3-n ( n = <nUm> or <nUm> ) with ammonia yield the corresponding adduct . H 3N*B(C 6F 5)H <nUm> dimerises in the solid state through N-H ⋯ H-B dihydrogen interaction . the adduct can be deprotonated to give lithium amidoboranes Li[NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) nH 3-n ] . reaction of the n = <nUm> reagent with [ cp 2ZrCl <nUm> ] lead to disubstitution , but [ cp 2Zr{NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) 2H } <nUm> ] is in equilibrium with the product of b-hydride elimination [ cp 2Zr(H){NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) 2H } ] , which prof to be the major isolated solid . the analogous reaction with [ cp 2HfCl <nUm> ] give a mixture of [ cp 2Hf{NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) 2H } <nUm> ] and the N-H activation product [ cp 2Hf{NHB(C 6F <nUm> ) 2H } ] . [ cp 2Zr{NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) 2H } 2]*PhMe and [ cp 2Hf{NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) 2H } 2]*4(thf) exhibit b-B-agostic chelate bonding of one of the two amidoborane ligand in the solid state . the agostic hydride is invariably coordinated to the outside of the metallocene wedge . exceptionally , [ cp 2Hf{NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) 2H } 2]*PhMe ha a structure in which the two amidoborane ligand adopt an intermediate coordination mode , in which neither is definitively agostic . [ cp 2Hf{NHB(C 6F <nUm> ) 2H } ] ha a formally dianionic imidoborane ligand chelating through an agostic interaction , but the bond - length distribution suggests a contribution from a zwitterionic amidoborane resonance structure . treatment of the zwitterions [ cp 2MMe(m-Me) B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( m = Zr , Hf ) with Li[NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) nH 3-n ] ( n = <nUm> ) result in [ cp 2MMe{NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) 2H } ] complex , for which the spectroscopic data , particularly 1J(B,H) , again suggest b-B-agostic interaction . the reaction proceed similarly for the structurally encumbered [ cp " 2ZrMe(m -Me)B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] precursor ( cp " = 1,3-C 5H <nUm> ( SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> , n = <nUm> or <nUm> ) to give [ cp " 2ZrMe{NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) nH 3-n } ] , both of which have been structurally characterised and show chelating , agostic amidoborane coordination . In contrast , the analogous hafnium chemistry lead to the recovery of [ cp " 2HfMe <nUm> ] and the formation of Li[HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] through hydride abstraction . A study regarding coordination chemistry of the bis(diphenylphosphino)amide ligand Ph2P-N-PPh2 at group <nUm> metallocenes is presented herein . coordination of N,N-bis(diphenylphosphino)amine ( 1 ) to [ ( cp 2TiCl)2 ] ( cp = i*5-cyclopentadienyl ) generated [Cp2Ti(Cl)P(Ph2)N(H)PPh2] ( 2 ) . the heterometallacyclic complex [ Cp2Ti(k2-P,P-Ph 2P-N-PPh2 ) ] ( <nUm> Ti ) can be prepared by reaction of <nUm> with n-butyllithium a well a from the reaction of the known titanocene - alkyne complex [ Cp2Ti(I*2-Me3SiC 2SiMe3 ) ] with the amine <nUm> . reaction of the lithium amide [(thf)3Li{N(PPh2)2}] with [ cp 2MCl2 ] ( m = Zr , Hf ) yielded the corresponding zirconocene and hafnocene complex [ Cp2M(Cl){k2-N,P-N(PPh 2)2 } ] ( <nUm> Zr and <nUm> Hf ) . reduction of <nUm> Zr with magnesium gave the highly strained heterometallacycle [ Cp2Zr(k 2-P,P-Ph2P-N-PPh2 ) ] ( <nUm> Zr ) . complex <nUm> , <nUm> Ti , <nUm> Hf , and <nUm> Zr were characterized by x-ray crystallography . the structure and bonding of all complex were investigated by DFT calculation . all road lead to rome : heterometallacyclic complex of the type [ Cp2M(k 2-P,P-Ph2P-N-PPh2 ) ] ( cp = i*5-cyclopentadienyl ; m = Ti , Zr ) can be prepared by using four different synthetic pathway ( see scheme ) . all route yielded the corresponding metallacycles in very high yield . analysis of the structure and bonding of these complex revealed that in-plane aromaticity play an important role for the stabilization of these specie . the reaction of different metallocene fragment [Cp2M] ( cp = i*5-cyclopentadienyl , m = Ti , Zr ) with diferrocenylacetylene and 1,4-diferrocenylbuta-1,3-diyne is described . the titanocene complex form the highly strained three- and five - membered ring system [Cp2Ti(I*2-FcC2Fc)] ( 1 ) and [Cp2Ti(I*4-FcC4Fc)] ( 2 ) ( fc = [ Fe(I*5-C5H4) ( I*5-C5H5 ) ] ) by addition of the appropriate alkyne or diyne to Cp2Ti . zirconocene precursor react with diferrocenyl- and ferrocenylphenylacetylene under C-C bond coupling to yield the metallacyclopentadienes [ Cp2Zr(C4Fc <nUm> ) ] ( 3 ) and [ Cp2Zr(C4Fc2Ph <nUm> ) ] ( 5 ) , respectively . the exchange of the zirconocene unit in <nUm> by hydrogen atom open the route to the super-crowded ferrocenyl-substituted compound tetraferrocenylbutadiene ( 4 ) . on the other hand , the reaction of 1,4-diferrocenylbuta-1,3-diyne with zirconocene complex afforded a cleavage of the central C-C bond , and thus , dinuclear [ { Cp2Zr(m- I*1 : I*2-C ≡ CFc ) } <nUm> ] ( 6 ) that consists of two zirconocene acetylide group wa formed . most of the complex were characterized by single - crystal x-ray crystallography , showing attractive multinuclear molecule . the redox property of <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were studied by cyclic voltammetry . upon oxidation to <nUm> n+ , 5n+ , and 6n+ ( n = 1-3 ) , decomposition occured with in situ formation of new specie . the follow-up product from <nUm> and <nUm> posse two or four reversible redox event pointing to butadiene - based molecule . however , the dinuclear complex <nUm> afforded ethynylferrocene under the measurement condition . super-crowded metallocenes : the reaction of diferrocenylacetylene and 1,4-diferrocenylbuta-1,3-diyne with group <nUm> metallocene compound yield attractive multiferrocenyl complex . depending on the metal , different product were obtained by complexation , coupling , or C-C bond cleavage of the ligand ( see scheme ) . their electrochemical property were studied in detail . the oxidation of the metallacycle induces decomposition of the complex . 1,2,3,4-Tetrasubstituted cyclopentadienes and indene derivative with identical or different substituents were obtained in good to excellent isolated yield through a zirconocene- and ClCu - mediated intermolecular coupling process . this synthetic procedure involved three organic partner , including one CH 2I2 , and two different or identical alkyne . two alkyne or one diyne undergo Cp2ZrII - mediated ( cp = e5-C5H5 ) pair - selective reductive coupling to afford the corresponding zirconacyclopentadiene derivative , which react , in the presence of ClCu and 1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(1 H ) - pyrimidinone ( DMPU ) , with CH2I2 through intermolecular followed by intramolecular coupling to afford the cyclopentadiene derivative . an application of the prepared tetrasubstituted cyclopentadiene derivative wa demonstrated by the facile synthesis of the corresponding zirconocene complex [(4RCp)2ZrCl2] and [ ( 4RCp ) 2ZrR'2 ] ( R' = me , et , or nBu ) . the unique 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted cyclopentadiene ligand and the corresponding metallocenes are expected to have further application in organometallic chemistry and organic synthesis . ringing in the change : A one - pot synthesis of 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted cyclopentadienes by zirconocene- and ClCu - mediated intermolecular coupling of two alkyne and diiodomethane ( see scheme ; cp = e5-C5H5 ; DMPU = 1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6- tetrahydro-2(1 H ) - pyrimidinone ) gave product that were successfully applied for the synthesis of the corresponding zirconocene derivative . A study of the coordination chemistry of different amidato ligand [(R)N-C(Ph)O] ( r = ph , 2,6-diisopropylphenyl ( dipp ) ) at group <nUm> metallocenes is presented . the heterometallacyclic complex [ Cp2M(Cl) {k2-N,O-(R)N-C(Ph)O} ] m = Zr , r = dipp ( <nUm> a ) , ph ( <nUm> b ) ; m = Hf , r = ph ( 2 ) ) were synthesized by reaction of [Cp2MCl2] with the corresponding deprotonated amide . complex <nUm> a wa also prepared by direct deprotonation of the amide with schwartz reagent [Cp2Zr(H)Cl] . salt metathesis reaction of [Cp2Zr(H)Cl] with deprotonated amide [(Dipp)N-C(Ph)O] gave the zirconocene hydrido complex [ Cp2M(H) {k2-N,O-(Dipp)N-C(Ph)O} ] ( 3 ) . reaction of <nUm> a with Mg did not result in the desired Zr (III) complex but in formation of Mg complex [ ( py ) 3Mg(Cl) {k2-N,O-(Dipp)N-C(Ph)O} ] ( <nUm> ; py = pyridine ) . the paramagnetic complex [ Cp'2Ti{k2-N,O-(R)N-C(Ph) O } ] ( cp ' = cp , r = ph ( <nUm> a ) ; cp ' = cp , r = dipp ( <nUm> b ) ; cp ' = cp , r = ph ( 8 ) ) were prepared by the reaction of the known titanocene alkyne complex [ cp 2'Ti(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ] ( cp ' = cp ( 5 ) , cp ' = cp* ( 6 ) ) with the corresponding amide . complex <nUm> a , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> a , <nUm> b , and <nUm> were characterized by x-ray crystallography . the structure and bonding of complex <nUm> a and <nUm> were also characterized by EPR spectroscopy . coordination chemistry : heterometallacyclic complex of the type [ Cp2M(L){k2-N,O-(Dipp)N-C(Ph) O } ] ( m = Ti , no L ; m = Zr , L = Cl ; dipp = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl ; see scheme ) can be prepared by a hydrogen-evolution reaction from either [ Cp2Ti(e 2-Me3SiC2SiMe3 ) ] or schwartz reagent [Cp2Zr(H)Cl] , giving the corresponding metallacycles in very high yield . EPR measurement revealed the stabilizing effect of the amidate ligand for paramagnetic d1 TiIII complex . unusual nonlinear asymmetric amplification and chiral ligand loading effect were discovered for the use of catalytic quantity of chiral aminoalcohols in the in situ hydrozirconation - transmetalation - aldehyde addition process . while the stereochemically most efficient aminothiol ligand demonstrated mechanistically conventional reaction parameter in excellent agreement with kagan 's ML2 system , the asymmetric induction in the presence of a chiral aminoalcohol wa found to vary greatly with loading and % ee of the ligand . aminothiols remain the ligand of choice for the highly enantioselective formation of allylic alcohol and provide experimentally more predictable reaction variable . however , new , optimized condition lead to a synthetically useful product % ee using the readily available and scalable aminoalcohol 2a . evaporative light - scattering detection ( ELSD ) is widely applied in the HPLC analysis of organic compound lacking a UY chromophore . however , this detection method is generally unsuitable for determination of enantiomeric ratio ( er ) . the er calculated from a UV trace and an ELS trace of the same compound differs significantly . because of the nonlinear concentration response of the ELS detector , a compound with an er of <nUm> : <nUm> appears to be enantiomerically pure by ELS detection . it is possible to obtain a calibration curve and to calculate a correction factor , but this procedure is time consuming and therefore not very practical for routine analysis . In contrast , a charged aerosol detector allows a very accurate determination of the enantiomeric ratio . like the ELS detection , the CA detection is independent of the chromophore property of the substrate . therefore , we recommend the use of CA instead of ELS detection for determination of the enantiomeric ratio of non-UV active compound . A series of (Z,Z)-tetraaryl-1,3-butadiene ha been synthesized stereospecifically and regioselectively by acidolysis of five-membered Ti , Zr metallocycles formed from asymmetrically substituted alkyne . the structure of these product have been proved by physical and chemical method . free car - parrinello molecular dynamic ( CPMD ) simulation of four diastereomers of the zirconium - propene complex [ {iPr(3-iPr-CpFlu)}ZriBu(C 3H6)]+ ( cp = cyclopentadienyl ; flu = fluorenyl ) provide valuable insight into the mechanism and stereocontrol of propene polymerization with stereorigid metallocenes . spontaneous insertion of propene into the zirconium - isobutyl bond is not observed , and propene is found to be weakly bound and to rotate relatively freely around the C-C bond to be formed . large - amplitude rotation of the isopropyl substituent around the cp - iPr bond may play a role in triggering dissociation of propene . three of the four diastereomers eliminate propene during the course of the simulation , which make dissociation the dominating event on a 20-ps timescale . the CPMD simulation thus support the validity of the assumption , fundamental to statistical propagation model , that each insertion is independent of the preceding insertion . using insertion barrier from static density functional calculation , the statistical model predicts the polypropene microstructure in good agreement with experiment at low polymerization temperature for the catalyst {iPr(3-R-CpFlu)}ZrCl2 ( r = H , iPr , tBu ) . the prediction become le accurate at higher temperature , probably due to the onset of the competing back - skip reaction , which is not included in the model . some new volatile bis-cyclopentadienyl zirconium alkoxides of the type cp 2Zr(OR)(O tBu ) ( r = iPr , et , me ) is synthesized by the reaction of the corresponding KOR with the intermediate cp 2ZrCl(O tBu ) . moreover , an alternative and convenient synthesis of cp 2Zr(O tBu ) <nUm> , based on the reaction of cp 2ZrCl <nUm> with an excess of tert-butanol and triethylamine , is reported . the obtained compound are identified by chemical analysis , thermogravimetric measurement , infrared ( IR ) , nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy , and mass spectrometry ( MS ) . furthermore , a crystallographic study of cp 2ZrCl(O tBu ) is also reported . cp 2Zr(O tBu ) <nUm> and cp 2Zr(O iPr)(O tBu ) are then used for depositing zirconia thin film of high quality and purity on Si(100) and stainless steel AISI <nUm> substrate by metal - organic (MO)CVD . the microstructure and composition of the deposit are investigated by x-ray diffraction ( XRD ) and secondary ion mass spectrometry ( SIMS ) , while their hardness and elastic recovery on the AISI <nUm> substrate are measured using load - depth nano-indentation test . the outcome are consistent with a significant increase in the berkovich hardness of the coated sample compared to that of bulk AISI <nUm> . the allyl-substituted ansa - zirconocene dichloride [ Me2Si(C 5H4)(C5H3CH2CH = CH 2)ZrCl2 ] ( 1 ) cleanly add the borane 9-BBN to the allyl C = C double bond to yield the corresponding hydroboration product <nUm> . the borane BC12F10H ( 3 ) is also added regioselectively to <nUm> to yield [ Me2Si(C5H4){C5H 3(CH2)3B(C6F5) 2}ZrCl2 ] ( 4 ) . the strongly electrophilic boron lewis acid in <nUm> add 2-methyl-4,5-dihydrooxazole to yield <nUm> . treatment of <nUm> with pyrrole result in the formation of the respective borane adduct <nUm> of the pyrrole tautomer 2H-pyrrole . the 2H-pyrrole ligand in <nUm> is deprotonated at C-2 upon treatment with pyridine , followed by proton transfer and replacement of pyrrole with formation of the corresponding pyridine adduct <nUm> . the complex <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by x-ray diffraction . the monoalkyl complex [ Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4) (e5-C5H3R)}(R')Cl ] [ r = me , R' = CH2Ph ( 1 ) ; r = me , R' = CH2SiMe3 ( 2 ) ; r = iPr , R' = CH2Ph ( 3 ) ; r = iPr , R' = CH2SiMe3 ( 4 ) ; r = SiMe3 , R' = CH2Ph ( 5 ) ; r = SiMe3 , R' = CH2SiMe3 ( <nUm> ] have been synthesized by the reaction of the corresponding ansa - metallocene dichloride complex and <nUm> equiv of the alkyl grignard reagent . dialkyl complex with large alkyl group only formed for the zirconocene complex containing the ansa ligand Me2Si(e5-C5Me4) ( e5-C5H4 ) and with the benzyl substituent giving [ Zr(Me2Si(e5-C5Me4) (e5-C5H4)}(CH2Ph) <nUm> ] ( 7 ) . when the alkyl substituent is CH2SiMe3 only the monoalkyl derivative , [ Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4) (e5-C5H4)}(CH2 SiMe3)Cl ] ( 8 ) , wa formed . the insertion reaction of the isocyanide reagent CNC6H3Me2-2,6 into the zirconium-carbon s-bond of complex 1-8 gave the corresponding e2-iminoacyl compound [ Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4) (e5-C5H3R)}{e2-R 'C = NC6H3Me2-2,6}Cl ] [ r = me , R' = CH2Ph ( 9 ) ; r = me , R' = CH2SiMe3 ( 10 ) ; r = iPr , R' = CH2Ph ( 11 ) ; r = iPr , R' = CH2SiMe3 ( 12 ) ; r = SiMe3 , R' = CH2Ph ( 13 ) ; r = SiMe3 , R' = CH2SiMe3 ( 14 ) ; r = H , R' = CH2SiMe3 ( 16 ) ] and [ Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4) (e5-C5H4)}{e2- PhCH2C = NC6H3Me2-2,6 } ( CH2Ph ) ] ( 15 ) . the molecular structure of <nUm> ha been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction study . methylenetriphenylphosphorane wa coordinated to the boron of phenylborylidene-bridged bis(cyclopentadienyl)-and bis(2-Me,4-Ph-indenyl) zirconium dichloride to form zwitterionic ansa - zirconocene complex . the cyclopentadienyl complex <nUm> , when activated with MAO , exhibit remarkable polymerization activity that is more than an order of magnitude greater than that of a related amidoborylidene-bridged complex a well a the commercially important pre-catalyst [Cp'-SiMe2-N-tBu]TiCl2 ( cp' ; C5Me4 ) . the zwitterionic bis(2-Me,4-Ph- indenyl)zirconium dichloride specie is isolated a a mixture of rac and meso isomer 4-6 . the propylene polymerization efficiency of the isomer mixture activated by MAO is greater than that of a related silylene bridged system at <nUm> and <nUm> ° C ; however , the activity of the zwitterionic system decreased with further increase in temperature . the high level of isotactic triad ( <nUm> % ) and pentad ( <nUm> % ) in the polypropylene formed by 4-6 indicates that the rac isomer is the most active precatalyst of the mixture . the molecular structure of <nUm> and the rac bis-indenylzirconium isomer <nUm> and one of the meso isomer <nUm> are described . In this paper we report the synthesis of several unbridged zirconocenes , 1a-c , <nUm> and <nUm> , each bearing a phenyl substituent in the 2-position of the cyclopentadienyl ring . we also report their photochemical behaviour and we compare the result with those obtained with the corresponding unsubstituted metallocenes 3a-c and <nUm> . study of their electronic spectrum and EPR / spin trapping experiment showed photogeneration of ligand- and zirconium - centred radical , thus making these complex suitable a photoinitiators for radical polymerisation process . the substitution of the hydrogen atom in the 2-position with a phenyl group had positive effect both on the absorption coefficient , improving the light absorption efficiency , and on the reaction yield of tert-butyl acrylate polymerisation . these result can be explained in term of the combined effect of greater persistence of the radical in solution and / or increased efficiency of the radical in initiating the polymerisation process . treatment of the substituted (diarylphosphanyl)methyl group-4 metallocene complex [ ( C5H4-CR1R2- PAr2)2ZrCl2 ] ( <nUm> : R1 / R2 = CH3 / CH3 , H / CH3 , H / aryl ) with Li[B(C6F5)4] in dichloromethane solution result in chloride ligand abstraction ( with ClLi precipitation ) to yield the complex [ ( C5H4-CR1R2- PAr2)2Zr-Cl+ ] ( 5 ) , with both phosphanyl group internally coordinated to the metal centre . three possible diastereoisomers are observed in the case of 5c ( R1 = H ; R2 = CH3 ) , while bulkier R2 substituents give higher selectivity . the thermally induced ( reversible ) cleavage of the Zr - phosphane linkage result in dynamic NMR behaviour . gibbs activation energy of DG[?](298 K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> and <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal / mol were obtained for these intramolecular equilibration process in the complex trans-5d ( R1 = H ; R2 = ph ) and trans-5e ( R1 = H ; R2 = ferrocenyl ) , respectively . treatment of the substituted (dimethylamino)methyl metallocene complex [ ( C5H4-CR1R2- NMe2)2ZrCl2 ] ( 6a , 6b ) with Li[B(C6F5)4] proceeds analogously to yield the cation system [ { C5H4-C(CH3)2- NMe2}2ZrCl+ ] ( 12a ) and [ { C5H4-CH(CH3)- NMe2}2ZrCl+ ] ( 12b , three possible diastereoisomers ) . both complex have their pair of amino group coordinated to the metal centre . the complex exhibit dynamic NMR spectrum . selective equilibration of the diastereotopic N(CH3)A(CH3)B resonance of complex 12a is observed [ DG[?](233 K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal / mol ] , whereas the adjacent C(CH3)A(CH3)B methyl group remain diastereotopic . the dynamic equilibration of the latter wa observed at a markedly higher temperature [ DG[?](333 K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal / mol ] . treatment of [ { C5H4-C(CH3)2- NMe2}CpZrCl2 ] ( 10 ) with Li[B(C6F5)4] resulted in the formation of complex [ { C5H4-C(CH3)2- NMe2}CpZr - cl+ ] ( 11 ) , which show the internal -N(CH3)A(CH)B equilibration proceeding with a markedly higher activation barrier [ DG[?](333 K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal / mol ] than in 12a , and a stereochemical memory effect indicative of solvent coordination to the metal centre of the resulting highly electrophilic chlorozirconocene cation intermediate . complex <nUm> wa characterised by an x-ray crystal structure analysis , which show the internal zr-amine coordination . ( alkylation of ansa - zirconocene [ Zr{(e5-C5H 5)SiMe2 - (MBI)}Cl2 ] ( MBI = e5-Me- C13H7 ) with MgRCl gave the dimethyl complex [ Zr{(e5-C5H5)SiMe2(MBI)}Me <nUm> ] , but unresolvable mixture containing mono-alkylated compound were obtained when bulkier alkyl were used . however pure dialkyl complex [ Zr{(e5-C5H5)SiMe2(MBI)}R <nUm> ] ( r = CH2Ph , CH2SiMe3 ) were easily obtained using K(CH2Ph) and Li(CH-2SiMe3) a alkylating agent . diastereoselective insertion into the MBI - unprotected Zr-R bond wa observed when all of these dialkyl complex were treated with 2,6-xylyl isocyanide to give the iminoacyl compound [ zr{(e5- C5H5)SiMe2(MBI)}R{CR[e2-N-(2,6- xylyl ) ] } ] ( r = me , CH2Ph , CH2SiMe3 ) . all of the new complex were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and the x-ray molecular structure of the dibenzyl and the imino-benzyl compound were determined . the catalytic activity for ethene polymerization and ethene / 1-hexene copolymerization of the dichloro zirconocenes [ Zr{(e5-C 5H5)EMe2(MBI)}Cl2 ] ( e = C , Si ) , activated with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , wa measured . the dimethyltitanocene / BC18F15 system reacts with the 4-unprotected methyl a-D-glucopyranoside derivative <nUm> ( " HO-carb . " ) to yield the ionic complex [ Cp2Ti(O-carb . ) ] +[MeB(C6F5)3]- ( 10a ) . spectroscopic study have led u to believe that 10a is characterized by an internal ether - chelate structure in solution that involves coordination of the 6-OCH2Ph oxygen atom . treatment of 10a with trimethylphosphane give the open , non-chelated complex 11a , in which the phosphane coordinate to the metal center . reaction of the THF - stabilized salt [ Cp2TiCH 3(THF)]+[BPh4]- ( 12a ) with <nUm> gave complex 13a , with coordinated THF . experiment with bis(methylcyclopentadienyl) titanium system gave analogous result ( complex 10b , 11b and 13b ) . zirconocenes react differently . addition of dimethylzirconocene ( 14a ) or dimethylbis(methylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium ( 14b ) to <nUm> gave the neutral complex 15a , 15b and methane . treatment of 15a ( 15b ) with B(C 6F5)3 again resulted in the formation of an ionic chelate complex 16a ( 16b ) . A non-chelated complex <nUm> wa formed by treating the THF - stabilized salt [Cp2ZrCH3(THF)] +[BPh4]- ( 17 ) with <nUm> . the chemistry of the metallocene bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complex ( Cp2M(L)(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ] [ m = Ti , without L ( 1 ) ; m = Zr , L = THF ( 2a ) ; m = Zr , L = pyridine ( 2b ) ] , the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl complex [ cp . 2M(e2-Me3Si-C2SiMe3) ] [ m = Ti ( 3 ) , Zr ( 4 ) ] , and the ethylenebis(tetrahydroindenyl) ( ebthi ) complex rac-[(ebthi)M(e2-Me3SiC2-SiMe3)] [ m = Ti ( 5 ) , Zr ( 6 ) ] ha been described in several review . A fine - tuning of the reaction is possible by varying the cp ligand ( cp , cp. , ebthi ) , additional the co-ligands ( THF , pyridine ) , and / or metal ( Ti , Zr ) , and it ha been pointed out that these complex offer a number of compelling advantage over other , similar , widely used metallocene reagent . In this microreview recent ( 2000-2004 ) example of the chemistry of complex 1-6 are summarized , and some special interaction with lewis acid are described . In these reaction the metallocene core " Cp'2Ti " and " Cp'2Zr " ( cp' = substituted cp ligand ) are mostly formed after dissociation of the alkyne . As example of this , a new selective zirconocene coupling route to large , functionalized macrocycles ha been established from 2b and polyynes , complex <nUm> catalysis the first anti-Markovnikov hydroarnination of terminal alkyne , complex <nUm> and <nUm> selectively form polynuclear titanium complex by C-C coupling of N - containing heterocycle , and complex <nUm> , 2b , <nUm> , and <nUm> promote selective C-H and C-F bond - cleavage reaction of fluorinated N - containing heterocycle . beside this recent chemistry , this microreview also focus on the reaction of the above-mentioned complex with the lewis acid diisobutylaluminum hydride and tris-(pentafluorophenyl)borane . for example , complex <nUm> , 2b , and <nUm> react with iBu2AlH to give heterodimetallic complex containing tetracoordinate planar carbon atom . the titanium complex <nUm> reacts with B(C6F 5)3 with elimination of the alkyne and gaseous hydrogen to give an electrophilic substitution of the cp or cp . ligand in which zwitterionic TiIII complex are formed . the zirconium complex <nUm> and <nUm> do not liberate hydrogen in the reaction with B(C6F 5)3 , although , after C-H activation of one methyl group of the cp . or cp part of the ebthi ligand and a B-C bond formation , zwitterionic complex containing alkylidene group with agostic interaction with the metal center are obtained . complex <nUm> reacts with B(C6F 5)3 with Si-C bond cleavage of the alkyne and formation of an alkynylboranate [ Me3SiC = BC19F15 ] - , which is complexed by the " rac - (ebthi)Ti " fragment to give a zwitterionic complex . some of the formed heterodinuclear complex and the zwitterionic complex are active catalyst in the ring - opening polymerization of lactones , cyclic carbonate , and epoxides , a well a the polymerization of ethylene . the synthesis and structure of the new zirconium(+3) silylphosphanido complex {[Cp2ZrP(H)R]2} 1a { cp = e5- CH ; r = SiMe2C(iPr)Me2 } , 1b ( r = SiiPr3 ) , and 1c ( r = SiF(tBu) ( 2,4,6-iPr3C 6H2 ) are reported . the latter are easily accessible by the reaction of the lithium salt of the corresponding primary silylphosphanes with the schwartz reagent [ Cp2Zr(H) Cl ] in THF at <nUm> ° C . they can be isolated in the form of diamagnetic red - black crystal in 68-85 % yield . the central structural motif of the complex consists of planar ( 1a , 1b ) and slightly puckered PZr ring ( 1c ) , and contains two d1-Zr(+3) center , which are antiferromagnetically coupled ( super exchange , through - bond interaction ) although the transannular Zr-Zr separation is around 360pm . thus , the compound have a biradicaloid electronic structure , heating of solution of 1a-c in toluene in the presence of Pd / C or [ ( ph 3P ) 2Pt(C2H4) ] result in catalytic dehydrogenation of the P-H bond , affording the first neutral zirconocene - phosphinidene dimer [Cp2ZrPR]2Sa-C in the form of deep red crystal in 72-88 % yield . the composition of the product is proven by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy , mass spectrometry and correct C,H - combustion analysis . the molecular structure of 3a and 3c were additionally confirmed by x-ray crystal structure analysis , showing that they consist of PZr ring with significantly shorter Zr-P distance than those observed in 1a and 1c , interestingly , the dehydrogenation of the mostly sterically crowded derivative 1c occurs also in boiling toluene solution without using a catalyst , but the process is prevented in a H atmosphere . this suggests that the zr(+3) center in 1c can serve a active site for the P-H bonding activation , which , however , are deactivated in the presence of H . the synthesis and characterization of chiral bis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride containing b-pinenyl-derived ligand substituents is reported . unbridged metallocene complex having the [?](1S , 2S , 5S)-6,6- dimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]hept-2-yl]methyl)dimethylsilyl substituent in both 1- and 2-positions of the indenyl moiety were prepared and isolated in moderate to low yield by reaction of the corresponding indenyllithium salt with ClZr <nUm> followed by work-up and crystallization procedure . the corresponding tetrahydroindenyl complex were obtained in excellent yield by catalytic hydrogenation of the indenyl six - membered ring . In a complementary approach , a synthetic route to a-pinenyl-substituted indenyl ligand analogue wa briefly evaluated , which however , suffered from low yield . selected ss-pinenyl-substituted indenyl complex were scanned a catalyst for the dehydropolymerization of phenylsilane upon activation with nBuLi , for polymerization of ethylene and propylene upon activation with methylalumlnoxane ( MAO ) a well a for enantioselective carboalumination of 1-octene with triethyland trimethylaluminum . the bis(indenyl) complex catalyzed the carboalumination reaction , albeit only low yield ( 8-16 % ) and low enantioselectivities ( ee = 0.5-10 % ) were obtained . the 2-substituted bis(indenyl)zirconocene / MAO catalyst system produced atactic low - molecular weight polypropylene with low polymerization activity whereas both 1-and 2-substituted complex showed high activity in ethylene polymerization producing polyethylene with high molecular weight ( mw > <nUm> ) . the systematic synthesis of 1,3-dialkyl-substituted 2-silylindenes and their suitability a zirconocene ligand is discussed . unexpected reactivity rendered a number of substitution pattern unfeasible , especially for alkyl group other than methyl in 2-(trimethylsilyl)indene derivative , and essentially for all derivative of 2-(dimethylsilyl)indene . the synthesis of rac / meso-bis[1-methyl-2-(trimethylsilyl)indenyljzirconium(IV) dichloride ( 12 ) and bis[1,3-dimethyl-2-(trimethylsilyl)indenyl]zirconium(IV) dichloride ( 13b ) are de scribed . the solid - state structure of the latter display strong deformation within the ligand framework and an unusually large C PcentroidZr - CPcentroid angle . both , <nUm> / MAO and 13b / MAO , displayed ethene and ethene-co-1-hexene polymerization activity . curiously , 13b / MAO show an extraordinary monomer selectivity , which can be rationalized by mean of DFT calculation on the active site . the zirconocene complex Cp2Zr(L) ( e2-Me 3SiC2SiMe3 ) ( 1a : L = THF ; 1b : L = pyridine ) and the ethylene bis(tetrahydroindenyl) complex rac-(ebthi)Zr(e2- Me3SiC2SiMe3 ) ( 2 ) react with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoropyridine with C-H bond activation to produce the 4-substituted pyridyl complex with agostic alkenyl group cp' 2Zr(4-C5NF4)[-C(SiMe3) = CH(SiMe <nUm> ) ] ( cp'2 = cp2 ) ( 3 ) and ( cp'2 = ebthi ) ( 4 ) . with 2,3,4,6-tetrafluoropyridine , after C-H bond activation , complex <nUm> yield two isomer of the 5-substituted pyridyl complex rac-(ebthi)Zr(3-C5NF4)[-C(SiMe3) = CH(SiMe3) ] with agostic alkenyl group , 5a and 5b . with pentafluoropyridine complex 1b give , after dissociation of the bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene ( btmsa ) , C-F bond activation at the 4-position and formation of Cp2Zr(4-C5NF4)F ( 6 ) . complex 1b reacts with 3-chloro-2,4,5,6-tetrafluoropyridine by mean of a preferred C-Cl activation to give Cp2Zr(3-C5NF4)Cl ( 7 ) . these result are in contrast to the reaction of the titanium complex cp 2Ti(e2-Me3-SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) which , with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoropyridine , gave C-F activation in preference to C-H activation . with pentafluoropyridine , C-F bond activation at the 2-position wa found rather than at the 4-position . the heterometallic dinuclear complex [ Cp*2Zr(Me){(m- OOCC6H4S)Rh(PEt3)3 } ] ( 3 ) is readily obtained by methane elimination in the reaction of [ Rh(SC6H 4COOH)(PEt3)3 ] with [ cp* 2ZrMe2 ] in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio . complex <nUm> reacts with <nUm> equiv. of water to give [ Cp*2Zr(OH){(m-OOCC6H 4S)Rh(PEt3)3 } ] ( 4 ) , a rare example of a terminal hydroxo complex of a zirconocene . complex <nUm> and <nUm> are isotypic . the influence of the zirconocene group on the property of the rhodium complex wa evaluated with 31P NMR spectroscopy , cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculation . [Cp*2ZrMe2] reacts with [ {Rh(m-SC6H4COOH)(PPh3)2} <nUm> ] ( even in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio at room temperature ) or with [ Rh(SC 6H4COOH)(PEt3)3 ] ( in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio at elevated temperature ) to give 32-membered metallamacrocycles containing four rhodium and two zirconium atom , in which each zirconocene group bridge two {Rh(SC6H4COO)(PR3)2}2 unit [ r = ph ( 5 ) , et ( 6 ) ] . the only significant structural difference in <nUm> and <nUm> is the presence of two different isomer , in which the bridging thiolato ligand occupy either the exo or the endo position of the Rh2S <nUm> ring . however , this small difference ha a significant influence on the size of the macrocyclic cavity . dinuclear group <nUm> metallocene catalyst linked by a biphenylene or 1,2-diphenylethylene bridge , namely [ 4,4'-(C5Me 4)2-(C6H4)2][CpZrCl 2]2 ( 2a ) , [ p-(C5Me4)C 6H4CH2]2[CpZrCl2] <nUm> ( 2b ) , [ p-(3,4-Me2C5H2)C 6H4CH2]2[CpZrCl2] <nUm> ( 2c ) , [ (C5Me4)2-(C 6H4)2][TiCl3]2 ( 3a ) , [p-(C5Me4)C6H4CH2] 2[TiCl3]2 ( 3b ) , and [ p-(3,4-Me 2C5H2)C6H4CH 2]2[TiCl3]2 ( 3c ) , have been prepared and the crystal structure of 2b and 3b determined by x-ray diffraction method . the crystal structure reveal that these complex consist of two equivalent metal unit inverted with respect to the center of the bridge . all the complex were tested for the polymerization of ethylene and styrene in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , and direct comparison of their catalytic property with those of the corresponding mononuclear analogue [ ( PhC 5Me4)-CpZrCl2 ] ( 4a ) , [ ( p-TolC 5Me4)CpZrCl2 ] ( 4b ) , [ ( 1-p-Tol-3,4-Me 2C5H2)CpZrCl2 ] ( 4c ) , [ ( PhC 5Me4)TiCl3 ] ( 5a ) , [ ( p-TolC5Me 4)TiCl3 ] ( 5b ) , and [ ( 1-p-Tol-3,4-Me2C 5H2)TiCl3 ] ( 5c ) were performed . the dinuclear zirconocenes show a high activity in ethylene polymerization comparable with those of the corresponding mononuclear catalyst and give an increased molecular weight of polyethylene . the dinuclear half -

In contrast , zirconocene - alkyne complex , such a those of 1-(trimethylsilyl) prop-1-yne and diphenylacetylene , gave 1-zirconacyclohept-2-en-5-yne in good yield . consideration of structural parameter suggests that both a seven - membered cyclic alkyne and a five - membered structure contribute to generation of this complex . coupling of benzyne and [3]cumulenes on a metal wa also found to afford the corresponding metallacycles . seven - membered metallacycloalkyne compound were synthesized and structurally characterized . zirconocene - alkyne complex , such a those of 1-(trimethylsilyl)prop-1-yne and diphenylacetylene reacted with [3]cumulene to give 1-zirconacyclohept-2-en-5-yne in good yield . coupling of benzyne and [3]cumulenes on the metal also gave the corresponding metallacycles . borylation of hafno - and zirconocene complex [ ( e5-C 5H2- 1,2,4-Me3)2M ] <nUm> ( m2,e2,e2-N <nUm> ) , containing strongly activated dinitrogen ligand , with pinacolborane ( HBPin ) resulted in N-B and M-H bond formation . treatment of the borylated product with carbon monoxide triggered N-N bond scission with concomitant N-C bond formation to produce m-borylimido and m-formamidido fragment . conversely , addition of tBuNC resulted in insertion of the isocyanide ligand into the M-H bond and furnished the corresponding e2- iminoacylhafnocene complex . the reaction of the metallocene generator Cp'2M(L) ( e2-Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) [ 1a-Ti : cp' = cp = e5-cyclopentadienyl , m = Ti , L = none ; 1b-Ti : cp' = cp* = e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl , m = Ti , L = none ; 1c-Ti : cp'2 = rac - ( ebthi ) = rac-ethylenebistetrahydroindenyl , m = Ti , L = none ; 1a-Zr : cp' = cp , m = Zr , L = pyridine ; 1b-Zr : cp' = cp* , m = Zr , L = none ; 1c-Zr : cp'2 = rac - ( ebthi ) , m = Zr , L = none ] with 1,2-bis(4',4',5',5'- tetramethyl[1',3',2']dioxaborolan-2'-yl)acetylene ( bPinBA , <nUm> ) a a di-heteroatom - substituted alkyne were investigated . A slightly special reaction of 1a-Ti with <nUm> produced no titanacyclopropene or titanacyclopentadiene , but instead complex <nUm> wa produced by the coupling of two alkyne unit with one of the cp ligand to form a six - membered ring annelated to a five - membered one . the titanocene complex 1b-Ti and 1c-Ti reacted with <nUm> to form the titanacylopropenes <nUm> and <nUm> . the complex 1a-Zr reacts with <nUm> to the corresponding zirconacyclopropene <nUm> a a byproduct , in which the pyridine ligand remains coordinated . if the pyridine ligand dissociates , a coupling with a second alkyne yield the zirconacyclopentadiene <nUm> a the main product . the reaction of the sterically more demanding zirconocene precursor 1c-Zr also yielded the zirconacyclopentadiene <nUm> , whereas 1b-Zr did not react with <nUm> . the complex rac-(ebthi)Ti(e2-bPinBA) ( 5 ) reacts with gaseous dry CO2 directly to form the titanafuranone <nUm> . the molecular structure of complex <nUm> and <nUm> were characterised by single - crystal x-ray crystallography . group <nUm> metallocenes and bis(tetramethyldioxaborolanyl)acetylene gave different product : " Cp2Ti " afforded a dihydroindenyl complex . " rac - (ebthi)Ti " , " Cp*2Ti " and " cp 2Zr(py) " led to metallacyclopropenes , whereas " cp 2Zr " and " rac - (ebthi)Zr " yielded metallacyclopentadienes . one of the titanacyclopropenes reacts with CO <nUm> to a titanacyclofuranone . novel seco - analog of CC - <nUm> <nUm> were synthesized from comercially available nitroaniline by reduction , bromination , bisulfonation and bisallylation followed by reaction with tert-butyllithium , zirconocene and iodine . the obtained quinoline <nUm> wa then transformed into <nUm> and <nUm> , which , upon treatment with pd0 , led to <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . reaction of schwartz 's reagent [Cp2ZrHCl]n ( 1 ) ( one or two equivalent ) with gem - dinitrile compound of the type X(CN)2 [ x = CMe2 , CBenz2 , Ni2PPr4 ] give the corresponding mono- and di-N-zirconated imino complex selectively . substitution reaction of the zirconocene metal fragment with electrophiles such a , for example , chlorophosphanes of the type R2PCl , acid chloride RC(O)Cl or the iminium salt [CH2NMe2]Cl allowed the preparation of a large variety of stable N - functionalized mono- and b-diimine derivative . the nature of the x group is of particular importance for the success of the substitution reaction step . the x-ray crystal structure obtained for the N - functionalized gem - aldiminonitrile compound <nUm> , 10b , the N - phosphorylated b-diimine <nUm> , and the gem - formyl nitrile derivative 12b are presented . ( during the last <nUm> year , group-IV metal complex have been used extensively a catalyst in organic chemistry . however , a new and rapidly growing field for group-IV metal catalysis evolved in the 1990s when the group of bergman , livinghouse and doye found that zirconium and titanium complex catalyze the inter- and intramolecular hydroamination of alkyne and allenes . starting from early result obtained with zirconocene bis(amides) , this review deal mostly with hydroamination reaction based on titanium catalyst . In this context , study directed towards catalyst development are presented a well a application of corresponding process for the synthesis of biologically interesting compound . however , the microreview cover group-IV metal complex catalyzed hydroamination reaction of alkyne and allenes that appeared in the literature before july <nUm> , <nUm> . ( the tandem zirconocene - mediated or - catalyzed cross-coupling-elimination reaction provides an efficient and versatile procedure for the construction of scaffold that in many case are difficult to access by traditional organic chemistry . In general , this process supposes the reaction of two unsaturated molecule . one of them is coordinated to the zirconocene and the other one contains a heteroatom at an appropriate position for the subsequent elimination process . In this microreview we discus the concept of this useful approach focussing on the reactivity of alkyne- , aryne- , alkene - and iminezirconocene complex towards alkene containing a heteroatom functionality at the allylic or vinylic position . some example of heteroatom - substituted alkyne are also covered . selective reduction of semicyclic imide either to hemiaminals ( endo carbonyl reduction ) or to aldehyde and amine ( exo carbonyl reduction ) in high yield by schwartz 's reagent ( Cp2ZrHCl ) are reported . mechanistic aspect of these reaction have been investigated at the DFT ab initio level with consideration of implicit solvent effect and thermal and pressure correction to <nUm> K / <nUm> atm . the reaction proceed from the reagent to very stable final zr-oxo intermediate through the formation of σ complex and subsequent four - center transition state structure ( 1,2-migratory insertion ) . the energetic barrier for the insertion step depend strongly on the nature of the ancillary group at the reducing carbonyl group . N-Carbamoyl group are reduced to hemiaminals whereas n-acyl group react at the exo carbonyl group . the absence of the second carbonyl group in the simple n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone ( le oxidized system ) strongly reduces the thermodynamic drive for the formation of the metallocene oxo intermediate and allows an explanation of the remarkable chemoselectivity of the hydrozirconation . the zirconocene-oxo intermediate hydrolyze quickly throughout an ionic mechanism in which water molecule strongly assist the process by stabilizing ion pair separation . the computational result are consistent with a large set of experimental data on reduction of g-lactam and isoxazolidinone derivative under mild condition . they provide a way to explain and predict the relative importance of the two competitive endo / exo reduction channel of semicyclic imide by considering the electronic and steric feature of substituents . semicyclic imide such a g-lactam and isoxazolidinone derivative are efficiently and selectivity reduced by the Cp2ZrHCl agent . the energetic reaction pathway for endo and exo attack , computed at the DFT level including thermal effect , allow an exhaustive interpretation of current and previously reported experimental data . two approach for the conversion of d-glucose to (-)-neplanocin A ( 2 ) , both based on the zirconocene - promoted ring contraction of a vinyl-substituted pyranoside , are herein evaluated ( scheme <nUm> ) . In the first pathway ( scheme <nUm> ) , the substrate posse the a-D-allo configuration ( see <nUm> ) such that ultimate introduction of the nucleobase would require only an inversion of configuration . however , this precursor proved unresponsive to Cp2Zr ( = [ZrCl2(Cp)2] ) , an end result believed to be a consequence of substantive nonbonded steric effect operating in a key intermediate ( scheme <nUm> ) . In contrast , the C(2) epimer ( see <nUm> ) experienced the desired metal - promoted conversion to an enantiomerically pure polyfunctional cyclopentane ( see <nUm> in scheme <nUm> ) . the substituents in this product are arrayed in a manner such that conversion to the target nucleoside can be conveniently achieved by a double - inversion sequence ( scheme <nUm> ) . recourse to palladium(0) - catalyzed allylic alkylation did not provide an alternate mean of generating <nUm> . the acid - catalyzed reaction between formaldehyde and 1H-indene , 3-alkyl- and 3-aryl-1H-indenes , and six - membered - ring substituted 1H-indenes , with the 1H-indene / CH2O ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> , at temperature above <nUm> ° in hydrocarbon solvent , yield 2,2'-methylenebis[1H-indenes] 1-8 in 50-100 % yield . these 2,2'-methylenebis[1H-indenes] are easily deprotonated by <nUm> equiv. of BuLi or MeLi to yield the corresponding dilithium salt , which are efficiently converted into ansa - metallocenes of Zr and Hf . the unsubstituted dichloro{(1,1',2,2',3,3',3a,3'a,7a,7'a-e)-2 , 2'-methylenebis[1H-inden-1-yl]}zirconium ( [ZrCl2(1')] ) is the least soluble in organic solvent . substitution of the 1H-indenyl moiety by hydrocarbyl substituents increase the hydrocarbon solubility of the complex , and the presence of a substituent larger than a me group at the 1,1' position of the ligand imparts a high diastereoselectivity to the metallation step , since only the racemic isomer are obtained . methylene-bridged ' ansa - zirconocenes ' show a noticeable open arrangement of the bis[1H-inden-1-yl] moiety , a measured by the angle between the plane defined by the two p-ligands ( the ' bite angle ' ) . In particular , of the ' zirconocenes ' structurally characterized so far , the dichloro{(1,1',2,2',3 , 3',3a,3'a,7a,7'a-e)-2,2'-methylenebis[4 , 7-dimethyl-1H-inden-1-yl]}zirconium ( [ZrCl2(5')] is the most open . the mixture [ZrCl2(1')] / methylalumoxane ( MAO ) is inactive in the polymerization of both ethylene and propylene , while the metallocenes with substituted indenyl ligand polymerize propylene to atactic polypropylene of a molecular mass that depends on the size of the alkyl or aryl group at the 1,1' position of the ligand . ethene is polymerized by rac-dichloro-{(1,1',2,2',3,3',3a,3'a,7a,7'a-e) -2,2'-methylenebis[1-methyl-1H-inden-1-yl]}zirconium ( [ ClZr 2(2') ] ) / MAO to polyethylene wax ( average degree of polymerization ca. <nUm> ) , which are terminated almost exclusively by ethenyl end group . polyethylene with a high molecular mass could be obtained by increasing the size of the 1-alkyl substituent . coordination of conjugated 1,3-dienes to a transition metal had been considered to occur only in a s-cis geometry , until the recent discovery of cp <nUm> zr(s-trans-diene) , diene = butadiene and trans , trans-1,4-diphenylbutadiene . A molecular orbital analysis of metal-butadiene interaction is carried out , for the specific case of CFeO <nUm> ( butadiene ) and cp <nUm> zr(butadiene) , to discern the electronic origin of the novel transoid geometry . stability of the s-cis and s-trans structure of cp <nUm> zr(butadiene) is found to be well balanced and we show how the geometrical choice is affected by substitution on butadiene . none faranal ( 1 ) , the trail-following pheromone of the worker of pharaoh 's ant ( monomorium pharaonis ) , wa synthesized by the coupling reaction of the iododiene <nUm> with the chiral building block <nUm> a the key step . the geometrically pure iododiene <nUm> wa prepared by the zirconocene-mediated carboalumination reaction of <nUm> followed by treatment with iodine . A novel 11C-C bond formation based on the palladium - mediated cross-coupling reaction of alkenylzirconocenes with [11C]methyl iodide is described . the conversion of internal alkyne into the corresponding alkenylzirconocenes followed by transmetalation with Pd(PPh3) <nUm> and subsequent cross-coupling with [11C]methyl iodide gave several 11C - labelled a,a'-dimethyl-substituted alkene . the palladium complex Pd(PPh3)4 proved to be superior to Pt(PPh3)4 or Ni(PPh3)4 a transition metal complex . the scope and limitation of the novel palladium - mediated cross-coupling reaction of alkenylzirconocenes with [ 11C]methyl iodide were tested with various internal alkyne . after heating at <nUm> ° C for <nUm> min radiochemical yield of up to <nUm> % ( based upon [11C]methyl iodide ) could be achieved . [14C]Formaldehyde wa synthesized by reducing 14CO2 at ambient temperature with schwartz 's reagent . the [14C]formaldehyde wa then used in the radiosynthesis of high specific activity ( <nUm> GBq / mmol ) [14C]hydrochlorothiazide via cyclization of 4-amino-5-chloro-1,3-benzenedisulfonamide . A synthesis of [ 14C]formaldehyde by reducing 14CO2 at ambient temperature with schwartz 's reagent is described . the [14C] formaldehyde ha been applied in the radiosynthesis of high specific activity ( <nUm> GBq / mmol ) [14C]hydrochlorothiazide via cyclization of 4-amino-5-chloro-1,3-benzenedisulfonamide . several type of SiO2-supported metallocene catalyst were prepared using chemically modified silica gel . polymerization of propene wa conducted with these catalyst combined with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or ordinary alkylaluminiums . highly isotactic poly(propylene) with high molecular weight wa obtained by the catalyst whose zirconocene ligand were chemically immobilized on O2Si . the preparative method of these catalyst and the result of propene polymerization , together with the analytical data of produced polymer , are reported in some detail . methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) wa polymerized with Cp2ZrCl2 / methylalyminoxane or Cp2M(CH3)2 ( m : Zr , Hf ; cp = cyclopentadienyl ) combined with BC18F15 ( 1 ) or Ph3CB(C6F5)4 ( 2 ) , ( ph = phenyl ) . in the presence of a lewis acid like C4H10Zn with slow inititation , which gave syndiotactic-rich poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) with high molecular weight . the polymer yield increase with polymerization time , which indicates that the propagation rate is zero order in concentration of monomer . the polymer yield increase also with concentration of Cp2Zr(CH3)2.2 , which indicates the zirconocene to be the real catalyst . the polymer yield and the initiation efficiency ( N / [Zr] ) increase with the concentration of C4H10Zn , which indicates C4H10Zn , to be involved in the initiation . it is also shown that the propagation reaction is independent of the concentration of C4H10Zn . methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) wa reacted with a small quantity of p-hydroquinone to obtain a modified MAO insoluble in toluene . ethylene and propylene homo- and copolymerization were conducted with zirconocene using the modified MAO a cocatalyst both in the presence and absence of triisobutylaluminium . it wa found that the modified MAO alone can not activate the zirconocene catalyst , whereas polymer with high molecular weight are obtained when combined with triisobutylaluminium . the catalytic activity is markedly dependent on the mole ratio of p-hydroquinone to MAO a well a the amount of triisobutylaluminium . olefin polymerization were conducted with novel multimetallic zirconocene catalyst system : R-CpCpZrCl2 ( 1 ) ( r = dimethylsilylferrocene ; cp = cyclopentadienyl ) and (R-Cp)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) in combination with methylaluminoxane or tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate . In ethylene polymerization , the maximum catalyst activity wa observed at a lower temperature ( 30-45 ° C ) when using complex <nUm> or <nUm> , compared with Cp2ZrCl2 . it wa also revealed that complex <nUm> is a more effective catalyst than Cp2ZrCl2 for copolymerization of ethylene and propene . polysiloxanes with bisindenyl , bisfluorenyl , and bis(1,2,3,4-tetramethyl)cyclopentadienyl side group were synthesized by condensation of the corresponding dichlorosilane compound and water to obtain supported zirconocene catalyst . the polymerization of ethene wa conducted over these catalyst combined with methylalumoxane . the polymerization activity depends markedly upon the substituents and decrease in the order : bisindenyl ≫ bisfluorenyl ≫ bis(1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadienyl) . all the supported catalyst give linear polyethene with fairly high molecular weight . the catalyst with bisindenyl group wa found to be composed of a toluene - soluble and a toluene - insoluble fraction . the polymerization profile ( activity versus time curve ) wa analyzed with the toluene - soluble and -insoluble fraction a well a the corresponding homogeneous system . the homogeneous system , which exerts the highest activity in the initial phase , wa completely deactivated after several hour whereas the activity of the supported catalyst , especially of the toluene - insoluble fraction , wa unchanged during <nUm> h even at <nUm> ° C . polysiloxanes with different content of bisindenyl group were also synthesized via the co-condensation with dimethyldichlorosilane and applied a the carrier . however , the activity per Zr atom decrease remarkably with an increase in dimethylsilane unit . 1-Butene polyinsertion promoted by two typical C2 - symmetric zirconocene catalyst ( i.e. rac-ethylenebis(1-indenyl)ZrCl2 ( 1 ) and rac-dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl)ZrCl2 ) ( 2 ) wa investigated under both hydrooligomerization and polymerization condition and compared with that of propene . it wa found that , in spite of a similar regiospecificity for the two monomer , the fraction of " dormant " site is higher in 1-butene polymerization , a a result of a ( much ) lower reactivity of a <nUm> last - inserted unit . accordingly , in the investigated case , <nUm> unit of 1-butene were not incorporated in the growing chain but either isomerized to <nUm> unit or remained at the chain end until they underwent chain transfer via b-hydrogen elimination . experimental evidence is also presented of an epimerization reaction of the growing poly(1-butene) chain with a <nUm> last - inserted unit , leading to a decrease of polymer stereoregularity with decreasing monomer concentration . living cationic ring - opening polymerization of e-caprolactone ( CL ) , d-valerolactone ( VL ) and 1,3-dioxepane-2-one ( 6 ) wa achieved at room temperature by using zirconocene borate complex catalyst . respective block copolymerization of CL with VL or with cyclic carbonate <nUm> wa also successfully performed . the mechanism of the present cationic living polymerization is discussed . A supported version of zirconocene catalyst on siloxane copolymer having 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp'')-fluorenyl ( flu ) ( I ) or cyclopentadienyl (Cp)-fluorenyl ( II ) group a substituents wa prepared and applied to propene polymerization using methylalumoxane ( MAO ) or [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] a cocatalyst . catalyst ( I ) , which wa soluble in toluene , exhibited very low activity , whereas catalyst ( II ) , which wa composed of a toluene soluble ( Cat-A ) and an insoluble fraction ( Cat-B ) , displayed a fairly high activity . both catalyst ( A and B ) give a mixture of syndiotactic , atactic and a small quantity of isotactic polypropene , with a fraction of syndiotactic pentad ranging from about 50-75 % . In contrast , the corresponding non-supported catalyst give almost completely atactic polypropene . the interaction of supported metallocene catalyst with methylaluminoxane lead to the desorption of the metallocene compound from the surface of the support and the formation of highly active homogeneous complex . the catalytic property of the system and characteristic of polyethylene formed are determined by these specie . the Zr surface loading from Cp2ZrCl2 toluene solution on different kind of commercial silica ( grace <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> ) wa determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry . In all silica , a saturation trend wa observed with increasing amount of metal in the initial solution , the largest Zr loading value ( <nUm> wt.- % ) being observed for silica grace <nUm> . solid surface area were determined by the BET method before and after metallocene immobilization , revealing that the value do not change after zirconocene impregnation . two different kind of cocatalyst were used , methylaluminoxane and trimethylaluminium . the aluminium loading on silica grace <nUm> wa determined using the 27Al(p,g)28Si nuclear reaction and titrometry , both showing that methylaluminoxane lead to an ' Al grafting ' four time more efficient than doe trimethylaluminium . finally , the catalytic activity of these system wa tested in the polymerization of ethylene . the supported catalyst were shown to be active , specially using the low cost trimethylaluminium a a cocatalyst . the polymer obtained with the supported system exhibited a higher molecular weight than those obtained with the homogeneous system . the influence of perfluoroborate anion on catalyst activity and stereospecificity ha been determined for propone polymerisation at 20-60 ° C . for C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes , activity were strongly ligand - dependent , with system activated by TIBA / Ph3C +X- , where TIBA = AliBu3 , x = {Z[B(C6F5)3]2} , and z = CN or H2N , giving significantly higher activity than methylaluminoxane under comparable condition . for high - activity catalyst at <nUm> ° C , { H 2N[B(C6F5)3]2 } - proved superior to { CN[B-(C6F5) 3]2}- , presumably due to the higher thermal stability of the amidoborate . the influence of counteranions on PP stereospecificity for these catalyst is negligible . on the other hand , the conformationally flexible catalyst , (2-PhIHd)2Zr-Cl <nUm> / TIBA / Ph3C+X- , show not only a strong anion dependence of it activity , but also significant variation in poly(propylene) isotacticity , mainly due to the formation of small fraction of highly isotactic ( mmmm > <nUm> % ) PP . this effect wa particularly pronounced for {CN[B(C6F5)3]2}- and the dianion , {Ni[CNB(C6F5)3]4} 2- . the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) in the presence of the neutral chloro zirconocene enolates , Cp2ZrCl[OC(OMe) = CMe2 ] ( 1 ) , Me4C2(Cp)2 ZrCl[OC(OMe) = CMe2 ] ( 2 ) , and Me2C(Cp)2ZrCl[OC ( OMe ) = CMe2 ] ( 3 ) , wa investigated . none of these compound is catalytically active on it own . they could be activated by adding Ph3CB(C6F5) <nUm> ( 4 ) ; however , only if the initial concentration of enolate is higher than that of the perfluorated phenyl borate . polymer were produced with a number average molar mass of up to <nUm> <nUm> g / mol and a dispersion index of <nUm> - <nUm> with mixture comprising <nUm> and <nUm> or <nUm> and <nUm> . the degree of polymerization depends only on the quantity of excess enolate and not on the absolute concentration of the initiator component . In contrast , a mixture of <nUm> and <nUm> wa not very active . kinetic modeling of the system a well a NMR spectroscopic investigation indicate that a bimetallic mechanism can describe chain growth . the activity of these catalytic system depends on the structure of the ligand . the two zirconocenes with bridged cyclopentadienyl ligand , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , convert MMA considerably slower . In addition to the methyl zirconocene enolates with unbridged cyclopentadienyl ligand , the corresponding chloro zirconocene enolates are also suitable for the polymerization of MMA . the latter compound offer the advantage that preparation for the production of the initiator are comparatively simple . propene polymerisation wa conducted with three ansa - zirconocene complexed : Me2Si(2-Me-4-PhInd)2-ZrCl2 ( A ) , me 2Si(2-Me-4-PhInd)2ZrClNMe2 ( B ) and me 2Si-(2-Me-4-PhInd)2ZrClNEt2 ( C ) . methylalumoxane ( MAO ) or [HNPhMe2][B(C6F5) <nUm> ] wa used a cocatalyst . the influence of cocatalysts and trisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) on polymerisation activity , molecular weight and polymer microstructure wa studied . furthermore , the alkylation and activation of the complex were examined using UV / VIS spectroscopy . complex A wa the most active in polymerisation , but polymer produced by B and C had in general higher molecular weight . replacing MAO partially by TIBA increased the molecular weight and prevented catalyst deactivation . according to the UV / VIS measurement , all complex have low reactivity towards TMA and TIBA . similar cationic specie were formed of all three studied zirconocenes in the reaction with MAO . additional TIBA did not affect the type of active specie formed in the reaction of zirconocene and MAO , but increased the activity of B and C. coplymers of propene and higher 1-olefins ( 1-butene , 1-pentene , 1-hexene , 1-heptene , 1-octene , and 4-methyl-1-pentene ( 4M1P ) ) , prepared with rac-Et(Ind)2-ZrCl2 ( EI ) and rac-Me 2Si(2-MeBenz-[e]Ind)2ZrCl2 ( MBI ) , were comprehensively analyzed by 13C NMR spectroscopy . these catalyst known to produce isotactic polypropene lead to two vastly different family of copolymer produced with EI possessed comparable isotacticities a well a similar stereosequences . furthermore , these copolymer did not significantly differ from those of the reference propene homopolymer . however , the copolymer produced with MBI significantly differed both from the reference propene homopolymer and among themselves . In fact , in contrast to the corresponding highly isotactic homopolymer , the whole series of copolymer wa characterized by rather low isotacticities . the degree of tacticity wa strongly influenced by the comonomer type . A detailed 13C NMR analysis revealed that these copolymer are constituted by highly isotactic sequence and by atactic sequencies of various length . it is proposed that the formation of atactic sequence is triggered by the insertion of a comonomer . it seems likely that MBI can shift from a stereoselective to a non-stereoselective state due to an interaction with higher linear or branched comonomer . copolymer of ethylene ( e ) with norbornene ( N ) were synthesized using the catalyst rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO ( 1 ) , <nUm> % rac / <nUm> % meso-Et(4,7-Me2Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO ( 2 ) , and rac-H2C(3-t-BuInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO ( 3 ) . catalyst activity , molar mass ( MM ) , and copolymer composition were studied a a function of time . the polymer showed an unusually narrow molar mass distribution ( MMD ) and a significant increase of their MM with time for up to one hour , suggesting a " quasi-living " polymerization at <nUm> ° C . the experimental data were fitted to kinetic equation and the propagation and transfer reaction were described in quantitative term . norbornene greatly depressed the propagation rate , along with the chain transfer rate . the more sterically hindered catalyst of the series showed lower propagation and chain transfer turnover frequency than <nUm> and yielded polymer with a low ( 2 ) to very low ( 3 ) norbornene content . the presence of norbornene in solution seemed to be one of the main factor responsible for the observed " quasi-living " character of the copolymerization , probably due to coordination of norbornene to the active site . time - resolved kinetic study also allowed for the calculation of the fraction of active metal center , ranging from <nUm> % ( 3 ) and 66-68 % ( 1 ) to <nUm> % ( 2 ) of the total zirconium present , depending on catalyst structure . UV - vi spectroscopic study revealed that vinyl-cyclohexane interaction with zirconocene catalyst is enhanced on light exposure . if oxygen is present it interacts with the catalyst , hindering vinylcyclohexane interaction and consequently lowering the catalyst activity . the catalyst activity can be recovered with light exposure if low O concentration are used since in light the zirconocene-vinylcyclohexane interaction is favoured over the zirconocene-O2 interaction . moreover , 1H NMR study of the reaction product showed that the structure of the vinylcyclohexane - based specie produced with light irradiation were identical to the specie produced in dark . this indicates that light exposure of the catalytic system doe not change the reaction mechanism . the origin of the syndiotactic selectivity in propene polymerization of a typical bridged fluorenyl-amido catalyst , namely [Me2Si(3,6-di-tert-butyl-9-fluorenyl)(Ntert-buty]) ] Cl2Ti ( 1 ) , activated with methylaluminoxane or [HMe2N(C6H5)][B(C6 F5)4 ] / al(i-butyl)3 , wa investigated by mean of <nUm> MHz 13C NMR spectroscopic microstructural polymer analysis . the asymmetric induction wa traced unambiguously to enantiotopic - site control . compared with the better - known cyclopentadienyl-fluorenyl ansa - zirconocenes , <nUm> turned out to be almost identically enantioselective ( in agreement with computer modeling ) , but le stereoselective because of a higher propensity to undergo site epimerization . this result in a chain microstructure with large predominance of m over mm stereodefects , deceptively similar to that of syndiotactic poly(propylene) produced under chain - end control . the synthesis of C1 - symmetric zirconocene complex bearing the 2,5-dimethyl-7H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:4,3-b']dithiophene ligand ( S 2-3 ) linked to substituted cyclopentadienes is described . different synthesis of S2-3 , the common intermediate for the preparation of these complex , are discussed . many of these complex have been found to be highly active in propylene polymerization , to require very low amount of methylalumoxane to be activated , and to produce poly(propylene)s of low isotacticity and melting point . 13C NMR analysis show that the poly(propylene)s are fully regioregular and that the stereoerrors are randomly distributed , a shown by the enantiomorphic - site triad test e ≈ <nUm> . the experimental pentad distribution wa fitted using a two - site model with different probability parameter for each site . the probability of chain back - skip wa also taken into account . the molecular weight and crystallinity of the poly(propylene)s are dependent upon the type of substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ring , and the correlation between mmmm content and melting point of the PP confirms the random distribution of stereoerrors . sixteen C1 - symmetric zirconocene and one hafnocene complex bearing the 2,5-R2-7H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:4,3-b']dithiophene ligand ( r = H , me , et , ph ) linked to a substituted indenyl ligand have been synthesized and tested in propylene polymerization . most of the C 1-symmetric zirconocenes of this type are highly active in propylene polymerization at low MAO / Zr ratio and produce poly(propylene)s ( PP ) in a broad range of isotacticity and melting point . the molecular weight and crystallinity of the PPs are strongly dependent upon the type of substituents on the indenyl moiety : PPs with Tm between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C and viscosity average molecular weight between <nUm> <nUm> and <nUm> <nUm> have been obtained at 50-70 ° C in liquid propylene . copolymerizations of ethylene and disubstituted diallylsilanes ( CH <nUm> = CH-CH2)2R2Si ( r = CH3 , C6H5 ) have been investigated with various zirconocene catalyst using methylaluminoxane a a cocatalyst . the bridged stereospecific catalyst showed a higher reactivity for disubstituted diallylsilanes than the non-bridged aspecific catalyst , disubstituted diallylsilanes were incorporated into the polymer chain via cyclization insertion preferentially , and formed 3,5-disubstituted silacyclohexane unit in the polyethylene main chain . A zirconocene catalyst , dimethylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride , produced a copolymer containing pendant ullyl group derived from the 1,2-insertion of diallyldiphenylsilane without cyclization . we have confirmed that water- and pentafluorophenol - modified isobutylmethylaluminoxane ( W / PM - MMAO ) enhances the productivity and stereoregularity of the yielded polymer and increase it molecular weight when propylene is polymerized using C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes . 13C NMR analysis show that when W / PM - MMAO is used a a cocatalyst with C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes , although the pentad peak of the stereoerrors derived from enantiofacial misinsertion have still existed ; those derived from the epimerization of the growing chain end that occurred with b-hydride elimination disappear . therefore , we propose that W / PM - MMAO interacts more strongly to the cationic metal center of metallocene than doe MMAO owing to steric and electronic effect , and W / PM - MMAO suppresses b-hydride elimination , resulting in the production of polypropylene with higher molecular weight and isotacticity . to the contrary , there wa no significant difference in the structure of the yielded polymer when W / PM - MMAO wa used with Cs - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes . In the case of C s-symmetric ansa - zirconocene , the stereoerror is mostly the result of monomer insertion error , and small amount of stereoerror caused by " skipped " insertion , not from the epimerization of the polymer chain end that occurs after b-hydride elimination ; therefore , there might not be any difference of the microstructure of yielded polymer between MMAO and W / PM - MMAO . it can be concluded that the both case of C2- and C s-symmetric ansa - zirconocenes are used a a catalyst , and water and phenol modification of MMAO doe not affect the monomer misinsertion which is one of the mechanism of the stereoerrors . propylene wa polymerised at varying trimethyl-aluminium ( TMA ) concentration with two metallocenes activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) in an attempt to better understand the effect of TMA on the activation process , catalyst activity and termination reaction . A chemical treatment of MAO solution with 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol wa used to obtain TMA - free polymerisation condition . the metallocene precursor under investigation were diphenyl-methyl(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) and rac-dimethylsilylbis(4-tert-butyl-2-methyl-cyclo-pentadienyl)zirconium dichloride ( 2 ) . chain transfer to aluminium wa the dominating termination route for <nUm> / MAO accompanied with b-H / b-CH3 transfer to Zr and b-H transfer to monomer . it wa found that b-H / b-CH3 transfer to Zr wa favoured over the b-H transfer to monomer at elevated temperature , and that polymerisation and b-H transfer to monomer depended on the same critical reaction . for <nUm> / MAO the detected termination route were b-H transfer to Zr and chain transfer to aluminium . A strong activity dependency on TMA concentration wa observed . with <nUm> / MAO high TMA concentration decreased and stabilised the activity , whereas TMA free polymerisation condition at <nUm> ° C increased markedly the activity , indicating that TMA coordinated to the active site of <nUm> / MAO . surprisingly , with more sterically hindered <nUm> / MAO , high TMA concentration increased the activity and nearly complete activity loss occurred at TMA - free polymerisation condition at <nUm> ° C . Rac-[CH2(2,4-di-tert-butyl-cyclopentadienyl)2]- Cl2Zr ( 1 ) , rac-[CH2(3-tert-butyl-4,5,6,7- tetrahydroindenyl)2]-ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , rac - [ CH 2(3-isopropyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)2]-ZrCl <nUm> ( 3 ) , and rac-[CH2(3-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl) 2]ZrCl2 ( 4 ) were synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR analysis . these C2 symmetric ansa - zirconocenes , activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , were able to promote copolymerization of ethene and 1,3-butadiene . the structure of the copolymer are strongly influenced by zirconocene utilized a catalytic precursor . depending on the reaction condition polyethenes containing cyclopropane and cyclopentane ring , or 1,1- 1,3-butadiene inserted constitutional unit , were obtained . reaction of <nUm> and <nUm> with MAO and MMAO were monitored by EPR . it wa found that MMAO is a stronger reducing agent than MAO . <nUm> is more prone to reduction than <nUm> . the reduction of IVZr to ZrIII seems to be the essential pathway of some zirconocene catalyst ' deactivation . ZrIII specie with the following proposed structure can be identified in the <nUm> / MMAO system : (2-PhInd)2ZrIII(iBu) , ( 2-PhInd ) 2ZrIII(m-Cl)2AliBu2 , (2-PhInd)2ZrIII(m-Cl)(iBu)Al iBu2 , and [(2-PhInd)2ZrIII] +[Me-MAO]- . the degree of reduction of IVZr specie determined by EPR in the catalytic system <nUm> / MMAO can be masked by the formation of diamagnetic ZrIIIVZrIII dimer . addition of monomer to the <nUm> / MAO system promotes reduction ot the zirconium specie . reactive specie in O2Si - supported , zirconocene - based olefin - polymerization catalyst have been characterized by comparison of their UV - vi spectrum with those of related , NMR - spectroscopically identified catalyst specie in homogeneous solution . neutral zirconocene dihydride complex are found to arise in hydrocarbon solution a well a on O2Si support when catalyst system that contain rac-Me2Si(ind) 2ZrCl2 and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) are modified by addition of diisobutylaluminum hydride or triisobutylaluminum . these complex , tentatively formulated a adduct with lewis-acidic alkylaluminum specie AlR2X , racMe2Si(ind)2ZrH2 *{nAlR2X} , are reconverted into the initial reactive zirconocene cation upon addition of isobutene to these reaction system . nano-polyethylene fiber and floccule were prepared under atmospheric pressure via ethylene extrusion polymerization in suit , using the SBA-15 - supported Cp2ZrCl2 catalytic system . the major morphology unit in the sample were fiber and floccule . the diameter of the single nano-fibers wa 120-200 nm . the single nano-fibers could aggregate to form fiber aggregate and bundle . the number of PE floccule increased with extension of polymerization time , while the melting point of PE with nano-fibers wa little higher than that of common polyethylene . none the use of ultraviolet / visible spectroscopy ( UV-Vis ) for the prediction of metallocene catalyst potential for the polymerisation of olefin is described . upon addition of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) to rac-[C2H4(1-indenyl)2ZrCl2] ( [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> ) the ligand-to-metal charge transfer band show a hypsochromic shift while a bathochromic shift is observed when more MAO is added ( [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> ) . these shift can be explained by assuming that methylation of the zirconocene by MAO occurs in the case of [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> while a cationic complex , the active catalytic system , is formed upon addition of more MAO , e.g. , [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> . A series of tert-butyl substituted zirconocene / methylaluminoxane catalyst illustrates the potential for the tailoring of olefin oligomers with extremely narrow molar mass distribution , which are explained on the basis of a chain-length dependent propagation rate . comparative oligomerization experiment provide a mean to estimate the relative rate for chain propagation versus chain transfer a well a a correlation with the metallocene structure . three kind of zirconocene catalyst , supported on polysiloxanes substituted with methylindenyl , methyl-fluorenyl and two indenyl group , respectively , were prepared and applied to propene and ethylene polymerization using methylaluminoxane a cocatalyst . both the activity and stereospecificity of these catalyst were found to lie between those of corresponding homogeneous and SiO2-supported catalyst . surprisingly , all the catalyst gave a mixture of atactic and isotactic poly(propylene) , plausible reason for which are briefly discussed . ethylene wa polymerized in toluene using methylalumoxane ( MAO ) activated rac-(Me2SiOSiMe2)[Ind]2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) and rac-(Me2SiOSiMe2)[IndH4]2MtCl <nUm> ( Mt = Zr ( 2 ) ; Mt = Ti ( 3 ) ) . all three catalyst system polymerize ethylene with high activity . the molecular weight of polymer produced with zirconocene ( 1 ) wa up to a weight - average molecular weight mw = <nUm> × <nUm> at low polymerization temperature ( < <nUm> ° C ) under atmospheric pressure . the titanocene catalyst <nUm> show lower activity and produced lower molecular weight polyethylene than zirconocenes <nUm> and <nUm> . replacement of aromatic ring in <nUm> by cyclohexane ring , leading to <nUm> , increase activity and reduces molecular weight . the catalyst system show a dependency of the activity on temperature . the disiloxane - bridged zirconocene complex , tetramethyldisiloxanediylbis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride and tetramethyldisiloxanediylbis(cyclopentadienyl)dimethylzirconium initiate the homopolymerization of ethene a well a the copolymerization of ethene and a-olefin with a modified methylaluminoxane a cocatalyst . the catalyst system give resonable activity but the molecular weight of polyethene decrease drastically with increasing polymerization temperature . In the polymerization of ethene cocatalyzed with modified methylaluminoxane , the catalyst activity of the siloxane - bridged dinuclear zirconocenes , tetramethyldisiloxanediylbis(cyclopentadienylindenylzirconium dichloride ) ( 3 ) and hexamethyltrisiloxanediylbis(cyclopentadienylindenylzirconium dichloride ) ( 4 ) were lower than that obtained with the siloxane - bridged mononuclear zirconocene , tetramethyldisiloxanediyldicyclopentadienyldimethylzirconium ( 1 ) . on the other hand , weight - average molecular weight mw and ratio of weight- to number - average molecular weight mw / mn of polyethene ( PE ) obtained with <nUm> or <nUm> were higher than those of PE obtained with <nUm> . for a binary mixture of <nUm> / <nUm> or <nUm> / <nUm> , it wa found that the obtained PE exhibit a bimodal molecular weight distribution for an appropriate composition of the mixed zirconocenes . mw / mn of PE could be adjusted by changing the relative concentration of the two zirconocenes . new supported catalyst on the basis of cyclopentadienylindenylzirconium dichloride ( CpIndZrCl2 ) anchored on silica with a trisiloxane spacer ( ZATS ) and a pentamethylene spacer ( ZAPM ) were prepared and used for ethylene polymerization with modified methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) a cocatalyst . ZATS and ZAPM produce polyethylene with lower molecular weight but show higher activity than silica - supported CpIndZrCl2 which wa prepared by reacting zirconocene directly with silica , i.e. , the activity of silica - supported CpIndZrCl2 is enhanced by introducing a spacer between silica surface and metallocene specie . ethylene-propene copolymerization wa carried out with Cp2MCl2 ( cp = cyclopentadienyl ) , rac-Et(Ind)2MCl2 , rac-Me2Si(Ind)2MCl2 ( et = ethylene , Me2Si = dimethylsilyl , ind = indenyl , m = Zr or Hf ) / methylaluminoxane . In the case of using ansa - hafnocenes , the minimum molecular size ( extended chain length ) of ethylene-propene copolymer wa obtained at about <nUm> mol- % of propene content in the copolymer . the polymerization activity decreased with increase of propene feed ratio in non-bridged non-specific metallocenes . higher polymerization activity were observed for the copolymerization compared to ethylene and propene homo-polymerization with ansa - isospecific metallocenes . the factor of molecular size lowering wa studied by the chain propagation and chain transfer reaction . copolymerizations of propene and buta-1,3-diene performed in the presence of rac-[CH2(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2] Cl2Zr and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) have been investigated . buta-1,3-diene give prevailingly primary coordination to the metal , producing overall <nUm> unit . cyclopropane and cyclopentane ring , although in low amount , are also obtained . the presence of butadiene would be responsible for some regioirregular 2,1-inserted propene unit , which at high temperature give rearrangement to <nUm> unit . propylene wa copolymerized with 1,4-divinylbenzene ( 1,4-DVB ) using rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2ZrCl2 and MAO in the presence of hydrogen . 1H NMR spectrum of the obtained copolymer confirmed the successful incorporation of 1,4-DVB . 13C NMR analysis revealed a unique copolymer structure with the incorporated 1,4-DVB unit predominantly forming 1,4-substituted phenyl repeating unit in the polymer main chain . A plausible mechanism involving spontaneous insertion of terminal styryl into Zr-H specie wa proposed to rationalize the unique incorporation of 1,4-DVB . norbomene ( NB ) wa oligomerized at <nUm> ° C using AlEt2Cl- Cl4Ti at a monomer / titanium molar ratio of about <nUm> . the oligomerization product consists of a fraction soluble in diethyl ether , amorphous by x-ray examination , and of a crystalline fraction , insoluble in diethyl ether . the crystalline fraction wa shown by powder x-ray diffraction to consist of a NB heptamer . single - crystal x-ray analysis indicated that the heptamer had a stereoregular 2,3-exo-disyndiotactic structure . the heptamer , adopts a strained , highly irregular , folded conformation in the crystalline state . structural difference with respect in NB oligomers obtained with zirconocene catalyst are discussed . the ability of a Cl2Mg support to activate a transition metal catalyst ha been found to depend both on the crystallographic structure of the support and on the nature of the catalyst . A high degree of crystallographic disorder can be very effective for the immobilization and activation of titanium and vanadium complex , but is not necessarily effective for zirconocene activation . A highly disordered support prepared by the reaction of MgBu <nUm> with ClH gave high activity with Cl4Ti but low activity with (n-PrCp)2ZrCl2 . high polymerization activity with the zirconocene were only obtained with support of type ClMg <nUm> / AlRn(OEt)3-n prepared from the reaction of AlR3 with Cl2Mg · 1.1EtOH . these support are characterized by additional peak in the x-ray diffraction pattern , indicating the presence of a crystalline structure which is absent in the other support and contains highly lewis acidic site able to generate the active metallocenium specie . catalytic nature of organometallic catalyst are modulated by coordinating organic ligand with proper steric and electronic property to metal center . carbon - based nanomaterials such a graphene nanoplatelets are used with and without N - doping and multiwalled carbon nanotube a a ligand for ethylene polymerization . zirconocenes or titanocenes are immobilized on such nanomaterials . polyethylene ( EsP ) produced by such hybrid show a great increase in molecular weight relative to those produced by free catalyst . specially , ultra-high-molecular-weight EsP are produced from the polymerization at low temperature using the hybrid with N - doped graphene nanoplatelets . this result show that such nanomaterials act a crucial role to tune the catalytic nature of metallocenes . hydrozirconation on vinyl-terminated substrate ( silicon wafer and nanosilica sphere ) is employed a an efficient way for immobilization of zirconocene catalyst through Zr-C bond , which is applied in surface coordination ethylene polymerization producing surface - tethered polyethylene ( PE ) . the formation of Zr-C σ bond induced by hydrozirconation provides an initiator precursor for growing a layer of PE covalently linked onto substrate . the result from SEM , AFM , and TEM show that the surface polymerization is controlled by hydrozirconation . surface pattern or core - shell structure with crystalline PE coating can be formed , when silicon wafer is selectively functionalized with vinyl-groups or vinyl-modified nanosilica is applied . it is believed that hydrozirconation for the synthesis of zirconocene initiator can be a versatile route to prepare polyolefin hybrid material . the homogeneous Ziegler-Natta – catalyst , consisting of a zirconocene compound and methyl-aluminoxane , lead to extremely high polymerization activity . with bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride pure atactic polypropylene and polyethylene with activity up to <nUm> g PE / g zr*h are formed . the higher the degree of oligomerization of the aluminoxane the more active are the catalyst . the density of polyethylene ( LLDPE ) can be lowered by using 1-butene or 1-hexene a comonomers . incorporation of dienes give EPDM-elastomers . highly isotactic polypropylene can be prepared by using chiral rac-ethylene bi – ( tetrahydroindenyl ) zirconium dichloride together with methylaluminoxane a cocatalyst . the toluene soluble part here consists of le than <nUm> weight percent . after resolution of this racemate it is also possible to produce optically active polypropylene and polybutene . with homogenous catalyst on the basis of chiral metallocenes and methylaluminoxane it ha become possible to polymerize cyclic olefin like cyclobutene , cyclopentene or norbornene . No ring opening reaction occurs . the crystalline polycycloalkenes show extremly high melting point between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C . copolymer of cyclopentene with propene are amorphous . they have a low molecular weight and glass transition point . on the other hand the glass transition temperature of norbornene / ethene copolymer exceeds <nUm> ° C . these copolymer could be used a material for optical disc and fiber . zirconocene complex carrying substituents at various position of their ring-bridged ligand framework were studied a catalyst for methylalumoxane-activated propene polymerization . effect of different substitution pattern on catalyst activity and on chain length and stereo- and regio-regularities of the polymer produced are correlated with geometrical feature of the complex , e.g. with parameter describing their structural rigidity or the aperture and obliquity of their coordination gap . rac-Ethylenebis(1-e5-indenyl)dimethylzirconium ( 1 ) wa reacted with triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( 2 ) to produce in situ the rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)methylzirconium cation ( 3 ) . this aluminium-free catalyst showed propene polymerization activity ( A ) and stereoselectivity which both increase with the decrease of polymerization temperature ( tp ) . At very low tp , <nUm> behaved a a “ single-site ” catalyst . an efficient way to produce such cation is to react ansa-zirconocene dichloride with <nUm> in the presence of TEA ( = triethylaluminium ) . A superior cationic catalyst wa obtained from rac-dimethylsilylenebis(1-e5-indenyl)dichlorozirconium , <nUm> , and TEA , which polymerizes propene at − <nUm> ° C(-55 ° C ) with activity of <nUm> × <nUm> ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) g polypropene per ( mol Zr η mol CH2 η h ) to polypropene which are <nUm> % ( <nUm> % ) isotactic with melting temperature Tm = <nUm> ° C ( <nUm> ° C ) and viscosity-average molecular weight mv = <nUm> × <nUm> ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) . the addition of methylaluminoxane lower the A of the cationic catalyst especially at low tp . rigorously speaking , the cation derived from <nUm> or <nUm> behaves a a “ single site ” catalyst only at very low tp . the use of TEA significantly and unexpectedly enhances the efficiency of the zirconocenium catalyst system . through polymerizing propene by mean of the catalyst system iPr[3-MeCpFlu]ZrCl2 / MAO it wa possible for the first time to generate hemiisotactic poly(propylene) ; the microstructure of this polymer is characterized by an alternating sequence of monomer unit with equal and statistical configuration . iPr[3-MeCpFlu]ZrCl2 is one of the new developed stereorigid ansa-metallocene catalyst which by mean of the structure of the bridged e-ligand system are considered to give access to the description and calculation of the behaviour of the stereospecifity . In the present paper the a-olefin polymerization wa investigated with the iPr[3-MeCpFlu]ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst system by mean of kinetics and product analytics ; parameter were the [Al] : [Zr] ratio , the monomer concentration , the polymerization temperature , the polarity of the solvent a well a the chain length of the starting a-olefin . the order of the polymerization reaction concerning the propene concentration wa found to be <nUm> ; this broken order indicates a complex reaction . concerning the dependency of the polymerization rate on the [Al] : [Zr] ratio a bell-shaped curve wa found ; obviously , at very high [Al] : [Zr] ratio the complex MAO compound inhibits the active zirconocene centre . the microstructure of the poly(propylene)s generated in toluene at <nUm> ° C corresponds with the expected hemiisotactic structure . on the contrary , the microstructure of the poly(propylene)s generated in toluene at higher polymerization temperature and in the polar solvent o-dichlorobenzene and methylene chloride at <nUm> ° C show considerable deviation from a hemiisotactic structure . under these polymerization condition the stereospecifity of the iPr[3-MeCpFlu]ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst can only be satisfyingly explained with isomerization reaction of the active zirconocene specie between two insertion step . these isomerization reaction without monomer coordination occur preferably starting from the unstereospecific state of the catalyst . this interpretation is confirmed by 1-butene and 1-hexene polymerization experiment . the polymerization kinetics of propene polymerization using metallocene / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) homogeneous catalyst have been investigated to explore the role of donor / acceptor interaction and to enhance the catalyst productivity . In the case of the non-stereospecific Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO model system it ha been demonstrated that , in addition to the well known irreversible deactivation , reversible deactivation , which are second order relative to the zirconium active site concentration , account for the decay of the polymerization rate . while MAO injection during polymerization enhances the polymerization rate , zirconocene addition deactivates the catalyst which can be reactivated by injecting additional MAO . A sequence of dynamic equilibrium involving the formation of active cationic metallocene intermediate a well a inactive zirconocene specie , e.g. , zirconocene dimer , is proposed . lewis base and lewis acid additive have been added a probe to examine the role of such equilibrium in the case of metallocene-based catalyst system such a MAO-activated Cp2ZrCl2 , racemic ethylenebisindenyl zirconium dichloride ( EBIZrCl2 ) , and racemic ethylenebis ( 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl ) zirconium dichloride ( EBTHIZrCl2 ) . while the conventional donor such a 2,6-ditert.butyl-4-methylphenol ( BHT ) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine ( TMP ) reduce catalyst productivity , even at very low donor / Al molar ratio , increasing propene concentration and addition of trimethylboroxine ( TMB ) substantially enhance catalyst productivity and affect molecular weight of the polypropylene produced with metallocene / MAO catalyst . Me2C[1-Cp-9-Flu]ZrCl2 derivative with H- , CH3-and (CH3)3C- substituents β to the cp bridgehead carbon atom a well a complex having mono- or di-substituted fluorenyl ligand ( r = CH3- , (CH3)3C- , CH3O- , CH3OCH2- , C5H9 ≡ C- , (CH3)2N- , F- , and cl- ) have been investigated a propylene polymerization pro-catalysts . steric effect from the b-Cp substituents determine the iso- , hemi-iso- , and syndio-specificities of the catalyst . the relative stereospecificities of Me2Si[1-Cp-3t-Bu-9-Flu]ZrCl2 and rac-Me2Si[1-Ind-3-t-Bu]2ZrCl2 are in accord with molecular model . the more un-symmetrical the catalyst are the more m and mm stereosequences there are in s-PP . the m dyad also increase with the concentration of Me2C[1-Cp-9-Flu-2-OMe]ZrCl2 . structure-performance relationship in the propene polymerization behaviour of a number of silicon bridged bisindenyl zirconocenes show a rational pattern . prognosis of the polymerization behaviour of different type structure , however , often fails , which is demonstrated by three example of new zirconocenes . these include two bisindenyl complex with two-membered silicon bridge and one isospecific bridged fluorenyl cyclopentadienyl specie . it is thus demonstrated that the scope of a “ rational catalyst design ” in the field of metallocene catalyst is still limited . most of the supported metallocene catalyst reported so far have been devised to immobilize metallocenes on the solid surface utilizing the ionic interaction between metallocenes and surface active site . whereas , we have been challenging to prepare more rigidly immobilized catalyst by using the chemically modified O2Si . the SiO2-supported zirconocene catalyst thus prepared could be activated by ordinary trialkylaluminiums like Al(i-C4H9)3 to give highly isotactic polypropene ( PP ) with high melting temperature ( Tm ) and number-average molecular weight ( Mn ) . this paper summarizes the result obtained so far . ab-initio molecular dynamic simulation on ethylene insertion in a bridged di(cyclopentadienyl) methylzirconocene have revealed that the entire reaction path starting from the p-coordinated ethylene-zirconocene complex up to and including propyl formation take place in about <nUm> femtosecond , which is unexpectedly fast , and suggesting the absence of any significant barrier of activation . starting from a reactant structure without a-H agostic interaction , at T = <nUm> K such an interaction evolves during the course of the insertion reaction and before the propyl is formed . the product state exhibit g-H agostic interaction . the isolation of non-fluxional alumoxane compound , [(tBu)2Al{OAl(tBu)2}]2 and [(tBu)AlO]n ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) , ha allowed for an investigation of the mode of activity observed for alumoxanes a co-catalysts for the zirconocene polymerization of olefin . [(tBu)2Al{OAl(tBu)2}]2 , which contains two three-coordinate aluminum center , show no reaction with Cp2ZrMe2 , and no catalytic activity towards ethylene polymerization . In contrast , the closed cage compound [(tBu)AlO]6 reacts reversibly to give the ion pair complex , [Cp2ZrMe][(rBu)6Al6O6Me] , which is active a a catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene . polymerization is also observed for mixture of Cp2ZrMe2 with [(tBu)AlO]n ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) . A new concept , “ latent lewis acidity ” , is proposed to account for the reactivity of the cage alumoxanes , [(tBu)AlO]n. metallocene / MAO catalyst are useful for the production of syndiotactic polystyrene - a new class of high performance polymer . the melting point of the obtained syndiotactic polystyrene depends on the metallocene used and can reach up to <nUm> ° C . In the past , the most active catalyst in polymerization have been half - sandwich titanocenes such a CpTiCl3 and Cp*TiCl3 . if the chlorinated compound are changed into the fluorinated compound a CpTiF3 and Cp*TiF3 , the activity increase by a factor of <nUm> to <nUm> . the fluorinated titanocenes are more stable at higher temperature and need a lower MAO excess in order to obtain optimal activity . polymer obtained with the unsubstituted CpTiF3 show melting point which are <nUm> ° C lower than those synthesized by pentamethylcyclopentadienyltitaniumtrifluoride . especially Cp*TiF3 show a much higher activity and , compared with the chlorinated compound , give polymer with a higher molecular weight . substituted cyclopentadienyltitanocenes have even higher activity . ethene / styrene copolymer can be obtained by catalysis with zirconocene compound . combined system including diphenylzinc ( Ph2Zn ) , a metallocene , and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , have been employed to initiate the copolymerization of styrene ( S ) with p-alkylsubstituted styrene and with a-olefins . the copolymerization process depend largely on the comonomer , the nature of the metallocene included in the initiator system , the presence of Ph2Zn , the polymerization temperature and the solvent used . titanocenes produced true copolymer for S / p - substituted styrene , but not in S / a-olefin copolymerization . on the other hand zirconocenes either did not copolymerize S / p - substituted styrene or produced very low conversion , while they succeeded in copolymerizing S / a-olefin , depending on the particular zirconocene employed . A low p-methylstyrene ( p-MeS ) content in the S / p-MeS copolymer and a low p-tertbutylstyrene ( p-ButS ) content in the S / p-ButS copolymer decreased Tm , making them easier to process material than s-PS . metallocenes are highly active catalyst for the production of precisely designed polyolefins and engineering plastic . especially zirconocene / methylalumoxane ( MAO ) catalyst and half - sandwich titanium complex have opened a frontier in the area of new polymer synthesis and processing . the material obtained show different microstructures , tacticities and property compared with conventional polymer . alternating ethene / propene polymer show lower glass transition temperature than random copolymer . constrained geometry catalyst are useful for the synthesis of norbornene / ethene copolymer . In the present paper the effect of the solvent , a lewis base and of non-polymerizable olefin on copolymerization of propene with higher a-olefins performed with isospecific ansa - zirconocene catalyst are investigated . A wide range of solvent with increasing polarity , donor character and steric hindrance ha been tested , and their effect on copolymer yield , composition and microstructure thoroughly analyzed . our result demonstrate that the solvent can have a significant influence on the copolymer composition , even though the solvent polarity is not the relevant factor . polymerization carried out in coordinating solvent , e.g. aromatic solvent , lead to the formation of product with considerably decreased higher a-olefin content . the reduced incorporation of the higher a-olefin is explained in term of competition between the nucleophilic medium and the olefin monomer for coordination to the active polymerisation site . the dependence of polymer microstructure on the solvent nucleophilicity is further elucidated by copolymerization study performed in the presence of diisopropyldimethoxysilane a a lewis base . the addition of the non-polymerizable olefin , 2-methyl-1-pentene , which doe not significantly affect comonomer composition , seems to slightly modify comonomer distribution . the sum of the result obtained give u valuable information regarding the mechanism of polymerisation at the active center . copolymerization of ethylene and 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) by zirconocene catalyst proceeded via cyclization - addition mechanism to form 1,3-didsubstituted cyclopentane structure in the polyethylene chain . the 1,3-cyclopentane structure wa found to be taken in the crystalline structure of polyethylene ( isomorphism ) by partially chainging the trans zigzag chain into gauche conformation , thereby , inducing a transformation of orthorhombic crystal to pseudohexagonal crystal . copolymerization of ethylene and cyclopentene ( CPE ) by zirconocene catalyst yielded copolymer having 1,2-disubstituted cyclopentane structure in the polyethylene chain . the 1,2-cyclopentane structure wa not taken into the crystalline structure of polyethylene . the melting point ( Tm ) and the crystallinity ( xc ) of polyethylene decreased by copolymerization of HD or CPE , and the tm- and xc - decreasing effect of CPE wa stronger than HD . for copolymer of propylene and HD or CPE obtained with isospecific zirconocene catalyst , the isomorphism wa not ovserved . combined system including diphenylzinc , Ph2Zn , a metallocene , and methylaluminoxane , MAO , have been employed to initiate styrene polymerization and the copolymerization of styrene with p-alkylsubstituted styrene and a-olefins . both polymerization and copolymerization process depend on the nature of the metallocene included in the initiator system , the presence of Ph2Zn , the temperature , and the solvent used . S / 1-alkene copolymer were obtained when the initiator system included a zirconocene , but not when a titanocene participated . copolymer of propene and several higher a-olefins , 1-butene , 1-pentene , 1-hexene , 1-heptene , 1-octene , and 4-methyl-1-pentene ( 4M1P ) , have been prepared with two different metallocene catalyst , rac - Et(Ind) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( EI ) and rac-Me <nUm> Si(2-MeBenz-[e]Ind) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( MBI ) , and comprehensively characterized by <nUm> C NMR spectroscopy . all copolymer produced with EI have comparable isotacticities a well a similar stereosequences . the copolymer produced with MBI significantly differ both from the reference propene homopolymer and among themselves : in fact , they are characterized by rather low isotacticities and the degree of tacticity is strongly influenced by comonomer type and concentration . A detailed <nUm> C NMR analysis revealed that these copolymer are constituted by highly isotactic and atactic sequence of various length . the similar thermal behavior , in term of transition temperature , for the homologues of the series obtained with the two different catalyst show that the capability of crystallization of these system is not directly connected to the overall microstructural property ( e.g. the isotacticity index ) but can be accounted for by the detail of the microstructure . dual - site ethene / 1-hexene copolymerizations with MAO - activated (1,2,4-Me3Cp)2ZrCl2 and ( Me5Cp ) 2ZrCl2 catalyst were performed . copolymer with narrow molecular weight distribution and bimodal short chain branching distribution could be produced . the combined catalyst system demonstrates a number of discrepancy from an expected average behavior of the individual site . dual - site (1,2,4-Me3Cp)2ZrCl2 / ( me 5Cp)2ZrCl2 system produce copolymer with lower incorporation than expected . clear evidence for relative activity enhancement of the (Me5Cp)2ZrCl2 catalyst in the mixture were observed in melting endotherms and crystaf profile . molecular weight obtained by the mixture were higher than for any of the individual catalyst . A similar effect is observed for a dual - site system of the (1,2,4-Me3Cp)2ZrCl2 catalyst together with the Me4Si2(Me4Cp)2ZrCl2 catalyst a an alternative to (Me5Cp)2ZrCl2 . A set of different 1- and 2-silyl-substituted zirconocene dichloride / MAO catalyst system wa investigated with respect to their performance in ethene / 1-hexene copolymerisations . in-depth study of bis(2- dimethylsilylindenyl ) zirconium(IV) dichloride ( 1 ) revealed a multi-site behaviour , illustrating sensitivity to the reaction temperature and the comonomer mole fraction . surprisingly , an upper limit is observed for the latter , leading to complete catalyst inhibition . analysis of the chain termination process implies the possibility of a predominant , although in general le favourable , b-hydride elimination route under certain polymerisation condition . to increase the thermal stability of metallocene-methylaluminoxane catalyst , pentalene bridged zirconocenes and a constrained geometry catalyst were used for the copolymerisation of ethene and norbornene . the constrained geometry catalyst is stable in solution up to <nUm> ° C . surprisingly the molecular weight of the copolymer increase with higher incorporation rate of norbornene . glass transition temperature of <nUm> ° C are reached . the microstructure of the cyclic olefin copolymer material is more alternating . result of our study on polymerization kinetics and test of copolymerization statistical model of ethylene-norbornene ( E-N ) copolymer obtained on the basis of microstructures determined by 13C NMR analysis are reported , ethylene-norbornene ( E-N ) copolymer were synthesized by catalytic system composed of racemic isospecific metallocenes , i-Pr[(3Pr i-Cp)(Flu)]ZrCl2 or a constrained geometry catalyst ( CGC ) and methylaluminoxane . polymerization kinetics revealed that E-N copolymerization is quasi living under standard polymerization condition . calculation of the number of active site and of chain propagation and chain transfer turnover frequency indicate that the metal is mainly in the Mt-N* state , while the Mt-E* state contributes more to transfer and propagation rate . the first - order and the second - order markov statistic have been tested by using the complete tetrad distribution obtained from 13C NMR analysis of copolymer microstructures . the root-mean-square deviation between experimental and calculated tetrad demonstrate that penultimate ( second - order markov ) effect play a decisive role in E-N copolymerizations . result show clue for more complex effect depending on the catalyst geometry in copolymer obtained at high N / e feed ratio . comonomer concentration wa shown to have a strong influence on copolymer microstructure and copolymer property . the copolymer microstructure of alternating isotactic copolymer obtained with i-Pr[(3Pri-Cp)(Flu)]ZrCl2 have been described at pentad level . second - order markov statistic better describes also the microstrucure of these copolymer . the olefin polymerisation activity of metallocene catalyst strongly depends on the counteranion provided by the activator system . the relative activity of a number of new diborate anion [ Z(BAr3) 2]- have been quantified ( z = CN , H2N , C2N3 ; Ar = C6F5 or o-C6F 4C6F5 ) . the kinetic parameter for the initiation , propagation and termination step of propene polymerisation catalysed by BCl2ISZr have been determined using quenched - flow kinetic and batch technique [ SBI = rac-Me2Si(1-Ind)2 ] . comparison of two activator system , ( i ) CPh3[B(C6F 5)4 ] / triisobutylaluminium ( TIBA ) and ( ii ) methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) show , surprisingly , that the concentration of specie actively involved in chain growth at any one time is comparable for both system , although the MAO - activated catalyst is about <nUm> time le active than the borate system . it is concluded that the counteranion remains sufficiently strongly bound to the metal centre throughout the chain growth sequence to modulate the energetics of monomer insertion . A model suggesting that the monomer binding follows an associative interchange ( ia ) mechanism is proposed . Diphenylzinc-metallocene-MAO initiator system have proven to be effective initiator system for styrene and for substituted styrene a well a for their styrene / ( styrene - derivative ) copolymerization . titanocene produced almost pure syndiotactic polymer while zirconocenes gave atactic polystyrene together with a low content , le than <nUm> % , of syndiotactic polystyrene . system including a zirconocene , particularly ethenyl(bisindenyl)zirconium dichloride were effective initiator of 1-alkene polymerization and of styrene / 1-alkene copolymerization . conversion to polymer increase with the molecular size of 1-alkene . styrene derivative and styrene / ( styrene derivative ) polymerization wa greatly influenced by the inductive effect of substituent and by steric hindrance due to the monomer . series of propene - norbornene ( P-N ) copolymer were synthesized in the presence of two C2 symmetric zirconocenes , rac - Et(Indenyl) 2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) and rac-Me2Si(Indenyl) 2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , and of the Cs symmetric zirconocene Me2C(Cp)(Fluorenyl)ZrCl2 ( 3 ) with MAO a cocatalyst . P-N copolymer were characterized by 13C NMR spectroscopy , SEC , and DSC . A first assignment of the main 13C NMR signal of P-N copolymer obtained with <nUm> and <nUm> containing isolated N unit wa obtained on the basis of DEPT experiment and by comparison with isotactic polypropene ( i-PP ) and E-N copolymer spectrum . ab initio theoretical 13C NMR chemical shift , combined with R.I.S . statistic of the P-N chain , gave important detailed indication for the assignment of the complex 13C spectrum of these copolymer . such assignment were used to estimate the N copolymer content . the comparison of N content value obtained from the area of different region of the spectrum reveals that <nUm> propene misinsertions are formed in greater amount a the [N] / [P] ratio of the feed increase . this may be due to the steric hindrance of the Mt - tertiary carbon bond when N is the last inserted unit , which make difficult the next propene insertion and cause the low polymerization activity , molecular mass and tg . the spectrum of P-N copolymer obtained with <nUm> revealed to be even more complex . A limited assignment of the spectrum ha been achieved . this allowed u to evaluate the N content in the copolymer and to evidence the low tendency of the Cs symmetric <nUm> to give <nUm> propene misinsertions in P-N copolymer . this is in agreement with the result observed with this catalyst in propene homopolymerization . olefin-diene copolymerizations in the presence of C2 symmetric zirconocene rac-[CH2(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 / MAO catalytic system have been reported and rationalized by experimental and molecular modeling study . ethene give 1,2-cyclopropane and 1,2-cyclopentane , 1,3-cydobutane , and 1,3- cyclopentane unit in copolymerization with 1,3-butadiene , 1,4-pentadiene , and 1,5- hexadiene , respectively . propene-1,3-butadiene copolymerizations lead to <nUm> and <nUm> butadiene unit and to a low amount of 1,2-cyclopropane unit . concomitant immobilization of zirconocene ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) into a silica matrix wa performed during the O2Si synthesis through non-hydrolytic sol - gel method . two different route , varying the ClSi <nUm> : Si(OEt)4 ratio were evaluated in term of zirconocene content and catalyst activity in ethylene polymerization , using methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) a cocatalyst . the catalyst were characterized by rutherford backscattering spectrometry , fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , diffuse reflectance spectroscopy , scanning electron microscopy and x-ray dispersive spectroscopy . the zirconocene content laid between <nUm> and <nUm> wt. % Zr / O2Si , depending upon the component ratio employed in the sol - gel synthesis . catalyst grain presented of irregular shape ( 20-100 mm size ) and zirconocene distribution wa not uniform . both route led to supported catalyst active in ethylene polymerization . catalyst activity wa intermediate between that exhibited by the homogeneous and the grafted zirconocene on silica . resulting polyethylene presented narrow molecular weight distribution and molecular weight slightly higher than that observed in the case of polymer produced with the homogeneous system . the recently described reaction product of zirconacyclopropenes cp 2Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) and five - membered zirconacyclocumulenes ( zirconacyclopenta-2,3,4-trienes ) Cp*2Zr(e4-1,2,3,4-RC4R) , cp* = e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl , r = me , Me3Si and ph , with i-Bu2AlH are active catalyst in the polymerization of ethylene and in the ring opening polymerization of e-caprolactone . here we describe the different activity of these complex after thermal activation or if additional i-Bu2AlH together with water are added . these result are compared to those which were obtained with the complex Cp2Zr(e 4-1,2,3,4-H2C4H2 ) , rac - (EBTHl)ZrF2 , roc(EBTHI)ZrCl2 , [ rac-(EBTHI)Zr(H)(m- H)]2 and roc (EBTHI)Zr(F)CH2 - CH2( 2-Py ) after activation with i-Bu2AlH together with water . reaction of Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 with excess methylalumoxane ( MAO ) give rise to ion pair containing zirconocenium cation of the type [Me2Si(Ind)2ZrMe]+ in contact with two type of anion , MeMAOA- and MeMAOB - , which differ in their coordinative strength : more strongly coherent contact - ion pair [ Me2Si(Ind)2 ZrMe +MeMAOB- ] are converted by a sufficiently high excess of MAO to more easily separable contact - ion pair [ Me2Si(Ind) 2ZrMe+MeMAOA- ] , which react with AlMe3 to form the outer - sphere ion pair [ Me2Si(Ind) 2Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2]+ MeMAO A- , and are likely to be required also for the formation of the olefin - containing reaction complex responsible for catalytic activity . exceptionally strong material could be synthesized by filled polyolefins with nanosized , regid particle or fiber . metallocene catalyst are excellent tool in the production of tailored microstructures a well a tacticitles of polypropylene . they are soluble in hydrocarbon and therefore can cover perfectly the surface of nano particle . here multi-walled carbon nanotube ( MWCNT ) ( diameter 15-25 nm , length up to <nUm> mm ) were used a filler . before polymerization , the filler were separated by ultra sound and then treated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . MAO reacts partially with defect and functional group of oxidized MWCNT . catalytically active center are formed after adding the zirconocenes or other transition metal complex directly on the CNT surface . the thickness of the polymer layer can be controlled by the monomer pressure and polymerization time . we obtained coating of <nUm> to <nUm> nm . by this method carbon nanotube can be covered also with isotactic or syndiotactic polypropylene , but also with polyethylene with any molecular mass . the nanocomposltes obtained were especially investigated In regard to their crystallization behavior , which depended significantly on the matrix used . the aluminohydride of zirconocene me 3SiCp 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> wa supported on pre-treated OSi <nUm> , and it catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization and ethylene-1-hexene copolymerization wa evaluated in order to compare with the corresponding activity of the complex in solution . As expected for system based on metallocenes , the aluminohydride of zirconocene complex showed higher activity in solution than in suspension , however it thermal and kinetic stability wa significantly increased . the effect of the co-catalyst concentration ( MAO ) on the activity and the molecular weight of the polymer are also reported in this study , finding that in heterogeneous phase low concentration of MAO were used to activate the pre-catalyst . the MW of the polymer and copolymer synthesized with the supported me 3SiCp 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> / OSi <nUm> could be controlled by adding molecular hydrogen ( H <nUm> ) a chain transfer agent in the polymerization and copolymerization reaction . copolymerizations of ethylene and a-olefins ( 1-hexene and 1-octene ) using a supported catalyst derived from the activation of a zirconocene aluminohydride complex with PMAO and MMAO are reported . the supported ( nBu-Cp 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> ) / OSi <nUm> / MAO system wa evaluated by high - throughput technique , in order to find approach to the optimal copolymerization condition . the polymerization reaction were carried out in a parallel polymerization reactor system ( PPR ) by symyx technology , inc . the screening of the activity of the supported system and the molecular weight ( MW ) of the polymer and copolymer obtained in the PPR , allowed u to optimize copolymerization condition , like hydrogen ( H <nUm> ) addition to control MW and molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) , polymerization temperature , cocatalyst ratio , and solvent type . the copolymerization reaction were scaled-up in order to validate the performance of the catalytic system at higher polymerization scale , according to the result obtained in the combinatorial phase . the scaled-up copolymerizations of ethylene with 1-hexene and 1-octene , showed high activity and MW , and low comonomer incorporation ( from <nUm> to <nUm> mol- % , determined by 13C NMR ) . however , the crystallinity ( x c ) , thermal property ( T c and T m ) and density of the polyethylene obtained with the supported ( nBu-Cp 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> ) / OSi <nUm> / MAO system , were significantly modified , approaching those of metallocene linear lowdensity polyethylene ( mLLDPE ) . binary metallocene - MAO and ternary diphenylzinc-metallocene-MAO initiator system have been tested a initiator in the homopolymerization of styrene and also in it copolymerization with several diverse comonomers including substituted styrene , styrene derivative , a-olefins and dienes . various titanocenes and zirconocenes and some exploratory experiment with hafnocene were carried out . the result indicate that titanocenes were more effective than zirconocenes in the homopolymerization of styrene while zirconocenes did better in a-olefin polymerization . it wa found that titanocenes generated mainly syndiotactic polystyrene , s-PS , while zirconocenes yielded atactic polystyrene or , depending on the zirconocene , a low percentage of s-PS . for these type of initiator the polymerization process depends largely on the inductive effect of the substituents linked to the benzene ring of styrene and on it position ( ortho , meta or para ) . substituent multiplicity reduced markedly the effectiveness of these initiator system . styrene / isoprene polymerization wa also studied using binary zirconocene - MAO initiator system that yielded low conversion and also low molecular weight polymer . In this work we studied the copolymerization of ethylene and different alpha-olefins ( propylene , 1-butene , 1-hexene , and 1-octene ) using aluminohydride zirconocene system supported on modified silica . the copolymerization reaction were carried out in hexane , at different Al / Zr ratio , using two different comonomer concentration . the effect of comonomer type on catalyst activity and polymer molecular weight and chemical composition distribution ( MWD and CCD ) wa compared . average comonomer incorporation wa determined by 13C NMR and the CCD by crystallization elution fractionation ( CEF ) . most of the copolymerizations showed very high catalytic activity ( up to <nUm> kg PE / mol Zr ) , and the molecular weight wa higher for the copolymer containing 1-octene , demonstrating that aluminohydride zirconocene system can copolymerize ethylene and alpha-olefins effectively . an opal - supported zirconocene complex ( OC ) wa prepared and employed to prepare functional polyethylene composite for the first time through in situ polymerization of ethylene . the formation mechanism of anion relating to opal wa explained and the value of anion released from pristine opal and that contained in the asfabricated polyethylene composite were detected . the OC exhibited high catalytic activity in ethylene polymerization with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) the cocatalyst . In addition to higher viscosity - average molecular weight ( me ) , experimental result also showed that the resulting polyethylene composite possessed improved anion - releasing capacity in comparison with pristine opal in addition to increased tensile strength , young 's modulus , and onset decomposition temperature ( tonset ) relative to neat polyethylene due to highly uniform dispersion of opal in polyethylene matrix . supported zirconocene catalyst on a new support , MgO , were prepared and tested in ethylene polymerization . three type of impregnation method were employed to find an optimum supporting method for MgO . the direct impregnation of Cp2ZrCl2 on MgO showed low metal loading and polymerization activity , while the catalyst had a higher metal loading and polymerization activity when MgO wa treated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) before supporting . treatment of MgO with MAO during the supporting step invoked two type of catalytic site , which wa evidenced by the bimodal molecular weight distribution of the polymer product . MgO is considered to have potential a a support for metallocenes . the use of biomass a support for zirconocene catalyst in ethylene polymerization wa studied . cellulose , starch and chitosan were conveniently characterized . many factor affecting the activity of the catalyst were examined . parameter such a surface area were found to have no significant influence on the activity of the catalyst . the activity of the catalyst sharply increased with the degree of deacetylation in the chitosan support . using this support the highest activity in ethylene polymerization wa obtained . the polymer obtained with the zirconocene supported on chitosan or cellulose pretreated with methylaluminoxane exhibited a higher obtained weight than those obtained with a homogeneous system . polymer particle obtained with these supported metallocene catalyst showed a good replication of the original support particle . polyethylene nano-composites , with different loading of silicon nitride ( NSi ) ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> wt % ) a filler were prepared by polymerization of ethylene , using zirconocene a catalyst . experimental result showed that activity of zirconocene catalyst activity wa higher for the composite having filler loading of <nUm> wt % . the thermal study using differential scanning calorimeter ( DSC ) and thermo - gravimetric analysis ( TGA ) indicated that crystallinity & thermal stability wa also influenced with the variation of filler loading . combustibility study using micro-calorimeter showed that increase in the filler loading will decrease the combustibility of polyethylene nano-composites . wide angle x-ray diffraction ( WAXD ) result indicated a decrease in the percentage of crystallinity with increase in filler wt % . scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) image revealed that morphology of the composite having <nUm> and <nUm> wt % of NSi are more fibrous when compared to control and composite having <nUm> wt % filler loading . POLYM. ENG . SCI. , <nUm> : <nUm> - <nUm> , <nUm> . A combination of diphenylzinc , a metallocene and methylaluminoxane ( Ph2Zn-metallocene-MAO ) is a suitable initiator system for the polymerization of styrene and for it copolymerization with para-alkyl substituted styrene . this paper report new experimental result which reinforce our previous finding indicating that polymerization process are initiated by monomer coordination to active specie resulting from these particular combined system . polymerization propagates by a cationic pathway . further to our previous observation that the I+ inductive effect of para-substituents in styrene improves conversion to polymer , we now find that methyl substitution on the vinyl double bond of styrene , in spite of the I+ inductive effect and a a result of increased steric hindrance , make the polymerization process difficult . on the other hand , the replacement of titanocenes by zirconocenes or hafnocenes generates Ph2Zn-metallocene-MAO initiator system which are also able to induce homo- and copolymerization , but with lower yield and producing practically amorphous polymer . the efficiency of our Ph2Zn-metallocene-MAO initiator system follows the order titanocene > zirconocene > hafnocene , at least for the studied metallocenes . the commercial interest of metallocene complex for olefin polymerization ha led to additional effort to prepare suitable metallocene complex efficiently and economically . ethylene polymerization wa carried out with a series of heterogeneous catalyst which were prepared in various Zr / silica ratio by immobilization of Ind2ZrCl2 preactivated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) on silica . this method to form the catalyst system resulted in a polymerization catalyst with reduced fouling tendency and improved reactor operability . polymerization of ethylene wa conducted in buchi reactor in a slurry phase under mild pressure . some of the physical property of the obtained polymer were also determined . background : much of the current research related to the development of in situ nanocomposites of olefin by polymerizing them with metallocenes in the presence of surface - treated filler is carried out in the slurry phase . In slurry - phase method a large amount of solvent is required and there is always a need of purification of the final product due to the possibility of trace of solvent present in the product . to overcome these drawback , to perform solvent - free metallocene - catalysed polymerization with in situ incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles , we have used a gas - phase polymerization technique a this doe not require solvent and also utilizes monomer feed stock efficiently . result : the catalyst used for the synthesis of in situ polyethylene nanocomposites by gas - phase polymerization wa nanosilica - supported zirconocene . the filler used were Cloisite-20A , kaolin and nanosilica . three different in situ polyethylene nanocomposites , i.e. Cloisite-20A-filled polyethylene ( CFPE ) , kaolin - filled polyethylene ( KFPE ) and nanosilica - filled polyethylene ( SFPE ) , were prepared by gas - phase polymerization . the nanocomposites were obtained in the form of fine powder . the polyethylene content in the developed nanocomposites is in the orthorhombic crystalline phase . using our approach , it is observed that the nanofillers are completely encapsulated by a thin layer of polyethylene . significantly higher molecular weight polyethylene wa formed in the case of KFPE in comparison to CFPE and SFPE . the thermal decomposition temperature , melting temperature and enthalpy are also observed to be higher for KFPE . conclusion : the gas - phase polymerization technique ha been successfully carried out for the synthesis of in situ polyethylene nanocomposites . themanufacture of linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) is of great significance in academia and industry . the employment of a single monomer , i.e. ethylene , to produce LLDPE by introducing two catalyst into one reactor to conduct ethylene copolymerization with in situ - generated a-olefins ha proved to be an effective way in this case . moreover , immobilization of catalyst affords LLDPE with bettermorphology and improved physical properties.An iron - based diimine complex immobilized on methylaluminoxane (MAO)-treated mesoporous molecular sieve wa used to oligomerize ethylene to a-olefins with improved selectivity to lower molar mass fraction . based on this , zirconocene compound wa also supported on mesoporous molecular sieve to comprise a two - catalyst system to produce LLDPE from a single ethylene monomer . copolymerization performed at both atmospheric and high pressure produced LLDPE of high molecular weight and broad molecular weight distribution without using MAO during the polymerization process . physical and mechanical measurement evidenced significant increase in tensile strength , tensile modulus and izod impact strength . A marked shear - thinning phenomenon and improved storagemodulus of LLDPE produced using catalyst supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15mesoporousmolecular sieve indicated a stronger interfacial interaction between themolecular sieve support and the polymeric matrix . spherical and well - dispersed silica / poly[styrene-co-(acrylic acid ) ] ( O2Si / PSA ) core - shell particle have been synthesized using an improved phase - inversion process . the resulting particle were successfully used a support for polyolefin catalyst in the production of polyethylene with broad molecular weight distribution . through the vapor phase , instead of the liquid phase in the traditional process , a non-solvent wa introduced into a mixture of micrometer - sized O2Si and PSA solution . the core - shell structure of the resulting O2Si / PSA microspheres wa confirmed using optical microscopy , scanning electron microscopy , fourier transfer infrared spectrometry , thermogravimetric analysis and measurement of nitrogen adsorption / desorption isotherm . In order to avoid agglomeration of particle and to obtain a good dispersion of the O2Si / PSA core - shell microspheres , the non-solvent wa added slowly . As the concentration of PSA solution increased , the surface morphology of the core - shell particle became looser and more irregular . however , the surface area and the pore volume remained the same under varying PSA concentration . the O2Si / PSA core - shell microspheres obtained were used a a catalyst carrier system in which the core supported (n-BuCp)2ZrCl2 and the shell supported Cl4Ti . ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization result indicated that the zirconocene and titanium - based ziegler - natta catalyst were compatible in the hybrid catalyst , showing high activity . the resulting polyethylene had high molecular weight and broad molecular weight distribution . the different elementary step in the activation process of racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 by commercial methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) have been studied by UV / visible spectroscopy and correlated with hexene polymerization kinetics . after monomethylation of the zirconocene dichloride ( λ = <nUm> nm ) , abstraction of Cl ligand by MAO at low Al / Zr ratio ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) yield tight ion pair , with an absorption band centred at λ = <nUm> nm , which are inactive towards hexene polymerization . addition of MAO in large excess ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) is required to form the active specie . the latter , characterized by an absorption at λ = <nUm> nm , were identified a trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) separated ion pair . the activation by commercial MAO of racEt(Ind)2ZrX2 , with x being methyl , benzyl or dimethylamino a extractable group , instead of chloride , reveals much easier and complete activation at low Al / Zr ratio ( Al : Zr = 50-150 ) . for these system , formation of active ion pair of different catalytic activity and absorbing in the range λ = 430-440 nm is observed . the use of TMA - depleted MAO instead of commercial MAO , a cocacalyst for racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 activation also allows the formation of active tight ion pair absorbing at λ = <nUm> nm at low Al / Zr ratio . these result underline the negative role of chloride ligand when associated with TMA ( contained in MAO ) in the activation process of zirconocene for olefin polymerization , and also suggest interesting alternative to reduce the amount of MAO necessary for metallocene activation . treatment of 2-(5-methyl-2-furyl)tetrahydroindenyllithium with Cl4Zr gave bis[2-(5-methyl-2-furyl)tetrahydroindenyl]zirconium dichloride ( 8 ) . dynamic 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed a cp - furyl rotational barrier of DGArrot[?] ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 . the x-ray crystal structure analysis of <nUm> showed the presence of a rac - like metallocene conformation in which the furyl ring are oriented coplanar with the cp moiety of the tetrahydroindenyl ligand system , but the two furyl ring are oriented differently : one ha the oxygen atom oriented toward the open front side , whereas the other ha the furyl oxygen pointing toward the narrow back side of the bent metallocene wedge . the 8-MAO ziegler - natta catalyst system produce an atactic polypropylene oil . ethene wa polymerized with the catalytic system L2ZrCl2 / MAO / TMA ( where L = cp , Me5Cp , or Me4Cp ; cp = e5-cyclopentadienyl ; MAO = methylaluminoxane ; and TMA = trimethylaluminum ) at <nUm> ° C , <nUm> bar , and AlTMA / Zr ratio of 0-2700 . the polymerization activity wa reduced with the addition of TMA for L = cp but wa almost unaffected for the methyl-substituted catalyst . increasing the TMA concentration resulted in a lower molecular weight of the polymer , with the largest effect for L = Me5Cp . A gel permeation chromatography analysis of the polymer revealed a high molecular weight shoulder and a nearly bimodal distribution for L = Me5Cp at high TMA concentration . A possible explanation of such a shoulder in term of long - chain branching wa ruled out by dynamic viscosity measurement . the origin of this effect more likely stemmed from competition between chain transfer to aluminum and b-hydrogen transfer reaction at two different site , one TMA - sensitive and one TMA - insensitive . polymerization at various pressure and temperature substantiated this assumption . A clue to the underlying mechanism came from investigation of chain transfer to TMA studied with density functional calculation . complexation of Me3Al to Zr wa much stronger for L = cp than for L = Me5Cp . however , the overall chain - transfer barrier wa much higher for L = cp . these result agreed both with the reduced activity for L = cp and with the strongly reduced molecular weight for L = Me5Cp observed with the addition of TMA . cyclopentadienyl magnesium chloride ( MgClCp ) and it functionalized derivative represent original and interesting supporting material to heterogenize metallocene catalyst for olefin polymerization . the synthesis of MgClCp , it functionalization , and the preparation of a catalytic system in which the ZrCl2(Flu)+ moiety is joined on the support through a cyclopentadienyl ligand are reported . this catalyst wa tested in ethene polymerization , and both the catalytic activity and property of the produced polymer were measured . it performance wa compared with that shown by the catalyst ZrCl2CpFlu employed under the same condition for both unsupported and conventional support , such a Cl2Mg . the result showed a remarkable improvement in term of the activity and polymer property with these heterogenized catalyst . moreover , this system showed stability toward leaching process and wa characterized by good morphological control of the growing polymer . finally , catalyst in which [HB(3,5-Me2pyrazolyl)3]ZrCl2+ and [HB(3,5-Me2pyrazolyl)3]ZrClOtBu+ moiety were bonded to a functionalized MgClCp- support were also synthesized and tested . the result showed that the proposed support could be usefully used to heterogenize tailored metallocene homogeneous catalyst . In fact , new catalyst were prepared that combined the peculiar advantage of both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalyst and overcame the disadvantage of the latter , such a a lack of morphology and reactor fouling . the copolymerization of propene with 7-methyl-1,6-octadiene ( MOD ) catalyzed by Cp*TiMe3 / BC18F15 ( A ) and rac-C2H4(Ind)2ZrCl2 / methylaluminoxan e ( B ) in toluene under <nUm> bar propene gave copolymer with unsaturated side chain . under these condition , catalyst A produced copolymer with an atactic backbone structure of type <nUm> , with <nUm> - <nUm> mol % MOD incorporation and weight - average molecular weight = <nUm> - <nUm> × <nUm> . using catalyst B , copolymer <nUm> with <nUm> - <nUm> mol % MOD incorporation were prepared . the comonomer incorporation wa a linear function of the feed ratio . the titanium catalyst A had a significantly higher affinity for MOD than the sterically more hindered zirconocene B . postpolymerization modification of the side - chain C = C bond allowed the facile introduction of a wide variety of functional group . epoxidation and especially ozonolysis of the C = C bond , to give -CHO and -COOH functionalized copolymer , proved to be very facile route to functionalized polypropene . according to monitoring by NMR , most of these transformation proceed in an essentially quantitative conversion . As an example of potential application of such polymer , polypropene with covalently attached dye were prepared that are suitable for blending . ethylene polymerization wa carried out with zirconocene catalyst supported on montmorillonite ( or functionalized montmorillonite ) . the functionalized montmorillonite wa from simple ion exchange of [CH3O2CCH2NH3]+ ( MeGlyH+ ) ion with interlamellar cation of layered montmorillonites . the functionalized montmorillonites [ high - purity montmorillonite (MMT)-MeGlyH+ ] had larger interlayer spacing ( <nUm> Å ) than montmorillonites without treatment ( <nUm> Å ) . the zirconocene catalyst system [ Cp2ZrCl2 / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) / MMT - MeGlyH+ ] had much higher Zr loading and higher activity than those of other zirconocene catalyst system ( Cp2ZrCl2 / MMT , Cp2ZrCl2 / MMT - MeGlyH+ , Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO / MMT , [Cp2ZrCl]+ [BF4] / MMT , [Cp2ZrCl]+ [BF4]- / MMT - MeGlyH+ , [Cp2ZrCl]+ [BF4]- / MAO / MMT - MeGlyH+ , and [Cp2ZrCl]+[BF4]- / MAO / MMT ) . the polyethylene with good bulk density were obtained from the catalyst system , particularly ( Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO / MMT - MeGlyH+ ) . MeGlyH+ and MAO seemed to play important role for preparation of the supported zirconocenes and polymerization of ethylene . the difference in Zr loading and catalytic activity among the supported zirconocene catalyst is discussed . heterogenization of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] on a silica support stabilized with chlorotriphenylmethane ( CICPh3 ) and N,N-dimethylaniline ( HNMe2Ph ) creates the following supported borane cocatalysts : [HNMe2Ph]+[B(C6 F5)3-SiO2]- and [CPh3]+[B(C6F5)3- SiO2]- . these supported catalyst were reacted with Cp2ZrCl2 TIBA in situ to generate active metallocene specie in the reactor . triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) wa a good coactivator for dichloro-zirconocene , acting a the prealkylating agent to generate cationic zirconocene ( Cp2ZrC4H9+ ) . the catalytic performance were determined from the kinetics of ethylene-consumption profile that were independent of the time dedicated to the activation of the catalyst . the scanning electron microscopy - energy dispersive x-ray measurement showed that BC18F15 dispersed uniformly on the silica support . under our reaction condition , the [CPh3]+[B(C6F5)3- SiO2]- system had higher productivity and weight - average molecular weight than the [HNMe2Ph]+[B(C6 F5)3-SiO2]- system . for the [CPh3]+[B(C6F5)3- SiO2]- system , the productivity increased with the amount catalyst ; however , the polydispersity index of polyethylene synthesized did not change . the final shape of polymer particle wa a larger - diameter version of the original support particle . the polymer particle synthesized with supported [CPh3]+[B(C6F5)3- SiO2]- catalyst had larger diameter . ethene - propene copolymerizations were performed in the presence of Cs symmetric group <nUm> metallocenes . the reactivity ratio were strongly influenced by both the transition metal and the ancillary ligand . substantially alternate , almost random , and blocky copolymer were obtained with titanocene , zirconocene , and hafnocene , respectively , with the bis(dimethylsilyl)-1,1'-2,2'-diyl-(3',5'-diisopropyl)(4- isopropyl)-(cyclopentadienyl) ligand , and a blocky copolymer wa obtained with ( diphenyl methylidene)(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)TiCl2 . copolymerization of ethylene or propylene and norbornene ( NB ) wa carried out with stereospecific zirconocene catalyst rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride , rac-dimethylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 2 ) , rac-dimethyl-silylenebis(2-methylindenyl)zirconium dichloride , and diphenylmethylene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride combined with cocatalysts at <nUm> ° C . temperature - rising elution fractional of the copolymer wa carried out with cross-fractionation chromatography with o-dichlorobenzene a a solvent , and a broad distribution of the copolymer composition wa detected . the fraction eluted at lower temperature contained higher NB . the effect of the polymerization time wa examined in the ethylene-NB copolymerization with catalyst <nUm> , and the higher - temperature elution fraction increased with increasing polymerization time . macroporous functionalized polymer bead of poly(4-vinylpyridine-co-l,4-divinylbenzene) [P(VPy-co-DVB)] were prepared by a multistep polymerization , including a polystyrene ( PS ) shape template by emulsifier - free emulsion polymerization , linear PS seed by staged template suspension polymerization , and macroporous functionalized polymer bead of P(VPy-co-DVB) by multistep seeded polymerization . the polymer bead , having a cellular texture , were made of many small , spherical particle . the bead size wa 10-50 mm , and the pore size wa <nUm> - <nUm> mm . the polymer bead were used a support for zirconocene catalyst in ethylene polymerization . they were very different from traditional polymer support . the polymer bead could be exfoliated to yield many spherical particle dispersed in the resulting polyethylene particle during ethylene polymerization . the influence of the polymer bead on the catalytic behavior of the supported catalyst and morphology of the resulting polyethylene wa investigated . this article report the use of a binary single - site catalyst system for synthesizing comb - branched polypropylene sample having isotactic polypropylene ( iPP ) backbone and atactic polypropylene ( aPP ) side chain from propylene feedstock . this catalyst system consisted of the bisiminepyridine iron catalyst { [ 2-ArN = C(Me)]2C5H3N}FeCl2 [ Ar = 2,6-C6H3(Me)2 ] ( 1 ) and the zirconocene catalyst rac-Me2Si(2-MeBenz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) . the former in situ generated 1-propenyl-ended aPP macromonomer , whereas the latter incorporated the macromonomer into the copolymer . the effect of reaction condition , such a the catalyst addition procedure and the ratio of <nUm> / <nUm> on the branching frequency , were examined . copolymer sample having a branching density up to <nUm> aPP side chain per <nUm> iPP monomer unit were obtained . the branched copolymer were characterized by 13C NMR and differential scanning calorimetry . because of the great economic interest in propylene-based polymer and the possibility of designing material with desired property with metallocene catalyst mixture , we investigated the characteristic of polypropylene produced by mixture of SiMe2Ind2ZrCl2 : dimethylsilane-bis(indenyl) zirconocene ( 1 ) and Et(Flu)(Cp)ZrCl2 : ethylidene ( fluorenyl cyclopentadienyl ) zirconocene ( 2 ) in different proportion . the polymer were fractionated with solvent , and the fraction were characterized . we observed that the polymer produced by the different mixed system showed lower weight - average molecular weight and only slightly broader molecular weight distribution than polypropylene synthesized by the individual catalyst . we concluded that catalyst <nUm> acted independently of catalyst <nUm> , producing polymer with the same isotacticity . ethene homopolymerization and copolymerization with 1-hexene were performed with three new tetramethyldisilylene-bridged zirconocene catalyst with 2-indenyl ligand ( A ) , 2-tetrahydroindenyl ligand ( B ) , and tetramethyl-cyclopentadienyl ligand ( C ) and with methylaluminoxane a a cocatalyst . catalyst A and B showed substantial comonomer incorporation , resulting in a copolymer melting temperature more than <nUm> ° lower than that of the corresponding homopolymer . In contrast , catalyst C produced a copolymer with a low 1-hexene content and a high melting temperature . the reduction in the molecular weight with 1-hexene addition also correlated well with the comonomer incorporation . for all three catalyst , the homopolymer and copolymer unsaturations indicated frequent chain termination after 1-hexene insertion and a high degree of chain - end isomerization during the homopolymerization of ethene . the chain transfer to Al in the cocatalyst also appeared to be important . the comonomer response could be correlated with the structural property of the catalyst , a derived from quantum chemical calculation . A linear model , calibrated against recent experiment with unbridged (MenC5H5-n)2ZrCl2 catalyst , suggested that the low comonomer incorporation obtained with catalyst C wa caused partly by a narrow opening angle between the aromatic ligand and partly by steric hindrance in the transition state of comonomer insertion . ethylene homopolymerizations and copolymerizations were catalyzed by zirconocene catalyst entrapped inside functionalized montmorillonites that had been rendered organophilic via the ion exchange of the interlamellar cation of layered montmorillonite with hydrochloride of l-amino acid ( AAH+Cl- ) or their methyl ester ( MeAAH+Cl- ) , with or without the further addition of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ( C16H33N+Me3Br- ; R4N+Br- ) . In contrast to the homogeneous Cp2ZrCl2 / methylaluminoxane catalyst for ethylene homopolymerizations and copolymerizations with 1-octene , the intercalated Cp2ZrCl2 activated by methylaluminoxane for ethylene homopolymerizations and copolymerizations with 1-octene proved to be more effective in the synthesis of polyethylene with controlled molecular weight , chemical composition and structure , and property , including the bulk density . the effect of the property of the organic guest on the preparation and catalytic performance of the intercalated zirconocene catalyst were studied . the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) wa investigated with tris(pentafluorophenyl)alane [ Al(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] and four metallocene imido complex that varied in the complex symmetry / chirality , metal , and r group in the = NR moiety , a well a a zirconocene enolate preformed from the imido zirconocene and MMA . this study examined four aspect of MMA polymerization : the effect of the metallocene imido complex structure on the polymerization activity and polymer tacticity , the degree of polymerization control , the elementary reaction of the imido complex with Al(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> and MMA , and the polymerization kinetics and mechanism . there wa no effect of the imido complex symmetry / chirality on the polymerization stereochemistry ; the polymerization followed bernoullian statistic , producing syndiotactic poly(methyl methacrylate)s with moderate ( ∼ <nUm> % [rr] ) to high ( ∼ <nUm> % [rr] ) syndiotacticity , depending on the polymerization temperature . polymerization control wa demonstrated by the number - average molecular weight , which increased linearly with an increase in the monomer conversion to <nUm> % , and the relatively small and insensitive polydispersity index ( from <nUm> to <nUm> ) to conversion . the reaction of the zirconocene imido complex with Al(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> and MMA produced the parent base - free imido complex and the [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition product ( i.e. , zirconocene enolate ) , respectively ; the latter product reacted with Al(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> to generate the active zirconocenium enolaluminate . the MMA polymerization with the metallocene imido complex and the alane proceeded via intermolecular michael addition of the enolaluminate to the alane - activated MMA involved in the propagation step . copolymerization of olefin ( ethylene and propylene ) and 5-hexen-1-ol pretreated with alkylaluminum wa performed using [dimethysilylbis(9-fluorenyl)]zirconium dichloride / methylaluminoxane a the catalyst . the copolymerization required extra addition of alkylaluminum to prevent deactivation of the catalyst when 5-hexen-1-ol wa pretreated with trimethylaluminum , whereas the triisobutylaluminum - treated system did not require any addition of alkylaluminum . the molecular weight of the copolymer depended on the kind of alkylaluminum compound ( masking reagent , additive , and cocatalyst ) . 13C NMR analysis proved that poly(ethylene-co-5-hexen-1-ol) containing <nUm> mol % of 5-hexen-1-ol acted a an alternating copolymer , whereas the poly(propylene-co-5-hexen-1-ol) acted a a random copolymer . the surface property of the copolymer wa simply evaluated by mean of water drop contact angle measurement . it wa found that the copolymer containing large amount of 5-hexen-1-ol unit showed good hydrophilic property . A novel approach to the preparation of polyethylene ( PE ) nanocomposites , with montmorillonite / silica hybrid ( MT-Si ) supported catalyst , wa developed . MT-Si wa prepared by depositing silica nanoparticles between gallery of the MT . A common zirconocene catalyst [ bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride / methylaluminoxane ] wa fixed on the MT-Si surface by a simple method . after ethylene polymerization , two class of nanofillers ( clay layer and silica nanoparticles ) were dispersed concurrently in the PE matrix and PE / clay - silica nanocomposites were obtained . exfoliation of the clay layer and dispersion of the silica nanoparticles were examined with transmission electron microscopy . physical property of the nanocomposites were characterized by tensile test , dynamic mechanical analysis , and DSC . the nanocomposites with a low nanofiller loading ( < <nUm> wt % ) exhibited good mechanical property . the nanocomposite powder produced with the supported catalyst had a granular morphology and a high bulk density , typical of a heterogeneous catalyst system . ethylene polymerization with catalytic system Me2SiCp*NtBuZrX2 ( 1 ) [ cp* = C3H4 ; x = Cl ( 1Cl ) , me ( 1Me ) ] , triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) , perfluorophenylborate CatB(C6F5)4 [ cat = CPh3 ( 3 ) , Me2NHPh ( 4 ) ] , or Me2SiCp2ZrX2 [ x = Cl ( 2Cl ) , me ( 2Me ) ] / TIBA / <nUm> ( 4 ) were performed within a wide range of ethylene pressure of different Al / Zr ratio , and Zr / B = <nUm> . catalytic system 1Cl(2Cl) / TIBA / <nUm> led to the formation of very high linear molecular weight polyethylene ( PE ) of me ∼ ; <nUm> with low activity . the replacement of both chlorine ligand in the precatalyst for the methyl one led to the formation of active specie producing low molecular weight PE with high activity . chain transfer to ethylene wa shown to be the main reaction controlling PE chain propagation : kp / ktr ∼ 20-30 for 1Me / TIBA / <nUm> and kp / ktr ∼ 350-500 for 2Me / TIBA / <nUm> . it wa suggested that TIBA wa present in the active center first in the form of a neutral heterobimetallic Zr-Al bridged complex followed by the formation of a partially polarized Zr - Al(Cl)R2 ( r = iBu ) or an unreactive Zr - AlR3 cationic complex by abstraction of the alkyl ligand under the action of borate . it wa concluded that AlR3 from the latter cationic complex may be easily reversibly replaced under the specific coordination of ethylene or accumulated a-olefin , giving rise to highly labile and sterically accessible cationic specie . experiment on ethylene polymerization with the catalytic system 1Cl(1Me) / TIBA / <nUm> / Ph2NH , 1Cl(1Me) / TIBA / <nUm> , 2Cl(2Me) / TIBA / <nUm> / Ph2NH , and 2Cl(2Me) / TIBA / <nUm> were performed to confirm the suggestion . catalytic system derived from dichloride complex in the presence of a s-donor substrate also produced low molecular weight EsP with molecular weight characteristic similar to those of product obtained with the dimethylated precatalysts . the specific feature of active specie derived from 2Me complex to isomerize coordinated a-olefin into trans-vinylene polymer chain wa also revealed . the catalytic behavior of the ternary catalytic system based on 2Me relative to 2Me or 2Cl precatalysts activated with polymethylaluminoxane at different Al / Zr ratio wa compared . an investigation of the catalytic behavior of the dimethylated zirconocenes Me2SiCp* NtBuZrMe2 [ cp* = C3H4 ; 1Me ] , Me2SiCp2ZrMe2 ( 2Me ) , Cp2ZrMe2 ( 3Me ) , Ind2ZrMe2 ( 4Me ) , Me2SiInd2ZrMe2 ( 5Me ) , Et(2-MeInd)2ZrMe2 ( 6Me ) , and Me2Si(2-MeInd)2ZrMe2 ( 7Me ) with the combined activator triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) / CPh3B(C6F5)4 ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ; B / Zr = <nUm> ) in ethylene polymerization at increased monomer pressure ( 5-11 bar , <nUm> ° C ) wa carried out . sterically opened zirconocenes in ternary catalyst gave rise to active specie effective in the formation of low molecular weight polyethylene ( EsP ) . these active specie tended to increase the PE molecular weight [ 1Me ( 2100 ) < 2Me ( 20,000 ) < 5Me ( 89,000 ) < 3Me ( 94,500 ) ] under similar condition . PE obtained with 4Me showed a bimodal gel permeation chromatography curve with a <nUm> % peak area [ weight - average molecular weight ( mw ) = <nUm> ] and a <nUm> % peak area ( mw = <nUm> ) . the increase in sterical demand from the zirconocenes wa also demonstrated by the reduction of the chain transfer to monomer , the reinsertion of vinyl-ended PE chain , and their ability for isomerization . these reaction were most pronounced for the zirconocenes 1Me and 2Me . the active specie responsible for the formation of low molecular weight EsP deactivated quickly . the zirconocenes 6Me , 7Me , and (2-PhInd)2ZrMe2 ( 8Me ) bearing substituent at the 2-position of the indenyl ring wa activated with TIBA alone , yielding active specie effective in ethylene and propylene polymerization . EsP formed with 6Me-8Me complex activated with TIBA had high molecular weight . an increase in the Al / Zr ratio in the catalytic system 8Me / TIBA from <nUm> to <nUm> led to an enhancement of the molecular weight of polypropylene ( PP ) sample from oligomeric product to an viscosity - average molecular weight of <nUm> . the increase in the molecular weight of PPs with an increase in the propylene concentration wa also observed . an analysis of the catalytic performance of the 8Me / TIBA system showed first - order dependency of the initial polymerization rate on the TIBA concentration and close to second - order dependency on propylene . the second - order dependency on the monomer concentration is explained in term of the monomer participation in the initiation step of the polymerization reaction . the use of functional group bearing silica / poly(styrene-co-4-vinylpyridine) core - shell particle a a support for a zirconocene catalyst in ethylene polymerization wa studied . several factor affecting the behavior of the supported catalyst and the property of the resulting polymer , such a time , temperature , Al / N ( molar ratio ) , and Al / Zr ( molar ratio ) , were examined . the condition of the supported catalyst preparation were more important than those of the ethylene polymerization . the state of the supported catalyst itself played a decisive role in both the catalytic behavior of the supported catalyst and the property of polyethylene ( PE ) . IR and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to follow the formation of the support . the formation of cationic active specie is hypothesized , and the performance of the core-shell-particle - supported zirconocene catalyst is discussed a well . the bulk density of the PE formed wa higher than that of the polymer obtained from homogeneous and polymer - supported Cp2ZrCl2 / methylaluminoxane catalyst system . the copolymerization of propylene with 1-hexene , 1-octene , 1-decene , and 1-dodecene wa carried out with silica - supported rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 a a catalyst . the copolymerization activity of the homogeneous and supported catalyst and the microstructures of the resulting copolymer were compared . the activity of the supported catalyst wa only one - half to one - eighth of that of the homogeneous catalyst , depending on the comonomer type . the supported catalyst copolymerized more comonomer into the polymer chain than the homogeneous catalyst at the same monomer feed ratio . data of reactivity ratio showed that the depression in the activity of propylene instead of an enhancement in the activity of olefinic comonomer wa responsible for this phenomenon . we also found that copolymerization with a-olefins and supporting the metallocene on a carrier improved the stereoregularity and regioregularity of the copolymer . the melting temperature of all the copolymer decreased linearly with growing comonomer content , regardless of the comonomer type and catalyst system . low mobility of the propagation chain in the supported catalyst wa suggested a the reason for the different polymerization behavior of the supported catalyst with the homogeneous system . the ethylene polymerization by Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO ( cp = e5 : cyclopentadienyl ; MAO = methyl aluminoxane ) and CpZrCl3 / MAO have been studied . the MW and PD ( = mw / mw ) of polymer obtained after 2.5-60 min are the same , which indicate short chain lifetime . the value of rate constant for Cp2ZrCl2 at <nUm> ° C are : kp = <nUm> − <nUm> ( m s)-1 and ktrA1 = 0.012-0.81 s-1 depending upon [Zr] and [MAO,] ktrb = <nUm> s-1 , and ktrH = <nUm> M-1 torr-1 / <nUm> s-1 . these chain transfer rate constant value are two to three order of magnitude greater than the corresponding value found for Cl2Mg supported titanium catalyst . one significant difference between the heterogeneous and homogeneous catalyst is that the former decay according to an apparent second order kinetics , whereas the latter decay is simple first order at <nUm> ° C and biphasic first order at higher temperature . the productivity of the catalyst depends weekly on temperature while the MW decrease strongly with increase of temperature above <nUm> ° C . all the active specie were formed upon mixing Cp2ZrCl2 with MAO while it took up to <nUm> min for the CpZnCl3 / MAO system . the productivity of the former increase more strongly with the decrease of [Zr] than the latter . otherwise , the two catalyst system have all their kinetic parameter differing le than a factor of two . the kinetic parameter have been measured for octene-1 solution polymerization at <nUm> ° C catalyzed by zirconocene with the cocatalyst methylaluminoxane . the polymerization were performed in an attenuated total reflectance ( ATR ) reaction cell . the progress of the reaction were followed by observing the disappearance of octene-1 using the <nUm> cm-1 band measured by FT-IR spectroscopy . the dependence of the reaction rate , rp , on catalyst concentration and cocatalyst / catalyst ratio wa examined . the catalyst deactivation mechanism wa studied by fitting the experimental data to mathematical model involving second-order propagation and either first or second order catalyst deactivation . second-order catalyst deactivation provided a much better fit . the calculated deactivation rate constant , kd , is <nUm> (Ms)-1 . this model is used to determine the propagation rate constant for Al / Zr = <nUm> × <nUm> a kp = <nUm> ( m s)-1 . A decrease in Al / Zr = <nUm> × <nUm> lowered the propagation rate constant , kp , to <nUm> ( m s)-1 indicating that le than <nUm> % of the initial Zr is active at this Al / Zr ratio . MgCl2-supported Cl3Ti catalyst , with and / or without electron donor modifier ( internal Bi or external Be ) , were compared with rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) activated with either MAO or the cation forming agent , triphenyl carbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( 2 ) , with triethylalumium ( TEA ) . the activity of the heterogeneous catalyst depend on the presence or absence of the lewis base , were relatively insensitive to the temperature of polymerization , and produce poly(hexene) with molecular weight up to <nUm> . the <nUm> / MAO catalyst ha about five time higher activity at <nUm> ° C but is almost inactive at − <nUm> ° C ; the overall activation energy is <nUm> kcal mol-1 . In contrast , the activity for hexene polymerization by the <nUm> / <nUm> / TEA catalyst is actually slightly greater at lower temperature . the MW 's of poly(hexene) obtained with the zirconocenium catalyst are only in the ten of thousand because of rapid b-hydride elimination by the electrophilic cationic Zr center . propylene wa polymerized with rac-ethylene-bis (1-e5-indenyl)dichlorozirconium / methylaluminoxane in solvent of different polarity . the poly ( propylene ) formed wa separated by solvent extraction ; 13C-NMR and DSC measurement were made on the polymer fraction . the poly(propylene) in each solvent fraction ha it characteristic molecular weight steric pentad distribution , melting transition temperature , and enthalpy for fusion irrespective of the polymerization medium . the result suggest that the medium dielectric constant doe not affect the polymerization rate or the intrinsic stereoselectivity , propagation and chain transfer rate a given catalytic specie but can alter the occurrence of steric insertion error through shifting of distribution of the propagating specie producing poly(propylenes) of different stereoregularities . propylene wa polymerized by binary zirconocenium catalyst derived from rac-ethylenebis(1-e5-indenyl)dimethylzirconium and cation forming agent (C6H5)3C+(C6F5)4B- and BC18F15 . polymerization were also performed with the ternary system of Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 , Et3Al , and the cation forming agent . the catalyst system , with the inert noncoordinating counter-ion , (C6F5)4B- , have much higher activity and stereoselectivity than the one with the CH3B-(C6F5)3 counter-ion . much le active still are catalyst having BF4- or (C6H5)4B- counter-ions . similar but smaller effect of counter-ion structure on ethylene polymerization were observed . racemic isopropylidene (1-e5-cyclopentadienyl)(1-e5-indenyl) dichlorozirconium and the 3-methylindenyl derivative have been synthesized and characterized . these precursor activated with methylaluminoxane produce poly(propylene) with hemiisotactic microstructures . the syndiospecific propylene polymerization catalyzed by isopropylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl)- and (2,2-dimethylpropylidene)(cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl)-zirconocenium ( 1+ and 2+ ) have been investigated theoretically and compared with experimental observation . with the ab initio calculated structure for the transition state ( TS ) of 1+(M)P and 2+(M)P ( m = propylene , P = 2-methylpentyl ) , their steric energy ( e ° ) have been computed using MM2 force-field . the difference between steric energy e ° ( m ) and e ° ( r ) for the meso and racemic enchainment of propylene , respectively , is defined a the stereocontrol energy [ dE ° ( m − r ) ] for syndiotactic propagation . the dE ° ( m − r ) for the TS of 1+ (M)P is about <nUm> kcal / mol , the value is <nUm> kcal / mol greater for 2+(M)P . the observed steric pentad distribution of the syndiotactic poly(propylene) obtained by these catalyst are consistent with smaller effective stereocontrol energy , which is about two-third a large a dE ° ( m − r ) value calculated for the MM2 optimized structure . syndiotactic enchainment is favored over isotactic enchainment for all combination of site configuration in the catalyst . a-Agostic interaction seems to enhance syndioselectivity , whereas g-agostic interaction change the stereoselectivity to meso enchainment . the mirror plane symmetry of the syndiotactic propagating specie render the stereoselectivity of the polymerization insensitive to reaction condition . these catalyst are also highly regiospecific . propene wa polymerized at <nUm> ° C and 2-bar propene in toluene using methylalumoxane ( MAO ) activated rac-Me2Si(Benz[e]Indenyl)2ZrCl2 ( BI ) and rac-Me2Si(2-Me-Benz[e]Indenyl)2ZrCl2 ( MBI ) . catalyst BI / MAO polymerizes propene with high activity to afford low molecular weight polypropylene , whereas MBI / MAO is le active and produce high molecular weight polypropylene . variation of reaction condition such a propene concentration , temperature , concentration of catalyst component , and addition of hydrogen reveals that the lower molecular weight polypropylene produced with BI / MAO result from chain transfer to propene monomer following a 2,1-insertion . A large fraction of both metallocene catalyst system is deactivated upon 2,1-insertion . such dormant site can be reactivated by h2-addition , which affords active metallocene hydride . this effect of h2-addition is reflected by a decreasing content of head-to-head enchainment and the formation of polypropylene with n-butyl end group . both catalyst show a strong dependence of activity on propene concentration that indicates a formal reaction order of <nUm> with respect to propene . MBI / MAO show a much higher dependence of the activity on temperature than BI / MAO . At elevated temperature , MBI / MAO polymerizes propene faster than BI / MAO . Bis(1-indenyl)-di[1'S , 2'R , 5'S)-methoxy]silane ( 1 ) wa converted into a mixture of corresponding ansa-diastereomeric zirconocenes . further purification afforded a single dia-stereomer , di[(1'S , 2'R , 5'S)-methoxy ] silylene-bis[e5-1(R , r)-(+)-indenyl ] dichlorozirconium ( 2 ) , which is optically active and hydrocarbon soluble . extremely rapid ethylene , propylene , and ethylene-hexene polymerization were observed both in toluene and n-heptane solution ; for instance , at <nUm> ° C , activity for ethylene polymerization reach ∼ <nUm> × <nUm> ( g of PE / ( ( mol of Zr ) · [C2H4] · h ) . the “ bare ” zirconocenium ion generated from <nUm> / TIBA / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 exhibit unusual polymerization behavior ; the polymerization activity increase monotonically with temperature of polymerization ( tp ) up to a conventional polymerization condition ( <nUm> – <nUm> ° C ) , and the 13C NMR study show that the isotactic poly-propylene obtained ha fairly high [mmmm] methyl pentad distribution at high tp ( 25 ° C with [mmmm] ∼ <nUm> – <nUm> ) and a perfect stereoregularity at low tp ( 0 ° C with [mmmm] > <nUm> ) . the catalyst precursor <nUm> and Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 3 ) supported on silica by different approach produced poly(olefins) of different molecular weight and stereoregularities , and a methylaluminokane and Ph3CB(C6F5)4 free silica-supported zirconocene system wa found to be activated by triisobutylaluminum . the study of ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization with the zirconocene catalyst , bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl <nUm> ) / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , anchored on a MgCl2(THF) <nUm> support wa carried out . the influence of 1-hexene concentration in the feed on catalyst productivity and comonomer reactivity a well a other property wa investigated . additionally , the effect of support modification by the organoaluminum compound [ ( MAO , trimethlaluminum ( AlMe3 ) , or diethylaluminum chloride ( Et2AlCl ) ] on the behavior of the ClMg 2(THF)2 / Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst in the copolymerization process and on the property of the copolymer wa explored . immobilization of the Cp2ZrCl2 compound on the complex magnesium support MgCl2(THF)2 resulted in an effective system for the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene . the modification of the support a well a the kind of organoaluminum compound used a a modifier influenced the activity of the examined catalyst system . additionally , the profitable influence of immobilization of the homogeneous catalyst a well a modification of the support applied on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the copolymer wa established . finally , with the successive self - nucleation / annealing procedure , the copolymer obtained over both homogeneous and heterogeneous metallocene catalyst were heterogeneous with respect to their chemical composition . statistical copolymer of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) with n-butyl- , s-butyl , t-butyl- , n-hexyl- , decyl- , stearyl- , allyl- , trimethylsilyl- and trimethylsilyloxyethyl methacrylate were prepared by zirconocene - catalyzed copolymerization . the reactivity ratio of MMA copolymer with butyl- , hexyl- , and stearyl methacrylate were estimated using the finemann - ross , the inverted finemann - ross , and the kelen - tudos graphical method . structural parameter of the copolymer were obtained from the calculated dyad sequence , derived by using the reactivity ratio . the effect of the nature of the methacrylate ester group and the catalytic system used on the copolymer structure is discussed . the glass - transition temperature ( tg ) value of MMA copolymer with butyl- and hexyl methacrylate were measured and examined in the frame of several theoretical equation , allowing the prediction of these tg value . the best fit wa obtained using barton and johnston equation , taking the monomer sequence distribution of the copolymer into account . metallocene and other transition metal complex activated by methylaluminoxane are highly active catalyst for the polymerization of olefin , diolefins , and styrene , which wa discovered at the university of hamburg about <nUm> year ago . these catalyst allow the synthesis of polymer with a highly defined microstructure , tacticity , and stereo - regularity , a well a new copolymer with superior property such a film clarity , tensile strength , and lower extractables . A better understanding of the mechanism of olefin polymerization lead to finding of other new single site catalyst . the development of the metallocene / MAO - catalyst from their discovery to their present state of the art is presented . the copolymerization of propylene and 3-buten-1-ol protected with alkylaluminum [ trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) or triisobutylaluminum ] wa conducted with an isospecific zirconocene catalyst [ rac-dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl) zirconium dichloride ] , combined with methylaluminoxane a a cocatalyst , in the presence of additional TMA or H a the chain - transfer reagent if necessary . the result indicated that endhydroxylated polypropylene wa obtained in the presence of the chain - transfer reagent because of the formation of dormant specie after the insertion of the 3-buten-l-ol - based monomer followed by chain - transfer reaction . the selectivity of the chain - transfer reaction wa influenced by the alkylaluminum protecting the comonomer and the catalyst structure . the copolymerization of ethylene and n-(vinylphenyl)carbazole ( VPC ) wa carried out with constrained geometry catalyst ( CGC ) and isopropylidene-bridged zirconocene catalyst . the copolymerization of ethylene and styrene wa successfully achieved with half - sandwiched titanocene catalyst which include bridged cyclopentadienyl and amino ligand . it wa observed that the copolymer exhibited semicrystalline / rubbery , amorphous rubbery and amorphous / glassy feature with increasing styrene content . the result show that the electronic interaction between VPC and the active specie affected the reactivity of VPC rather than the steric factor of the active specie . through the diels - alder reaction between cyclopentadiene group attached to polystyrene in the presence of zirconocene , novel polystyrene - supported metallocene catalyst were prepared . A novel method for immobilizing metallocene catalyst wa investigated , and the resultant polystyrene - supported metallocene for olefin polymerization wa studied . the result of olefin polymerization showed that different crosslinking degree of support in the catalyst system had significant effect on the catalytic behavior . the influence of the [Al] / [Zr] molar ratio and the temperature on the (co)polymerization activity wa studied . when 1-hexene and 1-dodecene were used for copolymerization with ethylene , an obvious positive comonomer effect wa observed . investigation of the characteristic and performance in propylene polymerization of silica - immobilized methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , in combination with a moderately and a highly isospecific zirconocene catalyst , ha revealed that a simple impregnation of silica with MAO at ambient temperature is insufficient to obtain uniform distribution of MAO throughout the support particle . homogeneous Al distribution throughout the support , giving increased catalyst activity , wa achieved by a more rigorous impregnation of silica with MAO at elevated temperature . the highest catalyst activity were obtained by precontacting the MAO with the zirconocene to generate the activated specie before immobilization on silica . polymer particle morphology wa strongly dependent on the characteristic of the silica used for catalyst immobilization . statistical copolymer of methyl methacrylate with cyclohexyl and trimethylsilyloxy ethyl methacrylate were synthesized with two different catalytic system based on the zirconocene complex Cp2ZrMe <nUm> . the reactivity ratio of methyl methacrylate and these methacrylates were calculated with the finemann - ross , inverted finemann - ross , and kelen - tudos graphical method . the structural parameter of these copolymer were estimated from the calculation of the dyad monomer sequence fraction . two different borate cocatalysts were employed , and their effect on the copolymerization process is discussed . the polymerization behavior of cyclohexyl methacrylate and trimethyl-silyloxyethyl methacrylate with the catalytic system cp 2ZrMe2 / BC18F15 / ZnEt <nUm> wa examined . block copolymer of these bulky methacrylates with methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) , having high molecular weight and relatively narrow molecular weight distribution , were prepared . n-Butyl acrylate and tert-butyl acrylate were polymerized with various catalytic system based on zirconocene complex . these polymerization seemed to proceed to a nonquantitative yield , producing polymer with high molecular weight and relatively low polydispersities . this behavior indicated the presence of termination reaction in the initiation step , which appeared to be faster than the propagation step . block copolymer of these acrylate with MMA were synthesized with the catalytic system rac-Et(Ind)2ZrMe2 / [ B(C6F 5)4]-[Me2NHPh]+ / ZnEt <nUm> , starting from the polymerization of MMA . the block copolymer produced were well defined in most case , a indicated by size exclusion chromatography , NMR , and differential scanning calorimetry measurement . an investigation of the polymer particle growth characteristic and polymer molecular weight and composition distribution in ethylene homopolymerization and ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization ha been carried out with a catalyst comprising a zirconocene and methylaluminoxane immobilized on a silica support . the presence of 1-hexene lead to higher productivity and easier fragmentation of the support during particle growth . crystallization analysis fractionation and gel permeation chromatography analysis of ethylene / 1-hexene copolymer prepared at different polymerization time reveals a broadening of the chemical composition distribution with increasing polymerization time a a result of the gradual formation of a relatively high-molecular-weight , ethylene-rich fraction . the result are indicative of significant monomer diffusion effect in both homopolymerization and copolymerization . the formulation of the 4-butenyl end group in zirconocene with catalyzed propulene polymerization , wa analyzed . the olefin polymerization with metallocene catalyst ha attracted much academic and industrial research interest . the analysis of polymer chain end provides key structural information for the determination of the chain transfer mechanism in olefin polymerization . the catalyst solution wa prepared in an inert atmosphere adding <nUm> mmol of RhCl(PPh <nUm> ) <nUm> in <nUm> ml of dry toluene . the evaluation of the intensity of unsaturated group show the percentage of 4-butenyl increase with respect to 2-butenyl in the treatment of the polymer with the hydride complex derived from RhCl(PPh <nUm> ) <nUm> . the result show that the mechanism of the formation of 4-butenyl chain end may be the isomerization of ci 2-butenyl catalyzed by a zirconocene hydride complex formed in situ during polymerization . C1 - symmetric diastereoisomers of a zirconocene dichloride , SiMe2(3-benzylindenyl)(indenyl)ZrCl2 , known a catalyst precursor used to produce polypropy - lenes with similar molecular weight and tacticities , have been investigated in ethylene polymerization . activated by methylaluminoxane , they produce microstructurally different polymer : high - density polyethylene and linear low - density polyethylene , the latter characterized by the presence of ethyl branch . the formation of branch is relevant in the complex having a sterically more crowded ( inward ) site . A comparison with the complex without substituents , meso-SiMe2(indenyl) 2ZrCl2 , show that the presence of a benzyl group on only one of the two indenyl moiety can regulate the number of branch and the molecular weight of the macromolecule . actually , the unsubstituted complex is able to give double the number of branch and lower molecular weight , whereas the ci - symmetric disubstituted complex previously reported generally give linear polyethylene . the impact of propylene prepolymerization on ethylene / 1-hexene and ehylene / 1-octene copolymerization study carried out with a catalyst comprising a zirconocene and MAO immobilized on a silica support were analyzed . the copolymerization of sample , following the prepolymerization , wa carried out by the charging of the desired amount of the comonomer to the reactor , along with n-heptane and an ethylene pressure applied . the catalyst used wa prepared by the impregnation of a silica support with a mixture of MAO and rac - et / ( ind ) 2ZrCl2 . result show that the application of a propylene prepolymerization wa significantly increased in the subsequent ethylene polymerization . also , the prepolymerization of a silica - supported metallocene catalyst with propylene before ethylene / 1-hexene or ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization can lead to a narrowing of the CCD in the resulting copolymer . the copolymerization of propylene and disubstituted diallylsilanes [ ( CH2 = CH-CH2-)2R2Si ( r = CH <nUm> or C6H5 ) ] wa investigated with isoselective and syndioselective zirconocene catalyst with methylaluminoxane a a cocatalyst . the syndioselective catalyst showed a higher reactivity for disubstituted diallylsilanes than the isoselective catalyst . diallyldimethylsilane wa incorporated into the polymer chain via cyclization insertion preferentially and formed 3,5-disubstituted dimethylsilacyclohexane unit in the polypropylene main chain . In the copolymerization with diallyldiphenylsilane , diallyldiphenylsilane wa copolymerized via both cyclization insertion and 1,2-insertion , which formed a pendant allyl group . the structure of isolated silacyclohexane unit , determined by 13C NMR and distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer spectroscopy , proved that the 1,2-insertion of diallylsilanes proceeded with enantiomorphic site control ; however , the diastereoselectivity of the cyclization reaction wa independent of the stereoselectivity of the catalyst used , and cis-silacyclohexane unit were mainly formed . vinylcyclohexane ( VCH ) wa copolymerized with ethene and propene using methylaluminoxane - activated metallocene catalyst . the catalyst precursor for the ethene copolymerization wa rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)ZrCl2 ( 1 ) . propene copolymerizations were further studied with Cs - symmetric isopropylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl)ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , C 1-symmetric ethylene(l-indenyl-2-phenyl-2-fluorenyl)ZrCl2 ( 3 ) , and " meso " -dimethylsilyl[3-benzylindenyl)(2-methylbenz[e]indenyl) ]ZrCl2 ( 4 ) . catalyst <nUm> produced a random ethene - VCH copolymer with very high activity and moderate VCH incorporation . the highest comonomer content in the copolymer wa <nUm> mol % . catalyst <nUm> and <nUm> produced poly(propene-co- vinylcyclohexane ) with moderate to good activity [ up to <nUm> and <nUm> kg of polymer / ( mol of catalyst × h ) for <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ] under similar reaction condition but with fairly low comonomer content ( up to <nUm> and <nUm> % for <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ) . catalyst <nUm> and <nUm> , both bearing a fluorenyl moiety , gave propene - VCH copolymer with only negligible amount of the comonomer . the homopolymerization of VCH wa performed with <nUm> a a reference , and low-molar-mass isotactic polyvinylcyclohexane with a low activity wa obtained . the ring - opening polymerization of e-caprolactone ( e-CL ) and d-valerolactone ( d-VL ) using nine catalytic system consisting of a combination of three C2V zirconocene complex and three borate cocatalysts is discussed . the polymerization proceed in a well - controlled manner , producing polymer with relatively high molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution . kinetic experiment of the polymerization of e-CL with the catalytic system Cp2ZrMe2 / B(C 6F5)3 ( 1 ) showed a linear dependence between polymerization yield and molecular weight with time , a well a between the molecular weight with the molar ratio of the monomer over the catalyst [e-CL] / [Zr] , indicating sufficient control of the polymerization reaction . the catalytic system ( 1 ) wa utilized for the synthesis of well - defined block copolymer of MMA with e-CL and d-VL . all sample were characterized by size exclusion chroma - tography , nuclear magnetic resonance , and differential scanning calorimetry . mesoporous alumina with average pore size of <nUm> - <nUm> nm were prepared by anodization of an aluminum film ( AAO ) , and by a sol - gel templating method ( TPL ) . In addition to a commercial alumina and sulfated TPL , the alumina were used a support for cyclopentadienyl zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl <nUm> ) and trimethyl(e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium ( Cp*ZrMe3 ) and tested in the polymerization of ethylene . the metallocenes supported on the alumina prepared with the templating method and it sulfated modification exhibited polymerization activity of <nUm> and <nUm> kgPE / ( molZr × h × bar ) , respectively , comparable to that obtained with silica - supported metallocenes ( <nUm> kg PE / ( molZr × h × bar ) ) . the acid site distribution of the alumina wa studied with FTIR and temperature programmed desorption ( TPD ) of pyridine , and also the amount of medium and strong acid site wa determined gravimetrically from the adsorption of pyridine . relative to the surface area , AAO with the highest amount of acid site ( <nUm> mmolPY / mAAO2 ) adsorbed cp 2ZrCl2 and Cp*ZrMe3 the most . study of the polymer ' morphology with a scanning electron microscope revealed polyethylene nanofibers in all the polymer sample , also in those obtained from the reference polymerization with homogeneous Cp2ZrCl2 and Cp*ZrMe3 . this finding suggests that a catalyst support with a tubular pore structure is not a prerequisite for the formation of polymer nanofibers . poly(propylene-ran-1,3-butadiene) wa synthesized using isospecific zirconocene catalyst and converted to telechelic isotactic polypropylene by metathesis degradation with ethylene . the copolymer obtained with isospecific C2 - symmetric zirconocene catalyst activated with modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) had 1,4-inserted butadiene unit ( 1,4-BD ) and 1,2-inserted unit ( 1,2-BD ) in the isotactic polypropylene chain . the selectivity of butadiene towards 1,4-BD incorporation wa high up to <nUm> % using rac-dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( Cat-A ) / MMAO . the molar ratio of propylene to butadiene in the feed regulated the numberaverage molecular weight ( Mn ) and the butadiene content of the polymer produced . metathesis degradation of the copolymer with ethylene were conducted with a CI6W / SnMe4 / propyl acetate catalyst system . the 1H NMR spectrum before and after the degradation indicated that the polymer degraded by ethylene had vinyl group at both chain end in high selectivity . the analysis of the chain scission product clarified the chain end structure of the poly(propylene-ran-1,3-butadiene) . the influence of ligand structure on copolymerization property of metallocene catalyst wa elucidated with three C1 - symmetric methylalumoxane ( MAO ) activated zirconocene dichloride , ethylene(1-(7 , 9)-diphenylcyclopenta-[a]-acenaphthadienyl-2-phenyl-2-cyclopentadienyl)ZrCl <nUm> ( 1 ) , ethylene(1-(7 , 9)-diphenylcyclopenta[a]-acenaphthadienyl-2- phenyl-2-fluorenyl)ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , and ethylene(1-(9)-fluorenyl-(R)1- phenyl-2-(1-indenyl)ZrCl2 ( 3 ) . polyethenes produced with <nUm> / MAO had considerable , ca. <nUm> % amount of trans-vinylene end group , resulting from the chain end isomerization prior to the chain termination . when ethene wa copolymerized with 1-hexene or 1-hexadecene using <nUm> / MAO , molar mass of the copolymer varied from high to moderate ( 531-116 kg / mol ) depending on the comonomer feed . At <nUm> % comonomer feed , ethene / 1-olefin copolymer with high hexene or hexadecene content ( around <nUm> % ) were achievable . In the series of catalyst , polyethenes with highest molar mass , up to <nUm> kg / mol , were obtained with sterically most crowded <nUm> / MAO , but the catalyst wa only moderately active to copolymerize higher olefin . catalyst <nUm> / MAO produced polyethenes with extremely small amount of trans-vinylene end group and relatively low molar mass 1-hexene copolymer ( from <nUm> to <nUm> kg / mol ) with similar comonomer content a <nUm> . these result indicate that the catalyst structure , which favor chain end isomerization , is also capable to produce high molar mass 1-olefin copolymer with high comonomer content . In addition , an exceptionally strong synergetic effect of the comonomer on the polymerization activity wa observed with catalyst <nUm> / MAO . C2 - symmetric group <nUm> metallocenes based catalyst ( rac - [ CH 2(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 ( 1 ) , rac-[CH2(1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 ( 2 ) and rac - [ CH 2(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]TiCl2 ( 3 ) ) are able to copolymerize styrene and 1,3-butadiene , to give product with high molecular weight . In agreement with symmetry property of metallocene precatalysts , styrene homosequences are in isotactic arrangement . full determination of microstructure of copolymer wa obtained by 13C NMR and FTIR analysis and it reveals that insertion of butadiene on styrene chain - end happens prevailingly with 1,4-trans configuration . In the butadiene homosequences , using zirconocene - based catalyst , the 1,4-trans arrangement is favored over 1,4-cis , but the latter is prevailing in the presence of titanocene ( 3 ) . diad composition analysis of the copolymer make possible to estimate the reactivity ratio of copolymerization : zirconocenes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) produced copolymer having r1 × r2 = <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ( where <nUm> refers to styrene and <nUm> to butadiene ) ; while titanocene ( 3 ) gave tendencially blocky styrene-butadiene copolymer ( r1 × r2 = <nUm> ) . the copolymer do not exhibit crystallinity , even when they contain a high molar fraction of styrene . probably , comonomer homosequences are too short to crystallize ( n <nUm> , in the copolymer at highest styrene molar fraction ) . we inclusively investigated polymerization behavior and structure of co-polymer in the copolymerization of propylene and alkylaluminum - protected polar allyl monomer . the control of the arrangement of polar group in the copolymer wa discussed . it wa proved that the location of polar group could be controlled by zirconocene catalyst and a kind of polar monomer . the indenyl or the 2-methylindenyl ligand of zirconocene were favored to produce end - functionalized polymer . it wa also found that the trimethylaluminum- protected allylamine and triisobutylaluminum - protected allylmercaptan had superior ability in the synthesis of end - functionalized polypropylene . on the other hand , the 2-methyl-4-phenylindenyl ligand produced the copolymer containing both the end - polar unit and inner - polar unit at the polymer chain . terpolymerization of propylene , polar allyl monomer , and 5-hexen-1-ol wa also conducted . the NMR study of the terpolymer revealed that both the 5-hexen-1-ol and the polar allyl monomer were incorporated into the polymer chain . it ha also become apparent that the polar allyl monomer unit predominantly occupied the chain end , while the 5-hexen-1-ol unit were located at the inner of main chain . consequently , we have achieved the synthesis of functionalized polypropylene in which the arrangement of polar group wa precisely controlled . highly filled polyethylene (PE)-based nanocomposites were obtained by in situ polymerization technique . an organically modified montmorillonite , cloisite ® <nUm> A ( C15A ) , wa previously treated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) to form a supported cocatalyst ( C15A / MA0 ) before being contacted with a zirconocene catalyst . the main feature of C15A / MA0 intermediate were studied by elemental analysis , TGA , TGA - FTIR , WAXD , and TEM . MAO reacts with the clay , replaces most of the organic surfactant within the clay gallery and destroys the typical crystrallographic order of the nanoclay . the catalytic activity in the presence of C15A / MAO is higher than in ethylene polymerization without any inorganic filler and increase with MAO supportation time . this indicates that part of the polymer chain grows within the clay gallery , separate them , and make it possible to tune the final morphology of the composite . the polymerization result and the influence of C15A pretreatment and polymerization condition on thermal and morphological property of the hybrid PE / C15A nanocomposites are presented . the copolymerization of ethylene ( e ) and norbornene ( NB ) wa investigated using the commercially available and inexpensive catalyst system , cyclopentadienylzirconium trichloride (CpZrCl3)Zisobutyl-modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) , at a moderate polymerization temperature in toluene . for the CpZrCl3 catalyst system activated by aluminoxane with a <nUm> mol % methyl group and a <nUm> mol % isobutyl group ( MMAO ) , the quantity of the charged NB and the polymerization temperature significantly affected the molecular weight , polydispersities , and NB content of the obtained copolymer and the copolymerization activity in all the experiment . As the charged NB increased and thereby the NB / e molar ratio increased , the NB content in the copolymer increased and reached a maximum value of <nUm> mol % . the CpZrCl <nUm> / MMAO ( [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> ) catalyst system with the [NB] of <nUm> mol L-1 and ethylene of <nUm> MPa at <nUm> ° C showed the highest activity of <nUm> kg molZr.-1 h-1 and molecular weight of <nUm> g mol-1 . the 13C NMR analysis showed that the CpZrCl3 / MMAO catalyst system produced the E-NB random copolymer with a number of NB homosequences such a the NN dyad and NNN triad . copolymerizations of ethylene or propylene and allyl monomer containing 9-fluorenyl group , diallyl-di-9-fluorenylsilane ( DAFS ) , 9,9-diallylfluorene ( DAF ) , and 9-allylfluorene ( AF ) , were investigated with various zirconocene catalyst using methylaluminoxane a a cocatalyst . the bridged zirconocene catalyst , especially a syndioselective catalyst , showed a higher reactivity for all the comonomers than the nonbridged catalyst . DAFS wa mainly incorporated into the polymer chain via cyclization insertion , whereas DAF wa copolymerized via both 1,2-and cyclization insertion . cyclization selectivity , ratio of cyclized insertion unit , of DAF in the copolymerization with propylene wa higher than that in the copolymerization with ethylene . copolymerization with AF yielded low - molecular weight copolymer because of frequent chain transfer reaction . optical property of the propylene based - copolymer were investigated by UV - vi and photoluminescence spectroscopy , and absorption - and emission - derived from fluorenyl group were detected in the copolymer . monodisperse cyano-functionalized porous polymeric bead were synthesized by seeded polymerization ; these microparticles were further used a support for zirconocene catalyst , which performed a a solid homogeneous catalyst in ethylene polymerization . copolymerization of ethylene and diallyl-bis(pyren-1-yl)-silane ( APyS ) wa investigated with zirconocene catalyst , rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) and diphenylmethylene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 2 ) , using methylaluminoxane a a cocatalyst . APyS wa copolymerized via both 1,2-insertion and cyclization insertion , and cyclization selectivity , ratio of cyclized insertion unit , of APyS in the copolymer obtained with catalyst <nUm> wa higher than that obtained with catalyst <nUm> . catalyst <nUm> showed a higher reactivity for APyS than catalyst <nUm> . photophysical property of the copolymer were investigated by UV - vi and photoluminescence ( PL ) spectroscopy , and absorption and fluorescence derived from pyrenyl group were detected in the copolymer . chloroform solution of the copolymer showed emission derived from both monomer and eximer of pyrenyl unit . only the emission derived from eximer of pyrenyl unit wa observed in the cast film . the polarized PL spectrum of an oriented film showed anisotropy , and the polarization excitation parallel to the drawing direction showed high fluorescence intensity . the electron ionization mass spectrometric behaviour of a new series of hafnocene and zirconocene diadamantanolates is discussed . they are also compared on the basis of mass-analyzed ion kinetic energy spectrometry . fragmentation pattern of the complex in question give relevant information on their gas-phase behaviour a MO2 / MC ( m = Zr , Hf ) precursor for metal-organic chemical vapour deposition . two supported metallocene catalyst ( CS : PQ <nUm> / MAO / cp 2ZrCl <nUm> and CS <nUm> : PQ 3030-BuGeCl <nUm> / MAO / cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ) were prepared by sequentially loading MAO and cp 2ZrCl <nUm> on partially dehydroxylated silica PQ <nUm> . In catalyst CS <nUm> , nBuGeCl <nUm> wa used to functionalize the silica . these catalyst were characterized by DR - FTIR spectroscopy , CPMAS NMR spectroscopy , and XPS . their catalytic performance wa evaluated by polymerizing ethylene using the MAO cocatalyst and characterizing the resulting polymer by GPC . both catalyst produced two metallocenium cation ( cation <nUm> : [ cp 2ZrCl ] + and cation <nUm> : [ cp 2ZrMe ] + ) with comparable equilibrium concentration and showed varying solid - state electronic environment . the modified support ( PQ <nUm> / MAO and PQ 3030-BuGeCl <nUm> / MAO ) acted a weakly coordinating polyanions and stabilized the above cation . BuGeCl <nUm> did not affect the solid - state electronic environment . however , it increased the surface cocatalyst to catalyst molar ratio ( Al : Zr ) , acted a a spacer , increased catalyst activity , and enhanced chain - transfer reaction . the separately fed MAO cocatalyst shifted the equilibrium between cation <nUm> and cation <nUm> toward the right . consequently , more cation <nUm> wa generated , which acted a the effective and active single - site catalytic specie producing monomodal PDI . imidozirconocene complex ( Cp2Zr = NR(THF) ) posse a rich reaction chemistry , in contrast to many imido complex of later transition metal . the synthesis and structural characteristic of these compound are briefly described , along with a qualitative molecular orbital description of the metallocene - imido interaction . imidozirconocene complex react at the Zr = N linkage with a variety of X-H bond , and undergo overall [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition reaction with a wide range of unsaturated organic and organometallic compound . result of study detailing the scope and mechanism of these reaction are presented herein , along with application to catalytic hydroamination , imine metathesis , and asymmetric transformation . radical reaction mediated by schwartz reagent and zirconocene(alkene) complex are firstly described . schwartz reagent is a promising alternative to tributyltin hydride and the first transition metal hydrido complex used a a radical mediator in organic synthesis .

At the forefront of these development have been zirconocene - phosphinoaryloxide complex ; the activation of small molecule , including H , CO2 , ether , olefin and alkyl chloride or fluoride , with such zirconocene ( or group <nUm> metallocene in general ) phosphine pair is described . nascent catalytic application for such complex in dehydrogenation reaction and future possibility for catalytic reactivity are also highlighted . A wider discussion of how the FLP concept may rationalise previous example of cooperative reactivity in transition metal complex , such a the heterolytic cleavage of hydrogen , suggests a strong and useful analogy . the development of ansa - metallocene catalyst is considered along several line of interest-ansa-metallocene complex with different ligand framework , insight gained with regard to relevant reaction intermediate and contribution of ansa - metallocene catalyst to industrial polymer production - with a view toward the present state of the art in these field of catalysis research . spontaneously formed fiber are formed from a number of metal - containing polymer when synthesized employing the interfacial polymerization system . this topic is reviewed with emphasis on group IVB and organotin - containing polymer . over <nUm> organotin polymer were surveyed for fiber formation . it is believed that fiber formation is favored when the backbone is rigid . the fiber have aspect ratio over <nUm> . their use a fiber in composite is encouraged . twentytwo new substituted metallocene Cp1Cp2MCl2 ( m = Ti , Zr or Hf ) dichloride have been prepared and the catalytic activity of some of them in alkene polymerization ha been primarily evaluated . the cp < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ClZr < inf > <nUm> < / inf > / C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > AlCl < inf > <nUm> < / inf > system ( cp = p-cyclopentadienyl ) wa found to be an active catalyst for polymerization of alkyne . both internal and terminal alkyne were polymerized by this homogeneous catalytic system . spectroscopic observation of a zirconacyclopentadiene compound in the above reaction led to the investigation of zirconacyclopentadienes a possible reaction intermediate . the zirconacyclopentadiene on reaction with phenylacetylene produced larger zirconacycles and poly-(phenylacetylene) . apparently , the mechanism of polymerization of alkyne is by successive insertion of the alkyne into the zirconium-carbon bond , producing expanded zirconacycles , elimination of which result in the formation of a polyalkyne . propene wa polymerized with ethylene bis(-1-indenyl)-dichlorozirconium ( Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) and methylalumoxane ( MAO ) at <nUm> ° C . the polymer wa fractionated by solvent extraction ; there wa no hexane insoluble material . the pentane insoluble , hexane soluble ( C5iC6s ) fraction contains <nUm> % mmmm pentad . it ha x-ray crystallinity of <nUm> % comprised of <nUm> % g-phase , and no NMR detectable misinsertions . however , 1,3-insertion wa found in the more soluble fraction . polymerization of ethylene and copolymerization of ethylene-propylene proceeded smoothly by using homometallic binuclear zirconium complex <nUm> or heterometallic binuclear zirconium - titanium complex <nUm> / methylaluminoxane catalyst system . the molecular weight distribution of polymer obtained by the binuclear zirconium complex were broader than that produced by mononuclear zirconium complex . the catalytic performance ( activity and polymer property ) of metallocenes with different symmetry in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) in the polymerization of propylene ha been investigated at different temperature , under standardized reaction condition . the zirconocene rac-ethylene ( e5-1-indenyl ) zirconium ( IV ) dichloride , with C2 symmetry , produce isotatic polypropylene and isopropylidene(e5-cyclopentadienyl ( e5-9-fluorenyl ) zirconium ( IV ) dichloride , with CS symmetry , syndiotactic polypropylene . the degree of the tacticity of these polymer increase with decreasing polymerization temperature . only atactic polypropylene wa formed with the unbridged zirconocenes bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl) zirconium ( IV ) dichloride and bis(e5-indenyl zirconium ( IV ) dichloride at any temperature investigated ( 10-60 ° C ) . the comparison of the copolymer obtained with the Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO and Cp2HfCl2 / MAO catalyst system showed that the catalyst having hafnocene wa much more reactive towards 1-octadecene than zirconocene . the comonomer concentration had to be three time higher in the zirconocene copolymerization than in the hafnocene copolymerization when the level of <nUm> mol- % wa reached . although the hafnocene catalyst wa more reactive towards 1-octadecene , the molecular weight were higher than in the copolymer obtained with the zirconocene catalyst . the total activity of the zirconocene wa <nUm> time higher than with the hafnocene catalyst . with the zirconocene catalyst the activity towards ethylene wa constantly increasing by increasing the comonomer concentration but stayed nearly constant with the hafnocene catalyst . it seemed that there is no rate enhancement effect upon comonomer addition with the hafnocene catalyst . three ethylene-bridged unsymmetric zirconocene dichloride bearing a cyclopentadienyl unit together with either a tetraphenylcyclopentadienyl- ( 8 ) , a 7,9-diphenylcyclopent[a]-acenaphtha-dienyl-(9) or a fluorenyl group ( 10 ) were used for propene polymerization after activation with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) at <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> ° C . whereas <nUm> is inactive at all , <nUm> produce atactic polypropene wax with high activity . the polypropene product of <nUm> are syndiotactic with stereoregularities depending on the polymerization temperature a well a on monomer and on MAO concentration . polymerization of propylene wa carried out at <nUm> ° C in the presence of methyl methacrylate(MMA) or ethyl benzoate(EB) using rac-Et(Ind)2ZrMe2 or rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrMe2 / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 a catalyst , which resulted in highly isotactic poly(propylene) with [mmmm] > <nUm> % , Tm = 160-161 ° C and very few 1,3- or <nUm> regioirregular unit . with the use of an achiral zirconocene Cp2ZrMe2 , a polymer with Tm = <nUm> ° C wa resulted a well . base on these experimental fact that the zirconocene can form a C1 - symmetrical complex with a lewis base . the norbornene / ethene copolymerization wa investigated by using two CS - symmetric ( [Me2C(Fluo)(Cp)]ZrCl2III , [Ph2C(Fluo)(Cp)]ZrCl2IB ) and two C2 - symmetric ( [Me2Si(Ind)2]ZrCl2I , [Ph2Si(Ind)2]ZrCl2II ) catalyst with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) a cocatalyst . this investigation focussed not only on the different polymerization behavior , like catalyst activity , but also considers the material property of the synthesized copolymer . it wa found , that the CS - symimetric catalyst are very well suitable to yield amorphous copolymer with glass transition temperature above <nUm> ° C and molecular weight > <nUm> g / mol . these copolymer could be used a potential starting material for optical disc and fiber . the antitumor activity of the metallocene dichloride TDC , ZDC , and HDC against ehrlich ascites tumor in CF <nUm> mouse is investigated . A single i.p. injection of TDC in the optimum dose ( 30-60 mg / kg ) <nUm> h p.t.t . achieves survival of 80-90 % of the animal until day <nUm> p.t.t . without any tumor manifestation . this indicates an increase in the mean survival time of about <nUm> % referred to the untreated animal . In contrast , ZDC and HDC exhibit no recognizable antineoplastic property under equal experimental condition . assuming a similar mechanism of tumor inhibition for both DDP and the antineoplastic active metallocene dichloride TDC , VDC , and MDC , the comparatively increased non-bonding Cl ... Cl distance ( " bite " ) of ZDC and HDC may be responsible for the cancerostatic inactivity of the latter compound . the in vitro growth - inhibiting potency of titanocene dichloride ( TDC ) , zirconocene dichloride ( ZDC ) , hafnocene dichloride ( HDC ) , vanadocene dichloride ( VDC ) , and molybdocene dichloride ( MDC ) against ehrlich ascites tumor ( EAT ) cell cultured in vitro a permanently growing suspension culture were determined . the most striking growth - suppression activity wa detected for VDC . A VDC concentration a low a <nUm> · <nUm> < sup > <nUm> < / sup > mol / l effect a highly significant diminution of cell proliferation . TDC and MDC inhibit cellular growth only in concentration of <nUm> · <nUm> < sup > <nUm> < / sup > or <nUm> < sup > <nUm> < / sup > mol / l , respectively , whereas ZDC and HDC , which are ineffective against EAT cell in vivo , require higher concentration level . the growth inhibition is caused by a cytotoxic action of the metallocene dichloride , a is demonstrated in the case of VDC and TDC by differentiation of live and dead EAT cell by mean of the dye lissamine green . by reaction of the [1]zirconocenophane(CH)3)2Si(C5H4)2ZrCl2 with equivalent amount of Li Et3BH and sulfur , C12H14S5SiZr can be prepared a chelate complex . the structure of this S5Zr chelate is discussed on the basis of its1H NMR spectrum . <nUm> . the thermal and photoinduced reaction of Cp2MMMe2 ( m = Ti , Zr ) with Et3EH ( e = Ge , Sn ) produce <nUm> mole of Et6E2 , <nUm> mole of methane , and <nUm> mole of Cp2M . compound with the general formula Cp2M(EEt3)2 could not be obtained . <nUm> . the exchange reaction of Cp2MCl2 ( m = Ti , Zr ) with Et3ELi ( e = Ge , Sn ) in THF or toluene at <nUm> ° C result in the formation of compound with the general formula Cp2M(EEt3)2 , which decompose at <nUm> ° C , yielding <nUm> mole of Et6E2 and an adduct of the biscyclopentadienyl derivative of the metal with THF . A new class of polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane ( POSS ) copolymer ha been developed by incorporating into a polymer backbone the POSS disilanol macromer , (c-C6H11)8Si8O11(OH)2 , along with a variety of inorganic comonomers . these new inorganic cluster - based copolymer were synthesized using a condensation polymerization approach , with formation of metal oxygen bond and climination of ClH ( a HNEt3 Cl ) or CH4 driving the reaction . the polymer thus formed are isolated a amorphous powder but do not display any observable glass transition ; they decompose without melting at over <nUm> C under nitrogen . especially interesting is the formation of a zirconocene - bridged copolymer which is stable to both air and methanol . zirconocene and hafnocene dihydrides Cp2MH2 ( m = Zr , Hf ) are capable of rapid absorbing carbon dioxide at room temperature and atmospheric pressure in a THF medium . In the case of Cp2ZrH2 , the reaction result in the cleavage of the C = O bond of a CO2 molecule to form cyclic trimeric zirconocene oxide [Cp2ZrO]3 , whose structure wa confirmed by analytical and spectral method a well a by x-ray diffraction study . small amount of formaldehyde and methyl formate are found in the organic product of the reaction . A mixture of rac- and meso-2,2'-propylidene-bis(e <nUm> -indenyl)zirconium dichloride wa obtained in <nUm> % yield . the compound were separated , and their structure were established by x-ray structural analysis . Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and the MAO co-catalyst , which polymerize ethylene and propylene , were heterogenized on partially dehydroxylated davison silica <nUm> , following the method of equilibrium adsorption . the dispersion of these catalyst component on the silica support wa investigated by measuring the spatial concentration profile of Si , Al , and Zr using a micro-PIXE technique . these component were found to be uniformly distributed over the support irrespective of the variation in the heterogenization procedure and the experimental condition used . the Si : Al ratio determined by the micro- PIXE technique were similar to those measured by the spectrophotometric method . however , the Al : Zr ratio measured by the former were somewhat lower than those determined by the latter . Micro-PIXE measurement confirmed the presence of several trace impurity such a K , Ca , Ti , Fe , Ni , Cu , and Zn which may potentially poison the resulting catalyst . ansa-{e <nUm> ,e 5' -[1,1'-(1-Silacyclopent-3-ene-1,1-diyl)bis(indenyl)] } dichlorozirconium ( 1a,b ) wa synthesized . the crystal structure of meso-[(1,4-CH <nUm> CH = CHCH <nUm> )Si(C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ] ( 1b ) wa established by x-ray diffraction analysis . photoinduced interconversion of the racemic ( 1a ) and meso form wa studied under various condition . the photostationary state ( rac : meso = <nUm> : <nUm> ) wa established rapidly when solution of ansa - zirconocene were irradiated with visible light . an efficient synthetic approach to 3-alkyl(aryl)-2-bromoindenes wa developed . the reaction of 2-bromo-3-tert-butylindene with MeMgI catalyzed by Ni(dppp)Cl <nUm> afforded 3-tert-butyl-2-methylindene from which bis(3-tert-butyl-2-methylinden-l-yl)methane and the corresponding ansa - zirconocene were synthesized . A linear correlation between the electrochemical gap value ( g = eox - ered ) and the energy of optical transition in the UV - vi region wa found and justified for a series of non-bridged and bridged bent - sandwich zirconocene complex with the general formula R(n5-L)2ZrX2 , where L = cyclopentadienyl ( cp ) , indenyl ( lnd ) , fluorenyl ( flu ) ; x = Cl , me ; the bridging group r = SiMe2 , CH2 . the first acetylene complex of hafnium , cp <nUm> Hf[Me <nUm> CaSi ≡ CHf(H)Cp <nUm> ] , wa synthesized by the reaction of hafnocene dihydride cp <nUm> HHf <nUm> with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene in benzene . the reaction is accompanied by elimination of the me <nUm> Si group from the molecule of the initial acetylene , a a result of which the acetylenide derivative of hafnium cp <nUm> Hf(C ≡ CSiMe <nUm> )(H) act a an acetylene ligand in the complex . under analogous condition , the reaction of zirconocene dihydride cp <nUm> HZr <nUm> with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene affords an analogous acetylene complex of zirconium cp <nUm> Zr[M <nUm> CSi ≡ CZr(H)Cp <nUm> ] . reaction of cp <nUm> HHf <nUm> with tolane and 3-hexyne proceed differently than the reaction with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene . here the corresponding hafnacyclopentadiene metallacycles are the final product . comparative analysis of catalytic activity of substituted bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride with the general formula ( r n cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( MeCp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( Pr i cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( Pr i <nUm> cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( bu n cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( bu i cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( bu t cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , cp* <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( cp* = me <nUm> C <nUm> ) , ( me <nUm> SiCp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( cyclo-C <nUm> H <nUm> cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , and [ ( cyclo-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> cp ] <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ) in ethene polymerization using polymethylalumoxane a the cocatalyst wa performed . the molecular mass characteristic of the polyethylene sample obtained were determined . A linear correlation of the specific activity of the catalyst and the turnover number with the electronic and steric characteristic of substituents at the cp ring of the complex wa established for the first time . analysis of the polymerization kinetics and the obtained correlation between the specific activity of the complex and molecular mass characteristic of the polyethylene sample suggest that alkyl substituents participate in reaction responsible for the restriction of the polymer chain growth and regeneration of the active center . these interaction most likely involve associate of AlMe <nUm> with polymethylalumoxane molecule . A DFT study of ethylene polymerization by zirconocene catalyst wa carried out . stationary point corresponding to intermediate and transition state were located on the potential energy surface of the [ cp <nUm> CZr <nUm> H <nUm> ] + + C <nUm> H <nUm> model system . three possible reaction mechanism involving the formation of b-agostic complex were considered . the energy and thermodynamic characteristic for different reaction pathway were calculated . corresponding activation energy lie in the range <nUm> - <nUm> kcal mol <nUm> . the catalytic property of the zirconium complex with " constrained geometry " Me2SiCp*NBu1ZrX2 ( cp* = C5Me4 , x = Cl ( 1a ) , me ( 1b ) ) and bridged bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconocene Me2SiCp2ZrX2 ( x = Cl ( 2a ) , me ( 2b ) ) during their activation with triisobutylaluminum / perfluorophenyl borate ( TIBA / LB(C6F5)4 , L = CPh3 ( 3 ) , Me2HNPh ( 4 ) ) in ethylene polymerization under a monomer pressure of 2-20 atm were studied by comparison . both dichloride complex exhibit moderate activity under the action of the combined TIBA / <nUm> activating agent and give linear high-molecular-weight polyethylene ( PE ) . the interaction of the dimethyl complex with TIBA / <nUm> afford active site in which the growing polymeric chain is intensely transferred to the monomer , due to which low-molecular-weight PE is formed . the dichloride complex affected by TIBA / <nUm> also afford low-molecular-weight PE . analysis of the structure of the polymeric product ( 1H NMR spectrometry , IR spectroscopy ) , molecular - weight parameter of the PE sample ( gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) ) , and kinetics of polymerization suggested that the active site contains AlBu13 a a heteronuclear bridged cationic complex . the influence of various basic substrate ( the product of chain transfer with the terminal vinyl group , the dimethylaniline fragment of borate <nUm> or other amine specially introduced into the reaction mixture ) on the catalytic property of the Zr-Al site wa revealed . the polymerization rate and molecular - weight parameter of PE a function of the reaction temperature , ethylene pressure , and modifying additive were studied . polymerization of ethylene on zirconocene catalyst wa studied with the density functional theory . the approach proposed previously for the model system cp <nUm> ZrEt + + C <nUm> H <nUm> wa extended to substituted zirconocene catalyst ( RCp ) <nUm> ZrEt + , which allowed u to compare the result of calculation with the experimentally found rate constant of chain propagation . the ethyl fragment wa demonstrated to be an adequate model for a growing polymer chain . the order of decrease in the activation energy of chain propagation calculated for compound with r = H , me , Pr n , and bu n is in qualitative agreement with the experimental data . however , the quantitative description gave underestimated theoretical rate constant of chain propagation compared to the experimental value . In the case of polyalkyl-substituted zirconocenes ( r = 1,2-Me <nUm> or me <nUm> ) , no correlation between the calculated and experimental characteristic wa observed . the result were explained using the simplest model reaction of the replacement of the MeMAO - counterion by an ethylene molecule accompanied by displacement of the former to the outer coordination sphere of the Zr atom . this step wa demonstrated to control the kinetics of the process . it wa concluded that the isolated - cation model used in early investigation is not adequate and call for modification with regard to the effect of the counterion . o-Thiatelluraphenylenezirconocene complex were obtained in good yield by reaction of dilithium o-benzenthiatelluride with zirconocene dichloride . these compound represent the first example of heterodichalcogenaphenylene bent metallocences . they were characterized by spectroscopic method and the effect on the n.m.r . result of stepwise substitution of one and two Te atom for S is discussed . x-ray crystal structure analysis wa performed for one representative complex . the structure is very similar to that previously reported for a diselenaphenylene complex , but the disorder observed for chalcogen atom prevents an accurate comparison of the geometrical parameter with other related compound . the mixture of non-conjugated dienes , 4-methyl-1,4-hexadiene and 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene ( MHD ) , were successfully synthesized by the reaction of isoprene with ethylene using Fe (III) - based catalyst in toluene . the conversion wa over <nUm> mol % on the basis of the initial amount of isoprene used . the production yield for MHD wa nearly <nUm> mol % , the other wa polyisoprene . the mixture were successfully copolymerized with ethylene by using zirconium - based metallocenes . the product were characterized by the combination of gas chromatography , high temperature gel permeation chromatography , 1H NMR , 13C NMR , high temperature 1H NMR , UV / visible spectroscopy , and differential scanning calorimetry . it wa found that 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene wa active enough to be incorporated into the copolymer chain but the corresponding isomeric material , 4-methyl-1,4-hexadiene , wa inactive in metallocene - catalyzed copolymerizations . specifically , in the zirconocene - catalyzed copolymerizations of ethylene with MHD , ansa - structure catalyst seem to be more efficient than non-bridged type zirconocene . the degree of incorporation of MHD in the resulting copolymer wa able to be controlled by the amount of non-conjugated dienes used initially . new group <nUm> metallocene oligosilyl compound ( RSi(SiMe3)2MCp2CI ; m = Zr , r = H , me , SiMe3 , SiMe21Bu , SiMe2CMe2CHMe2 , SiMe2Si(SiMe3)3 ; m = Hf , r = H , SiMe3 ) have been synthesized by reaction of the respective oligosilyl potassium compound with zirconocene or hafnocene dichloride . the catalytic activity of five bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complex of group IV metallocenes in the dehydrocoupling reaction of various 1,2-disubstituted hydrodisilanes were investigated . the reaction were monitored by GC / MS analysis in the early stage , and the polymer were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography . the homo- and copolymerization of styrene ( S ) with p-methylstyrene ( p-MeS ) and p-tert-butylstyrene ( p-ButS ) ha been tested using initiator system of the Ph2Zn-metallocene-MAO type . the metallocenes used were CpTiCl3 , IndTiCl3 , (n-BuCp)2TiCl <nUm> , Ind2ZrCl2 and Et(Ind)2ZrCl <nUm> . the Ph2Zn-metallocene-MAO system homopolymerize styrene , p-methylstyrene and p-tert-butylstyrene , producing syndiotactic polymer in the case of the titanocenes and amorphous polymer in the case of the zirconocenes . the S / p-MeS and S / p-ButS copolymer obtained with the Ph2Zn-titanocene-MAO system are enriched in the comonomer with respect to the initial feed . copolymerizations of ethylene with 1-decene were carried out with a series of stereospecific metallocene compound , rac - (EBI)Zr(NMe2) <nUm> [ <nUm> , EBI = ethylene-1,2-bis(1-indenyl) ] , rac - (EBI)Hf(NMe 2)2 ( 2 ) , rac-Me2Si(1-C5H 2-2-Me-4-tBu)2Zr(NMe2)2 ( 3 ) , ethylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)ZrMe2 [ <nUm> , Et(Flu)(Cp)ZrMe2 ] and isopropylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl) ZrMe2 [ <nUm> , iPr(Flu)(Cp)ZrMe2 ] , combined with Al(i-Bu) <nUm> / [CPh3][B(C6F5)4] cocatalyst . all catalyst system showed very high copolymerization rate and the 1-decene reactivity decreased in the order of <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> ∼ <nUm> > <nUm> . the reactivity product of ethylene and 1-decene ( rE x rD ) wa below <nUm> except <nUm> catalyst , corresponding to random copolymer structure with an alternating character . the melting point ( Tm ) , crystallinity ( xc ) , intrinsic viscosity ( [e] and density of the 1-decene / ethylene copolymer decreased markedly with an increase in the 1-decene content , regardless of the type of catalytic system . propylene copolymerization with 1-hexene and 4-methyl-1-pentene in liquid propylene medium in presence of MAO - activated C2 - symmetry ansa - zirconocene rac-Me2Si(4-Ph-2-MeInd)2ZrCl2 wa studied . random copolymer of propylene with 1-hexene and 4-methyl-1-pentene content up to 7mol[?] % were obtained at <nUm> ° C . general kinetic characteristic of propylene / higher a-olefin copolymerization were evaluated . the distinct feature of propylene copolymerization with 1-hexene and 4-methyl-1-pentene in liquid propylene medium - the proximity of comonomer relative reactivity ratio ( r1 r21 ) that indicates azeotropic nature of copolymerization process in studied condition . synthesized copolymer were characterized with the use of IR , 13C NMR , GPC , WAXD , DSC technique , and uniaxial tensile testing . this article reveals the dependence of crystalline phase in titania on the intrinsic activity during in situ polymerization of ethylene / 1-hexene using the zirconocene / dMMAO catalyst to produce LLDPE / O2Ti nanocomposites . first , the O2Ti nanoparticles having different crystalline phase were employed a the nanofillers by impregnation with dMMAO to obtain dMMAO / O2Ti then , copolymerization of ethylene / 1-hexene using zirconocene catalyst wa performed in the presence of dMMAO / O2Ti . it wa found that the catalytic activity derived from the anatase O2Ti ( A ) wa about four time higher than that obtained from the rutile OTi <nUm> . ( r ) . this wa likely due to higher intrinsic activity of the active specie present on the TiO2(A) . In addition , increased [Al]dMMAO / [Zr]cat ratio apparently resulted in enhanced activity for both O2Ti ( A ) and tio ( r ) . however , the O2Ti ( r ) showed le deactivation upon increased [Al]dMMAO / [Zr]cat ratio . this can be attributed to strong interaction between dMMAO and O2Ti . ( r ) a proven by the TGA measurement . the microstructure of the LLDPE / O2Ti obtained wa found to be random copolymer for both O2Ti ( A ) and O2Ti ( r ) . the copolymerization of styrene with isoprene ( ip ) ha been tested using combined zirconocene-methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) initiating system . both '' halfsandwich '' and real zirconium - based metallocenes were used . regardless of the metallocene employed , conversion to copolymer wa much influenced by the proportion of ip in the initial feed . As the proportion of ip is enriched , conversion to copolymer decrease substantially . result of NMR and DSC analysis indicate that the product obtained were truly copolymer and not a mixture of both homopolymers . the studied zirconocene - MAO initiating system produce atactic polystyrene . A small amount of ip in the initial feed substantially diminishes the conversion and at best trace of poly(isoprene) were detected in the homopolymerization of ip with these initiating system . the spherical zirconia modified with BCl3 , Cl4Si , and glycerol wa used a the support for rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst to catalyze the copolymerization of ethylene / 1-hexene . it is aimed to investigate the modification effect from different modifier on copolymerization behavior and compare the result with the unmodified system . the modified support show higher activity than the unmodified one . especially , the Cl4Si modification exhibited the highest activity and produced copolymer with the largest 1-hexene insertion . this can be attributed to stronger interaction between the support and MAO along with the presence of Cl4Si a a spacer group resulting in the absence of induction period . the modification did not affect the copolymer microstructure and the random copolymer were obtained from all supported system . the narrower molecular weight distribution can be obtained from the modified support . besides , BCl3 modification present the highest molecular weight of polymer probably due to BCl3 suppressing chain transfer reaction . allylbenzene wa polymerized in the presence of two type of homogeneous zirconocene catalyst ( co-catalyst methylaluiminoxane ) . selective chain termination through ss-hydride elimination or chain transfer to aluminum wa observed depending upon the catalyst employed . the rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 , and rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 , catalyst gave the polyallylbenzenes with saturated end group due to chain transfer to aluminum , while the Cp2ZrCl2 catalyst gave the polyallylbenzenes with vinylidene end group due to ss-hydride elimination . lewis acidic site ( LAS ) of silica , modified with TMA and MAO sample differed by TMA content , have been characterized by IR spectroscopy ( CO adsorption a probe molecule at <nUm> K ) . two type of LAS were found on the surface of silica modified with MAO and TMA : m LAS of moderate strength ( vCO = 2204-2212 cm-1 ) and weak W LAS ( vCO = <nUm> cm-1 ) . the concentration of these acidic site ha been estimated . it wa shown by IRS study CP2ZrMe2 interacts both with W LAS and m LAS . correlation between the amount of m LAS and the activity of ethylene polymerization ha been found . thirteen differently substituted long - chain amide- and amine - functional alkene were synthesised and used a comonomers in zirconocene / methylaluminoxane - catalysed copolymerizations with ethylene and propylene . characterization of the prepared copolymer showed the formation of functionalized copolymer with isolated comonomer unit . the incorporation level of the comonomers ranged from <nUm> to <nUm> mol % with ethylene and from <nUm> to <nUm> mol % with propylene . the molar mass of the copolymer were lower than those of the corresponding homopolymers . end group analysis of the copolymer by NMR suggested that the dominant chain termination mechanism wa chain transfer to aluminium . synthesis and activity of bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride catalyst supported on unconventional silica - type material obtained in sol - gel process and activated by organoaluminium co-catalyst were studied . the effect of support modification condition ( thermal dehydration and / or modification by organoaluminium compound ) and a type of co-catalyst on an activity of the catalytic system in ethylene polymerization and property of resulting polymer were investigated and compared with result obtained earlier for vanadium catalyst supported on mentioned sol - gel carrier . the most appropriate method of the sol - gel silica - type support preparation is thermal pre-treating ( <nUm> ° C ) followed by modification with AlEt2Cl . metallocene catalyst supported on such sol - gel product and activated by MAO appeared to be most active among studied system . studied Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO supported on silica - type sol - gel carrier allow to obtain polyethylene ( at <nUm> ° C polymerization temperature ) with yield up to 30*106 g / ( molZr*h ) , molecular weight below <nUm> <nUm> and MWD = 2-4 . ethene wa homo- and copolymerized in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO)-activated zirconocenes comprising (Me5Cp)2ZrCl2 ( cp* ) and racemic dimethylsilylene-bis[-2-methyl-indenyl] - bridged zirconocene dichloride where the ligand framework wa varied by benzannelation ( MBI ) , 4-phenyl ( MPI ) , and 4-naphthyl ( MNI ) substitution . zero shear viscosity and shear thinning of the ethene homopolymers increased a a function of the catalyst system with MNI · MPI > MBI » cp* and were correlated with the presence of long chain branch formed via reinsertion of vinyl-terminated polymer chain . the ranking wa confirmed using the reduced vanGurp palmen plot ( σ vs. IG*I / GN0 ) being le sensitive on molecular weight for polyolefin material . poly(ethene-co-propene)s ( EP ) containing <nUm> and <nUm> wt.- % propene were long chain branched a reflected by pronounced viscosity build-up at low angular frequency and increased shear thinning at higher angular frequency , whereas with propene comonomer content exceeding <nUm> wt.- % EP wa essentially linear . synthesis and activity ofbis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride catalyst supported on unconventional silica - type material obtained in sol - gel process and activated by organoaluminium co-catalyst were studied . the effect of support modification condition ( thermal dehydration and / or modification by organoaluminium compound ) and a type of co-catalyst on an activity of the catalytic system in ethylene polymerization and property of resulting polymer were investigated and compared with result obtained earlier for vanadium catalyst supported on mentioned sol - gel carrier . the most appropriate method of the sol - gel silica - type support preparation is thermal pre-treating ( <nUm> ° C ) followed by modification with AlEt2Cl . metallocene catalyst supported on such sol - gel product and activated by MAO appeared to be most active among studied system . studied Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO supported on silica - type sol - gel carrier allow to obtain polyethylene ( at <nUm> ° C polymerization temperature ) with yield up to 30*106 g / ( molZr*h ) , molecular weight below <nUm> <nUm> and MWD = 2-4 . the present study showed enhanced activity of ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization via O2Ti - O2Si mixed oxide - supported MAO with a zirconocene catalyst . it wa proposed that titania wa decorated on silica surface and acted a a spacer to anchor MAO to the silica support resulting in le steric hindrance and le interaction on the support surface . the bimodal polyethylene obtained from O2Ti - supported zirconocene / MAO catalyst wa observed during polymerization of ethylene and ethylene / 1-hexene . by mean of XPS , it revealed that O2Ti consisted of ti3+ ( BE = <nUm> eV ) and ti4+ ( BE = <nUm> eV ) . the dual catalytic site were attributed to the presence of ti3+ and Ti 4+ in O2Ti . the study revealed enhancement ( four to seven time ) of catalytic activity for ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization via the Zr - modified OSi 2-supported the metallocene / MAO catalyst . increased activity can be attributed to an increase in absorption ability of MAO on the modified support . In addition , the strong interaction between MAO and the support wa also considered . the synthesis , characterization , and application of a wide variety of metallocene and metallocene - like polymer and oligomers is described . much of this effort involves the group IVB metallocenes , but the work of vanadium and ruthenium are also included . the use of these material a analytical reagent , laser modifier , and in solar energy conversion is described . the conductivity of the polyamine derived from titanocene dichloride and 2-nitro-1,4-phenylenediamine increase to <nUm> to <nUm> fold when doped with iodine . larger increase are found for the analogous polyamines except derived from zirconocene dichloride ( increased 103-104 fold ) and hafnocene dichloride ( 105-106 fold ) and for certain other diamine . the conductivity of the product of titanocene dichloride and n-methyl-1,4-phenylenediamine increased <nUm> fold when doped . by comparison , conductivity increased only tenfold for the product from titanocene dichloride and chloro-1,4-phenylenediamine and le for the titanocene product with 1,4-phenylenediamine and methoxy-1,4-phenylenediamine and none for the product from dibutyltin dichloride and 2-nitro-1,4-phenylenediamine . conductivity did not appreciably change when sample were exposed to the atmosphere for <nUm> h. MALDI MS and IR result are consistent with the formation of C-I compound for doped material . polyethylene nanocomposites were prepared by in-situ polymerization technique by using highly active metallocene catalyst zirconocene ( cp 2ZrCl2 ) in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the influence of different concentration ( <nUm> , 0.6,0.83,1.6 and <nUm> wt. % ) of nano calcium zirconate on catalytic activity and polymer property wa investigated . there wa a steep increase in the activity of zirconocene catalyst ( from <nUm> to 185[?] × [?]10-3 g-PE / mol h bar , ) by addition <nUm> wt. % of the nanofiller the result of differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , crystallization analysis fractionation ( CRYSTAF ) and wide angle x-ray diffraction ( WAXD ) show that the percentage crystallinity wa influenced with respect to the nanofiller concentration . microcalorimeter wa used to study the effect of nanofiller on the pyrolysis of polyethylene . the fibril morphology appearing on the fractured surface wa reduced significantly with the addition of nanofiller a is evident from SEM morphology . the successive self - nucleation / annealing technique ( SSA ) by differential scanning calorimetry ha been applied to study the heterogeneity of ethylene-hexene-1 copolymer produced with supported catalytic system of different composition : highly active supported ziegler - natta ( Z-N ) catalyst - a titanium - magnesium catalyst Cl4Ti / Cl2Mg ( TMC ) and a vanadium - magnesium catalyst Cl4V / Cl2Mg ( VMC ) , a supported zirconocene catalyst Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 / OSi <nUm> ( MAO ) , and a chromium - oxide catalyst CrO3 / OSi <nUm> . comparative data by SSA technique with the same temperature program were obtained for copolymer differed by MWD from narrow to very broad ( mw / Mn = 2.4-54 ) and short chain branching distribution from narrow ( zirconocene catalyst ) to very broad ( TMC and chromium oxide catalyst ) . it is demonstrated that copolymer produced with the zirconocene catalyst have the narrowest melting range and do not contain thick lamella . the widest lamella thickness distribution ha been found for a copolymer produced with the chromium - oxide catalyst . copolymer produced with the supported Z-N catalyst are ranked in the middle with a more narrow lamella thickness distribution for copolymer prepared with VMC a compared with the one produced with TMC . the SSA result are compared with the data on copolymer fractionation by TREF . it is shown that these method give a good correlation for copolymer with narrow short - chain branching distribution produced with the supported zirconocene catalyst . In the case of copolymer produced with TMC , TREF yield a higher content of the high - branched fraction . the heterogenized reaction product of the partial hydrolysis of the organoaluminum compound AlMe3 and Al(i-Bu)3 with water a a constituent of highly hydrated support , zeolite ( ZSM-5-H2O ) and montmorillonite ( MMT-H2O ) , have been synthesized . the thermal degradation of the resulting heterogenized methylalumoxane compound and methylalumoxane ( MAO ) in a solid state is studied by temperature - programmed desorption with the mass - spectrometric analysis of liberated gaseous product , and the structural identity of the above compound is found . alkylalumoxanes prepared immediately on the surface of a support form heterogenized complex with the metallocenes Cp2ZrCl2 and Et(Ind) 2ZrCl2 . these heterogenized complex exhibit high activity in the reaction of ethylene and propylene polymerization . for this reason , MAO can be replaced by AlMe3 or Al(i-Bu)3 and the additional introduction of MAO or another alkylaluminum for zirconocene activation is unnecessary . it ha been found that , upon the immobilization of commercial MAO on dehydrated O2Si , the MAO molecule loses a portion of it most reactive methyl group and , a a result of this , becomes incapable of activating metallocenes . the effect of ferrocene and zirconocene dichloride on the rate and constant of copolymerization of methyl methacrylate with styrene wa studied . the result obtained suggest that the metallocenes in the elementary step of the reaction . transformation of electronic absorption spectrum of zirconocene catalytic system Ph2CCpFluZrCl2-polymethylalumoxane ( MAO ) and rac-Me2Si(2-Me,4-PhInd)2ZrCl2 - MAO ( flu is fluorenyl , ind is indenyl ) in toluene wa studied upon a change in the ratio of reactant A1MAO / Zr from <nUm> to <nUm> mol mol-1 . analysis of the spectroscopic data using statistical method determined the number of reaction product in each system . A reaction model including three equilibrium and being common for the both system wa proposed . effective equilibrium constant and absorption spectrum of individual reaction product were determined by parametric self - modeling of the experimental spectrum . A procedure wa developed for the synthesis of trinuclear cyclic ( Zr III)2-Al hydride [(Cp2Zr)2(m-H)] (m-H)2AlX2 ( x = Cl ( 1a ) or Br ( 1b ) ) . these complex were prepared in 60-65 % yield by the reaction of Cp2ZrX2 with AlH4Li in the presence of Br2Co and tolane . the structure of complex 1a and 1b and iodide 1c ( x = I ) were studied by NMR spectroscopy in solvent of different basicities ( toluene , THF , and pyridine ) . complex 1a is unsolvated and monomeric in all solvent ; complex 1b , in toluene and THF ; complex 1c , in toluene only .

A one - pot method for the synthesis of polycyclic phospholanes and phospholane 3-oxides from norbornenes wa developed based on their cp 2ZrCl2 - catalyzed cycloalumination . the in situ formed polycyclic aluminacyclopentanes were treated with organic dichlorophosphines ( RPCl2 , where r = me , but , ph ) to obtain polycyclic phospholanes . the phospholanes were oxidized with hydrogen peroxide to obtain their 3-oxides in 81-92 % yield . the direct photophysical approach to the estimation of the energy and orbital nature of electron - excited state of organometallic compound of early transition metal wa described . the concentration dependence of the zirconocene luminescence quenching wa studied using cyclopentadiene . the quenching of metallocene Cp2MIVCl2 luminescence wa observed using CsHU . the result of experiment on quenching of the luminescence of group IVB complex in the presence of CsHU were obtained even in the case of ET ≥ ET . A series of six - coordinate " half - sandwich " zirconocene phosphate and phosphonates have been synthesized by the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with ( diphenyl- , dibenzyl-)phosphate and methylphenylphosphinic acid under different condition . all of the complex were characterized by elemental analysis , FT-IR and NMR ( 1H , 13C ) spectroscopy . except for complex <nUm> , the structure of complex <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were confirmed by x-ray crystallography . the structure analysis reveal that complex <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> are trinuclear complex with fascinating m3-oxygen bridging ligand , central to a Zr-O backbone ( Cp2ZrCl2 : ligand is <nUm> : <nUm> ) while complex <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> are centrosymmetric dinuclear complex built up about the trapezoidal Zr2(m2-OH)2 unit ( Cp2ZrCl2 : ligand is <nUm> : <nUm> ) . reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with homometallic complex of aluminium containing one residual hydroxy group Al(OGO)(OGOH) and Al(L)(OGOH) [ where g = G1 = CMe2CMe2 ( 1a ) ; g = g <nUm> = CMe2CH2CHMe ( 1b ) ; g = G3 = CMe 2CH2CH2CMe2 ( 1c ) and L = L <nUm> = C7H5O = C2H4NO , g = G1 ( 2a ) ; L = L1 , g = G2 ( 2b ) ; L = L1 , g = G3 ( 2c ) ; L = L2 = C11H7O = NCH 2CH2O , g = G1 ( 2d ) ; L = L2 , g = g <nUm> ( 2e ) ; L = L2 , g = G3 ( 2f ) ] in THF using et <nUm> N a ClH acceptor affords novel heterobimetallic compound of the type Al(OGO)2Zr(Cl)Cp2 and Al(L)(OGO)Zr(Cl)Cp <nUm> , respectively . all of these derivative have been characterised by elemental analysis , molecular weight measurement , and spectroscopic [ IR , NMR ( 1H and 27Al ) ] study . synthesis and characterization of titanium(IV) and zirconium(IV) complex of the type Cp2M(Cl)(HPO) , Cp2M(HPO)2 , cp 2M(O[?]N[?]O) and Cp2M(O [?]N[?]S ) ( where m represents titanium or zirconium and HPO , O[?]N[?]O and O[?]N [?]S represent the donor set of the ligand ) have been reported . these new derivative have been prepared by the reaction of titanocene dichloride or zirconocene dichloride with 2-hydroxy-N-phenyl benzamide(HPOH) , 1-[(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1-N-phenylamino]hydrazine-carboxamide ( HO [?]N[?]OH ) and 2-hydroxy-N-phenyl benzamide benzothiazoline ( HO[?]N[?]SH ) in different molar ratio . the ligand and their complex have been characterized by the elemental analysis , conductance measurement , molecular weight determination and spectral study . on the basis of electronic , i.r. , 1H.-n.m.r . and 13C.-n.m.r . spectral study , trigonal bipyramidal and octahedral geometry have been proposed for the resulting complex . all the ligand and their complex have been screened for their biological activity on several pathogenic fungi and bacteria and were found positive in this respect . some zirconium compound containing chelating diamido dipyrrole or tetra-amido tetra-pyrrole ligand were synthesized and used a polymerization catalyst with high polymerization activity of ethylene at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> bar , in presence of MAO or BC18F15 a co-catalyst . the maximum catalytic activity reached <nUm> kg / mol bar h for ethylene polymerization by zr2(octa-phenyl calix[4]pyrrolidine)Cl4 . these result reveal that half - zirconocene like complex including four terminal chlorine and one calix[4]pyrrolidine in middle with both π and s-interaction have the highest ethylene polymerization turnover ( compound <nUm> , <nUm> ) . substituted 1,4-dimagnesium reagent were synthesized by the zirconocene - catalyzed reaction of alkene with ethylmagnesium reagent in the presence of a methylmagnesium containing additive . improved selectivity for formation of dimagnesium reagent over monomagnesium reagent wa obtained in the presence of the methylmagnesium containing additive . the ratio of monoto dimagnesiated product wa extrapolated from the ratio of alkene to diene in the product formed when the reaction wa quenched with allyl bromide . the extent of the increase in the alkene / diene ratio wa dependent on the type of organomagnesium halide , with greatest increase ( <nUm> % ) for the alkylmagnesium chloride . A mechanism for improved selectivity by suppression of b-hydrogen abstraction in the catalytic cycle is presented . quenching the 1,4-dimagnesium reagent with allyl bromide yielded decadienes . zirconocene reagent derived from zirconocene dichloride and two equivalent of butyllithium react with allylic , homoallylic diene ether . hydrolysis of the reaction product yield substituted tetrahydropyrans . the reaction is postulated to occur via cyclization of the diene to form a zirconacyclopentane . this cyclization occurs without allylic rearrangement . the bis(b-diketonato) Zr complex CpZr(acac)2Cl ( acac = acetylacetonato ) ( 1 ) and Cp*Zr(acac)2Cl ( 2 ) can be synthesized by the reaction of Cp'ZrCl3(Cp' = cp or cp* ) with <nUm> equiv of lithium acetylacetonate . CpZr(acac)2Cl ( 1 ) can be quantitatively prepared by treatment of Cp2ZrCl2 with excess acetylacetone . the tris(b-diketonato) Zr complex CpZr(tfac) <nUm> ( tfac = trisfluoroacetylacetonato ) ( 3 ) ha been prepared by treatment of CpZrCl3 with sodium trisfluoroacetylacetonate . the replacement of both chlorine atom and one cp group from zirconocene dichloride by nonfluorinated diketone , acetylacetone , readily occurs at room temperature in triethylamine medium , offering the tris(b-diketonato) Zr complex CpZr(acac)3 ( 4 ) . the complex were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopic method . In addition , the molecular structure of complex <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined by x-ray diffraction method . when activated by excess methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , these complex were active for ethylene polymerization , offering polyethylene with high molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution . complex <nUm> showed a very high ethylene polymerization activity of up to <nUm> kg PE / mol zr*h at <nUm> atm . complex <nUm> and <nUm> were also active for ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization . Nano-TiO <nUm> particle with a range of crystallite size were synthesized by a conventional sol - gel method , and then used a nanoparticle substrate in the synthesis of LLDPE / OTi <nUm> nanocomposites via in situ polymerization of ethylene / 1-hexene with zirconocene / MMAO catalyst . it wa found that the size of the nano-TiO <nUm> crystallite nanoparticles can influence the catalytic activity in the polymerization system . the larger nano-TiO <nUm> crystallite provided better catalytic activity in the polymerization system due to more space for monomer attack . In addition , by thermo - gravimetric analysis , it can be seen that the larger nano-TiO <nUm> crystallite also exhibited lower interaction with available MMAO . consequently , the MMAO reacted more efficiently with the zirconocene catalyst during the activation process , and enhanced polymerization catalysis . all the polymer nanocomposites product did not have well defined melting temperature indicating non-crystalline polymer . this is due to the high amount of hexene incorporation ( based on 13C NMR ) . the difference in crystallite size of the nano-TiO <nUm> also affected how 1-hexene became incorporated into the polymer nanocomposites . the smaller crystallite size of nano-TiO <nUm> allowed greater 1-hexene incorporation due to depression of the reactivity of the ethylene . the contribution of this work help develop a better understanding of the role of nano-TiO <nUm> in the catalytic activity of the polymerization system and in the microstructure of the polymer composite product . however , this study only considers work on the laboratory scale , so for commercial application of these result , it is necessary to scale up the polymerization process . it is only at this stage , that other physical property , such a the mechanical property of these material can be sensibly determined . Ansa-Cyclohexyl-bis(4,5,6,7-tertrahydro-1-indenyl) zirconium dichloride ( 5 ) wa used a catalyst for propylene and ethylene polymerization together with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) a the cocatalyst . isotactic polypropylene ( PP ) wa obtained with the highest activity of <nUm> × <nUm> g PP ( molZr ) -1h-1 . the meso-meso ( mmmmm ) pentad sequence content of PP wa determined by 13C NMR spectroscopy . the dependence of the microstructure on the reaction temperature and the Al / Zr molar ratio wa examined and the catalytic activity of complex <nUm> wa compared with that of the similar ansa - zirconocene <nUm> . the high activity of the new zirconocene <nUm> for propylene isospectic polymerization at high temperature ( <nUm> ° C ) is the result of it unique bridged - group structure . complex <nUm> / MAO display also high catalytic activity of <nUm> × <nUm> to <nUm> × <nUm> g PE(molZr)-1h-1 in the homo-polymerization of ethylene . the visometric molecular weight of PE range from <nUm> × <nUm> to <nUm> × <nUm> g*mol-1 under the given condition . 13C NMR spectroscopy analysis prof the PE to be linear polyethylene ( LPE ) . OZn nanoparticle wa used for preparing supported catalyst , which wa applied in copolymerization of ethylene and 1-octene to obtain LLDPE / OZn nanocomposite . there were two different impregnation method ( in situ and ex situ ) in preparing the nano-ZnO supported catalyst . the investigation to compare both method wa conducted by employing various 1-octene initial concentration in copolymerization . it wa found that a heterogeneous catalytic system comprised a supported catalyst , prepared by in situ impregnation , provided higher catalytic activity and 1-octene incorporation compared to those of ex situ impregnation under similar condition perhaps due to closer similarity to a homogeneous system . for the ex situ impregnation , it wa found that when zirconocene wa directly impregnated onto the support , the catalytic activity decreased . this wa due to zirconocene close vicinity to the support and even deep into the support structure proved by XPS and TGA measurement . therefore , it wa more inaccessible to monomer attack and reducing the catalytic activity . the separate study on each catalytic system relating to the comonomer effect wa also conducted by applying initial comonomer concentration varied between <nUm> and <nUm> mmol . the increase in catalytic activity with increasing comonomer concentration can be considered a a positive comonomer effect , and the opposite wa true for a negative comonomer effect . it wa found that both positive and negative comonomer effect occurred in in situ impregnation and ex situ impregnation system with Zn / ( Al ? Zr ) support , whereas only positive comonomer effect wa found in an ex situ impregnation system with Zn / Al support . this suggested that the comonomer effect wa varied according to the nature of each system . the polymer property , such a relative crystallinity and thermal property were also investigated and found to alter with 1-octene concentration . the bis(anilino)phosphine oxide (PhNH)2P(O)H a a ligand reacts directly with zirconocene dichloride CCl2P2Zr to afford H(PhNH)P[(NPh)OZr(Cp)2Cl] ( 1 ) , while in the presence of triethylamine a a base the ligand is deprotonated and H(O)P[(NPh)2Zr(Cp) <nUm> ] ( 2 ) is isolated in a very good yield . when the ligand is treated with Cl4Ti , however , the diligand complex Cl3TiO(NPh) PH(NPh)PHO(Nph)TiCl3 ( 3 ) is separated in high yield . these new compound have been fully characterized by FT-IR , UV - vi spectrophotometry and multi-nuclear ( 1H , 31P ) NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis a well a XRF analysis of SEM image . A method is described that allows the preparation of stable conjugated primary enamine containing furyl or pyridyl substituents . In a template reaction (butadiene)zirconocene is 1,4-selectively coupled to two 2-cyanopyridine equivalent to give the nine - membered metallacycle 8b . subsequent treatment with methanol remove the bent metallocene template and lead to the formation of 1,6-diamino-1,6-bis(2-pyridyl)-1,3,5-hexatriene ( 9b ) . the 1,6- diamino-1,6-bis(2-furyl)-1,3,5-hexatriene system ( 9a ) wa prepared analogously ( <nUm> % isolated ) . subsequent addition of benzonitrile to (butadiene)ZrCp2 followed by 2-cyanopyridine or 2-cyanofurane gave the respective unsymmetrically substituted 1,6-diaminohexatrienes in good yield . retention following ( n , γ ) reaction in solid state and in solution in benzene were measured for 1,1'-trimethylenetitanocene dichloride and for the corresponding derivative of zirconocene dichloride and hafnocence dichloride . comparison are made of these retention with those previously measured for the parent compound . retention in solution are best interpreted a due to a fast three - body recombination reaction for the parent compound and to a fast two - body recombination reaction for the bridged derivative . As part of the characterization of substituted biscyclopentadienyl Ti(IV) and Zr(IV) compound , 13C NMR and 1H NMR data have been obtained which indicate that the effect of both metal shielding ( Ti versus Zr ) and ring substitution can be taken into account by a simple additive relationship so that it is possible to predict accurately chemical shift for these system . metallacycles are formed upon thermolysis of (s-trans-e4-butadiene)zirconocene and binuclear (e2-aldehyde)zirconocene complex or photolysis of diphenylzirconocene in the presence of t-butyl- , trimethylsilyl- , and phenyl-acetylene . from a surprising equally high preference for a-t-butyl- and -trimethylsilyl-substituted product a well a the statistically favoured 2,4-disubstituted metallacyclopentadienes formed from t-butyl- or trimethylsilyl-acetylene it is suggested , that the position of the substituents in the final product is predominantly determined by the coordination of the alkyne preceding the ring - closure reaction . In contrast to the thermally induced reaction the expected major product ( 2,5-disubstituted zirconacyclopentadiene ) of the kinetically controlled cyclization reaction is formed upon photolysis of diphenylzirconocene in the presence of phenylacetylene . titanocene and zirconocene derivative with an interannular tetramethylethylene bridge can be made by reductive coupling of 6,6-dimethylfulvene with sodium amalgam , sodium anthracenide , or magnesium metal / CCl4 a reducing agent and subsequent reaction of the anionic tetramethyldicyclopentadienylethane product with Cl3Ti or Cl4Zr in THF . treatment of Cp2ZrCl(CH2PPh2) ( cp = e5-C5H5 ) with CO gave the dinuclear complex (Cp2ZrCl)2 [OCCH(PPh2)] ; a single crystal x-ray diffraction study revealed a coplanar doubly - chelated arrangement { A figure is presented } with electron delocalization throughout the six - atom nucleus . UV photolysis of mixture of dialkyl or diaryl complex of group IVA metal (e5-t-BuC5H4)2M(CH3)2 ( m = Zr , Hf ) containing grey selenium give the new complex [(e5-t-BuC5H4M(m-Se)]2 ( II ) . these complex are also formed by UV irradiation of a solution of equimolar amount of I and (e5-t-BuC5H4)2M(SePh)2 . the dark green crystalline [ZrCp''2(CO)2] ( cp'' = e-C5H3(SiMe3)2 ) , ( I ) ( d(13CO) <nUm> ppm ) , wa prepared by reduction from [ZrCp''2Cl2] and either CO ( using HgNa , Cl2HgMg , or li2 [COT] ) or CHgNaO2 in high ( CO ) to moderate ( CO2 ) yield ; the HgNa / CO procedure wa much more effective than for Zr analogue having e-C5H5 or e-C5H4(SiMe3) ligand ; the carbonyl complex I is a convenient precursor to CO-free derivative obtained either by oxidative addition or ligand displacement . the photolysis of Cp2Zr(CO)2 with diphenylacetylene or 3-hexyne yield the respective zirconacyclopentadiene complex Cp2Z(C4R4) ( r = ph , et ) . the thermolysis of Cp2Z(CO)2 with 3-hexyne or bis(pentafluorophenyl)acetylene also lead to the formation of Cp2Z(C4R4) ( r = et , C6F5 ) . ClH degradation of Cp2Zr[C6(C6F5)4] yield 1,2,3,4-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)-1,3-butadiene and Cp2ZrCl2 . when Cp2Zr(CO)2 is heated with diphenylacetylene in a closed vessel , tetraphenylcyclopentadienone is formed along with Cp2Zr(C4Ph4) . the hafnacyclopentadiene complex Cp2Hf(C4R4) ( r = ph , C6F5 , et ) are obtained when Cp2Hf(CO)2 is thermolyzed with the respective acetylene in refluxing octane . complex Cp2Hf(C4R4) ( r = ph , et ) are also formed when Cp2Hf(CO)2 is photolyzed with diphenylacetylene or 3-hexyne , respectively . the monocarbonyl-triphenylphosphine complex Cp2M(CO)(PPh3) ( m = Zr , Hf ) can be prepared via the irradiation of hydrocarbon solution of Cp2M(CO)2 and triphenylphosphine . these complex react readily with diphenylacetylene and 3-hexyne at 55-60 ° C to afford the corresponding metallacyclopentadiene complex Cp2M(C4R4) ( m = Zr , Hf ; r = ph , et ) . the metallocene dicarbonyls Cp2M(CO)2 ( m = Zr , Hf ) are readily prepared via the reduction of Cp2MCl2 ( m = Zr , Hf ) with amalgamated magnesium metal in THF solution under one atmosphere of carbon monoxide . the chiral ansa - zirconocene derivative ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)-zirconium(IV) dichloride ha been prepared by reaction of dilithiobis(indenyl)ethane with Cl4Zr and subsequent hydrogenation . the product ha been shown to be the 1-R,S rather than meso-metal - ring linkage stereoisomer by an x-ray determination of the molecular structure . ethylene-bridged titanocene and zirconocene derivative with permethylated ring ligand , C20Cl2H28Ti and C20Cl2H28Zr , have been synthesized and their crystal structure determined . Cp2Zr(-NCHR)Cl compound ( 9a-9c : r = CH3 , C6H5 , CH2Ph,respectively ) are formed upon hydrozirconation of nitrile . subsequent reaction with an aryllithium reagent yield Cp2Zr(-NCHR)Ar ( 14 ) . the ( alkylidene amido)zirconocene complex are characterized by a linear heteroallene - type structure possessing an sp - hybridized nitrogen atom . <nUm> reacts with the oligomeric metallocene dihydrides (Cp2ZrH2)x ( 15 ) and (Cp2HfH2)c , ( 17 ) , respectively , to form the binuclear compound Cp2Zr(m-NCHR)(m-Cl)MCp2 ( <nUm> , m = Zr ) and ( <nUm> , m = Hf ) . the formation of these thermally very stable metal complex is discussed . the reaction of imidoylzirconocene complex with zirconocene hydride yield (N-alkylamido)zirconocene complex . for a mechanistic study , the specifically substituted imidoylzirconocene complex 3b-3d have been prepared and treated with the oligomeric metal hydride (Cp2ZrH2)x ( 1b ) and (Cp2ZrHCl)x ( 1c ) . ( N-Benzyl formimidoyl)zirconocene chloride ( 3b ) wa obtained by treating 1c with benzyl isonitrile 2a . treatment of dimethylzirconocene with 2a gave ( n-benzyl acetimidoyl)methylzirconocene ( 3c ) , which wa treated with PhICl2 to give (N-benzylacetimidoyl)zirconocene chloride ( 3d ) . the reaction of 3d with (Cp2ZrH2)x ( 1b ) yielded (N-benzyl-N-ethylamido)zirconocene chloride ( 4b ) a the only identified product . A <nUm> <nUm> mixture of 4b and methylzirconocene chloride wa obtained upon treatment of 3c with (Cp2ZrHCl)x ( 1c ) ; in contrast , the reaction of 1c with 3b gave an equimolar mixture of Cp2ZrCl2 and (N-benzyl-N-methylamido)zirconocene chloride ( 4c ) . reaction path through binuclear ( m-CHR' = NR ) zirconocene intermediate are proposed to explain these experimental observation . polymer - attached Cp2ZrCl2 , Cp2HfCl2 , CpZrCl3 , CpHfCl3 , Cp2ZrCl and Cp3HfCl have been prepared . the polymer - attached Cp2ZrCl2 , on reduction with BuLi , produced an active catalyst whose efficiency for olefin hydrogenation is about eight time a great a that of the corresponding homogeneous specie under the same condition . the reduction product of supported zirconocene and hafnocene complex are active hydrogenation catalyst for diphenylacetylene which wa hydrogenated to 1,2-diphenylethane through intermediate stilbene . the similar reduction product have also been employed in catalytic isomerization of allylbenzene , cis-stilbene and 1,5-cyclooctadiene . allylbenzene wa converted into a mixture of trans- and cis-propenylbenzene , cis-stilbene wa isomerized to trans-stilbene , and 1,5-cyclooctadiene wa isomerized to 1,3-cyclooctadiene through the 1,4-cyclooctadiene intermediate . polymer - attached Cp2ZrCl2 , CpZrCl3 , Cp2HfCl2 , and CpHfCl3 can be used directly , without going through the reduction process , for the low yield epoxidation of cyclohexene . polymer - attached Cp2ZrCl2 wa used in hydrozirconation and carbon monoxide reduction study . thermolysis of zirconocene dicarbonyl at <nUm> ° C in toluene in the presence of an equimolar amount of trimethylphosphite produced dark green crystal of Cp2Zr(CO)[P(OCH3)3] ( 5 ) in about <nUm> % isolated yield . <nUm> wa characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy ( v(CO) <nUm> cm-1 ) and by an x-ray crystal structure analysis . <nUm> crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1 with cell constant a <nUm> , b <nUm> , c <nUm> Å , α <nUm> , β <nUm> , and γ <nUm> ° ; z = <nUm> . characteristic bond distance ( for the two crystallographically independent molecule ) are COZr <nUm> , <nUm> ; CO <nUm> , <nUm> ; PZr <nUm> , <nUm> Å . spectroscopic parameter of <nUm> are compared with those of <nUm> group IV metallocene carbonyl complex described in the literature . dimeric metallocene dihydrides [(e5-t-BuC5H4)2MH(m-H)]2 ( <nUm> ; m = Zr , Hf ) react with elemental chalcogens to give the four - membered metallacycles [(e5-t-BuC5H4)2M(m-E)]2 ( <nUm> , e = Se ; <nUm> , e = S ) . In the case of sulfur , the reaction also give (e5-t-BuC5H4)2MS5 ( 4 ) . both <nUm> and <nUm> are shown to come from subsequent reaction of the primary insertion product (e5-t-BuC5H4)2M(SH)2 . the one - electron reduction of zirconocene and hafnocene dichloride Cp2MCl2 ( m = Zr or Hf ) yield the corresponding anion Cp2MCl2- . there is no cleavage of an MCl bond , in contrast to the result in the case of the analogous titanocene and vanadocene dichloride . the compound (butadiene)zirconocene reacts readily at room temperature with iron carbonyl complex under CC coupling of the conjugated diene ligand with a carbonyl carbon atom . starting from C5FeO5 and (C4H6)ZrCp2 the metallacyclic (p-allylzirconoxy)carbene iron complex is obtained in good yield . from the (butadiene)zirconocene equilibrium mixture ( 12a 14a = <nUm> <nUm> ) the preferred reaction of the (s-trans-e4-diene)metallocene isomer with C5FeO5 or Fe(CO)4PPh3 take place . (s-cis-Butadiene)ZrCp2 ( 14a ) , which is a stronger nucleophile than it isomer ( 12a ) , appears to be inert towards these metal carbonyl under kinetically controlled reaction condition . this suggests a novel mechanism for the m-carbonyl → m-carbene transformation . A new method ha been developed to synthezise group <nUm> metallocene ylides . Ph3PCH2 reacts with in situ generated (e2-ethene)MCp2 ( m = Zr , Hf ) , (e2-aryne)MCp2 ( m = Ti , Zr ) , or with ( e4-conjugated diene)MCp2 ( m = Zr , Hf ) via intramolecular hydrogen transfer to form metallocene ylides Cp2M(R)CHPPh3 . In some case competitive methylene transfer occurs leading to four - membered metallacycles . the metallocene ylides all exhibit a substantial metal to carbon p-interaction , increasing in strength on going from hafnium to titanium a the central metal atom . ylide reactivity is greatly reduced . with a non-enolizable ketone , Cp2Zr(CH2CHCHCH3)CHPPh3 reacts via the reverse of the metallocene ylide forming reaction . with enolizable ketone , zirconocene or hafnocene ylides serve a base and form metal enolates . the resulting enolate ( e ) / ( z ) ratio strongly depends on the group r of the metallocene ylide base Cp2Zr(R)CHPPh3 . (e4-Butadiene)zirconocene reacts with (e-C5H4Cl)Co(CO)2 at ambient temperature to yield the metallacyclic zirconoxycarbene complex Cp2Zr(C4H6)(OC)Co(CO)(C5H4Cl) ( 6 ) . In contrast to the analogous chlorine - free carbene complex <nUm> equilibration with the starting material could not be observed for <nUm> . complex <nUm> crystallizes in space group P21 / c with cell constant a <nUm> , b <nUm> , c <nUm> Å , β <nUm> ° . the solid state structure of <nUm> and <nUm> , a determined by x-ray diffraction , are very similar . this indicates that the electronic influence of the ( C5H4X ) ligand on the CCoO bond of the starting material may be the reason for the observed different equilibrium ratio between carbene complex and the educts Cp2Zr(butadiene) and (e-C5H4X)Co(CO)2 . zirconocene ( n-octyl ) chloride , [(e5-C5H5)2Zr(n-Oct)Cl] , prepared in situ from 1- , 2- , or 3-octene and zirconocene hydrogen chloride , ha been found to react smoothly with <nUm> molar equivalent of stannic chloride to give moderate to high yield of n-octyltin(IV) trichloride at room temperature . four zirconocene system , each containing tertiary phosphine functionality indirectly linked to either or both cyclopentadienyl ring , are described . unlike the phosphinomethylzirconocenes , in which the metal and the phosphine strongly influence each other 's basic chemistry , it ha been found that a variety of transformation may be carried out at either site on the more indirectly linked system without interference from the other . thus reduction and hydrozirconation proceed normally at the Zr center , and quaternization and complexation to a second metal may be achieved at the phosphine . two " early - late " multimetallic system containing Zr and Co have been prepared . reduction and acylation at Co proceed without interference from Zr ; however , attempt to generate hydride at Zr in the bimetallic system were unsuccessful . elementary sulfur and selenium combine ( in boiling heptane ) with [(tBuCp)2-Zr(C6H4R)2] ( cp = e5-C5H4 ; r = CH3O ) to give the corresponding dichalcogenophenylenezirconocene . with tellurium , the reaction proceeds only at lower temperature ( in boiling hexane ) , affording the first ditellurophenylenezirconocene . As no metallacycle wa obtained with the cp ligand or when the metal is Hf , complex of the general type [(RCp)2MSe2C6H4-o] ( m = Ti , Zr , Hf ; r = H , t-Bu , CH3 ) have been synthesized by allowing metallocene dichloride to react with potassium benzenediselenolate , prepared by cleaving [(t-BuCp)2ZrSe2C6H4-o] with t-BuOK . the reaction of zirconocene dichloride with disodium terephthalate in the two - phase system H2O / CCl3H yield the novel cyclic three - nuclear complex tris[di(p-cyclopentadienyl) (m-terephthalato)zirconium(IV) ] ( 5 ) , which can be isolated a the CCl2H2 solvate ( sol : <nUm> <nUm> ) . the three dicarboxylato bridge act a ( <nUm> + <nUm> ) - dentate ligand , such that each Zr atom ha three ligating O atom in addition to it cp ligand and thus ha an 18-electron configuration . the twenty-seven-membered central ring of <nUm> is puckered . the structure of <nUm> ha been solved by an x-ray diffraction study . the complex crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21 / n , with z = <nUm> , and the lattice parameter a <nUm> , b <nUm> , c <nUm> Å , β <nUm> ° . the zirconocene ylide Cp2Zr(Ph)CHPPh3 ( 1a ) reacts with benzyl isonitrile at temperature above <nUm> ° C by insertion into the ZrC(ylide) bond to give the (e2-iminoacyl)zirconocene complex Cp2Zr(Ph)[e2-N(CH2Ph)C(CHPPh3)] ( 2a ) . complex 2a crystallizes in the space group P <nUm> - with a <nUm> , b <nUm> , c <nUm> Å , α <nUm> , β <nUm> , γ <nUm> ° . the x-ray diffraction study , showed 2a the ( e2-iminoacyl ) metallocene stereoisomer to have an " RN - inside " arrangement . the bonding parameter of the Ph3PCHC[Zr]NCH2Ph unit are consistent with 2a being an internally lewis - acid coordinated stabilized ylide . similarly the hafnocene ylide Cp2Hf(C2H5)CHPPh3 ( 1c ) reacts with benzyl isonitrile to give 2c which wa identified by x-ray crystallography . it crystallizes in space group I <nUm> - with a <nUm> , b <nUm> , c <nUm> Å , α <nUm> , β <nUm> , γ <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> . the MC and MN bond of the ( e2-iminoacyl ) metallocene moiety in 2c are slightly shorter than those in 2a . (e4-Butadiene)-zirconocene and -hafnocene each react with two molar equivalent of 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane to give nine - membered metallacycles Cp2MON(R)CH2CH = CHCH2N(R)O ( 8a : r = t-Bu ; m = Zr ; 8b : r = t-Bu , m = Hf ) , which have a trans-carbon-carbon double bond in the ring .

A reaction of zirconocene - vinylsilane complex with ketone afforded 3-trimethylsilyl-1-oxa-2-zirconacyclopentanes with an excellent regioselectivity . carbon-carbon bond formation occurred exclusively at the terminal carbon of vinylsilanes . their corresponding g-silylalcohols were obtained after hydrolysis . the product showed that vinylsilanes reacted with carbonyl compound at the b-carbon to silyl group . it is in sharp contrast to the conventional reaction of vinylsilanes of which the a-carbon normally attacked electrophiles . the reaction of styrene and it derivative with pentan-3-one on zirconium gave a mixture of two regioisomers . substituents of alkene tend to be in a-position to Zr in 1-oxa-2-zirconacyclopentanes . this orientation showed a different aspect of the formation of 1-oxa-2-zirconacyclopentanes from the alkene - alkene coupling reaction on zirconium . the regioselectivity of the reaction with carbonyl compound decreased in this order ; r = alkyl > silyl > aryl . hydrozirconation of various alkenylboronic ester <nUm> with H(Cl)ZrCp2 produce a new class of bidentate lewis acid a crystalline solid or oil , <nUm> , in 81-96 % yield . product <nUm> were characterized by IR , NMR , and in selected case elemental analysis . the reaction of CCl2P2Zr ( cp CH ) with solvent - free LiPH(2,4,6-tBu3C6H2) yield the terminal zirconocene phosphido complex Cp2Zr(Cl){PH(2,4,6-tBu3C6H2)} ( 1 ) ( <nUm> : <nUm> reaction ) or Cp2Zr{PH(2,4,6-t Bu3C6H2)}2 ( 2 ) ( <nUm> : <nUm> reaction ) . <nUm> is more readily obtained from the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with H2P(2,4,6- tBu3C6H2 ) in the presence of Mg . <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized spectroscopically ( NMR , IR , MS ) . an x-ray structure determination of <nUm> show that the PZr bond length ( PZr <nUm> Å , P2Zr <nUm> Å ) are identical . <nUm> and <nUm> exhibit dynamic NMR behaviour ( 1H ) indicating rotation around the PC bond and inversion of the phophido group . two series of group <nUm> bent metallocene complex bearing cholestanol - derived substituents at their cp - ring have been prepared . 5a-Cholestan-3 a-ol wa converted to the 3a-mesylate . nucleophilic substitution with CpNa , followed by deprotonation and treatment with ZrCl4(THF)2 gave bis[e5-(5a-cholestan-3b-yl)cyclopentadienyl]zirconium dichloride 3b-5 . 5a-Cholestan-3-one <nUm> wa converted to the corresponding fulvene , methyl lithium wa added and deprotonation and addition to ZrCl4(THF)2 furnished bis[e5-(3b-methyl- 5a-cholestan-3a-yl)cyclopentadienyl]zirconium dichloride ( 11b ) . treatment of the chiral cp - substituted zirconocene dichloride with a large excess of methyl alumoxane gave homogeneous ziegler catalyst . propene polymerization proceeded with overall stereochemical chain end control to give partly isotactic polypropylene . the zirconocene alkyne complex Cp2Zr(THF)(Me3SiCCSiMe3) ( 1 ) and Cp2Zr(py)(Me3SiC CSiMe3 ) ( 2 ) react with acetone to yield the new zirconadihydrofurane complex Cp2ZrOC(Me2) C(SiMe3)C(SiMe3) ( 3 ) . reaction of <nUm> with tolan give , under substitution of the alkyne moiety , a further dihydrofurane compound Cp2ZrOC(Me2)C(Ph)C(Ph) ( 4 ) . complex <nUm> and <nUm> are characterized by NMR and x-ray structure analysis . they are compared with the known titanocene complex cp2 TiOC(Me2)C(Ph)C(Ph) ( 5 ) to study the influence of the metal m = Ti , Zr and the substituents r = ph , SiMe3 in selected metalladihydrofuranes Cp2MOC(Me2)C ( r ) C ( r ) . although the structure of complex <nUm> and <nUm> are similar , the complex display different reactivity . thus <nUm> is capable of reacting with tolan , CO2 and water at room temperature , while <nUm> is inactive towards these compound under the same condition . 3-Arsolenes R-AsCH2C(Me)C(R')CH2(R = ph , me , tBu , Cl , R' = H , me ) are readily obtained from zirconocene-butadiene complex and RAsCl2 . alkylation with methyl iodide give arsonium salt [R(Me)AsCH2C(Me)C(R')CH2]I ( r = ph , me , tBu , R' = H , me ) , treatment with sulphur give sulphide R(S)AsCH2 C(Me)C(Me) - CH2 ( r = me , tBu ) , while oxidation with br2 or Cl2O2S result in ring cleavage . from chloroarsolene ClAsCH2C(Me)C(Me)CH2 substitution product R-AsCH2C(Me)C(Me)CH2 ( r = I , H , SPh , OMe , NMe2 ) a well a coupling product with AsAs , As2O , and As2S unit were synthesized . In addition , a number of arsolene complex with the metal chromium , molybdenum , tungsten , and ruthenium is described . we have demonstrated a very efficient ( <nUm> step , <nUm> % yield from 1-octen-7-yne and 1,2-diiodobenzene ) and novel synthesis of 1,2-bis(9-bicyclo[4.3.0]-non-1,6-dinyl)benzen . we utilized for the firstime in a bis(cyclopentadiene) synthesis the double pauson - khand cyclization and shapiro - elimination method . the double pauson - khand cyclization is also successful in the preparation of ethylene-bridged bis(cyclopentadienes) . A novel iodine - promoted elimination of allyl methyl ether wa also applied in the preparation of bis(cyclopentadienes) . the solid state structure of 1,2-bis(9-bicyclo[4.3.0]-non-1,6-dienyl)benzenedichlorotitanium ( dl-4a ) wa obtained and it show a very obtuse angle between the cyclopentadienyl substituents . the crstallographic data for dl-4a are a follows : C24Cl2H24Ti , monoclinic , C2 / c . a = <nUm> A ̊ , b = <nUm> A ̊ , c = <nUm> A ̊ , β = <nUm> ° , volume <nUm> A3 , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , rw = <nUm> % , goodness of fit <nUm> . the six - membered ring annulated C <nUm> - bridged ansa - metallocene [(4-cyclopentadienylidene)-4,7,7-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl]zirconium dichloride ( 6a ) wa treated with " butadiene-magnesium " to yield the corresponding ( s-cis-e <nUm> -butadiene)ansa-zirconocene complex a a mixture of two diastereoisomers ( 8a / 8a' ) . their mutual interconversion wa monitored by dynamic <nUm> H NMR spectroscopy at high temperature . the gibbs activation energy of the thermally induced 8a =8a' (butadiene)metalocene ring topomerization is DG inv ≠ ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol <nUm> . this is about <nUm> kcal mol <nUm> higher than observed for the analogous ( σ <nUm> , p-butadiene)metallocene ring inversion process in the parent bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium system . the corresponding ( s-cis-e <nUm> -butadiene)ansa-hafnocene complex ( <nUm> / 9' ) wa prepared analogously . it ( η <nUm> -butadiene)Hf inversion barrier ( DG inv ≠ ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol <nUm> ) is about <nUm> kcal mol <nUm> higher than that of the ( s-cis-e <nUm> -butadiene)HfCp <nUm> reference . the ( s-cis-e <nUm> -butadiene)[7-n-butyl-(4-cyclopentadienylidene)4,7-dimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl]zirconium complex 8b wa characterized by x-ray diffraction . the e-butadiene ligand exhibit only a small CC bond alteration ( <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> Å ) and a relatively small difference of the butadiene C terminal -Zr ( <nUm> and <nUm> Å ) vs. C internal -Zr ( <nUm> and <nUm> Å ) bond length . this point to an increased π complex character of the rigid ansa - metallocene complex compared with the parent ( s-cis-e <nUm> -butadiene)zirconocene complex 2a whose structure wa determined a a reference ( 2a : butadiene C terminal Zr , <nUm> and <nUm> Å , C internal Zr , <nUm> and <nUm> Å ) . A theoretical extended huckel theory analysis ha revealed that the pronounced increase in the butadiene metallocene topomerization barrier on going from the " normal " bent metallocene ( D(1)ZrD(2) , <nUm> ° , where D(1) and D(2) denote the centroid of the cp ring ) to the strained C <nUm> - bridged ansa - metallocene complex <nUm> containing a markedly opened bent metallocene wedge ( 8b : D(1)ZrD(2) , <nUm> ° ) is electronic in origin , probably caused by closing the energy gap between the 2a <nUm> and b <nUm> frontier orbitals . we conclude that the stereoelectronic feature of the bent metallocenes can be controlled by the application of specific steric constraint . reaction of Si(1,3-tBu2-C5H3)Me3 with MCl4 ( m = Ti , Zr ) in toluene or hexane at room temperature affords the new trichloromonociclopentadienyl-type derivative [M(1,3-tBu2-e5-C5H3)Cl3] ( m = Ti ( 2 ) , Zr ( 3 ) ] . treatment of complex <nUm> and <nUm> with appropriate alkylating reagent in hexane give the 1,3-di(tert-butyl)cyclopentadienyl trialkyl titanium and zirconium complex [M(1,3-tBu2-e5-C5H3)R3] [ m = Ti , r = CH3 ( 4 ) , CH2 ph ( 5 ) ; m = Zr , r = CH3 ( 6 ) , CH2 ph ( 7 ) , CH2CMe2Ph(8) ] . interestingly , when <nUm> reacts with <nUm> equivalent of LiCH2CMe2Ph in hexane at room temperature the ring-tert-butyl-metallated complex [ Ti(1-tBu-3-CMe2CH2-e5-C5H3) (CH2CMe2Ph)2 ] ( bd9 ) wa isolated in <nUm> % yield . the cationic mono(1,3-di-(tert-butyl)cyclopentadienyl) dibenzyl zirconium specie [Zr(1,3-tBu2-e5-C5H3)(CH2Ph2]+ , generated in situ by reaction of the tribenzyl complex <nUm> with BC18F15 or [CPh3]+[B(C6F5)4]- reagent , is reported and their dynamic NMR behaviour in CD2Cl2 solution at low temperature is studied . A variety of new silylene-bridged fluorenyl-containing ligand ha been synthesized with good yield via a convenient synthetic route . two dimethylsilylene-bridged (e5-indenyl)(e5-fluorenyl)(1) and (e5-cyclopentadienyl)(e5-fluorenyl) ( 2 ) zirconocene dichloride with C1 and Cs molecular symmetry have also been prepared . upon activation with methyl aluminoxane , the former produced a polypropylene of high molecular weight , but with low activity and isotacticity . the latter catalyzed non-stereospecific propylene polymerization without any syndiotactic tendency , but with <nUm> and <nUm> time greater ethylene and propylene activity respectively than the former catalytic system . the synthesis , crystal structure and propene polymerization behaviour of four bridged zirconocene dichloride is presented . all catalyst are capable of isotactic propene polymerization . methyl substitution at the 2- , 4- and 7-positions of the bridged bis(indenyl)zirconocene dichloride were introduced . the methyl substituent in the 7-position of the idenyl ring induces a significant steric interaction with the bridging group . on comparison of the 2,4,7-methyl substituted catalyst with their unsubstituted counterpart , only the ethylidene bridged catalyst rac-1,2-ethylidene-bis(2,4,7-trimethyl-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 4 ) is forced into the optimum geometry for isotactic propene polymerization . owing to the steric bulk at the bridge catalyst <nUm> is very rigid with respect to the movement of the idenyl ring and the metal centre thus produce highly isotacic polypropene even up to high polymerization temperature . molecular mechanic calculation and temperature - dependent NMR measurement demonstrate that catalyst <nUm> is not able to equilibrate between the λ and δ conformational state a the corresponding rac-1,2-ethylidene-bis(-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 3 ) catalyst doe . In the case of the catalyst isopropyliden((3-tert-butyl)cyclopentadienyl-9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride (6)_the substitution in the 3-position change the symmetry from Cs to C1 . this catalyst produce isotactic polypropene but with a decreased polymerization activity . the previously unknown 1,1-dichloro-2,3,4,5-tetramethyl-1-silacylopenta-2,4-diene ( 3 ) wa prepared in a three - step synthesis starting from zirconocene dichloride , 2-butyne , and n-butyllithium via bis(cyclopentadienyl)-2,3,4,5-tetramethyl-1-zirconacyclopenta-2,4-diene ( 1 ) and 1,4-diiodo-1,2,3,4-tetramethylbuta-1,3-diene ( 2 ) . <nUm> wa characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single - crystal x-ray diffraction . reaction of the new silole <nUm> with <nUm> equivalent of lithium in THF give the corresponding dianion 4. 1H- , 13C- , and 29Si - NMR chemical shift of <nUm> compared with <nUm> indicate some aromatic character for the ionic specie . trapping of <nUm> with Me3SiCl give 1,1-bis(trimethylsilyl)-2,3,4,5-tetramethysilole ( 5 ) in quantitative yield . reaction of either C8H11P or dmpe ( dmpe = C3H8P ) adduct of Cl4Zr with four equivalent of C5H7K lead to the formation of the respective <nUm> or <nUm> electron mono(ligand) adduct of the open zirconocene C10H14Zr . both complex were found to exist in the expected symmetric conformation , a confirmed for the dmpe complex by a single crystal x-ray diffraction study . the enantiomerically pure C2 - symmetrical (DMeBCOCp)2ZrCl2 complex (+)-3 wa synthesized from enantiomerically pure (-)-DMeBCOCp ligand (-)-1 . zirconocene (+)-3 wa recrystallized from toluene to provide single crystal suitable for x-ray diffraction . the unit cell contained two conformationally similar molecule in the monoclinic space group P21 ( # <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> A ̊ , b = <nUm> A ̊ , c = <nUm> A ̊ , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A 3 , z = <nUm> . of the <nUm> unique reflection , <nUm> observed reflection ( 3 or greater ) were refined to give a final r = <nUm> and rw = <nUm> . the cyclopentadienyl substituents are arranged in a roughly C2 - symmetrical orientation and the cyclopentadienyl carbon are close to a synclinal orientation . A study wa made of the polymerization of ethylene involving the use of a series of [e4-4-RC6H4C(NSiMe3)2]2ZrCl2 a precatalysts ( r = H ( 1 ) ; CH3 ( 2 ) ) . the benzamidinate zirconium dichloride complex were prepared from Cl4Zr and the corresponding 4-RC6H4C(NSiMe3)2Li* TMEDA ligand . the structure of complex <nUm> wa determined by a low - temperature x-ray diffraction study . " cationic " ethylene polymerization catalyst were generated from <nUm> and <nUm> with methylalumoxane . the polymerization activity and the molecular weight of the polymer are strongly dependent on the catalyst and cocatalyst concentration . the polymerization activity increase drastically with increase in pressure and temperature and decrease when electron - releasing group are attached to the aromatic ring . insertion of aldehyde into alkyne - zirconocene complex provides configurationally pureallyl alcohol in a one - pot procedure . In the case of unsymmetrical alkyne , the regioselectivity of the insertion process is high for terminal alkyne . with trimethylsilyl-substituted alkyne the regioseectivity is low . the insertion of chiral aldehyde into the symmetrical oct-4-yne-zirconocene complex provides the cram isomer a the major product . on the other hand , reaction of the complex derived from a terminal alkyne with 2-phenylpropanal lead primarily to the anti-Cram product . the result are explained in term of a four - centre transition - state model . the preparation of new zirconocene dichloride complex containing 9-substituted fluorenyl ligand is reported . the complex were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy . the three novel zirconocenophane dichloride [(O(Me2SiC5H4)2)ZrC12] ( 3 ) , [O(Me2SiC5H3-tC4H9)2)ZrC12] ( 4 ) and [{Me2Si(OMe2SiC5H4)2)ZrCl2]n ( 5 ) have been prepared and characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy . according to a successful single - crystal x-ray study , <nUm> crystallizes from n-hexane a a racemic mixture with exclusively 1,3-disubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligand and Cl centre oriented transoid to the O atom . <nUm> : monoclinic ; space group P2 <nUm> c , a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> pm ; β = <nUm> ° ; r = <nUm> ( rw = <nUm> ) . In solution ( room temperature ) , all three complex are fluxional ; moreover the NMR spectrum of <nUm> display the resonance of two isomer ( <nUm> : <nUm> ) . according to a mass spectrometry study of <nUm> , the B2 e-coupled scan of the molecular ion M+ ( m z = <nUm> ) indicates at least four " parent " fragment with <nUm> { slanted equal to or le - than } m z ≤ <nUm> , suggesting here trinuclear or even trinuclear precursor . A series of Cp'(C5H5)ZrCl12 and Cp2'ZrCl12 precatalysts ( cp' = C5Me4H , C4Me4P , C5Me5 ) together with C10Cl12H10Zr ha been investigated in term of steric and electronic variation and their catalytic activity in combination with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) towards the polymerization of ethylene are compared . the change in the steric environment were evaluated on the basis of the structural data available and supplemented by theoretical structural study on the semiempirical ( ZINDO , EHMO ) and density functional ( DF ) level . the x-ray structure of (C5Me4H)2ZrCl2 ( 3 ) and (C4Me4P)(C5H5)ZrCl2 ( 4 ) have been determined ( <nUm> : orthorhombic , cmcm , a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> c = <nUm> A ̊ , z = <nUm> ; <nUm> : monoclinic , P21 / c , a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> A ̊ β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> . 91Zr NMR data for the above series ha been measured and is correlated to change in the HOMO-LUMO gap available from electronic structure calculation . under mostly homogeneous polymerization condition , at very low zirconium concentration the order of the catalytic activity found for ethylene polymerization is C10Cl2H10Zr > (C5Me4H)(C5H5)ZrCl2 > (C5Me5)(C5H5)ZrCl2 > (C4Me4P)(C5H5)ZrCl2 > (C5Me4H)2ZrCl2 > (C5Me5)2ZrCl2 > (C4Me4P)2ZrCl2 , which for the most part is inversely proportional to the steric demand of the ring ligand in the metallocene precatalysts except for the phospholyl system . the lower activity of the phospholyl vs. the tetra- and penta-methylcyclopentadienyl compound might imply an electronic effect such that the electron withdrawing phosphorus substituent decrease the activity , although further study are needed to clarify this situation . emphasis is placed on the control of the polymerization condition and evaluation of the time - activity profile . At higher zirconium concentration an increased precipitation of polyethylene take place during the course of polymerization and result in a transfer to the heterogeneous phase with a diffusion controlled reaction rate thereby invalidating any activity - comparing study . the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with magnesium and tBuC2SiMe3 in tetrahydrofuran yield the first zirconocene complex with an alkyl substituted alkyne without additional phosphine ligand Cp2Zr(THF)(tBuC2SiMe3) <nUm> . that complex is stable at room temperature and wa characterized by it IR and NMR spectrum . the spectroscopical data of <nUm> were compared with those of the well known complex of that type Cp2Zr(THF)(Me3SiC2SiMe3) <nUm> to study the influence of different sterical and electronical influence of the substituents ( tBu and SiMe3 ) upon alkyne complexation . the chemo- and regio-selectivity of complex <nUm> wa studied in a hydrogen transfer reaction and in reaction with carbon dioxide and acetone . the result show mostly a kinetically favored reaction at the Si - substituted C - atom of the complexed alkyne , giving the b-SiMe3-product , which rearranges into the thermodynamically more stable a-SiMe3 - substituted product . In contrast to titanocene in the case of zirconocene complex coupling reaction of RC ≡ CSiMe3 ( r = SiMe3 , tBu ) could be realized . carbonylation of dimethylzirconocene , followed by treatment with zirconocene dihydride , benzyl chloride and then methyllithium , gave the (e2-acetaldehyde)zirconocene dimer ( 9 ) a a mixture of trans- and cis-isomers isolated in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio under kinetic control and in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio under thermodynamic control , respectively . complex trans-9 / cis-9 were treated with carbon monoxide to give the rans-10 / cis-10 monoinsertion product , and with isonitriles RNC ( r = CH2SiMe3 ( a ) , CMe3 ( b ) ) to give the mono- and bis-insertion product trans- and cis-11(a , b ) and <nUm> ( a , b ) , respectively . complex 12a wa characterized by x-ray diffraction . In all case the trans / ci stereochemical information wa predominantly retained in the product , which indicates that dimetallic pathway are favoured in these insertion reaction of the metallatricyclic (e2-aldehyde)metallocene dimer . successive treatment of triallylamine with zirconocene chloride hydride and germanium tetrachloride affords 1-aza-5-germa-5-chlorobicyclo[3.3.3]undecane , which is converted to the 5-organo derivative by the reaction with grignard or lithium reagent . the organo group showed higher reactivity toward stille - type coupling than the corresponding organotributylgermanes . BC18F15 reacts with the (e2-acetaldehyde)zirconocene dimer ( 4 ) by hydride transfer from the methyl group of a C2H4O ligand to boron . one of the metallaoxirane moiety of the dizirconium complex is then opened to give the salt [ (e2-CH3CHO)ZrCp2 · ( CH2 = CHO)ZrCp2]+[HB(C6F5)3]-(6) that wa isolated with an <nUm> % yield . propylene wa polymerized in the presence of the cation bis(O-acetyl-(R)-mandelate) ( 1+(S) ) of (S)-ethylenebis[4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-e5-indenyl]zirconium and ( 1+(R / S ) ) of a mixture of diastereomers . under the same experimental condition the polymer obtained with the latter exhibit abundant non-homosteric methyl 13C NMR pentad a well a 2,1-and 1,3-misinsertion resonance ; these stereo - and regioirregularities are absent in the poly(propylenes) formed by the enantiomeric 1+(S) . the stereoselectivity of catalysis by <nUm> ( r / S ) can be significantly raised either by reducing it concentration , lowering the polymerization temperature , or immobilizing it in a silica support ; the stereoselectivity of catalysis by 1(S) is not similarly affected . these result are consistent with the interchange of polymer chain of opposite b-carbon configuration bound to different chirality metal center of the racemic mixture causing steric inversion . In the case of catalysis by 1(S) , the same process doe not introduce stereoerror because the growing chain are of the same configuration . maximum isotactic specificity of an ansa - zirconocene precursor is obtained either with a pure enantiomer of the precursor or with a racemic mixture of the zirconium complex which is adequately immobilized on a support . four possible structure of C2 - symmetric bis(fluorenyl)zirconium complex are presented . three bis(fluorenyl)zirconocene complex have been prepared and tested for the polymerization of propylene and ethylene . rac / meso-Dichloro[e10-(1,2-ethanediyl)bis (7H-benzo[c]fluoren-7-ylidene)zirconium ( <nUm> / <nUm> * ) seems to be the most active polymerization catalyst for ethylene . the reaction of (e5-C5H5)2Zr{P(SiMe3)2}2 with C4NiO4 yield the heterodinuclear phosphido-bridged complex (e5-C5H5)2Zr{m-P(SiMe3)2}2Ni(CO)2 ( 1 ) . <nUm> wa characterised spectroscopically and by x-ray structure determination . the central four - membered NiP2Zr ring is slightly puckered ( dihedral angle between plane P2Zr / NiP2 = <nUm> ° ) . the Zr-P bond length are equivalent ( Zr-P1 <nUm> , Zr-P2 <nUm> Å ) , a are the Ni-P bond length ( Ni-P1 <nUm> , Ni-P2 <nUm> Å ) . the long Zr ⋯ Ni distance of <nUm> Å indicates the absence of a metal - metal bond . the heterodinuclear phosphido- and arsenido-bridged complex (e5-C5H5)2Zr{m-E(SiMe3)2}2M(CO)n [ e = P ; M(CO)n = C2NiO2 ( 1 ) or C4MoO4 ( 2 ) ; and e = As , M(CO)n = C4CrO4 ( 3 ) ] react rapidly with methylaluminoxane , yielding catalytically active complex which rival the known cationic system for the polymerization of ethylene . the first tin - bridged zirconocenes [ C7H10Sn 2]Zr[N(CH3)2]2 ( 3 ) and Sn{(C5H4)2Zr{N(CH3) 2]2}2 ( 4 ) have been obtained from tetrakis(dimethylamido)zirconium ( 1 ) and the CH-acidic ligand C12H16Sn ( 2a ) and C20H20Sn ( 2b ) , respectivily . the ansa - zirconocene <nUm> is formed in quantitative yield , <nUm> in <nUm> % yield . the bi- and trimetallic complex <nUm> ( SnZr ) and <nUm> ( SnZr2 ) polymerize ethylene more efficiently than the well - known silicon - bridged analogue of <nUm> ( Si instead of Sn ) . chiral ansa - zirconocene complex with a trimethylene link between the Si bridge atom and an a-position of each C5 ring ligand were prepared ; two representative , with i-propyl and t-butyl group a b-substituents , were structurally characterized . the property of these complex with respect to MAO - activated propene polymerization were studied in comparison with those of their Me2Si - bridged analog . the t-butyl-substituted spirosilane complex give a polymer with relatively high content of 3,1-insertions . these increased regioirregularities appear to be associated with decreased coordination gap aperture and increased lateral extension angle of the spirosilane - bridged zirconocene complex ; this notion is supported by a molecular - mechanic analysis of alternative olefin - insertion transition state . one unbridged and three bridged zirconocene complex , each of them bearing a cyclopentadienyl , fluorenyl , a-olefin and a PMe <nUm> ligand have been prepared and characterized by <nUm> H , <nUm> C and <nUm> P NMR spectroscopy . these model compound illustrate the mechanism of olefin coordination and insertion at the active site of syndiospecific homogeneous catalyst for the polymerization of propylene and 1-butene . the 1,2-di-tert-butylcyclopentadienyl anion ( 1 ) ha been used to prepare 1,1',2,2'-tetra-tert-butyltitanocene dichloride ( 5 ) , 1,1',2,2'-tetra-tert-butylzirconocene dichloride ( 6 ) , and 1,1',2,2'-tetra-tert-butyluranocene dichloride ( 7 ) . the bent metallocene structure of 5-7 have been confirmed by x-ray crystallography , and illustrate that the 1,2-di-tert-butylcyclopentadienyl ligand are arranged with all four tert-butyl group in the open part of the wedge between the two canted cyclopentadienyl ring , but that steric interaction between the substituents afford a conformationally dictated C2 symmetry for the molecule . In solution compound <nUm> and <nUm> exhibit NMR spectrum consistent with a facile dynamic process involving exchange between tert-butyl site that are inequivalent in the solid state . the nature of this site exchange is discussed , and comparison are made with related metallocene dichloride of group <nUm> metal . the synthesis of inflate derivative of titanocene and zirconocene from the corresponding dimethyl complex and triflic acid ( HOTf ) is described . comproportionation of Cp2M(OTf)2 with Cp2MX2 give Cp2M(OTf)X ( m = Ti , x = Cl , F , me ; m = Zr , x = Cl , me , BH4 ) . Cp2TiMe(OTf) reacts with ROH ( r = me , Me3Si or Me2tBuSi ) to give Cp2TiOR(OTf) .

ZINDO molecular orbital calculation indicate that the origin of this anomalously low stretching band is donation of electron density into the CO p* orbital directly from an orbital on the adjacent silicon center , i.e. s-p* back - bonding . consistent with this picture , the formally non-bonding Si / 3.C distance in <nUm> ( <nUm> Å ) is much longer than a typical single bond ( ca <nUm> Å ) , but in the range observed for delocalized organic p-ligands bonded to silicon . although the bond between the silicon and carbonyl ligand is not fully formed in the ground state of <nUm> , thermolysis in the presence of PMe3 yield the five - membered metallacycle cyclo-Cp2Zr[OC(PMe3)SiMe2NtBu] ( 3 ) , resulting from CO insertion into the SiZr bond and formation of a cyclic silaacyl , followed by attack of phosphine at the electrophilic acyl carbon . cyclopolymerization of nonconjugated dienes provides a route to a number of stereochemically complex poly(methylene-1,3-cycloalkanes) . the stereochemistry of these polymer derives from both tacticity and ci / trans stereochemistry of the carbocyclic ring . A unique feature of isotactic polymer with a predominance of trans ring is that they contain no mirror element of symmetry and are thus chiral by virtue of their main - chain stereochemistry . the enantioselective cyclopolymerization of 1,5-hexadiene in the presence of optically active precursor such a (-)-(R)-ethylene-bis(tetrahydroindenyl) zirconium (R)-binaphtholate ( [a]435 = <nUm> ° ) and a methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) co-catalyst yield optically active poly(methylene-1,3-cyclopentane) ( PMCP ) with a molar optical rotation [Ph]28405 of + <nUm> ° ( c = <nUm> , CCl3H ) . since the enantioface selectivity of the chiral zirconocene catalyst with propene is known , the absolute stereochemistry of the polymer can be tentatively assigned if an analogous enantioface selectivity with 1,5-hexadiene is assumed . the enantioselective cyclopolymerization of symmetrical dienes requires both a high enantioface selectivity for olefin insertion and a high diastereoselectivity for olefin cyclization in order to obtain a chiral macromolecular architecture . metallocene sulfide [Cp2M(m-S)]2 ( I , m zr4+ ; II , m hf4+ and cp = cyclopentadienyl ) have been synthesized . I and II show charge transfer absorption in the visible region . FT - raman , raman and IR spectrum of these compound are reported for the first time . the MS stretching band have been assigned with the help of a pre-resonance effect . the approximate normal coordinate analysis of the coordination skeleton ( d2h symmetry ) aid the detailed assignment in the low frequency spectral region . force constant of MCp and MS stretching imply that the bond order of HfL is higher than that of ZrL . metallocenes in combination with methylalumoxane a cocatalyst form extremely active catalyst for olefin polymerization and have become a research topic of growing interest in recent year . meanwhile a great number of symmetric and chiral zirconocenes have been synthesized to give totally different structure of isotactic , syndiotactic , stereoblock , or isoblock polymer . the isotactic sequence length of polypropylene is influenced by the nature of the ligand of the metallocenes . it ha become possible to polymerize cyclic olefin like cyclopentene , norbornene , or dimethanooctahydronaphthalene with different chiral zirconocenes without any ring opening reaction . the crystalline polycycloalkenes show extremely high melting point which are between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C . copolymer of cyclo-alkenes with ethene are amorphous and transparent with a glass transition temperature between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C and they can be used a material for optical disc and fiber . the nature and distribution of radioactive specie resulting from ( ng ) neutron - capture reaction in the metal atom of zirconocene dichloride and molybdocene dichloride were investigated . retention value of <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> % were obtained for zr-95 , zr-97 and mo-99 respectively . b-Transformation in 95Zr-zirconocene dichloride and 99Mo-molybdocene dichloride led to approximately <nUm> % of the respective daughter nb-95 and tc-99m being retained at the same molecular form a the parent . A series of (e5-C5H4R)2ZrCl2 ( r = H , me , et , iPr , tBu , SiMe3 , Me2Ph , ) complex have been used in combination with ethylalumoxane to copolymerise ethene with a-olefins ( C5C14 ) under constant condition ( P = 9-12 bar ; T = 50-80 ° C ) . activity decreased substantially for olefin > C8 . variation of the 1-hexene concentration ( (CpEt)2ZrCl2 a catalyst ) revealed rate enhancement at a 1-hexene / ethylene ratio of <nUm> . copolymer incorporation wa low ( < <nUm> % ) a detected by melting point and 13C NMR spectroscopy . A statistically designed approach ( <nUm> factorial ) wa used to investigate the influence of P,T and [1-hexene] on copolymer formation with (CpR)2ZrCl2 ( r = H , tBu ) . complex interaction between the variable wa detected but the result ( r = tBu ) were dominated by [1-hexene] . the microstructure in term of molecular mass distribution ( MMD ) and chemical comonomer distribution ( CCD ) of linear low density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) is greatly influenced by the catalytic system and process condition . furthermore , the 1-olefin insertion in the polymer chain can be distinguished between intramolecular and intermolecular distribution . to investigate the intermolecular CCD and the MMD , four LLDPEs ( ethylene-1-butene copolymer ) from different catalytic system based on Ti Cl2Mg catalyst , a zirconocene complex and a vanadium compound , are studied . the microstructure of the whole polymer and of their fraction are examined by size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , and 13C NMR analysis . further information about CCD is also obtained by DSC analysis on the whole sample by applying a particular thermal treatment , named thermal fractionated crystallization ( TFC ) , based on isothermal crystallization of the polymer from the melt at fixed temperature . the result obtained with the different analytical technique show that the examined polymer have a very distinct microstructure depending on the catalyst type . binuclear zirconocene carton are observed by 1H - NMR in C6D6 solution containing BC18F15 and an excess of a zirconocene dimethyl complex . the CH3 - bridged cation [((C5H5)2ZrCH3)2(m-CH3)]+ , solvent- separated from the anion H3C-B(C6F5)3 / - , is present in equilibrium with C12H16Zr and the mononuclear ion pair [ ( C11H13Zr / +***H3C-B(C6F5)3 / - ] ; in more concentrated solution , a binuclear ion pair [ ((C5H5)2ZrCH3)2(m-CH3)+***H3C- BC18F15 / - ] is the dominant specie . similar equilibrium are observed in C6,D6 solution containing BC18F15 and C18H26Zr , C14H20SiZr or rac-(CH3)2Si(indenyl)2Zr(CH3)2 . complex with sterically more demanding ligand , such a C22H36Zr or rac-(CH3)2Si(2-methyl benz[e]indenyl)2Zr(CH3)2 do not form any binuclear specie under these condition . In the catalyst system rac- (CH3)2Si(indenyl)2Zr(CH3)2 / Bu3NH+B(C6F5)4 / - , activity for the polymerization of propene increase with excess of the dimethyl zirconocene complex . this effect is due in part to a sacrifice of some dimethyl zirconocene for the removal of impurity from the catalyst system and in part to a stabilization of the catalyst in the form of the binuclear cation [((CH3)2Si(indenyl)2ZrCH3)2(m-CH3)]+ . the latter appears to act , in the presence of propene , a a source of the mononuclear cation [(CH3)2Si(indenyl)2ZrCH3(C3H6)]+ , rather than a a polymerization catalyst by itself . upon irradiation of a C2 - symmetric rac - isomer of an ansa - zirconocene dichloride , an interconversion into the C ( s ) - symmetric meso-form is observed until a photostationary state between the two diastereomers is reached . the final rac / meso-proportion and the interconversion rate depend on the structure of the different metallocenes . result of a-olefin polymerization catalyzed by [ Me2Si(2-Me-4,6-(i)Pr2 Ind)2]ZrCl2 rac and meso , respectively , and methylalumoxane ( MAO ) a cocatalyst are reported . In propene polymerization the rac - diastereomer show the higher activity whereas in pentene , hexene , and octene polymerization the meso-isomer is significantly more active . for all polymer a lower molecular weight is found using the meso-diastereomer a catalyst .

A large number of caryophyllene - type sesquiterpenoids have been isolated from nature . many of them show a wide range of biological and pharmacological activity . recently , a highly oxygenated caryophyllene - type sesquiterpenoids , pestalotiopsin A and structurally related natural product such a pestalotiopsin B and C and taedolidol have been isolated from pestalotiopsis sp . these natural product are characterized by their highly distorted bi- to pentacyclic structure , all including a gem-dimethylated cyclobutane ring a one constituent . recently , the first asymmetric total synthesis of both enantiomer of pestalotiopsin A wa completed by the author and coworkers , thereby clarifying the previously unknown absolute stereochemistry of this natural product . these total synthesis were achieved by the following notable synthetic concept : ( 1 ) chiral auxiliary - based symmetric synthesis of the functionalized cyclobutane derivative through the lewis acid - catalyzed [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition between dimethyl ketene diethyl ketal and propiolamide equipped with the oppolzer 's camphorsultam and ( 2 ) an intramolecular Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi cross-coupling mediated by a Cr (II) / catalytic Ni (II) system for high - yielding nine - membered ring formation . In this chapter , the author also summarize their synthetic approach toward pestalotiopsin A and related caryophyllene - type sesquiterpenoids , reported so far by procter and coworkers and paquette and coworkers . the procter group ha utilized the I2Sm - mediated reductive 4-exo-trig cyclization for the efficient construction of the polysubstituted cyclobutane moiety . the paquette group ha demonstrated the effectiveness of the zirconocene - mediated ring contraction strategy for access to the enantiomerically pure multiply functionalized cyclobutane moiety . the highlight of their synthetic endeavor aimed at the total synthesis of pestalotiopsin A are discussed in this chapter . the UV / visible absorption spectrum of rac-Et(Ind)2ZrC12 , rac-Et(Ind)2ZrMeC1 , rac-Et(Ind)2Zr(Me)2 , and the [rac-Et(Ind)2ZrMe-C2H4]+ complex , have been simulated by using the TDDFT technique within the adiabatic approximation and by using several basis set and XC functionals . hybrid XC functionals ( B3LYP , B3P86 and mPW1PW91 ) turn out to reproduce fairly well the essential feature of the experimental spectrum which originate from ligand to metal charge transfer transition . the comparison between the simulated and recorded UV / visible absorption spectrum appears therefore a a promising technique for assigning the structure of reaction intermediate in zirconocene polymerization . P = N-P = S linkage placed in some layer within dendritic architecture allow the grafting of several type of functional group at site and depth specific place in the internal layer of phosphorus containing dendrimers . these functional group are either organic derivative ( allyl , propargyl , isothiocyanate , amine , aldehyde , azide , crown - ether ) or metallic derivative ( gold chloride , anionic zwitterionic zirconocene ) . furthermore , the dendrimeric architecture is flexible enough to allow the growing of new dendrimers inside the internal void of the initial dendrimer . ( C ) <nUm> elsevier science S.A . this paper describes ethylene polymerization using four kind of zirconocene with different substitutionary group in cp ring a catalyst and aluminoxane a cocatalyst . their polymerization activity and me of resultant polyethylene were compared . it wa found basically that in tp = <nUm> ° C and Al / Zr = <nUm> , polymerization activity were of the following order : A2 > B2 > A1 > B1 [ A1 : ( CH2 double bond CH-CH2-CH2-Cp)2ZrCl2 ; B1 : ( CH2 double bond CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-Cp)2ZrCl2 ; A2 : { CH2 double bond C(CH3)-CH2-Cp}2ZrCl2 ; B2 : { CH3(CH3)-C double bond CH-CH2-Cp}2ZrCl2 ] . polymerization activity were affected greatly by polymerization condition . the influence of catalyst concentration on polymerization activity were discussed . the possible effect mechanism of different substitutionary group in cp ring on polymerization activity wa investigated . propylene polymerization and propylene / 1-octene copolymerization were studied using rac-Me2SiInd2ZrCl2(1) / MAO or rac-Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 / ( MAO + TIBA ) a catalyst ( methyl aluminoxane , MAO ; AliBu3 , TIBA ) . the structure distribution of the polymer wa characterized by temperature gradient extraction fractionation or precipitation fractionation , a well a by DSC analysis of the thermal segregated sample . by comparing the structure distribution of polypropylene and propylene-1-octene copolymer synthesized by <nUm> / MAO and <nUm> / ( MAO + TIBA ) , it is found that adding TIBA in the catalyst system increase the blockiness of the polymer chain , especially in the copolymerization system . it is assumed that , when iso-butyl is incorporated in the aluminoxane , ion pair of the active center and the aluminoxane counter ion may exist in different state that show different catalytic behavior , resulting in the formation of polymer with block structure . A novel carrier of ultradispersed diamond black powder ( UDDBP ) wa used to support metallocene catalyst . Al2O3 wa also used a carrier in order to compare with UDDBP . supported catalyst for ethylene polymerization were synthesized by two different reaction method . one way wa direct immobilization of the metallocene on the support , the other wa adsorption of MAO onto the support followed by addition of the metallocene . four supported catalyst Cp2ZrCl2 / UDDBP , Cp2ZrCl2 / Al2O3 , Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO / UDDBP and Cp2ZrCl2 / Al2O3 / MAO were obtained . the content of the zirconium in the supported catalyst wa determined by UV spectroscopy . the activity of the ethylene polymerization catalyzed by supported catalyst wa investigated . the influence of Al / Zr molar ratio and polymerization temperature on the activity wa discussed . the polymerization rate wa also observed . qualitative investigation of the mechanism of photochemical decomposition of diphenylpermethyltitanocene and zirconocene have been made . reductive elimination a well a homolytic cleavage of metal-carbon 0-bonds are the two major pathway for photodecomposition of the diphenylpermethylmetallocenes . when benzene-d6 wa used a the solvent for photolysis of diphenylpermethyltitanocene , biphenyl-d0 and biphenyl-d5 were found in a ratio of <nUm> / <nUm> , indicating that reductive elimination wa the much more favorable process . but in the case of diphenylpermethylzirconocene , biphenyl-d0 and biphenyl-d5 were found in a ratio of <nUm> / <nUm> , indicating that the homolytic photocleavage of the 0-bonds wa predominant . In the presence of carbon monoxide , moderately large amount of the dicarbonylpermethylmetallocenes were found , suggesting that the permethylmetallocenes were the intermediate . the discovery of pentamethylcyclopentadiene and 2,3,4,5-tetramethylfulvene in the recovered solvent indicated further photodecomposition of permethylmetallocene . consequently another intermediate , [(C5Me4CH2)M] , is proposed . an oligomeric material wa found to be the major metal containing product after the photolyses . the reaction of dimethylzirconocene with 2R,3R-diethyltartrate proceeds with evolution of two equivalent of methane and yield the chiral diethyltartratozirconocene dimer <nUm> . the analogous reaction between Cp2Zr(CH3)2 and 2S,3S-diethyltartrate furnishes ent-2 in almost quantitative yield . complex <nUm> contains a dimetallatricyclic framework ( tetraoxadizirconatricyclo[5.3.0.02,6]decane ) in solution a well a in the solid state . complex <nUm> wa characterized by x-ray diffraction . it crystallizes in space group P21 with cell parameter a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> and rw = <nUm> . In solution the tartratozirconocene dimer <nUm> undergoes an intramolecular automerization reaction ( DG ‡ intra ( <nUm> K ) ≈ <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ) which probably proceeds via a ten - membered metallacyclic intermediate or transition state . A cross-over experiment between the enantiomeric complex <nUm> and ent-2 showed the activation barrier for intermolecular exchange of mononuclear dioxazirconacyclopentane unit Cp2ZrOCH(E)CH(E)O ( ECO2C2H5 ) leading to equilibration with the isomeric dinuclear tartratozirconocene complex meso-2 to be at DG ‡ inter ( <nUm> K ) ≈ <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 . complex meso-2 show NMR spectrum compatible with a static ten - membered dimetallamonocyclic ring structure . the reaction of dimethylzirconocene with meso-dimethyltartrate yield the (meso-dimethyltartrato)zirconocene dimer <nUm> ( two isomer , 4a and 4b in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio , both of which posse dynamic dimetallatricyclic structure in solution ( DG ‡ intra ( <nUm> K ) ≈ <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( 4a ) ; DG ‡ intra ( <nUm> K ) ≈ <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( 4b ) ; DG ‡ inter ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( 4a--4b ) . crystallization from methylene chloride give single crystal of the isomeric (meso-dimethyltartrato)zirconocene dimer 5a which contains a monocyclic ten - membered ring structure . complex 5a crystallizes in space group P21 / c with cell parameter a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° ; z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> and rw = <nUm> . the amino-functionalized metallocene (C5H4CH(Me)NMe2)2ZrCl <nUm> , [(CpN)2ZrCl2] wa synthesized by salt metathesis of Cl4Zr and <nUm> equiv. of C5H4CH(Me)NMe2Li . the metallocene wa obtained in good yield a a mixture of rac and meso diastereomers a established by NMR spectroscopy . the addition of <nUm> equiv. of n-BuLi to the metallocene (CpN)2ZrCl2 produced a co-catalyst system which wa active , at a <nUm> mol % loading , in the dehydropolymerization of PhSiH3 to poly(phenylsilane) , P2Si . the P2Si wa obtained a a <nUm> : <nUm> linear - cyclic mixture ( mw = <nUm> , Mn = <nUm> ) a established by GPC analysis ; 29Si{1H} NMR spectroscopy revealed an atactic polymer microstructure . the synthesis and characterization of an edge - bridged half - open zirconocene , Zr(C5H5)(dmch)(PMe3)2 ( dmch = dimethylcyclohexadienyl ) , are described . As expected , the Zr-C bond distance for the dmch ligand are significantly shorter than those for the CH ligand . the compound readily incorporates <nUm> equiv. of alkyne , with loss of the PMe3 ligand , leading to a zirconacyclopentadiene complex , so that the dmch ligand ha remained intact . the highly electrophilic borane BC18F15 reacts with n-octadecanol ( n-C18H37OH ) and n-octadecanethiol ( n-C18H37SH ) to form equilibrium mixture of reactant and the <nUm> : <nUm> adduct (n-C18H37EH)B(C6F5)3 ( e = O , S ) ; equilibrium constant for adduct formation are determined . the adduct are deprotonated by 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene ( proton sponge ) to form the salt [C10H6(NMe2)2H][(n-C 18H37O)B(C6F5)3 ] and [C10H6(NMe2)2H][(n-C 18H37S)B(C6F5)3 ] , respectively , and by Cp2ZrMe2 to give methane and , apparently , the unstable zirconium complex [Cp2ZrMe][(n-C18H37E)B(C6F 5)3 ] . the alcohol , alkoxide , thiol and thiolate system are characterized in solution by 1H , 19F , 13C(1H) and 11B NMR spectroscopy and in the solid state by FAB mass spectrometry , and it is also shown that proton sponge can coordinate in monodentate fashion to BC18F15 . sixteen asymmetric dinuclear ansa zirconocene complex bearing cyclopentadienyl , indenyl or fluorenyl ligand and their ligand precursor have been synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy . after activation with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , the complex behave like dual site catalyst and produce polyethylene with bimodal or broad molecular weight distribution in homogeneous and heterogeneous medium . A boron - bridged amido-cyclopentadienyl ligand wa recently shown to form constrained - geometry titanium - complex that are capable of olefin polymerisation . here , the synthesis of the corresponding amido-indenyl ligand e1-C9H7B(NiPr2)N(H) ph ( C9H7 = indenyl ) ( 2a / 2v ) and it allyl-vinyl isomerisation are discussed . deprotonated 2a reacts with Cl4Zr to give the strongly distorted zirconocene - type complex [ zr{e <nUm> : e1-C9H6B(NiPr 2)NPh}2 ] ( 3 ) in a <nUm> : <nUm> reaction . all compound have been characterised by multinuclear NMR method and structure of both the ligand 2a and the complex <nUm> have been confirmed by x-ray diffraction . the new terminal zirconocene - organophosphanido complex [Cp2Zr(Cl){P(H)Dmp}] ( 1 ) and [Cp2Zr{P(H)Dmp}2] ( 2 ) ( dmp = 2,6-Mes2C6H3 ) bearing the sterically demanding ligand dmp have been prepared and structurally characterized . A flattened pyramidal geometry for the phosphorus atom of <nUm> and a shortened Zr-P bond length of <nUm> Å provide evidence for moderate Zr-P p-bonding . compound <nUm> , however , display both pyramidal and planar phosphorus atom . the corresponding Zr-P bond length of <nUm> and <nUm> Å , in conjunction with the phosphorus geometry , indicate that one phosphanido ligand is engaged in substantial p-bonding to the zirconium center while minimal , if any , of such interaction are present for the other phosphanido ligand . the solid state structure and 31P NMR spectrum for <nUm> and <nUm> are very different than previously reported [Cp2Zr(Cl){P(H)Mes*}] and [Cp2Zr{P(H)Mes*}2] ( mes* = 2,4,6-(t)Bu3C6H2 ) which carry the related sterically demanding group mes* . comparison to other structurally characterized zirconocene(IV) and hafnocene(IV) complex having terminal phosphanido ligand suggest that upon increasing the steric congestion at the phosphorus atom greater π interaction with the metal center are afforded if such steric interaction do not prevent achieving proper alignment of the PR2 group for optimal M-P p-bonding .

A force field model for ansa - zirconocene complex is constructed , which represents each C atom of the C5 - ring ligand a being bonded directly to the metal center , rather than by way of the C5 - ring centroid . this e5- model , which describes coordination geometry by mutual repulsion of the C5 - ring and halide ligand , ha no adjustable equilibrium or force - constant parameter for any of the angle at the Zr center . nevertheless , vibrational frequency and structural parameter are reproduced for a series of simple and Me2Si - bridged zirconocene dihalide complex with an accuracy comparable to that of the more complex centroid model . strong steric distortion , revealed by crystal structure determination in a series of tert-butyl- substituted ansa - zirconocene dibromide and diiodide complex , are likewise reproduced with remarkable accuracy by the e5-force field model . A series of <nUm> metallacyclic zirconocene complex ha been synthesized by the reaction of o-phenyl-substituted zirconocene dichloride complex with two equivalent of n-butyllithium via CH bond - activation reaction on the phenyl ring . after activation with methyl aluminoxane , these metallacycles are up to five time more active ethylene polymerization catalyst than the original metallocene dichloride complex similarly activated . the reaction of o-phenyl-1-bromoalkanes with cyclopentadienyl sodium , indenyl lithium or fluorenyl lithium form o-phenylalkyl-substituted ligand precursor in high yield . the corresponding anion react with zirconium tetrachloride to give o-phenylalkyl-substituted zirconocene dichloride complex . after activation with methylaluminoxane , these complex are highly active catalyst for homogeneous ethylene polymerization . the nature of the o-phenyl substituents determines the polymerization activity of the catalyst to a large extent . the polymerization result of <nUm> new complex are compared . chiral bicyclic phosphanes incorporating a five- and an eight - membered ring were prepared via selective P-N bond cleavage of chiral triquinphosphoranes induced by dimethylzirconocene Cp2ZrMe2 or diphenylzirconocene Cp2ZrPh2 . the three step synthesis of 2-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-indene from cyclohexyl methacrylate is described [ ( a ) PPA cyclization ; ( b ) AlH4Li reduction ; ( c ) ClH dehydration ] . this annelated trisubstituted cyclopentadiene wa bridged selectively to form ethylene- or dimethylsilyl-bridged bis(2-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-inden-1-yl) ligand . metal complex ( m = Cl2Zr , Cl2Ti , ClY , and ClLu ) of the bis(2-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroinden-1-yl)dimethylsilane ligand were formed a meso / dl stereoisomeric mixture in ratio from <nUm> : <nUm> to <nUm> : <nUm> dl : meso .

A novel method for the preparation of heterogeneous metallocene catalyst is described that can be applied for the polymerization of olefin starting with homogeneous metallocene complex . for this purpose zirconocene dichloride complex have been prepared containing alkenyl or alkynyl substituents . these complex can be activated with methyl alumoxane ( MAO ) and then are incorporated a comonomers into the formed polyolefin chain . the homogeneous metallocene catalyst become self - immobilizing under the reaction condition and the further formation of the polyolefin is then catalyzed heterogeneously . bimetallic Zr-Re complex with bridging C5H4PPh2 ligand ( henceforth abbreviated a cp' ) are accessible from the mononuclear zirconocene dichloride Cp'2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) and reactive rhenium complex . the attempted synthesis of a cationic complex from <nUm> and [Re(CO)3(NCMe)3]BF4 resulted in the formation of the zirconium - free compound [ ReCl(CO)3(C10H10(PPh2) <nUm> ) ] ( 2 ) . <nUm> is apparently formed by cleavage of the Cp'-Zr bond followed by intramolecular diels - alder addition . the compound wa fully characterized including an x-ray crystal structure determination of the CDCl3 solvate ( triclinic , space group P1 ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> pm , b = <nUm> pm , c = <nUm> pm , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> × <nUm> pm3 , z = <nUm> ) . <nUm> and the highly reactive ' salt ' [Re(CO)5FBF3] give the mono-bridged ionic complex [Cp'Cl2Zr(m-Cp')Re(CO)5]BF4 ( 3 ) . the doubly cp' - bridged complex [Cp'2Cl2ZrReCl(CO)3] ( 4 ) may be obtained from <nUm> and either [Re(CO)5Cl] or , more cleanly , [Re2(m-Cl)2(CO)6(THF)2] . reaction of <nUm> with a stoichiometric amount of AlH4Li give the bridging hydride complex [Cp'2ClZr(m-H)ReH(CO)3] ( 5 ) . from <nUm> and NaSMe the analogous methyl thiolate complex <nUm> wa obtained in an NMR tube experiment . reduction of <nUm> using sodium amalgam produce the dark blue - green complex [Cp'2ClZr-Re(CO)3] ( 7 ) which contains a direct Zr-Re bond . addition of ClH across this polar metal - metal bond give two isomeric hydride [Cp'2Cl2ZrReH(CO)3] ( 8a , b ) in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio and with fac and mer coordination geometry around rhenium , respectively . zirconocene compound having ether bond at the substituent of cyclopentadienyl ligand , [ e5-C5H4(CH2) nOCH2CH2OCH2CH3 ] 2ZrCl2 ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) and [ e5-C5H4CH2CH 2OCH2CH3]2ZrCl2 , were prepared and tested for ethylene polymerization catalyst with methylaluminoxane a a cocatalyst . the presence of oxygen atom close to the metal center drastically reduced the polymerization activity . it increased a the distance between zirconium and oxygen atom increased and showed a maximum when n wa <nUm> . A series of titanocene and zirconocene dichloride wa synthesized bearing ligand that contain a ( chiral ) ether group linked by an ethylene spacer group to the cyclopentadienyl ring . surprisingly , the chiral zirconocenes (e5-C5H4CH2CH2OR)2ZrCl2 with r = isobornyl and menthyl do not show ziegler - natta activity . this is probably caused by attack of the cocatalyst (MeAlO)n on the side chain , causing immobilization of the catalyst . intramolecular coordination of the side chain is provoked by converting the dichloride to the more lewis-acidic mono and bi triflate complex . the coordination of the ether chain depends on the size of the terminal group in the chain . In the achiral derivative (e5-C5H4CH2CH2OMe)2Zr(O3SCF3)2 there is a rapid equilibrium between specie with one and two intramolecularly - coordinated ether side chain . the monotriflate complex ( e5-C5H4CH2CH2Oisobor nyl)2ZrCl(O3SCF3) decomposes rapidly , because ether coordination result in facile C-O bond cleavage and liberation of camphene . accordingly , the bistriflate ( e5-C5H4CH2CH2Oisobor nyl)2Zr(O3SCF3)2 could not be synthesized . the chiral triflate complex (e5-C5H4CH2CH2OR)2Zr(O3SCF3)2 with r = menthyl and fenchyl are active diels - alder catalyst , although no optical induction wa observed , probably because the chiral ether handle are not sufficiently coordinated during catalysis . A series of zirconocene complex of formula cp <nUm> ZrMe 2-n L n where cp = C <nUm> H - <nUm> , me = methyl , L = pyrazolyl , bis(N,N'-phenylformamidinato) , or substituted aryloxide and n = <nUm> , were synthesized by reaction of cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> and cp <nUm> ZrMe <nUm> with LiL or HL , respectively . the structure of cp <nUm> Zr(2,6-OC <nUm> H <nUm> me <nUm> ) <nUm> , cp <nUm> Zr(2,4,6-OC <nUm> H <nUm> me <nUm> ) <nUm> and cp <nUm> ZrMe{CH(NC <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> } were determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction . the complex demonstrate appreciable activity for ethylene polymerization when used a cocatalysts with methylaluminoxane and dimethylanilinium tetrafluorophenylborate . the synthesis and characterization of three siloxy-substituted zirconocene complex rac- and meso-ethylenebis[1-(tert-butyldimethylsiloxy)indenyl]zirconium dichloride ( 3a,3b ) and rac-ethylenebis[1-(tert-butyldimethylsiloxy)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl]zirconium dichloride ( 4 ) are reported . the molecular structure of 3b and <nUm> have been determined and reveal that 3b crystallizes in a chiral staggered meso-conformation , whereas <nUm> adopts the expected C2 symmetric bent metallocene structure with indenyl-forward conformation of the ligand backbone . In both complex 3b and <nUm> the intramolecular oxygen-chlorine distance ( <nUm> - <nUm> Å ) are close to the sum of their van der waals radius ( <nUm> Å ) . the synthesis and characterization of 1- and 2-triisopropylsiloxy substituted bis(indenyl) zirconocenes is reported . the molecular structure of rac-[ethylenebis(2-(triisopropylsiloxy)-1-indenyl)]zirconium dichloride ( 6 ) and rac-[ethylenebis(2-(triisopropylsiloxy)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)]zirconium dichloride ( 8 ) have been determined and reveal that complex ( 6 ) crystallizes in the indenyl-forward ( π ) conformation while ( 8 ) adopts the indenyl-backward ( Y ) conformation . an ansa - zirconocene complex having a vicinally di-tert-butyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand , me <nUm> Si(C <nUm> H <nUm> )(C <nUm> H <nUm> -3,4-t-Bu <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> ( 1 ) , ha been synthesized and characterized by x-ray diffraction ( orthorhombic , space group : pbca , a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , V = <nUm> Å <nUm> , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , r w = <nUm> ) . complex <nUm> ha a very much twisted structure due to it steric repulsion . In solution , however , the two tert-butyl group are magnetically equivalent even at <nUm> ° C , indicating very fast oscillation of the bridged cyclopentadienyl unit with respect to the metal center . complex <nUm> and nonbridged zirconocene dichloride with tert-butyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand , ( C <nUm> H <nUm> -t-Bu ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( 2 ) , ( C <nUm> H <nUm> -1,2-t-Bu <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( 3 ) and ( C <nUm> H <nUm> -1,3-t-Bu <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( 4 ) , have been employed a methylaluminoxane (MAO)-activated catalyst for polymerization of 1-hexene under high pressure condition ( 100-750 MPa = ca . 1000-7500 atm ) . comparison with some non and methyl-substituted metallocenes are also discussed . the ethylene-bridged pseudo-Cs symmetric ansa - zirconocene complex , (1-fluorenyl-2-cyclopentadienylethane)zirconium dichloride ( 5a ) and (1-fluorenyl-2-tetramethylcyclopentadienylethane)zirconium dichloride ( 5b ) , were synthesized and their molecular structure have been determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction study . the complex 5a is very active toward propylene polymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , affording polypropylene with good syndiotacticity . In comparison with the known syndiotactic polypropylene catalytic system iPr(fluorenyl)(cyclopentadienyl)ZrCl2 / MAO , 5a / MAO system is better in thermal stability , higher in activity and lower in syndiotacticity under the identical polymerization condition . on the other hand , 5b / MAO system show low activity and produce nearly atactic polypropylene with low molecular weight , which could be attributed to the increased electron density and steric bulkiness around the metal center . dehydrogenative coupling of phenylgermane catalyzed by cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> or Cp*CpZrCl <nUm> used in conjunction with n BuLi ( two equivalent ) give partially network polyphenylgermanes of high molecular weight ( m w = <nUm> - <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> ) in moderate yield . resulting polyphenylgermanes are soluble in common solvent and a typical sample display λ max at <nUm> nm in UV absorption and show T d5 of <nUm> ° C in the thermogravimetric analysis . the implication of titanocene and zirconocene complex in phosphinine chemistry is reviewed . two approach to polyfunctional phosphinines using dimethyltitanocene a starting precursor have been developed so far . the first one involves the thermal rearrangement of 1-alkynyl-dihydrophosphetes . the second relies on the reactivity towards alkyne of 1,3,2-diazaphosphinines which are obtained by a metal transfer reaction from the corresponding diazatitanacycle . (2-Phosphininyl)-halogenozirconocene complex , prepared by insertion of zirconocene into the carbon - halogen bond of 2-halogenophosphinines , have found interesting application in the synthesis of a-functionalized compound and 2,2'-biphosphinines upon reaction with electrophiles and nickel(0) complex , respectively . another important development of their chemistry is provided by the synthesis of monomeric and dimeric phosphabenzyne-zirconocene complex . preliminary investigation have shown that their reactivity closely mimic that of their carbon counterpart . various molecule such a polar alkyne , aldehyde , ketone , nitrile , phosphine sulfide , insert into the carbon-zirconium bond of these complex to give a wide range of annelated metallacycles which can be subsequently transformed into functional phosphinines upon acidic hydrolysis . the dipropargylic derivative of Si , Ge , P , 1a-c , react with the zirconocene entity ' Cp2Zr ' and give the intermediate bicyclocomplexes 2a-c characterized by 1H and 31P - NMR . the electrophilic addition of H+ , br2 lead to the corresponding exo dienic metallacyclopentanes <nUm> . the cyclozirconation reaction with hetero-diallylic compound 5a-d give the metallacyclopentanes 7-15 , after reaction with different electrophiles such a H+ , Cl3P , PhPCl2 , Ph2PCl or Ph2PCl(BH3) , br2 . the cyclozirconation reaction of diynes is stereoselective and lead to the E,E - exocyclic dienes whereas the selectivity of cyclozirconation of dienes depends on the substituents on the heteroatom . chiral silicon bridged yttrio- and lanthanidocene chloride [ MeRSi(C <nUm> H <nUm> )(C <nUm> me <nUm> )LnCl ] <nUm> ( r = et ( a ) , ph ( b ) ; ln = Y ( 4a , b ) , La ( 5a , b ) , Sm ( 6a , b ) , Lu ( 7a , b ) ) and zirconocene dichloride [ MeRSi(C <nUm> H <nUm> )(C <nUm> me <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> ] ( r = et ( 8a ) , ph ( 8b ) ) were synthesized . compound 4-7 react with sodium acetate yielding the corresponding monomeric acetate [ MeRSi(C <nUm> H <nUm> )(C <nUm> me <nUm> )LnO <nUm> CMe ] ( r = et ( a ) , ph ( b ) ; ln = Y ( 9a , b ) , La ( 10a , b ) , Sm ( 11a , b ) , Lu ( 12a , b ) ) . all compound were characterized by elemental analysis , <nUm> H and <nUm> C{ <nUm> H } - NMR spectroscopy , and by mass spectrometry . single crystal x-ray structure determination show a dimer for 6a and a monomer for 8a . the zirconocenes 8a , b are active catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene and propylene in the presence of methylalumoxane ( MAO ) . the palladium - catalyzed coupling of 1,2-diiodobenzene with indenylzinc complex obtained from indene , 4-methylindene , 4,7-dimethylindene and hydrindancene gave 1,2-bis(1-indenyl)benzenes in 29-45 % yield . new phenyl-bridged ansa - bis(indenyl)titanium and -zirconium dichloride were obtained from these ligand in good yield either by addition of Cl3Ti or Cl4Zr to their lithium salt ( 61-92 % yield ) or by addition of Zr(NMe2)4 to the neutral ligand ( 59-67 % ) . In each case the zirconium tetraamide metalation gave very high dl-selectivity . the n-BuLi / Cl4Zr metalation of the phenyl-bridged unsubstituted indene gave a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio of dl- to meso- while placing substituents at the 4,7- and 5,6-positions led to <nUm> : <nUm> selectivity in favor of the dl-isomer . the n-BuLi / Cl3Ti metalation gave between <nUm> : <nUm> and <nUm> : <nUm> selectivity . the solid state structure of [1,2-bis(1-indenyl)benzene]dichlorozirconium ( dl-6a ) wa obtained by x-ray analysis . methylzirconocene cation [Cp2ZrCH3+] ( 2 ) add readily to (butadiene)zirconocene to yield the dimetallic cationic complex [ (Cp2Zr)(m-CH3)(m-butadiene)(ZrCp2) + ] ( 4 ) ( both cation with CH3B(C6F5)3- ( a ) or B(C6F5)4- ( b ) counteranion ) . the spectroscopic analysis indicates the presence of a C2 - symmetrical bridging mode of the transoid m-e2:e2 - conjugated diene ligand . treatment of 4a with Cp2Zr(CH3)Cl result in the formation of the m-chloro-bridged system [ (Cp2Zr)2(m-Cl)(m-C4H6) + ] ( 4d ) , that yield [ (Cp2Zr)2(m-CC-CH3)(m-C4H 6)+ ] ( 4e ) upon treatment with propynyl lithium . C2 - symmetric rac-ethylene-1,2-bis(e5-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)-zirconium dichloride (EBTHI)ZrCl2 ( rac-1 ) reacts with the lithium amide of 2,6-dimethylaniline , aniline and 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoroaniline to yield the corresponding rac-ethylene-1,2-bis(e5-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)-zirconium bis(monoarylamido) complex (EBTHI)Zr(NHR)2 ( rac-3a-c ) . these new bisamides represent potential chiral version of the known Cp2Zr(NHR)2 derivative which are active hydroamination catalyst . C10F2H10Ti and C10F2H10Zr were found to be rapidly converted into catalytically - active specie for the dehydrocoupling of silanes upon treatment with PhSiH3 or H2MeSiSiMeH2 . two kind of fluorenyl containing zirconocene catalyst , supported on polymethylsiloxane micro gel and on silica , were prepared and applied for ethylene polymerization using methylaluminoxane a cocatalyst . the observed activity were comparable with those of the corresponding silica supported catalyst . the average molecular weight of the obtained polymer differ from those of the corresponding homogeneous catalyst a from those of the silica supported system . In order to further our study of the bis(2-methylbenz[e]indenyl)zirconium dichloride catalyst system , we have synthesized the analogous tetrahydro-2-methylbenz[e]indene ligand ( 4 ) . In the process of synthesizing <nUm> , we have found that the structural isomer tetrahydro-2-methylbenz[f]indene ( 5 ) is also formed . this ha been confirmed by the synthesis of a series of dimethyl ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) , methyl-phenyl ( 8 ) , and titanium trichloride derivative ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) of the parent indene <nUm> and <nUm> . the new ligand system <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were converted to the analogous unbridged zirconocene dichloride complex <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> . the precursor were then activated with either methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( trityl ) and used a catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene and propylene . all zirconocene complex were highly active for the polymerization of ethylene , and in some case produced crystalline polypropylene at lower polymerization temperature . the polymethylene bridged dinuclear zirconocenes [ (CH2)n (C5H4)2][(C9H7)ZrCl 2]2 ( n = <nUm> ( 10 ) , <nUm> ( 11 ) , <nUm> ( 12 ) , <nUm> ( 13 ) ) have been synthesised by treating not only the respective disodium salt of the ligand with two equivalent of C9Cl3H7Zr in THF , but also the distannylated derivative of the ligand with two equivalent of C9Cl3H7Zr in toluene . all complex are characterised by 1H- and 13C - NMR and mass spectrometry and elemental analysis . it turned out that the value of dd = [dd-dp] , the chemical shift difference between the distal ( dd ) and proximal ( dp ) proton , for the produced dinuclear compound ( <nUm> for <nUm> and <nUm> , and <nUm> for <nUm> and <nUm> ) were smaller than the dd value of the known polysiloxane bridged dinuclear compound . the chemical shift of the bridgehead carbon in these complex are about <nUm> ppm shifted downfield with respect to the other two resonance at cyclopentadienyl ring ( <nUm> and <nUm> ppm , respectively ) . In order to investigate the catalytic property of the dinuclear complex and mononuclear metallocenes , ethylene polymerisation ha been conducted in the presence of MMAO . the most important feature is that the polymethylene bridged dinuclear metallocenes represent enormously improved activity compared with the activity from the corresponding mononuclear metallocene a well a the polysiloxane bridged dinuclear zirconocenes . In addition , the influence of both the nature and length of the bridging ligand upon the reactivity of the dinuclear metallocenes ha also been observed . treatment of a variety of bis(alkynyl)metallocenes Cp2M(-C ≡ C-R)2 ( m = Ti , Zr , Hf ; r = CH3 , n-C3H7 , n-C4H10 , cyclo-C6H11 ) with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane yield the metallocene(m,-RC4R)borate betaine <nUm> . these seem to be in an endothermic equilibrium with their methylenecyclopropene derived isomer - by mean of an intramolecular alkyne insertion reaction - which are very effectively trapped by the reaction with tert-butylisocyanide to yield the complex <nUm> that exhibit a methylenecyclopropene derived s-ligand framework . the zirconocene compound 6a ( r = CH3 ) , 6c ( r = n-C3H7 ) , 6d ( r = n-C4H9 ) , and 6e ( r = cyclo-C6H11 ) were characterized by x-ray crystal structure analysis . the hydrolysis of 6a , 6c and 6d gave the respective metal free system <nUm> that exhibit a pronounced cyclopropenylium-borate-betaine character . the title complex Me4Si2(1-C5H3-3-tBu) 2MCl2 ( m = Ti , <nUm> ; m = Zr , <nUm> ) have been prepared by reaction of Li2Me4Si2(C5H3-3- tBu)2 with MC14*2THF in refluxing THF . rac / meso ratio of about <nUm> / <nUm> wa obtained for the titanocene complex <nUm> . but for the zirconocene <nUm> , only meso isomer wa obtained . the crystal structure of meso-1 and meso-2 were determined . their catalytic property for ethylene polymerization have also been studied with MAO a a cocatalyst . reaction of hydroxyl , ether and carbonyl functionalized alkene with methylaluminoxane prepared in toluene-d8 ( MAO ) and zirconocenedichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) were investigated by 1H- and 13C - NMR spectroscopy at <nUm> ° C . the <nUm> alkene studied bear a terminal C = C bond separated by 7-9 ( -CH2- ) unit from the heteroatom moiety . intramolecular connectivity in mono ( alkene ) , bi ( alkene and MAO ) and tri ( alkene , MAO and Cp2ZrCl2 ) component mixture were determined by 2D HSQC , HMBC , ROESY and NOESY NMR technique . the five studied alkenols formed aluminium alkoxides with MAO even in the case of a substantial steric hindrance around the OH group . zirconocene enhanced the formation of aluminium alkoxides . decomposition to free alkenol wa observed only for the straight chain alkenol ( 10-undecen-1-ol ) . the OTMS derivative formed dimer of the type CH2 = CR1R2 along with methyl derivative , CH2 = C(Me) ( r ) and (Me)CH = CH ( r ) , in the presence of MAO and Cp2ZrCl2 . 10-Undecenyl methyl ether and methyl decenoate remained mainly a a free comonomer in the presence of MAO or MAO / Cp2ZrCl2 , though a transient coordination of the former to MAO wa deduced . unsaturated specie Me2C = CH-Al-X and CH2 = C4H7 = C(t-Bu)O-Al-X ( x = MAO oligomer ) were formed in the reaction of t-butyl undecenoate or 2,2-dimethyl-11-dodecen-3-one with MAO or MAO / Cp2ZrCl2 . interaction of the CH2 = CH part of the functionalized alkene with zirconocene wa not observed . A possible coordination of the C = C bond to MAO wa observed only for the sec alkenols . redox property of the substituted zirconocene dichloride : (C5H5-nMen)2 Cl2Zr ( n = 0-5 ) , [C5H5-n(SiMe3)n] 2ZrCl2 ( n = 0-3 ) , [C5Me4(SiMe3)](C5HMe 4)ZrCl2 and two ansa - analogue Me2Si(C5H4)2ZrCl2 and Me2Si[C5H2(SiMe3)2] 2ZrCl2 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry on a mercury electrode in tetrahydrofuran . In the (C5H5-nMen)2ZrCl2 ( n = 0-4 ) compound , standard electrode potential ( e ° ) of the one - electron uptake shift to more negative value by <nUm> V per one methyl group . A deviation from this linear dependence to a le negative e ° is observed for (C5Me5)2ZrCl2 . this effect is attributed to the steric hindrance between rotating C5Me5 ligand which tends to decrease the angle between the cyclopentadienyl ring plane ( φ ) and consequently , the energy difference between MO frontier orbitals . In the trimethylsilylated compound , the net effect of SiMe3 is negligible , giving virtually the same value of e ° for n = 0-3 . In m-SiMe2 - bridged ansa - compound the difference in e ° of <nUm> mV corresponds to the negative shift of <nUm> mV per one SiMe3 group . owing to the rigid angle φ , this shift can be tentatively accounted for the electronic effect of the SiMe3 group . In the non-ansa - compound , the negative shift due to the electronic effect of SiMe3 group is assumed to be roughly compensated by a positive shift resulting from a sterically controlled diminution of φ . A series of complex Si2Me4L2ZrCl2 ( L = ind ( 1b ) , 2-Me-Ind ( 2b ) , 3-SiMe3-Ind ( 3b ) and Ind-H4 ( 4 ) ) wa prepared . the synthesis of 1b , 3b and <nUm> gave predominantly the meso-isomers , whereas a <nUm> : <nUm> meso : rac mixture wa obtained for 2b . x-ray analysis of meso-3b revealed large steric hindrance on the metal center ( cp ° -Zr-Cp ° is <nUm> ° ) . the <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of meso-2b and rac-2b ( activated with MAO ) produced a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of elastic atactic and isotactic polypropylene with low activity . recent labeling experiment have detected stereoerrors in the isotactic polymerization of propene with zirconocenium catalyst , which are characterized by a deuterium transfer from the polymer chain to a methyl group . using Cp2Zr-iso-butyl+ a a model system , two alternative mechanism leading to the observed product are investigated using fully nonlocal level of density functional theory ( DFT ) . the direct hydrogen transfer starting from a g-agostic intermediate requires an overall activation relative to the b-agostic resting state in excess of <nUm> kJ mol-1 and can be excluded . the sequential mechanism involves a ( i ) b-elimination to yield an initial iso-butene p-complex ; ( ii ) a subsequent internal rotation of this p-complex ; and ( iii ) reinsertion of the olefin into the Zr-H bond via two consecutive formation of b-agostic interaction , with maximum relative energy along this path between <nUm> and <nUm> kJ mol-1 ( depending on functional and basis set employed ) . the subsequent step are the reverse of the first three step and can lead to an inverted iso-butyl complex with migrated deuterium . although certain barrier height are somewhat sensitive to the density functional employed ( BP86 vs. B3LYP ) , the sequential mechanism is much more favorable energetically . loss of olefin from the intermediate p-complex is endothermic by 104-114 kJ mol-1 and should therefore not occur . reaction of phenyl magnesium bromide with the a,b-unsaturated ketone 3-methyl-2,3,4,5,6,7-hexahydroind-8(9)-en-1-one , followed by an aqueous work-up , generates the pro-chiral tetra-substituted cyclopentadiene , 1-phenyl-3-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindene , cp ‡ H , a precursor to the e5-cyclopentadienyl ligand in ( cp ‡ )2Fe and [ ( cp ‡ )Fe(CO)]2(m-CO)2 . both complex were generated a mixture of rac - ( RR and SS)- and meso-(RS) - isomer , and in either case pure meso-isomer wa isolated by crystallisation and characterised by single crystal x-ray structure , both molecule having crystallographic ci symmetry . reduction with Na / Hg cleaves meso-(RS)-[(Cp ‡ )Fe(CO)]2(m-CO)2 and the resulting mixture of (R)- and (S)-[(Cp ‡ )Fe(CO)2]- anion reacts with MeI to give racemic ( cp ‡ )Fe(CO)2Me , which wa characterised by the x-ray crystal structure . the cp ‡ ligand is more electron donating than ( e-C5H5 ) a revealed by the reduction potential of the ( cp ‡ )2Fe+ / ( cp ‡ ) 2Fe couple , e ° = <nUm> V ( vs. Ag AgCl ) . reaction of LiCp ‡ with Cl4Zr yield the zirconocene dichloride [ Zr(Cp ‡ )2Cl2 ] a mixture of rac- and meso-isomers , from which pure rac - isomer is obtained a a mixture of RR and SS crystal by recrystallisation . the reaction of rac - [ Zr(Cp ‡ )2Cl2 ] with LiMe give rac - [ Zr(Cp ‡ )2Me2 ] . the structure of RR - [ Zr(Cp ‡ )2Cl2 ] and rac - [ Zr(Cp ‡ )2Me2 ] have been determined by x-ray diffraction . the structural study reveal the influence of the bulky substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand on the metal-Cp ‡ distance and other metric parameter . complex generated by treating chloro(aryloxy)bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium [ <nUm> ; aryloxy = 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxy ( 3a ) , 2,6-diisopropylphenoxy ( 3b ) , phenoxy ( 3c ) , 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenoxy ( 3d ) , and 2,6-dimethoxyphenoxy ( 3e ) ] with one equivalent of n-BuLi catalyze dehydrocoupling polymerization of arylsilanes <nUm> [ aryl = phenyl ( 1a ) , p-methoxyphenyl ( 1b ) , p-dimethylaminophenyl ( 1c ) , p-methylthiophenyl ( 1d ) ] at room temperature to afford corresponding polysilanes . their catalytic performance wa compared with the conventional system generated from dichlorobis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium ( 4 ) and two equivalent of n-BuLi . the reaction of 1a using 3a / n-BuLi , 3b / n-BuLi or 3c / n-BuLi gave high-molecular-weight polysilanes ( mw = <nUm> × <nUm> and Mn = <nUm> × <nUm> with 3a ; mw = <nUm> × <nUm> and Mn = <nUm> × <nUm> with 3b ; mw = <nUm> × <nUm> and Mn = <nUm> × <nUm> with 3c ) . formation of the polysilane wa fast in comparison with <nUm> , in particular when the catalyst wa ligated by a sterically demanding ( 3a ) or electron - withdrawing ( 3d ) aryloxy group . the time course of the gel permeation chromatography profile suggested that complex 3a showed faster chain growth than 3d , 3e and <nUm> . the extent of the formation of undesired cyclics wa relatively small ( < <nUm> % ) in the sterically demanding 3a / n-BuLi- or 3b / n-BuLi - catalyzed reaction . the P-H functionalised phosphinoalcohol 1-PH(Tipp)-2-OH-cyclo-C6H10 ( tipp = 2,4,6-Pri3C6H2 ) reacts with [Cp2ZrMe2] with elimination of methane to give exclusively the mono-substituted product [Cp2Zr(Me)(cyclo-1-O-2-PH(Tipp)-C6H10)] ( 1 ) , even at elevated temperature . <nUm> reacts with [Mo(CO)5(NMe3)] to give the heterodinuclear complex [ Cp2Zr(Me)(cyclo-1-O-2-PH(Tipp){Mo(CO)5}-C 6H10 ) ] ( 2 ) . the borane adduct [ Cp2Zr(BH4)(cyclo-1-O-2-PH(Mes)(BH3)-C 6H10 ) ] ( <nUm> , me = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2 ) wa obtained from [Cp2Zr(BH4)2] and 1-PH(Mes)-2-OH-cyclo-C6H10 in boiling hexane . 1-3 were characterised spectroscopically ( 1H , 13C , 31P , 11B ( for <nUm> ) , MS , and IR ) . A crystal structure determination of the RC,RC,RP / SC,SC,S P isomer of <nUm> wa obtained . the complex 1-3 were studied in the catalytic polymerisation of ethylene and propylene by activating them with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) a cocatalyst . the unsymmetrical substituted zirconacyclopentadienes obtained by selective intramolecular cross-coupling of two different alkyne on zirconocene are used to prepare new unsymmetrical C - substituted phosphole compound . the x-ray structure of a phosphole and it related sulfide are presented . the oligomerization of ethylene catalyzed by Cp2ZrL2 ( L = Cl , me , OC6H4-Me-p ) with ethylaluminoxane or Et3Al a cocatalyst ( Al / Zr = <nUm> , <nUm> ° C , C2H4P = <nUm> MPa ) afforded not only common chain oligomers but also a cyclic oligomer , methylenecyclopentane . the selectivity of methylenecyclopentane reached <nUm> % under optimal condition . the addition of C5H5N to the catalytic system of Cp2ZrCl2 / Et3Al wa capable of further improving the selectivity of methylenecyclopentane to <nUm> % . the homogeneous homopolymerization of propene wa conducted with the two catalyst precursor Me2Si(Ind)2ZrBz2 ( 1 ) and Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2ZrBz2 ( 2 ) and triphenylmethyltetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate [C(CH3)3][B(C6F5)4] ( 3 ) a cocatalyst . after synthesizing the dibenzyl compound from their dichloride derivative the catalyst system ( 1 ) / ( 3 ) wa optimized in respect to the catalyst / cocatalyst ratio and the amount of tri(isobutyl) aluminum ( TIBA ) . the polymerization behavior of the catalyst system ( 2 ) / ( 3 ) is investigated using a central composite experimental design . In this design the dependence of the polymer property on temperature , catalyst and monomer concentration are modeled . the dibenzyl compound ( 2 ) show extremely high catalytic activity of <nUm> <nUm> kg PP / molZr h molp . the polymer produced with this catalyst exhibit very high melting point and molecular weight . four supported metallocenes prepared by the sol - gel method were tested by ethylene homopolymerization and in ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization . the effect of A1 / Zr ratio , polymerization temperature and cocatalysts were evaluated . catalyst A2 , produced by TEA and MAO treatment showed the highest activity ( <nUm> × <nUm> kg PE / mol Zr h-1 ) among the tested system at A1 / Zr = <nUm> . A2 showed thermal stability on polymerization performed at a temperature a high a <nUm> ° C . all the system exhibited activity in the presence of common alkylaluminum ( TMA , TEA , TIBA ) . comonomer effect wa observed in the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene , where the comonomer incorporation is about <nUm> mol % . SAXS measurement of the employed xerogel suggested a weakly branched polymeric texture . metal content in the resulting polymer showed extremely low level of Zr . positron lifetime measurement are reported for linear poly(a-olefin)s from polypropylene to poly-1-eicosene polymerised using zirconocene catalyst . for comparison a low density polyethylene wa also studied . four lifetime are resolved , the longest of them ( t4 ) is attributed to o-Ps annihilation from free - volume hole in the amorphous phase and is used to estimate the mean volume of these hole . it is observed that the hole size increase with increasing separation between the measuring temperature ( T = <nUm> K ) and the glass transition temperature tg , estimated with differential scanning calorimetry . among the poly(a-olefin)s the average hole volume is the largest in poly-1-dodecene ( <nUm> nm3 , tg = <nUm> K ) and the lowest in polypropylene ( <nUm> nm3 , tg = <nUm> K ) . A method for estimation of the glass transition temperature tg from the experimental hold volume is proposed . from comparison of amorphous and crystalline density the fractional free volume wa calculated . from this the number of hole wa estimated to be <nUm> - <nUm> nm-3 . the effect of exposure of the polymer to positron radiation from the source on the o-Ps annihilation parameter wa also studied . while lower poly(a-olefin)s show a more or le pronounced exponential decrease of the o-Ps intensity I4 a a function of time , a slight increase is observed in higher poly(a-olefin)s . possible reason for this behaviour are discussed . copolymerization of propylene and cyclopentene ( CPE ) wa carried out using a a catalyst isospecific rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) , rac-dimethylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 2 ) , rac-dimethylsilylenebis(2-methylindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 3 ) , or syndiospecific diphenylmethylene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 4 ) with methylaluminoxane a a cocatalyst . isospecific zirconocene catalyst 1-3 produced copolymer having narrow molecular weight distribution , while syndiospecific catalyst <nUm> effected propylene homopolymerization . microstructures of the copolymer were studied by 13C NMR and distortionless enhancement of polarization transfer ( DEPT ) spectroscopy . CPE wa found to be incorporated in the copolymer preferentially via 1,2-insertion mechanism in the copolymerization with the catalyst <nUm> . the catalyst <nUm> and <nUm> gave copolymer containing CPE unit formed by either 1,2-insertion or 1,3-insertion mechanism . the proportion of 1,3-insertion unit increased with increasing CPE content in the copolymer . the isomerization reaction from 1,2-insertion to 1,3-insertion CPE unit wa discussed on the basis of kinetic parameter . the effect of Al content on MAO - modified silica wa evaluated on catalyst activity , on polymer property and on residual metal content in the resulting polyethylene . MAO - modified silica were prepared by impregnating MAO toluene solution in concentration range between <nUm> and <nUm> wt % Al / O2Si . commercial MAO - modified silica ( witco ) containing <nUm> wt % Al / O2Si wa used for comparative reason . the resulting modified - silica were employed a support for grafting (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 . using external MAO a cocatalyst ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) no difference in catalyst activity wa observed . nevertheless , for Al / Zr = <nUm> , catalyst activity were shown to be higher for supported zirconocene system containing <nUm> - <nUm> wt % Al / O2Si range . according to DSC analysis , one Tm peak wa detected for polymer obtained with catalyst prepared with <nUm> wt % Al / O2Si ( <nUm> ° C ) , but two Tm peak were observed for polymer obtained with catalyst prepared with <nUm> wt % Al / O2Si ( <nUm> and <nUm> ° C ) and <nUm> wt % Al / O2Si ( <nUm> and <nUm> ° C ) . A computational study of the ethylene-styrene copolymerization with rac-ethylenebis(tetrahydroindenyl)MCl2 [ m = Ti , Zr ] system using DFT method is presented . the complexation , coordination and insertion energy for ethylene and styrene monomer a well a for the styrene-ethylene copolymerization step into the catalytic active site model [Et2(IndH4)2]MCH3 + [ m = Ti , Zr ] were calculated . the goal of this study is to examine the influence of the metal atom [ Ti , Zr ] on the copolymerization activity . it could be concluded that zirconocene catalyst is much more active than the titanocene based catalyst . this could be explained by the higher steric congestion around the Ti a compared to the Zr complex . furthermore , it wa found that the primary styrene insertion give rise to complex in which the active site are blocked by the phenyl ring in both metal atom , so that only the secondary insertion of the styrene is possible . these fact might help to clarify the already published experimental result . copolymer of styrene and a styrene derivative having a Cs symmetrical ligand moiety were synthesized and used a the carrier for the synthesis of supported - type zirconocene catalyst . propene polymerization wa conducted using the resulting catalyst together with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , which gave syndiotactic polypropene . the productivity of the polymer - supported catalyst ( <nUm> kg PP ( mol zr)-1 for <nUm> h ) wa , however , very low compared to that of the corresponding homogeneous catalyst ( <nUm> kg PP ( mol zr)-1 for <nUm> min ) . an isospecific heterogeneous zirconocene catalyst wa prepared by supporting rac-Cl2SiInd2ZrCl2 on Cl2Mg using an impregnation method . polymerization of propene wa conducted over this combined with methylalumoxane a co-catalyst . it wa found that the catalyst displayed a fairly high activity to give highly isotactic polypropene at <nUm> ° C . with an increase in the polymerization temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C , the activity increased monotonically accompanied by a decrease in isospecificity . stereospecific polymerization of propylene wa carried out with rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) ( 1 ) , rac-dimethylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconiurn dichloride ( rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) ( 2 ) and isopropylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( i-Pr(Cp)(Flu)ZrCl2 ) ( 3 ) combined with trialkyl-aluminum ( AIR3 : r = C2H5 , i-C4H9 ) / triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( Ph3CB(C6F5)4 ) ( 4 ) . In isospecific polymerization with <nUm> and <nUm> , the molecular weight of polypropylene decreased with increase in the molar ratio of AlEt3 ( et = C2H5 ) / Zr , whereas , an effect of AliBu3 ( iBu = i-C4H9 ) concentration on molecular weight wa not observed . the microstructures of resulting polypropylene were studied by 13C n.m.r . and an increase in the molar ratio of ethyl end group ( derived from chain transfer to AlEt3 ) to n-propyl end group ( derived from b-hydrogen transfer ) wa observed with increase in the molar ratio of AlEt3 / Zr ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) . the chain transfer reaction by both AlEt3 and AliBu3 were also detected in syndiospecific polymerization with <nUm> . the molar ratio of alkyl ( r ) end group ( derived from chain transfer to AIR3 ) to n-propyl end group wa higher in the polypropylene obtained with AlEt3 than that obtained with AliBu3 . the relative constant ktrA / kp ( ktrA = rate constant of chain transfer to AIR3 , kp = rate constant of propagation ) were determined by kinetic study . several type of commercial and developmental aluminoxanes were studied in the semi-batch polymerization of ethylene using bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) . high temperature gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) measurement of polyethylene ( PE ) formed using various type of aluminoxanes approximated flory 's most probable distribution from a single site - type with PE mw / mn approaching <nUm> for polymerization temperature ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C . the structure and type of aluminoxane co-catalyst were found not to influence the molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) of PE although to influence the activity of the Cp2ZrCl2 catalyst . In general , modified methylaluminoxanes ( MMAOs ) and methylaluminoxanes ( MAOs ) were found to have similar activity , whereas isobutylaluminoxane ( IBAO ) gave a very low activity in the polymerization of ethylene . increasing isobutyl content in the aluminoxane co-catalyst led to a continual decrease in catalyst activity . increasing aluminium / zirconium ( Al / Zr ) molar ratio , by increasing the MAO concentration , led to increasing catalyst activity up to a maximum activity at an Al / Zr molar ratio of <nUm> . like the structure and type of the aluminoxane co-catalyst , the Al / Zr molar ratio wa found not to influence the PE MWD . mixing in additional trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) with MAO wa found not to alter the MWD but gave lower activity at similar Al / Zr molar ratio than that from MAO itself . we report an experimental investigation on long chain branching ( LCB ) in ethylene slurry polymerization with bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) / modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) using a semi-batch reactor . the effect of the reaction temperature , pressure , MMAO concentration , and catalyst feeding method on the long chain branching density ( LCBD , number of branch per <nUm> carbon ) , polymer molecular weight , and shear thinning property ( I10 / I2 ) were systematically examined . the slurry polymerization process , with it associated polymer - rich phase and the partitioning of active site , favor the LCB formation via an in situ copolymerization of ethylene macromonomers generated by b-hydride elimination and chain transfer to monomer . increasing the temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C reduced the LCBD from <nUm> to <nUm> , while increasing the pressure from <nUm> to <nUm> psig reduced the LCBD from <nUm> to <nUm> . the LCB polyethylene showed enhanced shear thinning property , with melt flow index ratio ( I10 / I2 ) in the range of <nUm> - <nUm> . the feeding sequence of reactant also had a significant effect on the LCB formation . it wa observed that feeding ethylene monomer before zirconocene catalyst produced polyethylene having much higher LCBD than feeding catalyst before monomer.We report an experimental investigation on long chain branching ( LCB ) in ethylene slurry polymerization with bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) / modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) using a semi-batch reactor . the effect of the reaction temperature , pressure , MMAO concentration , and catalyst feeding method on the long chain branching density ( LCBD , number of branch per <nUm> <nUm> carbon ) , polymer molecular weight , and shear thinning property ( I10 / I2 ) were systematically examined . the slurry polymerization process , with it associated polymer - rich phase and the partitioning of active site , favor the LCB formation via an in situ copolymerization of ethylene macromonomers generated by b-hydride elimination and chain transfer to monomer . increasing the temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C reduced the LCBD from <nUm> to <nUm> , while increasing the pressure from <nUm> to <nUm> psig reduced the LCBD from <nUm> to <nUm> . the LCB polyethylene showed enhanced shear thinning property , with melt flow index ratio ( I10 / I2 ) in the range of <nUm> - <nUm> . the feeding sequence of reactant also had a significant effect on the LCB formation . it wa observed that feeding ethylene monomer before zirconocene catalyst produced polyethylene having much higher LCBD than feeding catalyst before monomer .

( C ) <nUm> elsevier science B.V. four metallocene catalyst were prepared using two indenyl-containing aerogels a support , treated under different condition ( triethylaluminum ( TEA ) , methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and butyllithium ) . the catalyst were characterized by complementary spectroscopic technique : ultraviolet - visible spectroscopy ( UV - vi ) , x-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy ( XPS ) , matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization time - of - flight mass spectroscopy ( MALDI-TOF-MS ) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and electron probe microanalysis ( EPMA ) . the highest metal content ( <nUm> mmol Zr / g-cat . ) wa achieved in the case of xerogel treated with TEA prior to metallocene synthesis . after MAO leaching , such content is reduced to <nUm> mmol-Zr / g-cat. , exhibiting the highest activity in ethylene polymerization among the four developed catalyst . A relationship between catalyst activity and binding energy of Zr 3d(5 / <nUm> ) core level could be evidenced . the most active catalyst system showed a better Zr distribution , being the catalyst grain covered by aluminum cocatalyst . depth profile monitoring by XPS measurement showed that , in fact , MAO leach the zirconocene low binding energy specie , being deposited in the uttermost surface of the grain . eight zirconocene dichloride complex are described that contain an alkyl or silylalkyl substituent with a fluorenyl end group on the cyclopentadienyl ring . also , a bridged cyclopentadienyl indenyl metallocene complex with a fluorenyl terminated alkyl substituent is reported . these complex were activated with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) and used for catalytic ethylene polymerization . the synthesis and characterization of <nUm> new , unbridged metallocene dichloride complex of the type (L)(Ind)ZrCl2 ( L = o-phenylalkyl substituted cyclopentadienyl or 1-phenylsilyl substituted indenyl ; ind = indenyl ) and (L')(Flu)ZrCl2(L ' = 1-benzyl substituted indenyl or 2-benzyl substituted indenyl ; flu = fluorenyl ) are reported . after activation with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) , these complex are highly active catalyst for homogeneous ethylene polymerization . the influence of various substituents on the catalyst activity and the polymer property are discussed . ethylene polymerization wa carried out by using the zirconocene catalyst supported on MCM-41 ( or Al-MCM-41 ) , which had a uniform hexagonal array of linear channel constructed with a honeycomb - like silica matrix , and about <nUm> Å d-spacing . the zirconocene catalyst supported directly on silicious MCM-41 ( Cp2ZrCl2 / MCM-41 ) did not show any activity in ethylene polymerization . on the other hand , the activity of the zirconocene catalyst supported directly on Al-MCM-41 ( Cp2ZrCl2 / Al-MCM-41 ) were comparable to those of homogeneous zirconocenes , and much higher than the activity of those supported on Al-MCM-41 modified by methylaluminoxane ( Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO / Al-MCM-41 ) . the lewis acidity in Al-MCM-41 seemed to play an important role for anchoring the zirconocenes , such that lower value of Si / Al ratio resulted in higher catalytic activity . modification with MAO must have reduced the role of acidity . the difference in the catalytic activity among the supported zirconocenes wa discussed through the surface specie model on the interaction between zirconocene and lewis acid in Al-MCM-41 .

A comparison of the Cp2ZrCl2 and cp2 / (*)ZrCl2 reactivity with MAO , a the reference point for aluminoxanes , a well a with their parent aluminum alkyl AlMe3 ( TMA ) , Al(i-Bu)3 ( TIBA ) , and Al(i-Oct)3 ( TIOA ) ha been made . cp2 / (*)ZrCl2 , because of steric hindrance , is le reactive than Cp2ZrCl2 towards all aluminium compound considered . the cp2 / (*)Zr-i-BuCl and cp2 / (*)Zr-i-OctCl produced appear to be more stable than Cp2Zr-i-BuCl and Cp2Zr-i-OctCl due to the cp* steric hindrance , which inhibits b-hydrogen elimination . the lower reactivity of cp2 / (*)ZrCl2 along with the higher stability of the zirconium alkyl produced ha allowed u to produce evidence of the greater capacity of TIOAO with respect to TIBAO for yielding alkylated ion pair . these result explain the polymerization activity yielded by metallocenes when combined with the above aluminoxanes , that is , the Cp2ZrCl2 activity only with MAO , and the high polymerization activity of substituted metallocenes when b-alkyl-substituted aluminoxanes are used a cocatalysts .

( C ) <nUm> elsevier science B.V. effect of heterogenization parameter on compositional and catalytic property of Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 supported on silica modified with MAO were evaluated using data on metal loading , catalyst activity in ethylene-propylene copolymerization , and polymer property . the supported catalyst were prepared according to a <nUm> factorial design for multivariate analysis . the parameter studied were : MAO concentration in impregnation , Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 concentration in grafting , and immobilization temperature for both metallocene and organoaluminum . the grafting solution wa monitored by UV - VIS spectroscopy , while the resulting catalyst system were characterized by inductively - coupled plasma - optical emission spectroscopy ( ICP - OES ) , diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy ( DRIFTS ) , and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) . At high statistical significance , both MAO and Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 concentration during preparation affected the determination of the final A1 / Zr ratio on silica . the catalyst system were tested in ethylene-propylene copolymerizations using external MAO a cocatalyst . relationship were observed between ( i ) catalyst activity and the binding energy of Zr 3d5 / <nUm> electron and ( ii ) Al / Zr ratio on silica and the average ethylene incorporation . the polymer sample presented narrow molecular weight distribution , but according to differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , and cross-fractionation chromatography ( CFC ) data , catalyst system with given Al / Zr ratio might yield different crystallite , suggesting a plural distribution of chemical composition . this work present the result of theoretical and experimental characterization of supported (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 on organosilanes pre-treated O2Si . several possibility are analyzed and considered a an attempt to explain the observed zirconocene loading , catalyst performance in ethylene polymerization and resulting polymer property of these supported zirconocenes . the effect of silica pre-treatment with Ph3SiCl , Me3SiCl and Me2HSiCl on the immobilization of (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 wa modeled . the main considered aspect were the role of the surface concentration of the organosilanes , the presence or absence of residual chlorine and the possibility of interaction between the organosilanes and the zirconocene . all these fact might afford different surface specie at the impregnation step prior to the MAO activation during the polymerization reaction . the different elementary step in the racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 activation process by commercial methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) are studied by UV - VIS spectroscopy technique and correlated with hexene polymerization kinetics . after monomethylation of the zirconocene dichloride ( λ = <nUm> nm ) , abstraction of Cl ligand by MAO at low Al : Zr ratio ( Al : Zr = <nUm> ) yield tight ion pair , [racEt(Ind)2ZrMe]+ , [MAOCl]- with an absorption band centered at λ = <nUm> nm , inactive towards hexene polymerization . addition of MAO in large excess ( Al : Zr = <nUm> ) is therefore required to form active specie identified a TMA separated ion pair , [ racEt(Ind)2Zr+ (m-Me)2AlMe2 ] , [ MAO ∼ cl]- ( λ = <nUm> nm ) . the activation of racEt(Ind)2ZrMe2 by MAO reveals much easier and is complete at low Al : Zr ratio ( Al : Zr = <nUm> ) , yielding directly active ion pair [racEt(Ind)2ZrMe]+ , [MAOMe]- , absorbing at λ = <nUm> nm . these data underline the negative role of [MAOCl]- a a counter-anion in the activation process of zirconocene dichloride precursor for olefin polymerization . In the same condition , the use of TMA - depleted MAO allows the direct formation , at low Al : Zr ratio , of active tight ion pair λ = <nUm> nm ) . the activation process by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) of various zirconocene precursor of the type racEt(Ind)2ZrX2 , with different extractable x ligand ( x = Cl , me , NMe2 , CH2Ph ) , wa investigated both by mean of UV - VIS spectroscopy and through hex-1-ene polymerization kinetics . the different elementary step yielding olefin polymerization active specie , i.e. methylation and cationization of the transition metal could be readily discriminated . unlike racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 precursor for which high amount of MAO ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) is required to form catalytic specie active towards olefin polymerization , the complete activation of other racEt(Ind)2ZrX2 tested ( with x = me , NMe2 , CH2Ph ) is readily achieved at relatively low Al / Zr ratio ( Al / Zr = 40-50 ) . the corresponding zirconocenium specie exhibit different catalytic activity according to the nature of the extracted x ligand , showing the important role of the formed [MAO-X]- counter-anion in the activation process and more particularly , it ability to still coordinate with the metal center and compete with the incoming olefin . A series of supported metallocene catalyst were prepared by immobilizing (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 and Cp2NbCl2 on bare and on MAO - modified silica . both metallocenes were sequentially grafted on silica under different combination . metal loading ( Zr , Nb and Al ) wa determined by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy ( XRF ) . final metal content wa shown to be dependent on passivation of silica with MAO , and on the grafting sequence . higher metal content ( <nUm> wt. % Nb / O2Si and <nUm> wt. % Zr / O2Si ) were achieved when the metallocene wa grafted onto MAO - modified silica . Cp2NbCl2 derivative were not active in polymerizing ethylene using MAO a co-catalyst ( Al / Nb = <nUm> ) . all the system containing zirconocene derivative showed high catalyst activity . nevertheless , higher activity were achieved immobilizing (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 on silica that wa previously modified with MAO and Cp2NbCl2 . some immobilization protocol led to catalyst system which were even more active than the homogenous counterpart . effect of support structure and chemical modification on the catalyst performance are presented and discussed . the directed oligomerization of propene and 1-hexene wa carried out with a series of CP'(C5H5)ZrCl2 and Cp'2ZrCl2 pre-catalysts ( cp' = C5HMe4 , C4Me4P , C5Me5 , C5H4tBu , C5H3-1,3-tBu2 , C5H2-1,2,4-tBu3 ) together with C10Cl2H10Zr . oligomers in the molar mass range 300-1500 g / mol for propene and 200-3000 g / mol for 1-hexene were synthesized at <nUm> ° C . the majority of oligomer molecule contain a double - bond end group . oligomer characterization wa carried out by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) , 1H and 13CNMR . vinylidene double bond ( from b-hydrogen elimination ) are solely found for the tert-butyl-substituted zirconocenes and for most of the unsymmetrical methyl-substituted Cp'(C5H5)ZrCl2 system ( except cp' = phospholyl ) . with (C4Me4P)(C5H5)ZrCl2 and with the symmetrical methyl-containing Cp'2ZrCl2 pre-catalysts , also vinyl end group ( from b-methyl elimination ) are observed in the case of oligopropenes . the vinylidene / vinyl ratio depends on the ligand and the vinyl content increase from C5HMe4 ( <nUm> / <nUm> ) over C4Me4P ( <nUm> / <nUm> ) to C5Me5 ( <nUm> / <nUm> ) . the phospholyl zirconocenes and (C5HMe4)2ZrCl2 also exhibit chain - transfer to aluminum thereby giving saturated oligomers . heterogeneous metallocene catalyst avoid reactor fouling in olefin polymerisation . for technical use the metallocene catalyst must be fixed on carrier . silica is one of the favoured inorganic carrier . but the activity of heterogeneous metallocene catalyst on silica in ethylene and propylene polymerisation are often lower than those of comparable homogeneous catalyst system . we tested the clay mineral kaolin and montmorillonite a inorganic carrier for the polymerisation of ethylene and propylene with commercially available titanocenes and zirconocenes and also with new type of titanocenes . the heterogeneous catalyst on kaolin were le active in ethylene polymerisation a comparable homogeneous catalyst and they were not active in propylene polymerisation . In contrast the heterogeneous catalyst on montmorillonite are often more active in ethylene or propylene polymerisation than comparable homogeneous system . As cocatalysts trimethylaluminium ( AlMe3 , TMA ) and triisobutylaluminium ( Al(iBu3) , TIBA ) were used for heterogeneous polymerisation . As catalyst commercially available titanocenes and zirconocenes and also four titanocenes with unusual structure were tested which lang et al. had synthesised . the high activity in ethylene or propylene polymerisation with montmorillonite may be due to the special structure of the montmorillonite carrier . we treated silica with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane , BC18F15 , to create borane - functionalized support , SiO2-B(C6F5)3 which wa then used a a support and co-catalyst for the in situ activated dichloro-zirconocene ( Cp2ZrCl2 / TIBA ) and dimethyl-zirconocene catalyst system ( Cp2Zr(CH3)2 ) for ethylene polymerization . the surface modification of SiO2-B(C6F5)3 wa investigated by SEM - EDX , FTIR and XPS to determine the distribution of fluorine and boron atom on the silica surface a a measure of the presence of BC18F15 and interaction with the siloxane group of the silica support . catalytic performance are presented in the form of ethylene consumption rate profile . the result show that the independent of the time dedicated to the in situ activation of the metallocene , all pre-activated system showed activity decay . In contrast , the in situ activated system either showed little or no activity decay . the presence of TIBA wa adequate to make an active MAO - free catalyst system . the pre-activated and in situ activated metallocene system produced polyethylene with slightly different molecular weight ( MWs ) and molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) . MWDs were quite narrow ∼ <nUm> . the bulk density of polyethylene product is highest for the in situ activated metallocenes , but there is no difference between the product of dichloro- and dimethyl-zirconocenes . pre-activated and in situ activated catalyst show no reactor fouling . A series of aryl-substituted tetramethylcyclopentadienyl zirconocenes (C5Me4C6H4X-4)Cp' MCl2 [ CP' = CH , x = H ( 5 ) , me ( 6 ) , Cl ( 7 ) or OMe ( 8 ) ; cp' = ind , x = H ( 9 ) , me ( 10 ) or Cl ( 11 ) ; cp' = 2-Ph-Ind , x = H ( 12 ) ] and (C5Me4C6H4X-4)2 Cl2Zr [ x = H ( 13 ) , me ( 14 ) , Cl ( 15 ) ] , with different substituents at the 4-position of phenyl , have been prepared by the reaction of the corresponding ligand ( C5Me4HC6H4X-4 ) [ x = H ( 1 ) , me ( 2 ) , Cl ( 3 ) or OMe ( 4 ) ] with n-BuLi , Cl4Zr and Cp'Li or with n-BuLi and Cl4Zr . ethylene polymerization with these complex in combination with MAO ha been studied . the electron donor ( me ) at the 4-position of phenyl led to an increase in catalytic activity while the electron - withdrawing group ( Cl ) and the strong π donor ( OMe ) led to it decrease . complex <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> exhibited very high activity , but 13-15 showed much lower activity due to the bulky steric effect . the molecular structure of <nUm> ha been determined by x-ray diffraction . the relationship between structure of catalyst and catalytic activity were discussed . the behavior of two differently prepared methylaluminoxanes ( MAOs ) on the activation process of racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 for olefin polymerization wa studied . contrarily to commercial product , the two MAOs used are characterized by a low content of free trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) . MAO-A wa prepared by pumping off the TMA contained in commercial MAO , whereas MAO-B wa obtained by thermal treatment of TMA with benzophenone . the different elementary step in the zirconocene activation process depending on the amount and nature of added MAO ( commercial and modified one ) were investigated by UV / visible spectroscopy . In all case , monomethylation of racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 rapidly take place after addition of small amount of MAO . then , abstraction of the second chloride of the metallocene occurs upon addition of larger amount of MAO ( Al / Zr < <nUm> ) leading to the formation of highly active catalytic specie for hexene polymerization . this is characterized by a bathochromic shift of the zirconocene absorption band . the role of TMA is clearly pointed out by comparing the modified MAO / zirconocene system with the one based on commercial MAO . the influence of structure and composition of MAO on the activation process is also clearly underlined by the very different amount of activator needed to get metallocene active specie in the presence of commercial and modified cocatalysts . A series of zirconocenes differing in the coordination sphere , namely (R)ZrCl2 ( r = (MeCp)2 , (i-BuCp)2 , (n-BuCp)2 , rac - Et(Ind)2 and rac - Et(IndH4)2 ) were immobilized on silica grace <nUm> pretreated at <nUm> K under vacuum . the highest metal loading , determined by rutherford 's backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy , wa achieved with rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 . the steric effect played by the ligand on the cyclopentadienyl ring wa seen to influence on the grafted content : le Zr wa immobilized on silica using n-Bu a ligand , a compared to the zirconocene that us me a ligand . nevertheless , this catalyst wa the most active both in homogeneous and supported copolymerizations . copolymer were characterized with respect to their molecular weight , polydispersity ( mw / Mn ) , crystallinity , comonomer incorporation and melting temperature . mono , di and tetranuclear ansa zirconocene complex have been synthesized and characterized . after activation with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) these catalyst were used for the homogeneous and heterogeneous polymerization of ethylene . the property of the catalyst and the produced polymer were compared . the multinuclear catalyst show a different performance than the corresponding mononuclear derivative . the tetranuclear catalyst have the lowest activity because of steric crowding . five new hetero - bimetallic metallocene complex were synthesized by the reaction of RCpTiCl3 and a Si - bridged zirconocene complex in refluxing toluene . they were all well characterized . these complex activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) are highly active catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene . the molecular weight ( mw = 28,957-124,089 ) and the molecular weight distribution ( MWD = <nUm> - <nUm> ) of the polymer generated from the bimetallic catalytic system were higher than that obtained by Cp2ZrCl2 . A theoretical study of Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO system is presented based on density functional theory ( DFT ) calculation performed with gaussian basis - set . the MAO cocatalyst wa modeled a a small finite section of the most probably specie in solution . the geometry of the cation - counterion forming the ionic - pair active site wa fully optimized and it electronic structure wa examined in term of the natural bond orbital ( NBO ) population analysis . In this way the ionic - pair interaction can be related to the electronic charge change around the zirconium cation . the result indicate the formation of a stable ionic - pair and the redistribution of charge in the cation complex and counterion . the latter wa concluded by mapping the charge density difference . the laplacian of charge density confirm the ionic interaction of the metallocene / MAO system . A newly synthesized catalyst , a pentamethylene bridged dinuclear zirconocene [ CH2 (C5H4)2][(C9H7)ZrCl 2]2 ) , and it in situ supported catalyst were tested in a ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization and their performance wa compared with those of Cp2ZrCl2 and rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 . when homogeneous [ CH2 (C5H4)2][(C9H7)ZrCl 2]2 catalyst wa used in the copolymerization , it activity decreased with comonomer incorporation ( a negative comonomer effect ) and it produced copolymer with a lower comonomer content than other catalyst , both of which were ascribed to the steric effect of the [ CH2 (C5H4)2][(C9H7)ZrCl 2]2 catalyst . with in situ supported catalyst , the activity did not change much with the increase of 1-hexene content in contrast to the homogeneous catalyst . In situ supported catalyst produced copolymer with higher content of 1-hexene and lower melting point and crystallinity . the change in the molecular weight and it distribution of the copolymer with in situ supporting were significant and dependant on the nature of the catalyst . A series of <nUm> dissymmetric dinuclear ansa zirconocene complex and their ligand precursor have been synthesized and characterized . after activation with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , these catalyst polymerize ethylene with different productivity and polydispersities in homogeneous and heterogeneous medium . the tendency of these series are shown . In the present work Et(IndH4)2ZrCl2 wa immobilized on silica previously modified with different chemical compound , namely Cl3OV , Cl4Sn , Bu3SnH , Me2SiHCl , polymethylhydrosiloxane ( PMHS ) and such system were compared to methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) pretreated system . Bu3SnH - modified silica led to the highest zirconocene grafted content . Zr 3d5 / <nUm> binding energy determined by x-ray spectroscopy ( XPS ) wa shown to increase for Et(IndH4)2ZrCl2 supported on silica modified with Cl3OV , MAO and Bu3SnH , suggesting the generation of more electron deficient surface specie . all system were shown to be active in ethylene-propylene copolymerization , presenting higher activity than those prepared by grafting the zirconocene on bare silica . aging test with MAO - mediated system showed that the catalyst bearing <nUm> wt. % Al / O2Si kept it catalyst activity at least for <nUm> month after preparation . the homopolymerization of ethylene wa investigated using the catalyst of (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 supported on PMHS - modified silica ( PMHS = polymethylhydrosiloxane ) . the effect of the amount of the organosilane polymer on the metallocene grafted content wa studied in loading of PMHS from <nUm> to <nUm> wt. % Si / O2Si , in which the grafted Zr content wa from <nUm> to <nUm> wt. % Si / O2Si . the metal content were determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) , while the catalyst stepwise preparation wa monitored by diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy ( DRIFTS ) . the chemical environment of the zirconocene surface specie were further probed by x-ray spectroscopy ( XPS ) and the metal distribution wa studied by electron probe microanalysis ( EPMA ) . these catalyst system produced polyethylene with a narrow molecular weight distribution using methylaluminoxane a co-catalyst , and their catalyst activity were three time greater than the one obtained with (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 supported on the bare O2Si . effect of the support structure and the chemical modification on the catalyst performance are presented and discussed . A series of supported catalyst were prepared by combining ( nBuCp ) 2ZrCl2 and Cp2ZrCl2 sequentially grafted on silica in different ratio ( <nUm> : <nUm> and <nUm> : <nUm> ) and immobilization order . catalyst system were characterized by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) , diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy ( DRIFTS ) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and electron probe microanalysis ( EPMA ) . grafted metal content remained comprised between <nUm> and <nUm> wt. % Zr / OSi <nUm> . all the system were shown to be active in ethylene homopolymerization having methylaluminoxane a co-catalyst . catalyst activity wa shown to be dependent on the metallocene nature , but not on the addition order or molar ratio . the highest activity wa achieved with cp 2ZrCl2 / (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 ( <nUm> : <nUm> ) catalyst system ( ca. <nUm> kg PE ( mmol zrh)-1 ) . resulting polymer were characterized by GPC and DSC . In spite of bearing two catalyst center , no bimodality wa observed in the resulting polymer . the stereotacticities of a series of polypropylene polymer chain produced with different category of structurally characterized ansa- zirconocene and hafnocene procatalysts in homogeneous catalysis have been determined by statistical analysis of the methyl pentad signal intensity distribution of their 13C NMR spectrum . the polymer microstructural characteristic have been contrasted with the intramolecular parameter of the discrete metallocene molecule obtained from single crystal x-ray diffraction and different 1H NMR measurement . for the first category , by contrasting the polymerization behavior of zirconocene - hafnocene pair the origin of the stereospecificity difference have been discussed in term of heavy atom electron configuration , lanthanoid shell contraction and relativistic effect operative on element belonging to the sixth row of the periodic table . for the second category the observed change in polymerization behavior for a pair of zirconocene based catalyst with ligand modification of irrelevant steric control have been correlated to the electron density redistribution on different aromatic carbon and the consequent change in flexibility of the catalyst framework , increase of the haptocity of M-C5 bonding and variation of the frontier orbital shape and diffusivity . for the third category , pair of syndio- and isotactic specific ansa - zirconocene and hafnocenes have been selected in which the organic ligand are constructed with the same aromatic moiety joined with different bridge . the observed catalytic change have been correlated to combined steric and electronic factor altering orbital energy and hybridization . finally , by introducing a fourth category , the Hf effect is demonstrated by comparing the catalytic olefin activity of two non-bridged hafnocene- zirconocene pair . ethylene , propylene and 1-butene polymerization kinetics have been investigated in the presence of <nUm> zirconocene and ethylalumoxane derivative with various molecular mass and a molar ratio of Al / Zr = 23-26 . it wa found that zirconocene activity in combination with ethylalumoxanes with molecular weight MW = <nUm> ( an oligomer with -[OAl(C2H5)]- unit number equal to <nUm> ) increase in series : Cp(Acac)2ZrCl < (Fulv)2Cp,Zr,Cl2 < Cp,ZrMe2 < (Fulv)2Cp2Zr2(O)Cl2 < (Ind)2ZrCl2 < (t-Bu2Cp)2ZrCl2 < Cp2ZrCl2 < (t-BuCp)2ZrCl2 < (MeCp)2ZrCl2 < (i-PrCp)2ZrCl2 , where fulv - fulvalene . with methylalumoxane ( MW = <nUm> , ( -[OAl(CH3)]- unit number <nUm> ) the following series of zirconocene activity wa established : (MeCp)2ZrCl2 < (EtCp)2ZrCl2 < (PrCp)2ZrCl2 < ( BuCp2ZrCl2 < (i-PrCp)2ZrCl2 < ( cyclo- HexCp)2ZrCl2 . all - electron RHF and RMP2 ab initio calculation with split valence basis set of double- and triple-z quality have been used to study reaction path for the reaction of acetylene ( 1 ) with the model compound Cl2ZrH+ ( 2 ) and CCl2H3Zr / + ( 3 ) . At the RMP2 / / RHF level the acetylide - complex formation reaction is calculated to have a barrier of <nUm> ( 2 ) , <nUm> ( 3 ) kcal / mol with respect to complexed acetylene and to be <nUm> ( 2 ) , <nUm> ( 3 ) kcal / mol exothermic with respect to free acetylene . the transition state are four - membered cycle . the calculated energy barrier are greater than the theoretical value obtained for s-bond metathesis of acetylene with Cl2ScR and Cp2ScR ( r = H , CH3 ) . the calculated energetics of the metathesis reaction path are compared with the theoretical value determined for the alternative insertion reaction of acetylene into Zr-H and Zr-C σ bond . the insertion reaction are kinetically and thermodynamically favoured over the corresponding metathesis reaction . the copolymerization of ethylene and 1,5-hexadiene wa investigated under high pressure of <nUm> bar using a zirconocene catalyst in the presence of methylaluminoxane . the concentration of the diene wa varied over a wide range including the homopolymerization of both ethylene and 1,5-hexadiene . from the amount of polymer formed per unit of time and the catalyst feed the productivity wa determined . the resulting polymer were analyzed by DSC , GPC , IR- and 13C-NMR-spectroscopy to evaluate the average molecular weight together with the polydispersity , the crystallinity , the melting point and the structure . the catalyst exhibit a good ability for copolymerization and cyclopolymerization of 1,5-hexadiene in which a predominance of trans ring formation wa observed . the isoselective propene polymerization using the homogeneous Me2Si(Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst system wa investigated . the influence of the concentration of metallocene and MAO activator on polymerization kinetics and microstructure of the resulting polymer wa studied . catalyst activity wa found to be independent of zirconocene concentration and only a function of total MAO concentration . polypropene microstructure wa not affected by either MAO or zirconocene concentration . the polymerization behavior is compared to that of Me2Si(2-Me Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO . A model is presented to account for the equilibrium present in the polymerization medium . this model take into account the interaction between metallocene cation and excess MAO , thus explaining the influence of MAO concentration on catalyst activity in propene polymerization . A modified extended huckel method ( EHMO ) , which includes core - core repulsion term , wa used to study a propylene polymerization heterogeneous catalyst by modeling the adsorption of the ansa - metallocene ethylen-bisindenylzirconium dichloride ( C20Cl2H17Zr from now on EtInd2ZrCl2 ) on O2Si surface . the adsorption wa considered to occur at two face of O2Si ( with geminal and isolated OH 's ) and at two different temperature for O2Si pretreatment ( <nUm> and <nUm> ° C ) . taking into account that the interaction with Al compound is considered a a way to improve the catalyst performance , specially with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , a local model of aluminoxane ( AlO ) wa added to Si-O bond with the subsequent metallocene adsorption . the result show that AlO improves the zirconocene adsorption on O2Si modeled at <nUm> ° C while it inhibits that process at <nUm> ° C . the c(s)- and c(2v)-symmetric doubly dimethylsilylene-bridged zirconocene complex (Me2Si)2{e5-C5H2-4-CHMe2{e5C5H-3,5-(SiMe3)2}ZrCl2 , 6a , and (Me2Si)2{e5C5H-3,5-(CHMe2)2)2ZrCl2 , 6b , have been synthesized by reaction of corresponding dilithio ligand salt with Cl4Zr in CCl2H2 . when activated with methyl aluminoxane , C ( s ) - symmetric zirconocene 6a catalyzes the polymerization of propylene ( liquid propylene , <nUm> ° C ) to yield a syndiotactic polymer of mw = <nUm> and rrrr % = <nUm> . by contrast , c(2v)-symmetric zirconocene 6b display a low activity and affords an atactic polymer . displacement of the anion H3C-B(C6F5)3 from the zirconocene contact - ion pair [ (C5H5)2Zr(CH3)+ *** (m-H3C)-B(C6F5)3- ] by a series of phosphine and formation of a bisphosphine complex by uptake of a second phosphine ligand have been studied by NMR method in C6D6 solution . evidence is presented that associated , outer - sphere ion pair [(C5H5)2Zr(CH3)(PR3)]+ H3C-B(C6F5)3- predominate at zirconocene concentration up to ca. <nUm> mM ; higher aggregate become apparent at higher zirconocene concentration . equilibrium constant for the formation of mono- and bis-PMe3 complex have been determined ; the latter are found to be highly sensitive to steric perturbation . these data , together with density - functional estimate for reaction enthalpy , lead to the following qualitative conclusion with regard to olefin coordination in zirconocene - based polymerization catalyst : ( i ) the olefin substrate displaces the borate anion only from a small equilibrium fraction of the zirconocene alkyl cation present ; ( ii ) the predominant fraction of the resulting zirconocene alkyl olefin cation remains in an outer - sphere association with the counteranion ; ( iii ) mutual displacement of olefin and counteranion from the Zr center is slow compared to typical olefin insertion ; ( iv ) uptake of a second olefin under formation of a cationic zirconocene alkyl diolefin complex is rather unlikely even at elevated olefin concentration . the ( conjugated diene ) group <nUm> metallocenes la-d ( diene - butadiene , isoprene ; metallocene = CP2Zr , Cp2Hf , MeCp2Zr ) add BC18F15 to yield the metallacyclic m *** F-C bridged metallocene-borate-betaine complex 3a-d . these add one equivalent of acetylene to give the chiral metallacyclic insertion product 5a-d that can be described a either intramolecular ion - pair type complex involving interaction of the negatively polarized terminal -CH = CH-CH2-[B] group of the resulting s-ligand system with the positively polarized metallocene moiety of the dipolar betaine product or r2-internal alkene metallocene complex , respectively , a it is revealed by a comparison with the related acyclic THF - addition product <nUm> and <nUm> . propyne insert unselectively into the terminal Zr-C bond of the complex 3a-c . In each case a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of the regioisomers 6a-c ( methyl at C2 ) and 7a-c ( methyl group at Cl ) is obtained . the behavior of (C2B9H11)M(NEt2)2(NHEt2) [ m = Ti ( 1 ) , Zr ( 2 ) ] mono-dicarbollide complex in olefin and styrene polymerisation ha been investigated . compound <nUm> and <nUm> , when activated by MAO ( Al / m = <nUm> to <nUm> ) , polymerise ethylene with good activity . surprisingly , <nUm> can also be activated with small amount of triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA , Al / Zr = <nUm> to <nUm> ) . the ethylene polymerisation activity of the <nUm> / TIBA catalyst ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> atm , toluene-chlorobenzene ) is greater than that reported for the CpZrX3 / MAO catalyst but lower by about one or two order of magnitude than zirconocene - MAO system ( e.g. Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO , rac-(ethylene-bis-l-idenyl)ZrCl2 / MAO ) . the GPC ( gel permeation chromatography ) curve of the polyethylene sample obtained with <nUm> / TIBA catalyst ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> atm , toluene-chlorobenzene ) is bimodal indicating that at least two specie are active in this system and one is more active than the other . the <nUm> / MAO system ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> atm , toluene-chlorobenzene ) slowly polymerises propylene to atactic polymer . under the same experimental condition 1-pentene doe not polymerise at all . compound <nUm> and <nUm> , activated with MAO , produce syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) with very low activity . attempt to copolymerise styrene with ethylene by the <nUm> / MAO and <nUm> / MAO system afforded a mixture of the two homopolymers . ethene / 1-octene and ethene / 1-butene copolymerization using various methylaluminoxane - activated metallocene catalyst , e.g. silylene-bridged substituted bisindenyl zirconocene system and halfsandwich titanocene , wa performed at <nUm> ° C in toluene . the influence of the ligand substitution on comonomer incorporation , catalyst activity , molar mass , molar mass distribution , degree of polymerization and copolymerization parameter wa investigated in ethene / 1-octene copolymerization at constant comonomer ratio and in ethene / l-butene copolymerization a a function of varying ethene / 1-butene feed mass ratio . In ethene / 1-octene copolymerization the highest comonomer incorporation wa achieved with MAO - activated Me2Si(Me4Cp)(N-tert-butyl)TiCl2 catalyst . best performance in term of comohomer incorporation combined with high catalyst activity and molar mass wa found for silylene-bridged bisindenylzirconocenes , where 2-methyl substitution promoted high degree of polymerization and benzannelation accounted for improved catalyst activity , comohomer incorporation and randomness of comonomer incorporation . In ethene / 1-butene copolymerization at high 1-butene feed content silylene-bridged substituted bisindenyl system showed polymerization characteristic similar to that of ethene / 1-octene copolymerization . the influence of 2-methyl substitution on activity and comohomer incorporation wa significant only at low 1-butene feed content . storage tooduli and glass transition temperature of the poly(ethene-co-l-butene) copolymer decreased with increasing 1-butene content . A novel dinuclear ansa - zirconocene catalyst ( m-C12H8{[SiPh(Ind)2]ZrCl2}2 ) ( I ) wa prepared by a wurtz coupling reaction between two equivalent of bisindenylphenylchlorosilane and one equivalent of 4,4'-dibromobiphenyl in THF at reflux temperature for <nUm> h , followed by a successive reaction with Cl4Zr · 2THF in THF at <nUm> ° C . polymerization of ethene wa conducted in a <nUm> cm3 glass reactor equipped with a stirrer at <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> ° C using MAO or Ph3C[B(C6F5)4] a cocatalyst and toluene a the solvent . the catalyst ( I ) gave linear polyethene with a broader molecular mass distribution ( MMD ) in a much higher yield a compared to the corresponding mononuclear catalyst derived from [Ph2Si(Ind)2]ZrC12 ( II ) . the apparent activity increased monotonously from <nUm> ° C up to <nUm> ° C . the replacement of MAO with Ph3C[B(C6F5)4] gave polyethene with a higher molecular weight . four newly synthesized bridged bisindenyl zirconocenes which are derivative of known structure have been tested in polymerization of liquid propylene with methylaluminoxane a cocatalyst . they include two asymmetric and two binuclear system which are suitable for isotactic polymerization . surprising difference from the behavior of similar system ( regiospecificity , chain termination ) are found and discussed . the polymerization of propylene wa studied with a series of dinuclear early transition metal zirconocene - late transition metal complex bridged by phosphido and arsenido moiety of general formula [(e5-C5H4R'')2Zr{m-ERR'}2M(CO)(n)] ( e = P , r = r ' = SiMe3 , r '' = H , m = Mo , n = <nUm> ( 1 ) ; e = P , r = r ' = SiMe3 , r '' = H , m = Ni , n = <nUm> ( 2 ) ; e = As , r = r ' = SiMe3 , r '' = H , m = Cr , n = <nUm> ( 3 ) ; e = P , r = H , r ' = 2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2 , r '' = me , m = Mo , n = <nUm> ( 4 ) ; e = P , r = H , r ' = 2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2 , r '' = me , m = Cr , n = <nUm> ( 5 ) ) , a well a with the corresponding monometallic zirconocene precursor complex of the type [(e5-C5H4R'')2Zr(ERR')2] ( e = P , r = r ' = SiMe3 , r '' = H ( 6 ) ; e = P , r = H , r ' = 2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2 , r '' = H ( 7 ) ) and [(e5-C5H4Me)2Zr(ERR')Cl] ( e = P , r = H , r ' = 2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2 ( 8 ) ) . the active cationic specie were generated treating the complex with an excess of methylalumoxane ( MAO ) . the catalytic activity wa found to be strongly dependent on temperature and catalyst / MAO ratio . supported catalyst for ethylene polymerization have been prepared by interaction of CP2ZrX2 ( cp = e5-C5H5 , x = Cl or CH3 ) with silica chemically modified by C3ClH9Si ( TMCS ) or trialkylaluminium compound AlR3 ( r = C2H5 ( TEA ) and (i)C4H9 ( TIBA ) ) . the interaction between the modificators and the silica surface have been examined by 1H solid - state MAS NMR spectroscopy , DRIFTS and chemical analysis . the Cp2Zr(CH3)2 / O2Si - TMCS catalyst showed a fairly high activity in ethylene polymerization ( 30-300 kg PE(mol zr*h*bar)-1 ) even in the absence of any cocatalysts specially added . the addition of the cocatalyst ( MAO or TIBA ) led to a further increase in the activity of the supported catalyst . polyethylene obtained with the C3H6P2Zr / O2Si - TMCS catalyst without any cocatalyst consisted of uniform polymer particle of a spherical shape replicating that of the silica particle , whereas the shapeless aggregate of finely dispersed polymer particle similar to those usually obtained with homogeneous system were produced with the same supported catalyst in the presence of the MAO cocatalyst . A series of heterogeneous catalyst system wa prepared by the immobilization of bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride , (nBuCP)2ZrCl2 , on silica support activated at different temperature . silica dehydroxylation wa evaluated in term of retained metal loading and activity in ethylene homopolymerization . characterization of the catalyst system wa accomplished by rutherford back - scattering spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy . the highest metal loading ( <nUm> wt. % Zr / O2Si ) wa achieved with silica treated under vacuum at room temperature ( <nUm> K ) , but the catalyst showed only a minor polymerization activity which may be attributed to a large number of inactive Zr - support bidentate specie formed at a high surface density of OH in silica . IR spectroscopic data show that , regardless of support activation temperature , a significant number of isolated OH group remains after zirconocene fixation . the presence of bulky ligand in the catalyst molecule seems to prevent the remaining OH group from reacting with additional metallocene complex , keeping the metal loading around <nUm> wt. % Zr / O2Si for silica activated between <nUm> and <nUm> K . high polymerization activity observed for the system based on <nUm> K - activated silica suggests a role for these OH group in the generation of active alkylated specie when methylaluminoxane and trimethylaluminum ( contained in MAO itself ) are added at the beginning of the polymerization reaction . IR analysis show that TMA , which is a le sterically demanding compound than MAO , can effectively access the remaining OH group consuming them thoroughly . practically all the prepared system presented activity in ethylene polymerization with MAO a cocatalyst , the highest activity ( <nUm> x <nUm> PEg mol-1 Zr h-1 ) having been obtained with silica dehydroxylated at <nUm> K . IR spectroscopy ha been used to study the interaction of silica with two methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) sample differed by trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) content and with TMA . MAO and TMA have been shown to react with silica in a different way . whereas TMA interacts with terminal hydroxyl group of silica via the prototysis reaction , MAO mainly adsorbs on the surface hydroxyl group of silica without noticeable protolytical reaction with them . when silica is treated with commercial grade MAO with significant TMA content , the silica surface hydroxyl group mainly interacts with TMA and MAO adsorbs on the surface of O2Si / TMA sample . lewis acidic site ( LAS ) of silica , modified with TMA and MAO sample differed by TMA content , have been investigated by IR spectroscopy ( CO adsorption a probe molecule at <nUm> K ) . two type of LAS were found on the surface of silica modified with MAO and TMA : LAS of moderate strength ( v(CO) = 2204-2212 cm-1 ) and weak LAS ( v(CO) = <nUm> cm- <nUm> ) . the concentration of these acidic site wa estimated . by anchoring of Cp2ZrCl2 on silica , modified with TMA and MAO , the corresponding catalyst O2Si / TMA / Cp2ZrCl2 and O2Si / MAO / Cp2ZrCl2 were prepared and tested at ethylene polymerization . some correlation between the amount and strength of surface LAS of support , catalyst composition and their activity are discussed . it is proposed that the surface active specie are formed at zirconocene interaction with the most strong LAS . the system EtInd2ZrCH+ / <nUm> is parallel with SiO(*) / <nUm> MAO- wa studied theoretically by mean of an extended huckel method ( EHMO ) for the propylene adsorption . the adsorption of the different form of olefin wa evaluated on the active site formed by metallocene and silica , in presence or not of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . In this way , it is possible to appreciate the important function of MAO when the active site is modeled considering all component . according to these result the presence of MAO avoids the adsorption of some form of propylene . metallocene complex of group <nUm> metal are playing an increasingly important role in olefin polymerisation catalysis . this contribution survey several aspect of the chemistry of metallocene catalyst that are being pursued in our laboratory at present , namely the application of half - sandwich complex a catalyst for high - molecular weight elastomeric polypropene , unusual C-H activation reaction of zirconium half - sandwich complex , the development of 14-electron borole complex a neutral analogue of cationic [Cp2ZrR]+ catalyst , and the heterogenisation of MAO - free zirconocene catalyst on borate - functionalised silica . A new mechanism is proposed to explain the occurrence of primary- growing-chain-end epimerization , and the structure and frequency of olefinic end group arising from primary b-hydride transfer , in low molecular weight isotactic polypropylene produced with C2 - symmetric zirconocenes . this mechanism , based on the reversible formation of a zirconocene allyl dihydrogen complex , account for both loss of catalyst stereospecificity and decrease of polypropylene molecular weight observed by lowering [propylene] , and accommodates a number of previous and new experimental observation . inter alia : ( i ) the formation of internal vinylidene unsaturations ; ( ii ) the increase of catalyst activity induced by H addition ; ( iii ) the observed deuterium scrambling in the [1-D]propylene and [2-D]propylene polymerization recently reported by brintzinger . this new mechanism is discussed in the light of the polymerization result from two MAO - activated catalyst : rac- C2H4(Ind)2ZrCl2 and the novel , highly regiospecific rac-Me2C(3-t-Bu- Ind)2ZrCl2 . ethylene polymerization wa conducted with bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) and racdimethylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 2 ) combined with trialkylaluminum ( AlR3 ; r = methyl ( me ) , ethyl ( et ) , isobutyl ( iBu ) ) / triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( Ph3CB(C6F5)4 ) or tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane ( BC18F15 ) to study the effect of cocatalysts on polymerization rate ( r(p) ) . when AlMe3 wa used , no activity or very low activity wa observed with both zirconocenes regardless of the borane compound used . the replacement of AlMe3 to AlEt3 or AliBu3 with 1-AlR3 / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 caused polymerization and induction time wa observed to reach the maximum r(p) . especially in the case of using AlEt3 , it took about <nUm> min to show the activity . when BC18F15 wa used , AlEt3 wa not effective but AliBu3 gave the highest activity among all the combination of AlR3 and the borane compound . In the case of polymerization with <nUm> using Ph3CB(C6F5)4 , high activity wa observed with both AlEt3 and AliBu3 without any induction period . when BC18F15 wa used instead of Ph3CB(C6F5)4 , very low activity wa observed with AlEt3 . on the other hand , high activity wa observed with AliBu3 , and the maximum r(p) wa found at the beginning of the polymerization . the effect of AlR3 on the formation of active specie wa discussed based on these result . A novel class of heterogeneous ethylene polymerization catalyst , derived from homogeneous metallacyclic zirconocene complex is described . these complex can be activated with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) and used for ethylene polymerization . the polymerization reaction begin homogeneously , but the homogeneous metallacycles self - immobilize during the polymerization process . subsequent olefin polymerization is therefore heterogeneously catalyzed . this method of heterogeneous olefin polymerization is compared with a homogeneous and an alternate heterogeneous polymerization technique . ( C ) <nUm> elsevier science B.V. the metallocene (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 wa grafted on partially dehydroxilated commercial silica ( grace <nUm> ) whose surface had been chemically modified by wet impregnation of an organosilane ( Ph3SiCl , Me3SiCl , or Me2SiHCl ) aiming at supported catalyst system with well spaced a-olefin polymerization active center . final Zr loading were determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) , and modification at the silica surface after each preparation step were monitored by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy . these catalyst system produced polyethylene with narrow molecular weight distribution when methylaluminoxane wa used a cocatalyst , with twice the activity of (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 supported on bare O2Si . effect of support structure and chemical modification on catalyst performance are presented and discussed . ( C ) <nUm> elsevier science B.V. the kinetics of methane liberation during polymethylalumoxane ( MAO ) interaction with zirconocenes Cp2ZrCl2 , Ind2ZrCl2 , Me2SiCp2ZrX2 , Me2SiInd2ZrX2 , and Me2SiCp*N'BuZrX2 ( x = Cl , me ) , were studied in a wide range of metallocene concentration ( <nUm> x 10-3-1 x 10-5 mol / l ) and Al / Zr ratio ( 100-24 <nUm> ) at the narrow range of MAO concentration ( <nUm> - <nUm> mol / l ) . the reaction of methane liberation follows apparent first order on zirconium . the total methane yield is suggested to be determined by active aluminum specie present in MAO , so that [CH4](proportional to ) being ~ <nUm> [Al] both in reaction of MAO self - condensation and those catalyzed by dissolved zirconocenes . comparison of the kinetic parameter of the reaction derived in the presence of zirconocenes show considerable increase in both specific initial rate of methane liberation and the specific methane yield ( per mole of zirconium ) at metallocene concentration lower than <nUm> x 10-4 mol / l . multiple regeneration of metal-carbon ( M-C ) bond wa revealed . according to the data of analysis of the effect in term of dissociative equilibrium , the active specie that catalyze the reaction of condensation of MAO are cationic particle . it ha been demonstrated that the kinetic parameter of the reaction were also sensitive to the nature of zirconocene . ( C ) <nUm> elsevier science B.V. 1-Butene wa selectively dimerised with a high yield to 2-ethyl-1-hexene using a zirconocene / MAO catalyst . 2-Ethyl-1-hexene wa further etherified with methanol to a novel tertiary ether compound , 3-methoxy-3-methyl heptane . ( C ) <nUm> elsevier science B.V. the reaction of a-zirconated phosphorus compound <nUm> and <nUm> with methyl propiolate or dimethylacetylene dicarboxylate give rise to stable zwitterionic zirconocene - ate complex <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> in which the zirconium atom is linked exclusively to carbon atom . dialkylzirconocenes react with molybdenum or tungsten hexacarbonyl and iodine or NBS to form cyclopentadiene molybdenum or tungsten tricarbonyl iodine or bromide . the synthesis , characterization and x-ray structure of two zirconium complex of the bulky pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl ligand , cp PRO , are reported . the monocyclopentadienyl <nUm> electron complex , cp PRO ClZr <nUm> ( I ) , ha an unusual monomeric structure in the solid state and ha short Zr - ligand distance . the lewis acidity of this complex is manifested in it ability to catalyze the [4+2] cycloadditions of methyl- and ethylmethacrylate to cyclopentadiene . the sandwich complex , cp PRO CpZrCl <nUm> ( II ) , ha more typical Zr - ligand distance , but ha a more parallel arrangement of the two cyclopentadienyl ring . two new C1 - symmetric zirconocenes of the type [ me 2C(3-RCp)(Flu)]ZrCl2 bearing a phenyl ( ph ) or a cyclohexyl ( cHex ) substituent on the cyclopentadienyl ring were synthesized . copolymerizations of ethene and styrene were carried out using these catalyst and compared to the result obtained with the methyl- and tertbutyl-substituted a well a with the unsubstituted system . by the introduction of the phenyl substituent both the activity and the molar mass could be increased whilst the styrene incorporation wa comparable to that achieved with the unsubstituted system . In the case of the alkyl substituted system ( r = me , tertBu , cHex ) the styrene incorporation is decreased drastically and molar mass and activity are also strongly effected . the effect of support calcination temperature , an important catalyst synthesis parameter , on the overall performance of the supported catalyst [ silica ES70 - nBuSnCl3 / MAO / (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 ] , polymerizing ethylene without separately feeding the MAO cocatalyst , were studied . the silica wa calcined at <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> ° C for <nUm> h. nBuSnCl3 wa used to functionalize the silica . ethylene wa polymerized using the synthesized catalyst at <nUm> bar ( g ) in hexane for <nUm> h . No reactor fouling wa observed . free - flowing polymer particle with bulk density ( <nUm> - <nUm> g / ml ) and a fairly spherical morphology similar to that of the catalyst particle were obtained . also , the particle size distribution of the polymer resembled that of the catalyst . therefore , the replication phenomenon from catalyst to polymer took place . the narrow PSD span ( 1.41 ) indicates that the resulting polyethylene are suitable for various mixing - intensive polymer application . the MAO cocatalyst - free ethylene polymerization instantaneously formed a polymer film around the catalyst particle , which coated / immobilized the catalyst constituent ; this is how leaching wa in situ prevented which favored heterogeneous catalysis to occur . the catalyst showed fairly stable polymerization kinetics . the catalyst activity , a a function of the silica calcination temperature , varied a follows : <nUm> ° C > <nUm> ° C > <nUm> ° C > <nUm> ° C . this finding ha been explained considering the relevant surface chemistry phenomenon . the calcination temperature did not significantly affect the bulk density and the PDI ( <nUm> ≤ PDI ≤ <nUm> ) of the resulting polyethylene . the low PDI substantiates the retention of single - site catalytic behavior of the experimental supported catalyst . four dinuclear alkylidene-bridged zirconocene complex were synthesized applying hydrozirconation reaction of a,o-dienes with the " schwartz ' reagent " and tested for the polymerization of ethylene . the polyethylene obtained with alkylidene-bridged dinuclear complex showed higher molecular weight mw and polydispersities revealing that more catalytically active specie exist in the polymerization system . silica gel modified by MgO , HLiO , and HNaO , i.e. , O2Si / MgO , O2Si / HLiO , O2Si / HNaO , respectively , were examined a solid support in the ethylene and propylene polymerization reaction using dimethylsilylene-bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( SHIZ ) a the catalyst and i-Bu3Al a the co-catalyst . all three were found to be equally effective for the former reaction , whereas activity wa discrete for the latter reaction , with the order being O2Si / MgO > O2Si / HLiO > O2Si / HNaO . for the O2Si / MgO combination which showed the highest performance , BET and STEM study indicated that Mg wa evenly distributed in the silica gel . acid - base measurement of all three solid indicated that O2Si / MgO had strongly acidic site whereas the other two did not , and in addition , O2Si / HNaO had strongly basic site whereas the remaining two had only weakly basic spot . these result suggested that the presence of weakly nucleophilic anionic site is essential for high reactivity and that strongly acidic site enhance the reactivity . the immobilization of Cp2ZrCl2 wa performed by entrapment within the binary oxide O2Si - O3W using a non-hydrolytic sol - gel route . the catalyst and oxide matrix were characterized by complementary technique ( rutherford backscattering spectrometry , ultraviolet - visible diffuse reflectance and infrared transmission spectroscopy , differential pulse voltammetry , adsorption - desorption of N , and x-ray diffraction ) . the catalyst performance in term of catalytic activity and polymer property wa evaluated by ethylene polymerization . catalyst characterization suggested that the entrapped complex exhibited lower Zr electronic density than the corresponding unsupported metallocene . the polymerization result also revealed that this low Zr electronic density is optimized in term of complex activation with low MAO concentration ( low [ Al / Zr ] ratio ) and reactivity . this fine tuning result in a catalyst system that is active with a low [ Al / Zr ] ratio and that achieves high catalytic activity . the result demonstrate that the entrapping method allows the generation of a catalyst system in which part of the activation process is attributed to the support . In this sense , the support may partially play MAO function by stabilizing the active catalytic specie . catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene , which contain rac-Me 2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( BCl2ISZr ) bound to methylalumoxane - pretreated O2Si support ( O2Si / MAO / BCl2ISZr ) , were studied with respect to leaching of zirconocene and MAO into heptane solution caused by triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) . the latter is found to solubilize surface - bound MAO and zirconocene component , such that the Al content in the solid catalyst is reduced by 15-40 wt % and their Zr content by 50-60 wt % . consequently , ethylene polymerization with such TIBA - containing catalyst system occurs both on the surface of the solid catalyst and in the solution phase . polymerization in solution is favored by high MAO content in the O2Si carrier . polymerization in solution lead to polyethylene ( PE ) product with lower molecular mass than polymerization on the support surface ; this is the main cause of formation of PE with bimodal molecular mass distribution when ethylene is polymerized with O2Si / MAO / BClISZr <nUm> catalyst co-activated by TIBA . it is proposed that the co-activator TIBA interacts with surface - bound MAO to modify MAO in such a manner that it becomes soluble in aliphatic hydrocarbon and capable of solubilizing some active zirconocene component . A new scaffold consisting of a carbocycle and a substituted imidazoline in an orthogonal arrangement wa synthesized a a potential specific inhibitor of glycosidases . the spirobicycloimidazoline , (5R,6R,7R,8R)-8-(hydroxymethyl)-2-phenyl-1,3-diazaspiro[4.4]non-1-ene-6,7-diol , wa synthesized from methyl 2-O-p-methoxybenzyl-3,4-di-O-benzyl-a / b-d-gluco-6-enopyranoside via (1R,2S,3S,4R,5S)-3,4-bis(benzyloxy)-2-(4-methoxybenzyloxy)-5-vinyl-cyclopentanol . the ring contraction of the 6-enopyranoside in the presence of zirconocene equivalent ( ' cp <nUm> Zr ' ) reagent gave exclusively the corresponding cyclopentanol without cleavage of the PMB protecting group . In the course of the study , a new a-mannosidase inhibitor , (1R,2R,3R,5R)-5-amino-3-hydroxymethyl-cyclopentane-1,2-diol , wa also discovered . calcosilicate ( CAS-1 ) wa used for the first time a an effective carrier for simultaneous immobilization of a dual - functional catalytic system consisted of iron - based bis(imino) pyridyl complex ( O ) and zirconocene compound ( C ) to form heterogeneous catalyst precursor ( CAS - <nUm> / O / C ) . the a-olefins formed form O - catalyzed ethylene oligomerization copolymerized in situ with ethylene to linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) under the catalysis of C in CAS - <nUm> / O / C upon addition of cocatalysts a described hereafter . instead of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , triethylaluminum ( TEA ) wa employed to activate the copolymerization reaction with high catalytic activity and smooth kinetic process . experimental result reflected that the selectivity for lower a-olefins wa improved due to the confinement effect of the layered structure of CAS-1 , hence greatly increasing the incorporation rate of a-olefins into LLDPE main chain and the branching degree accordingly during the in situ copolymerization of a-olefins and ethylene . the layered structure of CAS-1 endowed the resultant LLDPE with improved thermal stability in addition to higher molecular weight ( Mn ) . the LLDPE / Al2O3 nanocomposites synthesized by the in situ polymerization with dried - modified methylaluminoxane ( d-MMAO ) / zirconocene catalyst were investigated . first , after vacuum heated the Al2O3 nanofiller , the d-MMAO a the cocatalyst wa impregnated onto it . then , ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization wa carried out with the presence of different amount of d-MMAO / Al2O3 in a <nUm> mL semi-batch stainless steel autoclave reactor . after filtration , the obtained LLDPE nanocomposite wa characterized by mean of scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) / energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy ( EDX ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) . it wa found that the polymerization activity strongly depended on the [Al]dMMAO / [Zr]cat ratio . the addition of Al2O3 nanofiller apparently resulted in increased melting temperature and molecular weight of LLDPE without any change in molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) . the bimodal MCM-41 - supported zirconocene / dMMAO catalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity for ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization compared to the unimodal one . the higher activity can be attributed to lesser support interaction . the copolymer having broader MWD wa obtained with the bimodal support without any significant change in MW and polymer microstructure a seen by 13C NMR . In this present study , the use of silica and zirconia a a support for zirconocene / MAO catalyst for copolymerization of ethylene / 1-olefin ( 1-hexene , 1-octene , and 1-decene ) wa investigated . first , MAO a the cocatalyst wa impregnated onto the support . then , copolymerization of ethylene / 1-olefin wa performed . it wa found that the use of zirconia support showed promising activity compared to those of the silica . increased activity can be attributed to higher amount of [Al]MAO present on the zirconia support coupled with strong interaction between the osupport - alcocatalyst linkage . In addition , the use of zirconia also resulted in higher degree of 1-olefin insertion and decreased Tm of copolymer produced . here , the copolymerization of ethylene / 1-octene with zirconocene / dMMAO catalyst using different pore sized silica - based support wa investigated . it revealed that the large pored silica [ O2Si ( LP ) ] exhibited the highest polymerization activity due to both highest amount of available active site present along with the moderate interaction between dMMAO and the support . the strong interaction between dMMAO and the support a proven by TGA analysis apparently resulted in dramatically decreased polymerization activity for the bimodal pored silica - alumina [ Si-Al ( BP ) ] . the copolymer produced were further characterized by mean of DSC and 13C NMR . although they exhibited the similar triad distribution , the degree of 1-octene insertion wa different . air - stable zirconocene bis(perfluorooctanesulfonate)s [ Cp2Zr(OPf)2 , OPf = C8F17O3S ] showing high lewis acidity and high thermal stability wa prepared by reacting Cp2ZrCl2 with AgOPf , and examined a a catalyst for acylation reaction . it wa found that in the acetylation of various alcohol , phenol , thiols , and amine by equimolar of acetic anhydride , Cp2Zr(OPf)2 exhibit high activity and selectivity to desired product under mild and solvent - free condition . In the acylation of 2-phenylethanol across various acylating reagent , it also show good catalytic efficiency . In a test of ten cycle , Cp2Zr(OPf)2 show little loss of activity . the result afford a general and efficient method for the acylation of alcohol , phenol , thiols , and amine using zirconium bis(perfluorooctanesulfonate) a catalyst . zirconocene bis(perfluorobutanesulfonate) [ Cp2Zr(OSO 2C4F9)2*2H2O ] wa successfully synthesized by treatment of Cp2ZrCl2 with AgC4F9O3S , and wa found to have the nature of air - stability , water tolerance , high thermal stability and strong lewis acidity . this complex showed high catalytic efficiency for the synthesis of a-aminophosphonates via kabachnik - field reaction of aldehyde / ketone , amine and diethyl phosphite under mild and solvent - free condition . furthermore , it can be reused without loss of activity in a test of five cycle . compared with our previously reported complex of Cp2Zr(OSO 2C8F17)2*3H 2O*THF , this complex showed better catalytic activity . the synthesis of Zr-SBA-15 material from zirconocene dichloride a metal precursor ha been investigated . these material can be prepared with a high loading of zirconium while preserving good mesoscopic ordering . Zr-SBA-15 material display acid property which have revealed to confer high catalytic activity in the transesterification of crude palm oil with methanol for biodiesel synthesis , achieving yield to FAME over <nUm> % in a batch reactor under the following reaction condition : <nUm> ° C , <nUm> h , methanol to oil molar ratio <nUm> : <nUm> and using <nUm> wt. % catalyst loading referred to oil . furthermore , Zr-SBA-15 material display excellent stability in palm oil transesterification , being fully regenerated by calcination at <nUm> ° C after at least eight consecutive reaction run . the incorporation of titanium , molybdenum and tungsten a doping metal produce slightly promotion of the acidity of Zr-SBA-15 material , though this is not translated into higher catalytic activity . the efficient catalytic dehydropolymerization of phenylsilane by homogeneous zirconocene bissilanolates ( [ { ( c-C 5H <nUm> ) 7Si 8O 12O } 2Zr(e 5- C 5H <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 1a ) ; [ { ( c-C 5H <nUm> ) 7Si 8O 12O } 2Zr(e 5-C 5H 4Bu ) <nUm> ] ( 1b ) [ { ( c-C 5H <nUm> ) 7Si 7O <nUm> ( OSiMe 3)O 2}Zr(e 5-C 5H <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 4 ) ; [ { ( me 3CO ) 3SiO } 2Zr(e 5-C 5H <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 5 ) ) and chlorosilanolates ( [ { ( c-C 5H <nUm> ) 7Si 8O 12O}ZrCl(e 5-C 5H 4Bu ) <nUm> ] ( 2 ) ; ( [ { ( c-C 5H <nUm> ) 7Si 7O 9O 3}Zr 2Cl(e 5-C 5H <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 3a ) ; [ { ( c-C 5H <nUm> ) 7Si 7O 9O 3}Zr 2Cl(e 5-C 5H 4Bu ) <nUm> ] ( 3b ) ) ha been demonstrated . the presence of at least one silanol ligand in the zirconocene moiety wa found essential for high catalytic performance . solid state structure of complex 1a wa determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . A series of nine zirconocene - siliceous catalyst were prepared by grafting of zirconocene moiety onto silica using three general method : ( a ) reaction of [ ( η 5-C 5H <nUm> ) 2ZrCl <nUm> ] with silica in the presence of NEt <nUm> ; ( b ) reaction of [ ( η 5-C 5H <nUm> ) 2ZrMe <nUm> ] with silica ; ( c ) reaction of solely [ ( η 5-C 5H <nUm> ) 2ZrCl <nUm> ] with silica . supported catalyst were characterized by ICP-MS , FT-IR , TGA and selected example by XPS analysis . those catalyst prepared by method ( a ) and ( b ) were found efficient in the phenylsilane polymerization although a higher Zr / monomer ratio had to be used in comparison with homogeneous analogue . the low concentration of residual silanol group in supported catalyst wa found essential for their high catalytic performance . advantageous reusability of supported catalyst wa demonstrated using OSi <nUm> / cp 2ZrCl <nUm> / NEt 3(5.8) . the catalytic performance wa retained in three consecutive cycle producing polymer with almost identical property . the compelling advantage of synchrotron radiation ( SR ) in charge density study of coordination complex are described and illustrated with a number of recent synchrotron study , ordered according to the atomic number of the metal atom involved ( Cr , Fe , Cu , Zr , Mo , Th ) . the review concludes with two study of the Cu - containing extended solid Cu2O and the high - temperature superconducting phase Ba100Cu150O349Y50 , done with very high energy synchrotron radiation of about <nUm> keV ( ∼ <nUm> Å ) , very much beyond what is available at conventional x-ray source . this review summarises attempt that have been made to quantify and separate steric and electronic factor associated with zirconocene - type catalyst in the olefin polymerisation reaction . the use of cone and solid angle , measurement of molecular space ( coordination gap aperture , obliquity angle and lateral extension angle ) , the taft steric parameter a well a a number of theoretical method ( ab initio hartree fock , QSAR , 3D-QSAR and paired interacting orbitals ) a approach to the quantification of ligand size is discussed . attempt to associate these measure with catalyst activity are reviewed . pentalene bridged zirconocene / methylaluminoxane catalyst are described a useful for the polymerization of ethene , propene , and co-polymerizations with norbornene . they show a high thermostability up to polymerization temperature of <nUm> ° C . polyethylene with molecular mass of <nUm> million g / mol are obtained at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> g / mol at more than <nUm> ° C . the molecular mass distribution varies between <nUm> and <nUm> because of the steric isomer of the pentalene ligand . some of the complex are active for the polymerization of propene . similar to ansa cyclopentadienyl-fluorenyl complex , the tacticity of the produced polypropylene can be changed from syndiotactic to isotactic by substitution of the cyclopentadienyl ring . 6-Dialkylaminofulvenes add a variety of RLi reagent to form (dialkylaminoalkyl)cyclopentadienides [ C <nUm> H <nUm> C r <nUm> r ce : glyph() N r ′ <nUm> ] Li , which exhibit oligomeric chain structure in the solid state . transmetallation yield the corresponding titanocene or zirconocene derivative that often show interesting intramolecular CH activation reaction . phosphide anion addition to 6-alkyl-fulvenes yield the analogous phosphinoalkyl-Cp reagent and subsequently their group <nUm> metallocene complex . deprotonation of 6-dialkylamino-6-alkylfulvenes generates enamino-substituted cp - ligand . their metal complex undergo intramolecular mannich reaction to yield C <nUm> - bridged ansa - metallocene product . treatment of 6-dimethylaminofulvene with ArHLiN reagent lead to amine exchange and open a synthetic route to " CpCN " MX <nUm> " constrained geometry " catalyst . LiNHR addition to some 6-alkylfulvenes represents an alternative entry to this important class of compound . the corresponding " CpCP " MX <nUm> system are derived from the analogous LiPHR addition reaction . many typical reaction of the new fulvene - derived metal complex are presented and discussed . In this account [3]- and [5]cumulene complex of group <nUm> metallocenes that form five - membered metallacycles are described . these complex have a " triple bond " despite their five - membered ring structure , showing that they are regarded a 1-metallacyclopent-3-ynes . the molecular structure show their strained alkyne character . these complex react with transition metal to form alkyne - coordinated bimetallic complex . they also receive electrophilic attack by proton and boranes resulting in M-C bond cleavage . when a [3]cumulene couple with an alkyne on the metal , the reaction produce seven - membered metallacycloalkynes that have a strained structure showing an interaction between the " triple bond " and the metal center . hexapentaenes , [5]cumulenes , form conjugated 1-metallacyclopent-3-ynes . the aryl-substituted [5]cumulene complex wa reduced by alkali metal to give dianionic specie that reacted with proton to give 1-metallacyclopent-3-ene , a cycloalkene , and with iodomethane to give 1-metallacyclopenta-2,3-diene , a cycloallene . the hexapentaene with tert-butyl group reacts with zirconocene to form an e2-p - coordinated complex in the presence of trimethylphosphine , although it gave a 1-metallacyclopent-3-yne in the absence of the phosphine . the former wa transformed into the latter by addition of a phosphine , and vice versa by removing the phosphine , showing a " haptotropic " shift . here , we revealed the effect of particle size of the nanoscale O2Si on catalytic and characteristic property of LLDPE / nano-SiO2 composite synthesized via the in situ polymerization with a zirconocene / MAO catalyst . In the experiment , O2Si ( <nUm> and <nUm> nm ) wa first impregnated with MAO . then , copolymerization of ethylene / 1-hexene wa performed in the presence of nano-SiO2 / MAO to produce LLDPE / nano-SiO2 composite . it wa found that the larger particle exhibited higher polymerization activity due to fewer interaction between O2Si and MAO . the larger particle also rendered higher insertion of 1-hexene leading to decreased melting temperature ( Tm ) . there wa no significant change in the LLDPE molecular structure by mean of 13C NMR . this work describes the influence of the modification of the ClMg 2(THF)2 and Cl2Mg magnesium support with the AlEt2Cl , MAO , AlEt3 , AlMe3 , and AlEt 2Cl alkylaluminium compound on heterogenisation of the bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium(IV) dichloride Cp2ZrCl2 catalyst . it wa found that only the MgCl2(THF)2 support modified with AlEt2Cl gave the heterogeneous catalyst . on the contrary , application of a magnesium carrier modified by AlEt3 , AlMe3 , and MAO compound only result in a homogeneous zirconocene catalyst . the heterogeneous bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium(IV) dichloride catalyst of the composition MgCl2(THF) / (AlEt2Cl)0.34 / (Cp2ZrCl2)0.01 a determined by FTIR , XRD , and AAS analysis wa synthesised and , after activation by MAO , applied for ethylene polymerisation . the catalyst turned out to be stable and more active than those magnesium supported catalyst already known from the literature . the polyethylene produced ha a relatively high molecular weight ( mw > <nUm> g / mol ) , a narrow and monomodal molecular weight distribution ( MWD = <nUm> ) , a bulk density of about <nUm> g / dm3 , and monomodal particle size distribution . application of a ternary al(i - bu)3 / MAO / B(C 6F5)3 activator decreased the amount of MAO needed and increased catalyst activity , but did not change the reaction mechanism . the electrochemical synthesis and characterisation of poly(methyl vinylsilane ) and a series of poly(methyl vinylsilane-co-metallocenes ) network polymer are described in detail . this class of polymer are not accessible through wurtz coupling reaction and are however prepared by electro-reduction of dichloro methyl vinylsilane in a non-aqueous system using aluminum electrode in a single compartment cell . these polymer have been characterised using UV , FTIR , XRD , SEM and NMR spectral technique . cyclic voltammetric study of the above polymer reveal their conducting behavior . these polymer show optical property a explained from the result . polymer of this type are proposed a potential soluble precursor for CSi and metal doped CSi material . unbridged bis-substituted-indenyl zirconocene complex , [ ( 2,4-Me 2Ind)2ZrCl2 , met-1 ; ( 2,4,6-Me 3Ind)2ZrCl2 , met-2 ] , were supported on silica and montmorillonite carrier ( resulting in silica - supported catalyst MS-1 and MS-2 , and montmorillonite - supported catalyst MT-1 ) . ethylene polymerization by homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst showed high activity , affording polyethylene with high molecular weight . the catalytic activity and the molecular weight of the polymer were improved using the heterogeneous system . the activity for the ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization by heterogeneous system were lower than those using homogeneous system , however , the comonomer wa incorporated efficiently into polymer in both the homo- and the heterogeneous system , and moreover , the microstructure of the copolymer derived from the heterogeneous catalyst showed different characteristic from those resulting from the homogeneous system . the rErH value of the heterogeneous catalyst ( <nUm> for MS-1 and <nUm> for MS-2 ) , are quite different from those of their homogeneous analogue ( <nUm> for met-1 and <nUm> for met-2 ) . 4,4'-Bis(methylene)biphenylene bridged homodinuclear titanocene ( 3 ) and zirconocene ( 4 ) have been synthesized by treatment of CpTiCl3 and CpZrCl3 · DME with Na2[C5H4CH2C6H4-p-C6H4CH2C5H4] , respectively , in THF and characterized by 1H NMR and element analysis . after activation with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) , these catalyst were used for the homogeneous polymerization of ethylene . the influence of reaction condition , such a temperature , time , catalyst concentration and molar ratio of MAO / cat . on ethylene polymerization were investigated in detail . the catalytic activity of <nUm> and <nUm> are more than three time higher than that of the phenyldimethylene bridged homodinuclear metallocene of titanocene ( 5 ) and zirconocene ( 6 ) , respectively , and also twice higher than that of Cp2TiCl2 / MAO and Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO , respectively . however , the catalytic activity of <nUm> is nearly half a high a that of <nUm> , which reached <nUm> × <nUm> g PE / mol cat h . the molecular weight of polyethylene increase simultaneously with prolongation of polymerization time . GPC spectrum show that <nUm> and <nUm> produce polyethylene with broad molecular weight distribution ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) . the high melting point of the product ( 131-134 ° C ) indicate that the polyethylene formed is highly linear and highly crystalline . copolymerizations of ethylene with 1,3-butadiene in the presence of catalytic system based on C2 - symmetric zirconocenes rac - ( CH 3)2Si(2-R-4-R'-1-indenyl)2ZrCl <nUm> ( where r = CH3- or H and R' = C6H 5- or H ) are compared . the chemical nature and the relative amount of constitutional comonomer unit from butadiene ( 1,4-trans , methylene-1,2- cyclopentane and methylene-1,2-cyclopropane ) are strongly affected by the bulkiness of the substituent on the indenyl ligand . the unsubstituted indenyl zirconocene system rac-(CH3)2Si(indenyl) 2ZrCl2 / methylalumoxane ( MAO ) insert 1,3-butadiene leading to both cyclopentane and 1,4-trans unit , whereas exclusively cyclopentane constitutional unit are obtained from rac-(CH3)2Si(2- methyl-1-indenyl)2ZrCl2 / MAO . the catalytic system rac-(CH3)2Si(2-methyl-4-phenyl-1-indenyl) 2ZrCl2 / ( MAO ) is able to incorporate about <nUm> % of butadiene unit into polymer chain and to form up to <nUm> % of cyclopropane unit . an unusual insertion mechanism for conjugated diolefins , that involves a butadiene e2 primary coordination and insertion leading to formation of cycloalkane unit , is largely predominant for all used catalytic system . mechanistic study and DFT calculation indicate that the chemoselectivity of the reaction depends on the bulkiness of the substituents on the indenyl ligand of catalyst .

DFT calculation were performed in order to gain further knowledge about the geometry of the complex and their electronic property and therefore explain the difference between their reactivity . attempt to synthesize bent metallocene complex of pyridine-2,6- bis(thiocarboxylate) , Cp2Ti(pdtc) and Cp2Zr(pdtc) yielded partially desulfurized product . In the case of Cp2Ti(IV) two type of product were obtained , in one case desulfurization wa at one of the thiocarboxylate group resulting in a carboxylate group while in the other case it wa partial and from both the thiocarboxylate entity .

A systematic study on organo-layered silicate intermediate used for preparing in situ polyethylene nanocomposites wa performed by pyrolysis - gas chromatography / mass spectrometry and thermogravimetric analysis . the type and composition of the pyrolysis product gave useful information about mechanism of thermal degradation . the combination of pyrolysis and thermal decomposition data allowed u to describe the evolution of the organoclay structure after the reactive pretreatment step with alkylaluminoxane cocatalyst and zirconocene or bis(imino)pyridine iron precatalyst , respectively . A proof of the formation of heterogeneous organoclay - immobilized catalyst wa obtained . unlike reported example of early transition metal e2(N,C)-pyridyl complex , scandium e2(N,C)-pyridyl complex supported by a ferrocene diamide ligand react further with pyridine to give coupling product . although most of their insertion reaction with unsaturated substrate are similar to those of previous yttrocene and zirconocene complex , in the reaction with butadiene , higher reactivity than the one reported for the yttrocene complex wa observed . herein are discussed reaction of e2(N,C)-pyridyl scandium complex supported by a 1,1'-ferrocene diamide ligand with ethylene , 2-butyne , and 1,3-butadiene . zirconocene catalyst wa heterogenized inside an organosilane - modified montmorillonite ( MMT ) pretreated by calcination and acidization , for supported catalyst system with well - spaced a-olefin polymerization active center . the varied pretreatment and modification condition of montmorillonite are efficient for supported zirconocene catalyst in control of polyethylene microstructures , in particular , molecular weight distribution . In contrast to other supported catalyst system , Cp2ZrCl2 / modified montmorillonite(MMT-7) - supported catalyst with a distinct interlayer structure catalyzed ethylene homopolymerization and copolymerization with 1-octene activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , resulting in polymer with a bimodal molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) . silica ( <nUm> m2 g-1 ) wa chemically modified with Cp2ZrCl2 and (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 by grafting . hybrid silica bearing surface indene group wa synthesized by the sol - gel method , followed by metallation with ZrCl4*2THF . the resulting phase were characterized by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) , 13C and 29Si magic angle spin nuclear magnetic resonance , x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy , and diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy . according to RBS measurement , metal content wa 0.2- to 0.3-wt % Zr / O2Si for the grafted system and 4.5-wt % Zr / O2Si for the phase prepared by the sol - gel method . the solid phase were evaluated for the adsorption / preconcentration of lindane and heptachlor epoxide from aqueous solution . for comparative reason , the commercial LC-18 phase wa also evaluated . analyte concentration wa monitored by gas chromatography electron capture detection . for the grafted phase , the coordination sphere around the metal center seems not to influence the adsorption / desorption property of these phase vis-a-vis the studied analytes . In the case of the phase prepared by the sol - gel method , recovery result were comparable to those observed for LC-18 . experiment using OZr <nUm> and O2Zr / O2Si phase led to lower recovery result . silica wa chemically modified with zirconocenes , namely Cp2ZrCl2 , (MeCp)2ZrCl2 , (iBuCp)2ZrCl2 and (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 by grafting . hybrid silica bearing surface indene group wa synthesized by the sol - gel method , followed by metallation with ZrCl4s2THF . according to RBS measurement , metal content wa <nUm> - <nUm> wt % Zr / O2Si for the grafted system and <nUm> wt % Zr / O2Si for the phase prepared by the sol - gel method . the solid phase were evaluated in the adsorption / preconcentration of organochloride ( hexachlorobenzene , lindane , heptachlor , heptachlor epoxide , dieldrin and endrin ) pesticide from aqueous solution . for comparative reason , commercial LC-18 phase wa also evaluated . analyte concentration wa monitored by GC - ECD . for the grafted phase , the coordination sphere around the metal center seems not to influence the adsorption / desorption property of these phase vis-a-vis the studied analytes . recovery result for both analytes were comparable to those observed in the case of LC-18 in the case of the phase prepared by the sol - gel method . experiment using O2Zr and O2Zr / O2Si phase led to lower recovery result . In this present study , the linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) wa synthesized via ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization with the zirconocene / MMAO catalyst by in situ impregnation of different silica ( OSi <nUm> ) support . the OSi <nUm> support used were small - pored ( SP ) and large - pored ( LP ) size with and without Ga modification . it wa found that the SP - OSi <nUm> support exhibited higher polymerization activity ( ~ <nUm> time ) than that obtained from the LP - OSi <nUm> one . this can be attributed to the lower amount of MMAO being present inside the SP - OSi <nUm> support resulting in higher content of MMAO at the external surface . the higher activity in ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization wa also found with the supported catalyst having Ga modification onto both SP - and LP - OSi <nUm> support . the result demonstrated that the introduction of Ga may improve ability of support to immobilize metallocene catalyst . based on 13C NMR measurement , it indicated that all synthesized polymer were typical LLDPE having random distribution of comonomer . ethylene polymerization wa carried out using highly active metallocene catalyst ( cp 2ZrCl <nUm> and cp 2TiCl <nUm> ) in combination with methylalumoxane . Titanium(IV) oxide containing <nUm> % Mn a dopant wa used a nanofillers . the influence of filler concentration , reaction temperature and pressure on the catalytic activity and polymer property wa investigated . there wa a fourfold increase in the activity of zirconocene catalyst by addition of doped - titania . the morphology indicates that the doped - titania nanoparticles have a nucleus effect on the polymerization and caused a homogeneous PE shell around them . the optimum condition for polymerization wa found to be <nUm> ° C . In the present study , the polymerization behavior of ethylene-propylene ( EP ) copolymerization with a zirconocene / MAO catalyst upon the addition of a small amount of diene were investigated . it indicated that besides the addition of dienes , the polymerization behavior were also dependent on the e / P ratio and type of diene . apparently , diene addition resulted in decreased activity , especially at high e / P ratio ( e / P = <nUm> ) . In all case , the addition of <nUm> hexadiene ( <nUm> HD ) resulted in the lowest activity . it seemed that there wa no significant change in the microstructure of EP elastomer upon different e / P ratio . the characteristic of polymer obtained by mean of DSC and 13C NMR were further discussed in more detail . the practical aspect of applying CPMG for acquisition of wideline powder pattern are examined . it is shown that most distortion / modulation of spikelet spectrum can be traced to the incoherent signal averaging from multiple coherence transfer pathway . A strategy for minimizing these distortion / modulation is described . also , a few interesting observation regarding the implementation of the wideline WURST - QCPMG experiment are presented , namely the accumulation of second - order signal phase and the effect of varying the sweep rate and rf field of chirp pulse . the reaction of o-alkenyl substituted zirconocene dichloride complex with two equivalent of n -butyllithium is strongly influenced in the presence of alkene and alkyne . metallacyclic zirconocene complex of novel structure are obtained . the additive alkene and alkyne compete with the o-alkenyl substituents and the intermediate 1-butene for the formation of a metallacyclic structure . the reaction of o-alkenyl substituted zirconocene dichloride complex with two equivalent of ethyllithium and n -hexyllithium give analogous reaction and metallacycles a with n -butyllithium . the synthesis and polymerization behavior of four new asymmetric ansa -metallocenes containing a fluorenyl moiety and a substituted indenyl moiety is reported . the zirconocenes diphenylsilylene-(e 5-9-fluorenyl)-[e5-1-(3-t-butyl)indenyl]- zirconium dichloride ( 4 ) , dimethylsilylene-(e5-9- fluorenyl)-[e5-1-(3-t-butyl)indenyl]-zirconium dichloride ( 5 ) , ethylene-1-(e5-9-fluorenyl)-2-[e5-1- (3-t-butyl)indenyl]-zirconium dichloride ( 6 ) , and diphenylsilylene- (e5-9-fluorenyl)-[e5-1-(2-methyl-4-phenyl) indenyl ] - zirconium dichloride ( 8 ) were all found to be highly active for the polymerization of both ethylene and propylene when activated with excess methylaluminoxane . compound <nUm> wa found to produce highly isotactic polypropylene with an [mmmm] value of <nUm> % . the reaction of phenylalkyl substituted zirconocenedichloride complex with two equivalent of n-butyllithium give metallacyclic zirconocene complex . In this reaction aromatic CH bond can be activated in unbridged and bridged metallocenedichloride complex even if the corresponding phenyl ring contain halogen substituents such a fluorine or chlorine . after the activation with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , all the metallocene complex prove a attractive catalyst for ethylene polymerization reaction . because of their lewis basicity the halogen substituents fluorine or chlorine have a strong influence on the molecular weight of the produced polyethylene . metallocene complex with chloro substituents in the ortho position of the phenyl ring produce bimodal polyethylene . ethylene polymerization study have been carried out with novel precatalysts of the type : [ ( e5-C13 H8)-X(t-BuOC6H12)Me-(e5- C5H4)]ZrCl2 [ x = C [1a] , Si [2a] ] , [ (e5-C13H8)-XMe2- ( e5-(t-BuOC6H12C5 H3 ) ) ] Cl2Zr [ x = C [3a] , Si [4a] ] in the presence of excess methylalumoxane ( MAO ) to compare their catalytic activity and to delineate the effect of the 6-t-butoxyhexyl functionality on ethylene polymerization . the precatalysts [1a] and [2a] with the bridge functionality showed higher activity in ethylene polymerization than the corresponding complex [3a] and [4a] which have it on the cp ring moiety . on the other hand the silyl bridged complex [2a] and [4a] produced a higher molecular weight polyethylene than the carbon - bridged one , regardless of the location of functional group . A novel half - sandwich Zr(IV) complex [ e5:e 1-N-C5(CH3)4 CH2CH2N(CH3)2]ZrCl <nUm> ( 6 ) together with zirconocene dichloride [ e5-C5(CH3)4 C4H10N ] [e5-C5(CH3)5] Cl2Zr ( 4 ) and [ e5-C5 C3H8 N(CH3)2]2ZrCl2 ( 5 ) have been prepared . complex <nUm> ha been isolated and characterized in three different form , namely , a an adduct with THF 6a , an adduct with tetrahydrothiophene 6b , and a solvent - free form 6c . molecular structure of complex <nUm> , 6b , and 6c have been established by x-ray diffraction analysis . complex 6c ha been shown to be a monomeric solvent - free half sandwich Zr(IV) complex . the dynamic behavior of complex 6a in a non-solvating medium ( an equilibrium between 6a and 6c along with a degenerate interconversion of the Zr-Ccp-CH2- CH2-N(CH3)2-(Zr) pseudo-five-member metallacycle ) have been studied by the variable - temperature 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy . the activation parameter for the degenerate five - member cycle interconversion have been elucidated . four series of reaction were explored that are aimed at the development of a functional group chemistry at the sensitive bent metallocenes of the group <nUm> metal . first , we have tested and employed the olefin metathesis reaction . two [ C5H4-(CH2)n-CH = CH2]2ZrCl2 complex ( with n = <nUm> and n = <nUm> ) were treated with the Cl2(PCy3)2 r = CHPh catalyst in dilute solution . intramolecular metathesis took place readily with liberation of ethene to yield the corresponding ansa - metallocene complex [ C5H4- (CH2)n-CH = CH - ( CH2 ) n-C5H4]ZrCl2 that were isolated in ca. <nUm> % ( n = <nUm> , trans-CH = CH- ) or ca. <nUm> % ( n = <nUm> , cis-CH = CH- ) yield . intermolecular olefin metathesis could also be effected using either a first or a second generation grubbs catalyst to metathetically couple a variety of (L)Cl2M(C5H4-CH2 CH = CH2 ) - type titanium or zirconium complex to yield the respective dimetallic product . alkenyl substituents were attached at the ligand stage at the indenyl 2-positions by mean of a nickel - catalyzed cross-coupling reaction . transmetallation eventually gave the bis(2-alkenylindenyl)ZrCl2 complex . photolysis of three example of this type of complex ( with 1-alkenyl substituents being methyl , cyclohexyl , or phenyl ) resulted in a very efficient intramolecular [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition to yield the respective substituted cyclobutylene-bridged ansa -metallocenes . these complex were MAO activated to give very active homogeneous metallocene catalyst for , e.g. , ethene / 1-octene copolymerization . the corresponding (s-trans-butadiene)-ansa-zirconocene complex feature a pronounced C-H / phenylene p-interaction that probably help to stabilize the s-trans-diene complex relative to it s-cis - isomer . deprotonation of 7-dialkylaminofulvenes provides an easy access to enamino-cyclopentadienides . transmetallation under carefully controlled condition gave the respective bis(enamino-C5H4) Cl2Zr complex . their treatment with a catalytic amount of a lewis acid ( Cl4Ti ) or a bronsted - acid ( [HNMe2Ph+][BPh4-] ) led to a rapid intramolecular mannich - type carbon-carbon coupling reaction that gave novel , very rigid C3 - bridged , -NR2 functionalized ansa - metallocene system . the analogous , readily performed mannich - coupling reaction starting from 1,1'-diacetylferrocene and a variety of secondary amine provided an interesting and useful novel entry to [3]ferrocenophane system . catalytic hydrogenation of the unsaturated bridge followed by additional functionalization opened a novel pathway to ferrocenophane - based chelate ligand ( some optically active ) for stereoselective catalytic transformation . eventually , example of direct attack of the electrophilic boranes BC6F5 <nUm> or BC12F10H , respectively , to the cp ring of bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconacyclopentadienes are described , leading to novel type of cp - borylated group <nUm> metallocene complex . the regioselectivity of the coupling reaction of the internal acetylenic derivative Ph2P-C ≡ C-SiMe3 ( 2 ) and the benzyne complex [ Cp2Zr(e2- C3H2 ) ] ( 1 ) resulted preferentially in the formation of the zirconaindene metallacycle with the metal a-carbanions stabilized by the trimethylsilyl group . we have been able to structurally characterize the two regiosomers . the unusual acute Zr-C-P angle and the short Zr-P distance revealed that a significant lewis - base / lewis - acid s-P-Zr interaction occurs in the a-phosphino zirconaindene metallacycle . addition of HCl*Et2O on the cyclic a-silyl zirconindene complex led to competition reaction between ( i ) the nucleophilic attack of the lone pair of the phosphino group followed by P-C cleavage to form Ph2PH and Ph-C ≡ C-SiMe3 ( 7 ) and ( ii ) protonolysis of the Zr - CSi bond to give the z-vinyl silyl phosphino product Ph2PC(Ph) = C(H) SiMe3 ( 8 ) . when the lone electron pair of the phosphino group is engaged intramolecularly with the metal center to achieve the stable 18-electron configuration protonolysis reaction on the Zr-C bond to give the z-vinyl silyl phosphino product Ph2PC(H) = C(Ph)SiMe3 ( 9 ) is the unique process observed . protonolysis reaction on the complex prepared in situ from the addition of <nUm> and zirconocene like reagent " [Cp2Zr] " gave Ph2PH , H-C ≡ C-SiMe3 , and Ph2PC(H) = C(H)SiMe3 ( 18 ) which resulted from the competitive P-C and Zr-C bond cleavage process of the transient alkyne complex Cp2Zr(e2-Ph2 P-C ≡ C-SiMe3 ) ] ( 14 ) . an easy and inexpensive three -

metallocene complex bearing substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ( cp ) and fluorenyl ( flu ) moiety , namely methylene[9-(2,7-di-tert-butyl)fluorenyl ( 2-(1,3-dimethylcyclopentadienyl)]zirconium dichloride ( 1a ) and it analogue , methylene [ ( 9-(2,7-di-tert-butyl)fluorenyl ( 2-(1-methyl-3-phenyl)cyclopentadienyl ) ]zirconium dichloride ( 2a ) , have been prepared from (2,7-di-tert-butyl)-9-prop-2-ynyl-9H-fluorene ( 2 ) . this procedure includes the use of 3-bromo-1-propyne which affords the methylene bridging unit by way of an intermolecular pauson - khand reaction in which norbornadiene and a pendant alkyne cyclize to form a ring that later becomes a substituted cyclopentadienyl group . ethylene-norbornene ( E-N ) copolymerization wa then carried out using these new complex ( 1a and 1b ) in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) a a cocatalyst ; these activity can be compared to that of isopropylene[9-fluorenyl-cyclopentadienyl]zirconium dichloride ( 3a ) . the activity of catalyst 1a wa comparable to that of 3a but much higher than that of 2a . In addition , 1a show higher norbornene insertion performance , and give an E-N copolymer with a higher glass transition temperature ( tg ) than 2a under identical condition ; both 1a and 2a give a lower tg polymer than 3a doe . the (butadiene)zirconocene system is characterized by the occurence of two isomer , (s-cis-)- and ( s-trans-e4-C4H 6-)ZrCp2 . out of this equilibrium , (butadiene)zirconocene ha successfully been employed a a stoichiometric reagent in organic and organometallic synthesis and a a precursor for the generation of active homogeneous ziegler - natta catalyst system . (Butadiene)zirconocene wa the first mono-nuclear metal complex for which the s-trans-e4 - conjugated diene coordination mode wa established . meanwhile a variety of additional example from metal throughout the periodic table wa found . the (butadiene)zirconocenes have found use a valuable reagent in organic and organometallic synthesis , for which various representative example are described . they have also found extensive use a precursor for the generation of very active and sometimes very selective homogeneous metallocene ziegler - natta olefin polymerization catalyst . the employment of the dipolar zirconocene(butadiene) / BC18F15 addition product in mechanistic study ha revealed important aspect of the reaction course taken in the carbon-carbon coupling reaction sequence at this important class of catalyst . several specific example are described in this article . meso- and rac - diastereomers of the Me-Ph-cyclopentadienyl-disubstituted zirconocene and tetramethyldisiloxane - bridged ansa - metallocene dichloride ( m = Zr , Hf ) have been isolated by transmetallation of their lithium salt to MCl4 and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction method . the zirconocene dichloride activated with MAO are active catalyst for ethene and propene polymerization . the non-vicinal methyl-phenyl-substituted zirconocene dichloride meso-and rac-[Zr{e5-(1-Ph-3-Me-C 5H3)}2Cl2 ] and [ zr(e 5-C5H5){e5-(1-Ph-3-Me-C 5H3)}Cl2 ] have been isolated by transmetallation of the lithium salt Li(1-Ph-3-Me-C5H3) to ZrCl4(THF)2 and [ Zr(e5-C5H 5)Cl3 • DME ] ( DME = dimethoxyethane ) , respectively . similar transmetallation of the lithium salt Li2[(Me-Ph-C 5H2SiMe2)2O ] to MCl4 gave the ansa - metallocenes [ M{e5-(Me-Ph-C5H 2SiMe2)2O}Cl2 ] ( m = Zr , Hf ) for which the meso- and rac - diastereomers were separated . the dimethyl and dibenzyl derivative of these metallocenes were also prepared and the structure of all of these compound determined by NMR spectroscopy . the molecular structure of rac-[Zr{e5-(2-Me-4-Ph-C5H2SiMe 2)2O}Cl2 ] wa determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction method . the activity of the dichlorometallocenes / MAO catalyst for ethene and propene polymerization wa evaluated .

A number of related example of this condensation reaction at the intact group <nUm> bent metallocene framework is described , using different amino-substituents and Ti , Zr and Hf system . three example of the unsaturated ansa - metallocene system were characterized by x-ray diffraction . In a few case it wa possible to isolate the open ( enamino-Cp ) 2ZrCl <nUm> complex . In the case of , e.g. , ( piperidinoethenylcyclopentadienyl ) 2ZrCl <nUm> ( 13c ) treatment with a catalytic quantity of the lewis acid ClZr <nUm> or the bronsted acid [PhNMe2H+][BPh4-] resulted in a clean conversion to the respective mannich condensation product , here the ansa - metallocene complex 4c . the strongly electrophilic borane HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> did not catalyze the CC - coupling reaction under the applied reaction condition but added cleanly to the enamino-CC double bond of , e.g. , 13c to yield a cyclic nitrogen donor - stabilized hydroboration product ( 19 ) . deprotonation of di(3-methylindol-2-yl)phenylmethane ( L 2H <nUm> ) or 2-methoxyphenyldi(3-methylindol-2-yl)methane(L2'H2) with two equivalent of nBuLi , followed by reaction with cp 2TiCl <nUm> or cp 2ZrCl <nUm> yielded complex Cp2TiL2(1),Cp2TiL2'(2),Cp2ZrL2(3)andCp2ZrL2'(4) . compound 1-4 were characterized by NMR spectroscopy , and compound <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were further analyzed by x-ray crystallography and elemental analysis . the molecular structure of <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> illustrate that chelating di(3-methylindol-2-yl) methane have a structural relationship to coordinated bis(pyrazolyl)borates . the phenyltrihydroborate complex , cp 2ZrCl{(m-H) 2BHPh } , <nUm> , and cp 2Zr{(m-H) 2BHPh } <nUm> • ( <nUm> / <nUm> toluene ) , <nUm> , were prepared from the reaction of cp 2ZrCl <nUm> with one and two mole of BHLi 3Ph . the Zr-H-B bond in <nUm> are stable under vacuum at <nUm> ° C for hour without significant decomposition . an inductive effect ha been proposed for this strong interaction . this hydrogen bridge bond can be broken upon reacting with the lewis base N(C 2H <nUm> ) <nUm> to produce ( C 2H <nUm> ) <nUm> N • BH 2Ph and the zirconium hydride compound cp 2ZrH{(m-H) 2BHPh } , <nUm> . compound <nUm> also can be prepared from the reaction of cp 2ZrHCl with BHLi 3Ph . the reaction of <nUm> with the lewis acid B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> is solvent dependent , the metathesis product cp 2ZrCl{(m-H) 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> } , <nUm> , wa formed in the toluene solution , whereas the ionic complex [ cp 2ZrCl(OEt 2)][HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , <nUm> , wa isolated from the ether solution . the reaction of titanocene dichloride , cp 2TiCl <nUm> , with BHLi 3Ph produced a 17-electron , paramagnetic complex , cp 2Ti{(m-H) 2BHPh } , <nUm> . single crystal x-ray structure of <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were also determined . A coplanar structure of the four bridge hydrogen in <nUm> wa observed . the meso- and rac - like isomer of bis{e5-(1-benzyl)indenyl} zirconium dichloride ( 5 ) , bis{e5-(1-para-methoxybenzyl)indenyl} zirconium dichloride ( 6 ) , bis{e5-(1-para-fluoro-benzyl)indenyl} zirconium dichloride ( 7 ) and bis{e5-(1-phenylethyl)indenyl} zirconium dichloride ( 8 ) were synthesized and isolated . solid - state structure of meso- and rac - like <nUm> were determined by x-ray structure analysis . polymerization property of the methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) activated diastereomers of complex 5-8 were studied in ethene polymerization under different monomer concentration . the rac - like isomer of 1-phenylethyl-substituted <nUm> / MAO showed significantly higher activity than the 1-benzyl substituted analog 5-7 / MAO . In addition , rac - <nUm> / MAO behaves like a single center catalyst producing polyethene with narrow molar mass distribution ( <nUm> - <nUm> ) , while diastereomers of 5-7 / MAO produce polymer with molar mass distribution varying from <nUm> up to <nUm> . the rac and meso-like isomer of 5-7 / MAO have different response on the monomer concentration . quantum chemical calculation suggest a strong interaction between the benzyl substituent and the electron deficient zirconium center . the phenyl metal coordination energy depend on the electronic property of the para-substituent . In <nUm> / MAO , due to the ethyl spacer , the coordination doe not have a significant role and therefore much higher activity and single center polymerization behavior is observed . the reaction of the ansa - zirconocene meso-[C2H 4(4,7-Me2Indenyl)2]ZrMe2 with BC18F15 afforded , besides the expected ion pair with outward MeB(C6F5)3- anion , also a minor isomer ( molar fraction <nUm> ) with the bulky methylborate anion in the inward site . 2D 1H EXSY experiment revealed exchange between the two isomer , at T > <nUm> K , through the migration of the MeB(C 6F5)3- anion between outward and inward site . the presence of free BC18F15 fastened the exchange , suggesting BC18F15 attack on the zirconium bound methyl ligand of the two ion pair . novel zirconocene complex ( 1-Biph-3,4-Me2Cp ) 2ZrCl2 ( 3 ) , (C5Me5)(1-Biph-3,4- Me2Cp)ZrCl2 ( 4 ) , and (C5H5)(1-Biph- 3,4-Me2Cp)ZrCl2 ( 5 ) containing a 1-biphenyl-3,4- dimethylcyclopentadienyl ligand ( 2 ) have been prepared and their solid state structure were characterized by x-ray diffraction method . the crystal structure of <nUm> revealed a racemic , C2 - symmetric nature in the solid state . In ethylene polymerization , they all afforded high - density polyethylene with very high activity . especially , the catalytic property of <nUm> were most marked in term of both polymerization activity and molecular weight of polyethylene among them . they also showed good activity on the polymerization of propylene , but afforded nearly atactic , amorphous polypropylene with a little higher [mmmm] methyl pentad value by <nUm> and <nUm> than that by the most active <nUm> under the given reaction condition . characteristic of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) polymerization using oscillating zirconocene catalyst , (2-Ph-Ind)2ZrX2 ( x = Cl , <nUm> ; x = me , <nUm> ) , mixture of rac- and meso-zirconocene diastereomers , (SBI)ZrMe2 [ <nUm> , SBI = Me2Si(Ind)2 ] and (EBI)ZrMe2 [ <nUm> , EBI = C2H4(Ind)2 ] , a well a diastereospecific metallocene pair , rac-4 / Cp2ZrMe <nUm> ( 5 ) and rac - <nUm> / CGCTiMe2 [ <nUm> , CGC = me 2Si(Me4C5)(t-BuN) ] , are reported . MMA polymerization using the chloride catalyst precursor <nUm> activated with a large excess of the modified methyl aluminoxane is sluggish , uncontrolled , and produce atactic PMMA . on the other hand , the polymerization by a <nUm> / <nUm> ratio of <nUm> / BC18F15 or <nUm> / Ph3CB(C 6F5)4 is controlled and produce syndiotactic PMMA . mixture of diastereomeric ansa - zirconocenes <nUm> or <nUm> containing various rac / meso ratio , when activated with BC18F15 , yield bimodal PMMA ; this behavior is attributed to the meso-diastereomer that , in it pure form , affords bimodal , syndio-rich atactic PMMA . for MMA polymerization using diastereospecific metallocene pair , rac - <nUm> / <nUm> and rac - <nUm> / <nUm> , the isospecific catalyst site dominates the polymerization event under the condition employed in this study , and the aspecific and syndiospecific site are largely nonproductive , thereby forming only highly isotactic PMMA . (Butadiene)zirconocene is observed to exist a an equilibrium mixture of ( s-cis- ) and (s-trans-e4-C4H6)ZrCl <nUm> isomer . the system add a variety of unsaturated organic reagent to form metallacyclic (allyl)metallocene product . In some case , a second equivalent of a reagent is taken up , which form the basis of a variety of useful template coupling reaction of butadiene at the bent metallocene framework . the lewis acid BC18F15 add to (butadiene)zirconocene and to a great variety of butadiene complex of ansa - metallocenes and related system to give zwitterionic metallocene- butadiene-borate betaine . most of these system are active homogeneous ziegler - natta olefin polymerization catalyst , that do not require additional activation . catalyst activity are often in a similar range to those observed for other catalyst activation procedure used in this chemistry . In the case of the (butadiene)metallocene / BC18F15 system we can often observe the first olefin insertion step . this feature wa utilized to carry out a variety of mechanistic study of the essential carbon-carbon coupling step that take place at such bent metallocene catalyst system . even reaction with the functionalized monomer methylmetacrylate could be followed in this way . some chelate ligand late metal system were also included in these study . however , these system mostly behaved differently , even in case where some structural similarity were observed . benz[f]indenyl zirconium complex have been successfully synthesized and characterized . their catalytic activity were evaluated for the polymerization of ethylene . the complex combined with MAO can be highly active single site catalyst , which display activity comparable with that of the cp 2ZrCl2 / MAO system and provide very high molecular weight polyethylene . the melting point of the polymer indicates the formation of linear polyethylene . treatment of zirconocene dichloride [ e5-C 5(CH3)4CH2CH2N(CH 3)2][e5-C5(CH3) 5]ZrCl2 ( 1 ) with amalgamated magnesium in THF result in cleavage of a C-H bond in one of the methyl group of the CH3N <nUm> fragment yielding [ e5:e2(C,N)-C 5(CH3)4CH2CH2N(CH 3)CH2][e5-C5(CH 3)5]ZrH ( 2 ) . an analogous reduction of [ e5-C5(CH3)4CH 2CH2N(CH3)2]2ZrCl <nUm> ( 4 ) proceeds similarly only in the presence of great excess of C3H9P , otherwise no identifiable product are formed . heterogeneous reaction of the hydride complex <nUm> with ClH4N in THF produce the corresponding chloride complex [ e5 : e2(C,N)-C5(CH3)4CH 2CH2N(CH3)CH2][e5- C5(CH3)5]ZrCl ( 3 ) , with the Zr - CH2 bond retained . the molecular structure of compound <nUm> and <nUm> were established by x-ray diffraction analysis . reaction pathway for the formation of zirconocene phosphinidene complex Cp2Zr(PR3)PR from Cp2ZrCl2 and HLi and LiPRH and it reactivity to 1,2-dichloroethane are explored with density functional theory using model structure that are devoid of substituents . after the initial Cp2Zr(Cl)PH2 is generated with HLiP <nUm> reaction with HLi is likely to eliminate ClH in a single step to give directly the 16-electron complex Cp2ZrPH , which is stabilized by the H3P phosphine ligand . the intermediate formation of a phosphine hydride complex , Cp2Zr(H)PH2 resulting from hydride substitution , is unlikely both on the basis of unfavorable reaction energy and calculated 31P NMR chemical shift that indicate that such a specie can not have been observed experimentally . it is likely that a diphosphine complex , Cp2Zr(PH2)2 , result on using an excess of the lithium phosphide , which on H - transfer give directly the phosphine - stabilized phosphinidene complex . the reactivity of this specie is dominated by the release of it stabilizing phosphine ligand to give a highly reactive 16-electron phosphinidene complex , Cp2ZrPH , which reacts with 1,2-dichloroethane after coordination to one of the chlorine atom in two asynchronous metathesis step to the three - membered phosphirane ring . In this process , Cl2Zr is reformed enabling it recycling to regenerate the phosphinidene complex . this study highlight the special reactivity of the 16-electron Cp2ZrPH and suggests that related complex may be generated similarly , thereby expanding the synthetic potential of these nucleophilic reagent . fluorofluorenes [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octafluoro-9-(pentafluorophenyl)-9H- fluorene ( OFPF ) , 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octafluoro-9-(2,4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-9H- fluorene ( OFTF ) , and 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octafluorofluorene ( OFF ) ] react with sodium hydride or with lithium alkyl to give fluorofluorenyl anion which have been characterized in solution by <nUm> F NMR spectroscopy . OFPF is deprotonated by ethylenediamine , by HMPT and by 1,7-diazo-bicyclo(5,4)-undec-7- ene ( DBU ) , a shown by <nUm> H and <nUm> F NMR spectrometry . the new compound [ rac-ethylene-bis(e <nUm> -4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl ) ] diallylzirconium(IV) ( ZRAL ) , a prepared from [ rac-ethylene- bis(e <nUm> -4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)]dichloridezirconium(IV) and allylmagnesium chloride , undergoes allyl abstraction with OFPF , CPh <nUm> [ B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , and B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> forming zirconium - containing cation , a established by <nUm> H and <nUm> F NMR spectrometry . toluene / pentafluoroanisole solution of the fluorinated anion , in combination with ZRAL , catalyze the polymerization of ethylene , with an activity comparable to that of MAO or CPh <nUm> [ B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , a remarkable increase of activity being observed with the ZRAL / OFPF system . Bis-(1,2-(RMe <nUm> OSi ) <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> complex with r = me-(5a) , iPr-(5b) and tBu-(5c) have been synthesised in good yield and characterised . compound 5a-c are the first synthesised example of multi-siloxy-substituted cyclopentadienyl metallocenes . the siloxy-substituents have a for siloxy substituted metallocenes unique steric arrangement , with one almost in the same plane , and the other nearly perpendicular to the plane of the cyclopentadienyl ligand of the zirconocene . the ethylene / 1-hexene co-polymerisation activity using methylalumoxane a co-activator give low activity , with compound 5c ( <nUm> kg(PE) / g(Zr) / h ) being the most active . methodology is described for the preparation of a rigid C 2-bridged zirconocene catalyst system where the C2 - bridge is embedded in a spirane scaffold . the ligand wa prepared from 3,4-dihydro-2H-fluoren-1(9H)-one . initially , the oxo group wa converted into a spirocyclobutanone function . further conversion to a fulvene wa followed by regio- and stereoselective saturation to provide the ligand cis-2- (cyclopentadienyl)-1',2',3',4'-tetrahydro-9H- spiro[cyclobutane-1,1'-fluorene] . the ligand wa dilithiated and reacted with zirconium tetrachloride to provide the corresponding ( e5- cyclopentadienyl)-spiro[cyclobutane-1,1'-(e5-fluorenyl)] zirconium dichloride complex . the structure of the zirconocene dichloride ha been established by crystal x-ray analysis . the recent finding that the powerfully electrophilic zirconocene equivalent known a " Cp2Zr " is capable of transforming vinyl furanosides and pyranosides into enantiomerically pure , highly functionalized cis-2-vinyl cyclobutanols and cyclopentanols ha been extended in a number of direction . the synthetic potential of this methodology is illustrated by the variety of carbocycles that can be produced , ranging from cyclobutanones , a carbacyclic nucleoside , cyclooctane polyols , and medium - ring carbohydrate mimic . many of the key transformation are evaluated in term of transition state energetics . an improved synthesis of <nUm> and <nUm> is described that allows access to these complex in multigram quantity necessary for catalytic application . the crystal structure of <nUm> and <nUm> are compared and the conformational preference of the ligand , that are important for catalytic application , are discussed . complex <nUm> wa evaluated a a catalyst for carbomagnesation reaction . metallocene alkyl cation for polymerization of olefin posse two active site involved in migratory insertion . site epimerization , with an inversion at the metal atom , is considered to be one of the major cause for break - down of the alternating propagation model , resulting in stereoerrors whenever the two catalytic site have substantially different enantioface selectivity . density functional theory ha been used to determine the intrinsic reaction coordinate that connects the optimized minimum and transition state of inversion in the parent ansa - zirconocene [{H2C(Cp)2}Zr-Pr]+ ( Pr = n-propyl ) . these calculation yield a three - step reaction path for site epimerization . starting from the pyramidal b-agostic complex , an activated rotation around the Zr-Pr bond first produce an a-agostic conformation . continued rotation lead to an equivalent second a-agostic intermediate and then finally to the inverted b-agostic complex . the second step is rate - determining and proceeds through a planar three - coordinate transition state . In the case of [{H2C(Cp)2}Zr-iBu]+ ( iBu = iso-butyl ) , the situation is more complicated , because there are several interconvertible a- , b- and g-agostic intermediate , but the rate - limiting step is again an inversion process connecting two different a-agostic conformers with the alkyl group on opposite enantiosides . for both ansa - zirconocene catalyst , the computed free - energy barrier for epimerization are around 11-12 kcal / mol and almost independent of temperature , while those for insertion increase with temperature due to the entropic cost of association . according to the computational result for the isolated catalyst , insertion remains favored over epimerization for the experimentally relevant temperature range in the n-propyl case , whereas both process are competitive in the iso-butyl case . inclusion of bulk solvent effect by a continuum solvation model doe not affect the result much , while explicit consideration of a coordinating counterion cause larger change . the present model calculation on the role of site epimerization should thus be most relevant for propene polymerization with non-coordinating counterions . the dialkyl complex , [ Zr { r ( H ) C ( e5 - C5 me4 ) ( e5 - C5 H4 ) } R2' ] ( r = pri , R' = me ( 2a ) , CH2Ph ( 3a ) ; r = bun , R' = me ( 2b ) , CH2Ph ( 3b ) ; r = but , R' = me ( 2c ) , CH2Ph ( 3c ) ; r = ph , R' = me ( 2d ) . synthesis of rigid ansa - zirconocene precatalyst system with a C2 - bridge embedded in a spirane scaffold is described . fulvenes were key intermediate in regio- and stereoselective preparation of the appropriate spirane ligand . substitution in the cyclopentadienyl group in the ligand wa effected by fulvene methodology . the zirconocenes were active precatalysts for the polymerisation of propene when activated with MAO . the structure of the parent zirconocene dichloride ha been verified by x-ray crystal analysis . A series of chiral ansa - zirconocene ester enolate complex incorporating C2- or Cs - symmetric ligand , including neutral rac - (EBI)ZrCl[OC(OiPr){double bond , long}CMe2 ] ( 1 ) , rac - (EBI)Zr(OTf)[OC(OiPr){double bond , long}CMe2 ] ( 2 ) , rac - (EBI)Zr(OTf)[OC(OMe){double bond , long}C(Me)CH2C(Me2)C(OiPr){double bond , long}O ] ( 3 ) , [Me2C(Cp)(Flu)]ZrMe[OC(OiPr){double bond , long}CMe2 ] ( 4 ) , and cationic [Me2C(Cp)(Flu)]Zr+(THF)[OC(OiPr){double bond , long}CMe2][MeB(C6F5)3]- ( 5 ) , have been synthesized . within the neutral C2 - ligated zirconocene ester enolate series , the chloride derivative <nUm> is inactive toward any methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) addition , the methyl derivative rac - (EBI)ZrMe[OC(OiPr){double bond , long}CMe2 ] add cleanly only <nUm> equiv. of MMA , and the triflate derivative <nUm> can add either <nUm> equiv. of MMA to form the single - MMA - addition product <nUm> or multiple equivalent of MMA to form P(MMA) . unlike the Cs - ligated methyl cation [Me2C(Cp)(Flu)ZrMe]+ , which is inactive for MMA polymerization under various condition , the Cs - ligated ester enolate cation <nUm> is moderately active for polymerization of MMA and N,N-dimethylacrylamide at ambient temperature ; the resulting P(MMA) ha a high molecular weight of Mn = <nUm> <nUm> Da but a low syndiotacticity of [rr] = <nUm> % , and the polymerization conforms to a chain - end control mechanism . group <nUm> metallocene complex can form adduct or condensation product with a variety of typical biogenic molecule . In this account , example are presented and discussed for the reaction of zirconocene or titanocene complex with suitably protected / deprotected carbohydrate derivative . some methodological development are shown for the attachment of aminoacid or peptide derived functional group at the cp - ring of the group <nUm> bent metallocenes . eventually , the reaction of methylzirconocene- and methyltitanocene cation with a series of short oligopeptides are discussed that lead to the formation of primary kO - adduct followed by O,N,O - chelate complex formation with methane evolution . the dynamic feature of some such system are discussed . A mixture of tertiary alkyl halide and 2-methylene-1,3-dithiane wa treated with butylmagnesium bromide in the presence of a catalytic amount of zirconocene dichloride . the reaction resulted in alkylative dimerization to yield the corresponding vic - bis(dithiane) . the reaction would proceed a follows . A single electron transfer from low - valent zirconocene to alkyl halide would generate the corresponding alkyl radical . the radical add to 2-methylene-1,3-dithiane to afford the corresponding radical stabilized by the two sulfur atom . A couple of the stable radical finally undergo dimerization . the effect that a solvent ha on reaction of Cp2Zr{(m-H)2BHR}2 and Cp2ZrH{(m-H)2BHR} ( r = CH3 , ph ) with BC18F15 ha been studied . from the reaction in benzene the metathesis product Cp2Zr{(m-H)2B(C6F5)2}2 , <nUm> , wa isolated . In the case of diethyl ether , different hydride abstraction product , including [Cp2Zr(OEt2){(m-H)2BHPh}][HB(C6F5)3] , <nUm> , [Cp2Zr(OEt2){(m-H)2BHCH3}][HB(C6F5)3] , <nUm> , [Cp2Zr(OEt2){(m-H)2BH2}][HB(C6F5)3] , <nUm> , and [Cp2Zr(OEt)(OEt2)][HB(C6F5)3] , <nUm> , were isolated depending on the starting zirconocene complex . the diethyl ether molecule of 3-6 are weakly coordinated to Zr and displaced in THF solution . isolation of <nUm> and <nUm> is attributed to their fast precipitation from the reaction mixture , which prevented further reaction from occurring . In addition to the hydride abstraction , a hydride metathesis wa also involved in the formation of <nUm> . time - elapsed 11B NMR study indicate that <nUm> and <nUm> are the intermediate on the pathway to <nUm> and <nUm> . the molecular structure of 2-6 were determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . reaction of alkynyllithium with zirconocene dichloride in the presence of quinone afforded zirconoenediynes in good yield . treatment of the zirconoenediyne with p-chloranil in the presence of ClCu afforded 1,1,4,4-tetraethynyl-1,3-diene in good yield . In the presence of ClCu and / or Pd(PPh3)4 , the zirconoenediynes could be transformed into various enediyne derivative through coupling reaction with electrophiles . the chiral , terpenoid - substituted yttrocene [(e5-neomenthylCp)2Y{o-C6H4CH2NMe2}] ( 1 ) can be prepared via facile arene elimination starting from [Y(o-C6H4CH2NMe2)3] . compound <nUm> retains a C1 - symmetric structure in solution on the NMR time scale , due to tight binding of the amine donor . the (-)-phenylmenthyl-substituted complex [(e5-(-)-phenylmenthylCp)2Y(m-Cl)2Li(OEt2)2] ( 5 ) and [(e5-(-)-phenylmenthylCp)2YN(SiMe3)2] ( 6 ) were prepared via salt metathesis . reaction of Cl3Y with the planar chiral (1-neomenthylindenyl)lithium predominantly produced a single , C2 - symmetric , racemic - like diastereomer . the x-ray crystal structure analysis confirmed that [(e5-(+)-NMInd)2Y(m-Cl)2Li(Et2O)2] ( 7 ) represents the same p-S , p-S metallocene diastereomer and adopts a very similar conformation a observed by erker in his zirconocene complex . complex <nUm> reacts with LiN(SiMe3)2 to form [(e5-(+)-NMInd)2YN(SiMe3)2] ( 8 ) with retention of configuration . complex <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> showed moderate to good catalytic activity in asymmetric hydroamination / cyclizations of aminoalkenes , but enantioselectivities were limited to a maximum of <nUm> % ee for the sterically most hindered catalyst <nUm> . the indenyl complex <nUm> is prone to protolytic loss of an indenyl ligand at low ( ≤ <nUm> % ) catalyst loading , if sterically undemanding aminoalkene substrate are applied . formal [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between the bis-sulfonium zirconocene - ate dimer { A figure is presented } 1a and methylpropiolate , benzaldehyde and carbon disulfide afforded stable zwitterionic phosphonium zirconocene - ate complex 2-4 , respectively , with two orthocondensed five - membered heterocycle . x-ray crystal structure of <nUm> ha been determined . elemental chalcogens ( S , Se , Te ) gave rise also to a new variety of five - coordinate zirconium(IV) complex ( 5-7 ) by a formal [3+1] cycloaddition reaction . In these bicyclic zirconates , sulfur is included in a five - membered ring while the second chalcogen is in a four - membered one . the unimolecular isomerization mechanism from a secondary <nUm> → <nUm> propene unit promoted by the prototype zirconocene system H2SiCp2Zr+(P) ( P = polymeryl chain ) ha been investigated by using density functional theory calculation ( B3LYP ) for both gas and solvent phase . the typical route occurring through b-hydrogen elimination to the metal , olefin rotation around the metal center and olefin reinsertion into the metal hydrogen bond ha been calculated by using QM / MM calculation with the ONIOM model in the presence of the counterion CH3 B(C6 F5)3- and compared to the alternative intramolecular reversible formation of a zirconocene allyl dihydrogen complex . our calculation show that the alternative route remains energetically le accessible , at least for the prototype metallocene system used here . the reaction of the bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)methylzirconium cation ( 1 ) with four imines have been studied in the gas phase by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry . reactivity of the bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)methylzirconium cation is governed by the availability of a labile hydrogen in the corresponding imine . the product observed differ from those that might be expected in analogy with earlier work on ketone , aldehyde and alkene ( e.g. , zirconocene e3-enolate and e3-allyl complex ) : azomethyne / benzylidene specie are found instead of enamine ; however , the general reaction mechanism resembles that proposed for ketone and alkene . an elimination reaction leading to final product wa shown to be preceded by a fast migratory insertion / deinsertion equilibrium for alkyl-substituted imines . such an equilibrium is not possible for aryl-substituted imines due to lack of lability of the aryl group and thus only methane elimination wa observed for these imines . A unique p-conjugative interaction pattern wa experimentally revealed in the doubly acetylide - bridged binuclear group <nUm> metallocene complex , which wa involved in C-C coupling / cleavage reaction of acetylides and s-alkynyl migration . to elucidate how this multi-center bonding network affect the structural and reaction property of these complex , density functional theory ( DFT ) calculation and molecular orbital ( MO ) analysis were carried out on the electronic structure and s-alkynyl migration mechanism of the doubly acetylide - bridged binuclear Zr complex , (L2Zr)2(m-C{triple bond , long}CH)2 ( L = cp , Cl ) . the B3LYP calculation suggested that the doubly [s,p] acetylide - bridged complex C2h-(L2Zr)2(m-C{triple bond , long}CH)2 wa produced by the reaction of L2Zr(C{triple bond , long}CH)2 with L2Zr through a C2v-(L2Zr)2(m-C{triple bond , long}CH)2 intermediate followed by an isomerization process . In particular , the isomerization of c2h- or C2v-(L2Zr)2(m-C{triple bond , long}CH)2 is almost thermoneutral through a low barrier of <nUm> - <nUm> kcal / mol . the MO walsh diagram revealed that the two isomer have a very similar six-center-six-electron bonding network . the coplanar p-conjunctive interaction by the electron donating and back - donating interaction between the metal center and acetylide ligand significantly stabilizes the doubly acetylide - bridged binuclear group <nUm> metallocene complex and the isomerization transition state . the ansa-bis(cyclopentadiene) compound , Me2Si(C5HPh4)(C5H4R) ( r = H ( 2 ) ; but ( 3 ) ) , have been prepared by the reaction of C5HPh4(SiMe2Cl) ( 1 ) with C5H5Na or Li(C5H4But) , respectively , and transformed to the di-lithium derivative , Li2{Me2Si(C5Ph4)(C5H3R)} ( r = H ( 4 ) ; but ( 5 ) ) , by the action of n-butyllithium . the ansa - zirconocene complex , [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Ph4)(e5-C5H3R)}Cl2] ( r = H ( 6 ) ; but ( 7 ) ) , were synthesized from the reaction of Cl4Zr with <nUm> or <nUm> , respectively . compound <nUm> and <nUm> have been tested in the polymerization of ethylene and compared with their methyl-substituted analogue , [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H3R)}Cl2] ( r = H ( 8 ) ; but ( 9 ) ) . whilst <nUm> and <nUm> are catalytically active , the tetraphenyl-substituted complex <nUm> and <nUm> proved to be inactive in the polymerization of ethylene . this phenomenon ha been explained by DFT calculation based on the reaction intermediate in the polymerization process involving <nUm> and <nUm> , which showed that the extraction of a methyl group from the zirconocene complex to form the cationic active specie is endothermic and therefore unfavourable . the reaction of the metallocene dichloride [(e5-C5H5)2MCl2] , m = Ti and Zr , with the 1,4-di-tert-butyl-1,4-diazabuta-1,3-diene radical anion ( lithium complex ) in diethyl ether reveal a reactivity difference within the series , yielding [(C5H5)TiCl{(t-BuNCH)2}] and [(C5H5)2Zr{(t-BuNCH)2}] through the elimination of C5H5Li and / or ClLi , respectively . we report the x-ray crystal structure of these complex , and discus their reactivity pattern and solution fluxional property . from the reaction of super hydride ( LiBEt3H ) with 6-(4-methoxyphenyl) fulvene ( 1a ) , 6-(2-fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl) fulvene ( 1b ) , and 6-(4-N,N-dimethylaminophenyl) fulvene ( 1c ) lithiated cyclopentadienide intermediate ( 2a-c ) were synthesised . these intermediate were then transmetallated to zirconium with Cl4Zr to give benzyl-substituted zirconocenes bis-[(4-methoxybenzyl)cyclopentadienyl] zirconium(IV) dichloride ( 3a ) , bis-[(2-fluoro-4-methoxybenzyl)cyclopentadienyl] zirconium(IV) dichloride ( 3b ) and bis-[(4-N,N-dimethylaminobenzyl)cyclopentadienyl] zirconium(IV) dichloride ( 3c ) . all three zirconocenes were characterised by single crystal x-ray diffraction and preliminary in vitro cell test were performed with the zirconocene derivative on the LLC-PK cell line in order to determine their cytotoxicity . zirconocenes 3b and 3c did not show cytotoxicity up to a concentration of <nUm> mM , while 3a exhibited an C50I value of <nUm> mM against LLC-PK . synthesis of rac / meso-{PhP(3-t-Bu-C5H3)2}Zr{Me3SiN(CH2)3NSiMe3} ( rac-3 / meso-3 ) and rac / meso-{PhP(3-t-Bu-C5H3)2}Zr{PhN(CH2)3NPh} ( rac-4 / meso-4 ) were achieved by metallation of K2[PhP(3-t-Bu-C5H3)2] · <nUm> THF ( 2 ) with Zr{RN(CH2)3NR}Cl2(THF)2 ( where r = SiMe3 or ph , respectively ) using ethereal solvent . these isomeric pair were characterized by 1H , 13C{1H} , and 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy ; rac-3 and rac-4 were also examined via single crystal x-ray crystallography . the structure of rac-3 and rac-4 are notable in the tendency of the cyclopentadienyl ring towards e3 coordination . while isolated sample of rac-3 / meso-3 and rac-4 / meso-4 slowly isomerize in tetrahydrofuran-d8 to equilibrium ratio , the isomerization rate for <nUm> is more than 15-fold greater than that for <nUm> . In addition , equilibrium ratio are rapidly reached when isolated sample of rac-3 / meso-3 and rac-4 / meso-4 are exposed to tetrabutylammonium chloride in tetrahydrofuran-d8 solvent . we propose that a nucleophile ( either chloride or the phosphine interannular linker ) brings about dissociation of one cyclopentadienyl ring , thus promoting the rac / meso isomerization mechanism . new metallocene dichloride [ e5-(1,4-Me2-2,3-Ph2-C5H )2TiCl2 ] ( 2 ) , [ e5-(1,4-Me2-2,3-Ph2-C5H )2ZrCl2 ] ( 3 ) and [ e5-(1,4-Me2-2,3-Ph2-C5H )e5-(C5H5)ZrCl2 ] ( 4 ) were prepared from lithium salt of 1,4-dimethyl-2,3-diphenylcyclopentadiene ( 1 ) and [TiCl3(THF)3] , [ZrCl4] and [e5-(C5H5)ZrCl3(DME)] , respectively . compound 2-4 were characterized by NMR spectroscopy , EI-MS and IR spectroscopy , and the solid state structure of <nUm> wa determined by single crystal x-ray crystallography . the catalytic system <nUm> / MAO and <nUm> / MAO were almost inactive in polymerization of ethylene at 30-50 ° C , however , they exhibited high activity at temperature <nUm> ° C . the catalyst formed from <nUm> and excess of MAO wa practically inactive at all temperature . 2,4,5-Tri(t-butyl)-1,3-diphospholyl sodium salt ( 2a ) and 3,5-di(t-butyl)-1,2,4-triphospholyl sodium salt ( 3a ) react with Cl4Zr and CpZrCl3 to form (e5-2,4,5-tri(t-butyl)-1,3-diphospholyl)ZrCl3 ( 4 ) , Cp(e5-2,4,5-tri(t-butyl)-1,3-diphospholyl)ZrCl2 ( 5 ) , and Cp(e5-3,5-di(t-butyl)-1,2,4-triphospholyl)ZrCl2 ( 6 ) in the complete absence of water , respectively . surprisingly , bent sandwich complex <nUm> exhibit the NMR spectroscopic characteristic of a hindered ring ligand rotation but the cyclopentadienyl ligand of <nUm> rotates freely in the NMR time scale in spite of the superior space demand of it 2,4,5-tri(t-butyl)-1,3-diphospholyl ligand . this contradiction is discussed on the basis of an attractive interligand P-C interaction between homo- and heterocyclic p-ligands , which is stronger for <nUm> . water even in trace amount present in the reaction mixture change the course of the reaction completely . No zirconium p-complexes are accessible this way , but only oligo- or polycyclic organophosphorus compound . compound 3a and Cl4Zr form the asymmetric tricyclic P6(t-BuC)4H2 isomer <nUm> with two p{double bond , long}C double bond a a dimer of 1,2,4-triphosphol . it is accompanied by small amount of ClH addition product <nUm> , where one of the p{double bond , long}C double bond is eliminated . compound <nUm> contains six , and <nUm> eight stereogenic center , but both form one pair of enantiomer each only . A single stereoisomer of P6(t-BuC)4H2 cage <nUm> is formed if (1-trimethylstannyl)-3,5-di(t-butyl)-1,2,4-triphosphol 3b is used a the P3(t-BuC)2 source in combination with Cp*ZrCl3 in the presence of trace amount of water . compound <nUm> is a meso-compound , which is composed by dimerization of either two homochiral unit of (R)-3,5-di(t-butyl)-1,2,4-triphosphol 3cR or by two unit of it s-enantiomer 3cS . No trace of cyclic addition product ha been identified , which would represent the heterochiral combination of enantiomer 3cR + 3cS . P2- and P3 - zirconocene dichloride derivative <nUm> and <nUm> have been tested a ziegler - natta alkene oligomerization catalyst . both are catalytically active with 1-hexene a the substrate , but can not compete with the activity of the phosphorus - free original catalyst Cp2ZrCl2 . zirconocene and titanocene bis(perfluorooctanesulfonate)s were synthesized . In contrast to the corresponding triflates and perchlorate , these compound are air- and water - stable . they were proved to be ionic on the basis of conductivity measurement and x-ray analysis , allowing these complex to be stored for month . the strong lewis acidity of these cationic metallocene specie , which wa proved by ESR study , enabled catalytic glycosylation . the allyl-substituted group <nUm> metal complex [M{(R)CH(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}Cl2] [ m = Ti , r = CH2CH{double bond , long}CH2 , ( 2 ) ; r = CH2C(CH3){double bond , long}CH2 ( 3 ) ; m = Zr , r = CH2CH{double bond , long}CH2 ( 4 ) , r = CH2C(CH3){double bond , long}CH2 ( 5 ) ] have been synthesized by the reaction of allyl ansa - magnesocene derivative and the tetrachloride salt of the corresponding transition metal . the dialkyl complex [ m ( r ) CH ( e5 - C5 me4 ) ( e5 - C5 H4 ) R2' ] [ m = Ti , r = CH2 = C2H3 , R' = me ( 6 ) , R' = CH2Ph ( 7 ) ; r = CH2C(CH3){double bond , long}CH2 , R' = me ( 8 ) , R' = CH2Ph ( 9 ) ; m = Zr , r = CH2CH{double bond , long}CH2 , R' = me ( 10 ) , R' = CH2Ph ( 11 ) ; r = CH2C(CH3){double bond , long}CH2 , R' = me ( 12 ) , R' = CH2Ph ( 13 ) ] have been synthesized by the reaction of the corresponding ansa - metallocene dichloride complex 2-5 and two molar equivalent of the alkyl grignard reagent . compound 2-5 reacted with H under catalytic condition ( wilkinson 's catalyst or Pd / C ) to give the hydrogenation product [M{(R)CH(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}Cl2] [ m = Ti and r = C3H7 ( 14 ) or r = C4H9 ( 15 ) ; m = Zr and r = C3H7 ( 16 ) or r = C4H9 ( 17 ) ] . the reactivity of 2-5 ha also been tested in hydroboration and hydrosilylation reaction . the hydroboration reaction of <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> with 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ( 9-BBN ) yielded the complex [M{(9-BBN)CH2CH(R)CH2CH(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}Cl2] [ m = Ti and r = H ( 18 ) ; m = Zr and r = H ( 19 ) or r = CH3 ( 20 ) ] . the reaction with the silane reagent HSiMe2Cl gave the corresponding [M{ClMe2SiCH2CHRCH2CH(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}Cl2] [ m = Ti and r = H ( 21 ) ; m = Zr and r = H ( 22 ) or r = CH3 ( 23 ) ] . the reaction of <nUm> with t-BuMe2SiOH produced a new complex [Zr{t-BuMe2SiOSi(Me2)CH2CH2CH2CH(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}Cl2] ( 24 ) through the formation of Si-O-Si bond . on the other hand , reactivity study of some zirconocene complex were carried out , with the insertion reaction of phenyl isocyanate ( PhNCO ) into the zirconium-carbon s-bond of [Zr{(n-Bu)CH(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}2Me2] ( 25 ) giving [{(n-Bu)CH(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)]}Zr{Me{k2-O,N-OC(Me)NPh} ] a a mixture of two isomer 26a-b . the reaction of [Zr{(n-Bu)(H)C(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}(CH2Ph)2] ( 27 ) with CO also provided a mixture of two isomer [{(n-Bu)CH(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)]}Zr(CH2Ph){k2-O,C-COCH2Ph} ] 28a-b . the molecular structure of <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction study . reaction of Sn[(N(C6H3iPr2-2,6)(SiMe3)]2 and [{Sn(N(C6H3iPr2-2,6)(SiMe3)(m-Cl)2] with di-n-butyl-dicyclopentadienylzirconium yielded the trimetallic a carbene - like complex {[(N(C6H3iPr2-2,6)(SiMe3)](n-Bu)Sn}2Cp2Zr . the oxidation of {[(N(C6H3iPr2-2,6)(SiMe3)](n-Bu)Sn}2Cp2Zr by oxygen give the five - membered dioxadistannazirconacyclic complex {[(N(C6H3iPr2-2,6)(SiMe3)](n-Bu)Sn}2O2Cp2Zr . new ansa - zirconocene complex with amino ( 8-11 ) and alkoxy ( 12 ) substituents attached to the e5-bonded indenyl fragment have been synthesized by the reaction of Cl4Zr with the appropriate dilithium salt in toluene . In addition to HRMS , NMR spectroscopy , and elemental analysis , all new metallocenes have been characterized by single crystal x-ray analysis . crystallographic analysis showed that heteroatom substituents , especially those in the 3-position on the indenyl ligand , have a substantial effect on the structure of metallocenes leading to an increase in the gap aperture in those complex . slippage of the indenyl fragment toward e3-bonding wa found to correlate with the electron donating ability of the substituent in the 3-position , being larger for amino than alkoxy substituents . based upon the amount of slippage , 3-amino-substituted indenyl complex bear strong resemblance to a fluorenyl complex . the alkenyl substituted fulvene compound , (C5H4){double bond , long}CMe(CH2CH2CH{double bond , long}CMe2 ) ( 1 ) , reacts with one equivalent of LiMe to give the lithium derivative Li{C5H4(CMe2CH2CH 2CH{double bond , long}CMe2 ) } ( 2 ) . the reaction of <nUm> with Me2Si(C5Me4H)Cl gave the ansa - ligand precursor Me2Si(C5Me4H)(C5H <nUm> ( CMe2CH2CH2CH{double bond , long}CMe2 ) ) ( 3 ) , which after the subsequent reaction with <nUm> equivalent of LiBun yielded the dilithium salt Li2{Me2Si(C5Me4) ( C5H3(CMe2CH2CH2CH{double bond , long}CMe2 ) ) } ( 4 ) . the alkenyl-substituted zirconocene complex [ Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4) ( e5-C5H3(CMe2CH2CH 2CH{double bond , long}CMe2))}Cl2 ] ( 5 ) wa synthesized by the equimolar reaction of <nUm> and Cl4Zr . <nUm> wa characterized by spectroscopic method and by single crystal x-ray diffraction study . the zirconocene compound <nUm> ha been tested a a catalyst in the polymerization of ethylene at different temperature and Al : Zr ratio , and also in the co-polymerization of ethylene and 1-octene , observing modest co-monomer incorporation . In addition , the cytotoxic activity of <nUm> wa tested against tumour cell line 8505C anaplastic thyroid cancer , A253 head and neck tumour , A549 lung carcinoma , A2780 ovarian cancer and DLD-1 colon carcinoma . complex <nUm> showed the best cytotoxic activity on A2780 ovarian cancer ( C50I value of <nUm> ± <nUm> mM ) . this represents the highest reported cytotoxic activity of a zirconocene complex on A2780 ovarian cancer . In addition , the cytotoxic activity of <nUm> , have been compared with those obtained using cisplatin . In the literature most of the dehydrogenation reaction of alkane are described a CH activation reaction of cyclooctane . the best result of CH activation reaction have been found for the reaction of MAO activated metallocene complex and cyclooctane at temperature over <nUm> ° C . the application of ansa amido functionalized half sandwich compound of the type Ind'Si(Me)2NtBuMCl2 ( ind' = monosubstituted indenyl ) ; m = Ti , Zr , Hf ) for CH and CC activation reaction is completely unknown in the literature . In contrast to the dehydrogenation reaction of cyclooctane and the metallocene complex of the group <nUm> metal , where the zirconocene complex give higher TONs than the titanocene complex the ansa amido functionalized titanium complex give more than two time higher TONs than the corresponding Zr or Hf complex . the ansa amido functionalized ligand increase the TONs for the Ti complex and decrease the TONs of the Zr complex . In contrast to the metallocene complex , the ansa amido functionalized dichloride complex of Ti show also a higher activity than the corresponding Zr complex . it is known that the photolysis of organometallic titanium , zirconium and hafnium ( IV ) compound can give M(III) radical . the formation of the active Ti metal centre is easier than in the case of the corresponding Zr and Hf metal compound .

cp t-bu 2ZrMe <nUm> , <nUm> ; cp n-bu 2ZrMe <nUm> , <nUm> ; ind 2ZrMe <nUm> , <nUm> ; cp me4 2ZrMe <nUm> , <nUm> ; cp 2ZrMe <nUm> , <nUm> ] with [ HNMe 2Ph][B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] wa investigated by mean of NMR spectroscopy . it wa found that protonolysis of a Zr-Me group occurred generating a coordinative vacancy at the metal center and methane . cation coming from 1-4 dimethyl precursor bound NMe 2Ph , liberated from the protonation process , and formed zirconaaziridinium ion pair { [ me 2Si(Cp) 2Zr(e 2-CH 2NMePh)][B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , <nUm> ;

In addition , it solubility wa higher than that of our previously reported uninuclear zirconocene bis(perfluorooctanesulfonate) . it showed high catalytic efficiency in the friedel - craft acylation of alkyl aryl ether and the mannich reaction and could be reused . two different supported zirconocene , that is , bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 , catalyst were synthesized . each catalyst wa used to prepare one ethylene homopolymer and one ethylene-1-hexene copolymer . catalyst active center multiplicity and polymer crystallization kinetics were modeled . five separate active center type were predicted , which matched the successive self - nucleation and annealing ( SSA ) peak temperature . the predicted crystallinity well matched the differential scanning calorimetric ( DSC ) value for a single avrami - erofeev index , which ranged between <nUm> and <nUm> for the polymer experimented . the estimated apparent crystallization activation energy ea did not vary with cooling rate , relative crystallinity α , and crystallization time or temperature . therefore , the concept of variable / instantaneous activation energy wa not found to hold . ea linearly increased with the weight average lamellar thickness lwav DSC - GT ; and for each homopolymer , it exceeded that of the corresponding copolymer . higher ea , hence slower crystallization , wa identified a a pre-requisite to attain higher crystallinity . crystallization parameter were correlated to polymer backbone parameter , which are influenced by catalyst active center multiplicity . the silica - supported MAO wa in situ- and ex situ immobilized with zirconocene catalyst to produce ethylene copolymer . the in situ catalytic system exhibited higher activity compared with the ex situ one . the ethylene / 1-hexene ( EH ) copolymerization showed the highest activity for both catalytic system . 13C NMR revealed that the copolymer produced in all system were random copolymer . In addition , the in situ system resulted in narrow molar mass distribution ( MMD ) for all copolymer indicating a uniform catalytic site present . the present study revealed the effect of different O2Ti nanoparticles employed on catalytic and characteristic property of LLDPE / O2Ti nanocomposites synthesized by the in situ polymerization with zirconocene / dMMAO catalyst . it wa found that the presence of rutile phase in titania apparently resulted in decreased activity due to low intrinsic activity of active site being present . based on 13C NMR result , all LLDPE / O2Ti sample exhibited the random copolymer having different degree of 1-hexene insertion . the highly dispersion of titania can enhance the degree of 1-hexene insertion resulting in decreased crystallinity . In the present study , the nanoSiO2 and nanoZrO2 were used a the filler for linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) nanocomposites . In fact , the LLDPE nanocomposites were synthesized via the in situ polymerization of ethylene / 1-octene with a zirconocene / MAO catalyst in the presence of the filler . the LLDPE - nanocomposites were further characterized by mean of TEM , DSC , 13C NMR and XPS . it wa found that productivity increased more when the nanoZrO2 filler wa applied . the similar distribution for both filler wa observed by TEM . based on the 13C NMR result , it appeared that the LLDPE nanocomposites obtained from both filler were random copolymer . In particular , the resulted binding energy and elemental concentration at surface obtained from XPS measurement were further discussed in more detail . the controlled radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate initiated by the ferrocene - zirconocene dichloride-benzoyl peroxide system wa found to occur a a living radical process with an increased concentration of sindio-triads in the resulting poly(methyl methacrylate ) . comparative theoretical analysis of optimized geometry and electronic structure of Cp2ZrCl2 / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) system and it interaction with a third component wa performed . the additive studied wa a lewis acid compound : AlCl3 . density functional theory ( DFT ) , that included exchange and correlation effect , wa employed with gaussian basis set . additive enhances the cocatalyst lewis acid character and , indirectly , it modifies the electrophilicity of Zr atom . by comparing the geometrical structure and charge distribution of the site with and without AlCl3 it is possible to understand the reason of polymerization performance improvement . previous experimental result for these system have showed a notable increase in ethylene and propylene polymerization activity . In this paper , an electrochemical study of the metallocene / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and metallocene / trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) specie is presented . the metallocenes used were [ (CH3)2Si(Cp) 2ZrCl2 ] and [(Cp)2ZrCl2] . the evaluation of the metallocene / MAO and metallocene / TMA system wa based on the analysis of the redox potential of the solution with different Al / Zr molar ratio using acetonitrile a solvent . the result obtained for Al / Zr ratio lower than <nUm> , suggested that in presence of TMA or MAO , the formed monomethylated specie are [(L)ZrIV(CH3)Cl] , L = cyclopentadienyl (Cp)2 or (CH3)2Si(Cp) <nUm> . for Al / Zr molar ratio higher than <nUm> , the result obtained in TMA presence are in agreement with the formation of the specie [ (L)Zr IV(CH3)(m-CH3)Al(CH3) 2]+ , while in MAO presence the ionic pair , [ (L)Zr IVCH3]+[MAOCl]- , is formed . there 's a general agreement that these are active specie in olefin polymerization . functionalized metallocene precursor ( BrMe2SiC 5H4)CpZrBr2 ( 1 ) , ( BrMe2SiC 5H4)2ZrBr2 , ( 2 ) ( Br 2MeSiC5H4)2ZrBr2 ( 3 ) , and [1,3-(BrMe2Si)2C5H3] 2ZrBr2 ( 4 ) were immobilized on partially dehydroxylated silica ( PDS ) and screened for ethylene polymerization in slurry reaction conducted in toluene using methylalumoxane ( MAO ) a the cocatalyst . the effect of metallocene precursor structure , catalyst immobilization method , and catalyst loading are presented in term of catalytic activity , polymer molecular weight distribution , and stability of the catalyst toward leaching . the catalytic cyclo-oligomerization of ethene by metallocene complex Cp2ZrCl2 with Et3Al a cocatalyst in the presence of Mg - containing third - component is described . under optimal condition ( Cp2ZrCl2 / Et3Al / Et2Mg = <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> , <nUm> ° C , C2H4P = <nUm> MPa ) the reaction afforded <nUm> % of cyclic oligomers , including exo-methylenecyclopentane ( <nUm> % ) and a small amount of methylcyclopentane ( <nUm> % ) , 1-methyl-1-ethylcyclopentane ( <nUm> % ) and vinylcyclohexane ( <nUm> % ) , along with usual open - chain alkene . when the p-ligand wa changed to e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl and indenyl ( ind ) or Cp2TiCI2 wa used in place of cp 2ZrCl2 , the selectivity of exo-methylenecyclopentane dropped dramatically to 1-8 % . In contrast , the catalytic reaction by post-metallocene complex L2ZrCl2 ( L2 = salen , salphen ) under identical condition generated open - chain alkene exclusively . A zirconacyclopentane mechanism is proposed to explain the product formed in cyclo-oligomerization of ethene . this work present a 23-1 factorial planning designed to evaluate the effect of some parameter of the metallocene immobilization route in the ethylene polymerization . the highest ethylene polymerization activity wa observed for the catalyst synthesized using TMA a modifier agent , in the inverse addition order , and impregnation temperature of <nUm> ° C . these result indicated that the immobilization route played an important role on the catalyst performance . UV - vi DRS result suggested the formation of MAO - like specie on the silica surface . these specie may be formed from the reaction of TMA either with water adsorbed on the support or OH group of the silica surface . DSC analysis indicated that the crystallinity of these polymer varied a a function of the catalytic activity , the more active catalyst producing polymer with higher crystallinity . the obtained polymer presented melting point around <nUm> ° C , typical of commercial polyethylene . this work present the result of homopolymerization of ethylene using an hybrid system (nBuCp)2ZrCl2-Cp2ZrCl <nUm> , supported on silica . the catalytic system were analyzed by RBS , DRIFTS and EXAFS and polyethylene ( PE ) by GPC and DSC . the catalytic activity and the polymer property showed dependence on the different ratio used (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 / Cp2ZrCl2 at the preparation step . theoretical study permit u to conclude that the metallocenes interact with the surface in different way . depending on the addition order and the molar ratio between both metallocenes , distribution and nature of active specie would be different . possibility of binuclear active site with different propagation and termination constant is analyzed and discussed . EHMO calculation allow u to conclude that Cp2ZrCl <nUm> ha a strong affinity by AIS plane , whereas ( nBuCp ) 2ZrCl2 show similar affinity for both silica plane . the influence of the concentration of CPh3+B(C 6F5)4- a the activator for metallocene polymerisation catalyst ha been quantified . whereas typically a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio of activator and metallocene dialkyl is employed , in line with the expected stoichiometry of alkyl abstraction , significant increase in the productivity of some - but not all - propene polymerisation catalyst have been found . the effect is particularly marked for catalyst with more open structure , such a the constrained - geometry complex ( C5Me 4SiMe2NBut)TiCl2 , where the activity could be increased by about an order of magnitude . most catalyst show an optimum CPh3+ / Zr ratio , beyond which further increase of [CPh3+] ha no effect . while some zirconocenes reach activity of up to <nUm> × <nUm> g PP ( mol zr)-1 [ C 3H6]-1 h-1 ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> bar ) , other , typically le active zirconocenes do not show a trityl response at all . possible reason for this effect are discussed . homoleptic and mixed a-zirconium phosphonates ( ZrPs ) a-Zr(O3PR)2 ( r = me , bun , bui , hex , oct and ph ) and a-Zr(O3PR1) 2-x(O3PR2)x were readily prepared in high yield from zirconyl choride and the corresponding phosphonic acid in suitable solvent mixture under hydrothermal condition at low fluoride concentration . they form crystalline aggregate consisting of platelet from ca. 10-20 monolayers thickness , with well - defined surface structure . impregnation with Cp2ZrCl2 by sublimation or slurry method provided the first example of PZr - supported alkene polymerization catalyst . crystal morphology and interlayer spacing are unaffected by the impregnation process . solid - state NMR spectroscopy provides evidence for the integrity of the adsorbed metallocene structure . covalent attachment of Cp*ZrCl3 to functionalized ZrPs of the type a-Zr(O 3PR1)1.8(O3PCnH 2nOH)0.2 is similarly possible . the new catalyst polymerize ethene with good to excellent activity under mild condition , even at remarkably low methylalumoxane / zirconocene ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> . the polymer is obtained a free - flowing particle , which reflect the morphology of the catalyst support . the reactivity of Cp2ZrCl2 towards partially dehydroxylated silica wa evaluated and the effect of chemical modification of this silica were studied . different modified silica were prepared by reaction of the original partially dehydroxylated silica with silicon ether , EtOSiMe3 and (Me3Si)2O , or a silazane , ( me 3Si)2NH . the resulting material were activated with MAO and the catalytic system were evaluated in ethylene polymerization . the different reaction were monitored by FT-IR spectroscopy . the catalyst were characterized by elemental analysis a well a by infrared and UV - vi spectroscopy . grafting of organosilanes occurs by reaction with reactive siloxane bridge . the new SiR3 group formed on the surface react with Cp2ZrCl2 to form volatile ClSiMe3 and oxo zirconium specie . these latter specie are active , after the addition of MAO , in ethylene polymerization . the effect caused by changing the nature of the modifier in the grafting reaction with the metallocene , a well a the catalytic activity of the resulting material , are presented and discussed . IR spectroscopy ha been used to study the interaction of silica with PhNEt <nUm> ( N ) and B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ( B ) and subsequent interaction of the support OSi <nUm> / [ N + B ] with dimethylzirconocene me 2Si(2-Me-Ind) 2ZrMe <nUm> ( " Zr " ) . the data were obtained on the composition of the surface compound appeared at both stage of catalyst synthesis . it ha been shown that ( B ) and ( N ) interact with OH group of silica to form ionic pair [ HNR <nUm> ] +[(C 6F <nUm> ) 3BOSi ] - ( IP-1 ) . cation fragment of this pair contains highly reactive NH bond with a.b. at <nUm> cm <nUm> . it ha been found that NH group in a part of IP-1 complex react with neighboring OH group of silica by hydrogen bonding that give complex IP-2 . it ha been shown that " Zr " complex interact both with complex IP-1 and IP-2 . As " Zr " reacts with IP-1 , zirconium ionic complex IP-3 containing ZrMe bond are formed on silica . these complex are suggested to be the precursor of the polymerization active site . the reaction of " Zr " with IP-2 , most likely , produce surface zirconium compound containing no ZrMe bond and inactive for propylene polymerization . IR spectroscopy ha been used to study the interaction of silica with PhNEt <nUm> ( N ) and B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ( B ) and subsequent interaction of the support OSi <nUm> / [ N + B ] with dimethylzirconocene me 2Si(2-Me-Ind) 2ZrMe <nUm> ( RL 2ZrMe <nUm> ) . the data were obtained on the composition of the surface compound appeared at both stage of catalyst synthesis . the catalytic property of ( r XPh ) 2C(Cp)(Flu)MCl <nUm> complex ( r x = Cl , F or CF <nUm> ; m = Zr or Hf ) in propylene polymerization were studied . the result showed dependence of stereospecificity and polymerization activity on the substituent on phenyl group . when r x is CF <nUm> , the activity is <nUm> time of that of the complex with no substituent at <nUm> atm propylene pressure and is extremely high at <nUm> MPa propylene pressure . the CF <nUm> group increased the regioirregular insertion during polymerization to produce partially crystalline s-PP . when r x is halogen , the obtained polymer ha higher melting point than that obtained from the complex with no substituent . the meso ansa zirconocene with dimethylsilyl bridge , activated by methylalumoxane , catalysis the ethylene polymerization , producing ethyl-branched polyethylene . with respect to the polymer obtained with the previously investigated meso zirconocenes , we have found higher branching amount and lower molecular weight . the rapid b-H transfer from the growing chain to the coordinated monomer could account for both these feature of the polymer . the investigation on the structural parameter of the complex , through x-ray diffraction analysis , and on the electrophilicity of the cationic center , through NMR experiment , suggests , a a possible rationalization of this behavior , the obstruction in the inward site . silica-poly[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate-co-4-vinylpyridine ] inorganic - organic hybrid ( SMV ) ha been synthesized , and by loading zirconocene catalyst on the carrier , novel zirconocene supported catalyst ha been made and tested for ethylene polymerization . the silica monomer ( SM ) is prepared by coupling reaction of hydroxyl group of silica surface with 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate ( MPS ) and then , SMV is synthesized by copolymerization of SM with 4-vinylpyridine . the formation of SM and SMV ha been confirmed by FTIR , solid - state 13C NMR , XPS , and elemental analysis ( EA ) . loading Cp2ZrCl2 on SMV resulted in the zirconocene supported catalyst . ethylene polymerization data demonstrate that the SMV supported catalyst ha higher activity than the SM supported one and yield polyethylene with much higher molecular weight than that produced by the corresponding homogeneous zirconocene catalyst . UV / vi in diffusion reflection mode ( DRS ) and DRIFT spectroscopy have been used to study the surface zirconocene specie formed at the interaction of Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 and Me2Si(Ind) 2ZrMe2 complex with the MAO / O2Si support . effect of additional activation of these catalyst with TIBA ha been studied a well . structure of type [Me2Si(Ind)2ZrMe] +[MeMAO]- ( C ) is formed at the reaction of me 2Si(Ind)2ZrMe2 complex with MAO / O2Si ( a.b. at <nUm> nm in UV / vi spectrum ) . interaction of this complex with TIBA result in the formation of new structure ( d ) with a.b. at <nUm> nm in UV / vi spectrum . the surface specie of different composition and structure are formed at interaction of Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 complex with MAO / O2Si . the ratio between these specie depends on the zirconium content in the Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO / OSi <nUm> catalyst . according to the DRIFTS data ( CO and ethylene adsorption ) and ethylene polymerization data these catalyst contain active ZrMe bond but activity of these catalyst at ethylene polymerization is low . interaction of Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO / OSi <nUm> with TIBA lead to the formation of the new cationic structure of type ( d ) with a.b. at <nUm> nm in UV / vi spectrum and great increasing of activity at ethylene polymerization . under atmospheric pressure , nano-polyethylene fibre were prepared via in situ ethylene extrusion polymerization , with MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) catalytic system , respectively . the effect of the geometrical structure and surface property of MCM-41 and SBA-15 on the morphology of the resultant polyethylene , catalytic activity and polymerization rate were investigated and compared in various polymerization condition . the possible formation mechanism of nano-polyethylene fibre with MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported Cp2ZrCl2 a catalyst wa discussed . In the presence of hydrogen and of (R,R)-ethylenebis tetrahydroindenyl zirconium dichloride activated by methylalumoxane , the styrene can be fully converted into low molecular weight compound . the kinetic picture of the hydrooligomers formation is made complicated by the irregular regiochemistry of the styrene insertion . however the study on the effect of the feed composition on the product composition allows inferring mechanistic hypothesis and optimizing the formation of the chiral product , (R)-1,3-diphenylbutane . the subsequent functionalization of this molecule , without loss of chirality , discloses the potentiality of such kind of catalytic system for the synthesis of optically active synthones . the new ansa - complex (R-Ph)2C(Cp)(Ind)MCl2 ( r = CF3 , F , Cl ; m = Ti , Zr or Hf ) were synthesized from the reaction of dilithium salt of the corresponding ligand with appropriate group <nUm> metal halide . they were tested for ethylene homopolymerization and copolymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) at various ethylene pressure and temperature . In the case of zirconocenes , complex <nUm> ( r = CF3 ) and <nUm> ( r = Cl ) demonstrated much higher catalytic activity than complex <nUm> ( Ph2C(Cp)(Ind)ZrCl2 ) and <nUm> ( r = F ) in ethylene polymerization . the same trend wa observed in titanocenes and hafnocenes . the electronic and geometric effect of substituents at the phenyl group on the polymerization activity were easily noticed . for the ethylene / 1-hexene or 1-octene copolymerization , <nUm> also showed the highest catalytic activity , and the copolymer from complex <nUm> possessed the highest 1-hexene and 1-octene content . the reactivity of the silyl ether - substituted zirconocene [ Zr{e5-C5H4(CH2) 3OSiMe3}(e5-C5H5) Cl ] ( 1 ) towards dehydroxylated silica wa evaluated and comparative study with respect to the unmodified analogue [ Zr(e5-C5H5)2Cl <nUm> ] ( 2 ) were performed . the different reaction were monitored by FT-IR spectroscopy . the resulting material were activated with MAO and the catalytic system were evaluated in ethylene polymerization . the catalyst were characterized by elemental analysis a well a by FT-IR and UV - vi spectroscopy . In addition to the classical reaction between zr{single bond}Cl bond and acidic silanol surface group , grafting of complex <nUm> occurs to some extent by reaction between the silyl ether group and reactive siloxane bridge on the silica surface . In contrast , complex <nUm> , a one would expect , only reacts through the zr{single bond}Cl group . supporting zirconocene <nUm> on MAO - modified silica give rise to a more efficient catalyst . the effect caused by these different grafting reaction , a well a the catalytic activity of the resulting material , are presented and discussed . mixture consisting of zirconocene difluorides C p'2 Zr F ( cp' = substituted or nonsubstituted e5-cyclopentadienyl ) a pre-catalysts and diisobutylaluminumhydride i-Bu2AlH a activator were found to be active catalyst in the room - temperature hydrodefluorination ( HDF ) of fluorinated pyridine . evaluation of these system established rac - (ebthi)ZrF2 ( 1 ) and Cp2ZrF2 ( 3 ) together with i-Bu2AlH a active catalyst in the room - temperature hydrodefluorination ( HDF ) of pentafluoro-pyridine . the active specie for the conversion were the actually formed hydride [rac-(ebthi)ZrH(m-H)]2 ( 2 ) and [Cp2ZrH(m-H)]2 ( 4 ) . the result we obtained ( rt , <nUm> h , turn over number <nUm> ) showed a significantly better performance compared to other investigation published before for this HDF reaction . the ansa - indene compound {1-Me2Si(3-C9H6Et)2} ( 1 ) wa prepared by alkylation of the unsubstituted ansa - indene . this compound wa converted , by reaction with nBuLi , to the dilithium compound [Li2{1-Me2Si(3-C9H5Et)2}] ( 2 ) . ansa - zirconocene [Zr{1-Me2Si(3-e5-C9H5Et)2}Cl2] ( 3 ) wa prepared by the reaction of Cl4Zr with <nUm> in ether / toluene at <nUm> ° C . the molecular structure of meso-3 wa determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction study . the ansa - zirconocene <nUm> exhibit a greater activity in ethylene polymerization than reference complex such a [Zr{1-Me2Si(e5-C9H6)2}Cl2] and [Zr{1-C2H4(e5-C9H5)2}Cl2] and , in addition , it maintained a reasonable level of activity after <nUm> h of contact with MAO solution . furthermore , the different elementary step in the activation process of ethylene polymerization for substituted complex [Zr{1-Me2Si(3-e5-C9H5R)2}Cl2] ( r = et <nUm> , me <nUm> , nPr <nUm> and nBu <nUm> ) by commercial methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) have been studied by UV - vi spectroscopy . addition of MAO in large excess ( [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> ) at <nUm> ° C yield a previously unreported intermediate in the activation process of metallocenes ; this intermediate ha an absorption band centered at λ = <nUm> nm . we report here the influence of the type of catalyst , ring substitution , type of cocatalyst and addition of THF on the activation process of these metallocenes . heterogeneous zirconocene catalyst were prepared with an unconventional method by grafting mesoporous silica SBA-15 fiber with Cl4Zr in gas or liquid phase and subsequently with lithium salt of cyclopentadiene ( cp ) or indene ( ind ) . In order to obtain a better understanding of the bonding mode of the zirconium and the ligand , the ZrClx / O2Si and ZrClxL / O2Si were now for the first time characterized by several technique , including elemental analysis , FTIR spectroscopy , 1H MAS NMR and 13C CP MAS NMR . the result verify the e5-bonding of the ligand to the metal center , which in turn wa discovered to be both mono- and bifunctionally bonded to the silica . the catalyst were tested in ethylene polymerization , in which they yielded polyethylene with moderate activity . the group <nUm> ansa - metallocene complex with chiral substituent bearing cyclopentadienyl ligand , [ M{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e 5-C5H3{CHRR'})}Cl2 ] ( r = pri , R' = me ( 9 ) ; r = pri , R' = ph ( 10 ) ; r = but , R' = me ( 11 ) ; r = but , R' = ph ( 12 ) ; m = Zr ( a ) , Hf ( b ) ) , were synthesized by the reaction of the dilithium compound , Li2{Me2Si(C5Me4)(C5 H3{CHRR'} ) } ( r = pri , R' = me ( 5 ) ; r = pri , R' = ph ( 6 ) ; r = but , R' = me ( 7 ) ; r = but , R' = ph ( 8 ) ) , with the tetrachloride salt of the transition metal . the molecular structure of 11a and 12a have been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction study . the catalytic behaviour of 9-12 in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene ha been studied . isotactic polypropylene with [mmmm] pentad of the order of <nUm> % were obtained with the C1 symmetric ansa - zirconocene catalyst . the lithium derivative of the chiral substituent bearing cyclopentadienyl ligand , Li{C5H4(CHRR')} ( r = pri , R' = me ( 1 ) ; r = pri , R' = ph ( 2 ) ; r = but , R' = me ( 3 ) ; r = but , R' = ph ( 4 ) ) , were prepared via the reaction of alkyllithium compound with the corresponding fulvene reagent . the mixed cyclopentadienyl zirconocene complex [Zr(e5-C5H5)(e5-C5H4{CHRR'})Cl2] ( r = pri , R' = me ( 5 ) ; r = pri , R' = ph ( 6 ) ; r = but , R' = me ( 7 ) ; r = but , R' = ph ( 8 ) ) were prepared via the reaction of the lithium precursor 1-4 with [Zr(e5-C5H5)Cl3] . the symmetrical zirconocene complex , [Zr(e5-C5H4{CHRR'})2Cl2] ( r = pri , R' = me ( 9 ) ; r = pri , R' = ph ( 10 ) ; r = but , R' = me ( 11 ) ; r = but , R' = ph ( 12 ) ) , were synthesized from the reaction of two molar equivalent of 1-4 with Cl4Zr . when the mono(cyclopentadienyl) complex [Zr(e5-C5H4{CHRR'})Cl3] ( r = pri , R' = me ( 17 ) ; r = pri , R' = ph ( 18 ) ; r = but , R' = me ( 19 ) ; r = but , R' = ph ( 20 ) ) were reacted with C9H7Li the zirconocene derivative , [Zr(e5-C9H7)(e5-C5H4{CHRR'})Cl2] ( r = pri , R' = me ( 21 ) ; r = pri , R' = ph ( 22 ) ; r = but , R' = me ( 23 ) ; r = but , R' = ph ( 24 ) ) , were obtained . the molecular structure of <nUm> ha been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction study . 5-12 and 21-24 have been tested a catalyst in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene . isotactic polypropylene with [mmmm] pentad between <nUm> and <nUm> % were obtained and their tacticity can be related directly to the structure of the catalyst . heterogeneous olefin polymerisation catalyst were prepared by combining zirconocene with a series of purely siliceous and Al - containing MCM-41 support with different Si / Al ratio , using simplified and improved version of the well - known direct impregnation and " MAO pre-treatment " method . the catalyst were tested in ethylene polymerisation . analysis of polymerisation activity and kinetic profile led to a rationalisation on the effect of support Si / Al ratio and method used for catalyst preparation over the catalytic behaviour for ethylene polymerisation . polymer were characterised by scanning electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry . A mechanism is proposed to associate the formation or absence of fibrous morphology with polymerisation activity . an MCM-41 ha been modified by grafting several zirconocene complex to give new material potentially active in the polymerization of a-olefins . these material have been activated by the cocatalyst MAO , to generate the catalyst MCM - <nUm> / metallocene / MAO ( metallocene = [Zr(e5-C5H5)2Cl2] ( 1 ) , [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}Cl2] ( 2 ) and [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H3But)}Cl2] ( 3 ) ) . the resulting functionalized ordered mesoporous silica sample ( 1-3 ) were tested a catalyst in the polymerization of ethylene and compared with both the homogeneous system analogue and the functionalized silica derivative SG / metallocene / MAO ( SG = silica gel ; metallocene = [Zr(e5-C5H5)2Cl2] ( 4 ) , [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}Cl2] ( 5 ) and [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H3But)}Cl2] ( 6 ) ) . the metallocenes <nUm> and <nUm> have been characterized by 13C-CP MAS NMR and 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy . the structure and surface property of MCM-41 / [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}Cl2] and MCM-41 / [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}Cl2] / MAO system have been studied by x-ray diffractometry , nitrogen adsorption - desorption isotherm measurement and thermogravimetry . the grafting of the metallocene complex , activation with MAO and subsequent polymerization reaction have been followed by an FT-IR " in situ " study . scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy have been used to show the morphology of the heterogeneous catalyst a well a the resulting polyethylene obtained . ethylene polymerization using catalyst derived from activation of zirconocene aluminohydride complex , supported on silica , pretreated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , is described . the novel catalyst composition were compared to those using conventional zirconocene dichloride complex and characterized by SEM / EDX and DRIFT spectroscopy . supported catalyst were prepared which featured various surface Al : Zr ratio . when using excess MAO a both activator and scavenger , the catalyst containing the most Zr per g of support gave rise to the most active formulation ; the high activity in the presence of excess MAO are due , in part , to catalyst leaching prior to and / or during polymerization . when tri-isobutylaluminum ( TIBAL ) wa used a scavenger , the supported catalyst that featured a higher surface Al : Zr ratio had higher activity than those prepared at the lower Al : Zr ratio . the activity of the aluminohydride complex wa significantly higher than that of the corresponding dichloride complex , when activated by MAO while the in the presence of TIBAL , there wa little difference in performance between the two catalyst precursor . several Ga-MCM-41 material , prepared using different synthesis and template removal procedure , were used for the immobilisation of Cp2ZrCl2 by a direct impregnation method . support were carefully characterised by XRD , N adsorption , ICP - AES , AAS , XPS and FTIR ( using pyridine a probe molecule for acid site ) , in order to ass their structural feature , chemical composition ( bulk and surface ) and surface acidity property . supported catalyst were tested for the polymerisation of ethylene , using methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) a cocatalyst / activator . the relationship established between concentration / strength of acid site of Ga-MCM-41 and the catalytic performance of zirconocene dichloride supported in these material demonstrate that the behaviour of the catalytic system analysed in this paper is compatible with existing model for the interaction of single - site olefin polymerisation catalyst with other inorganic acidic oxide . zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) supported on montmorillonite K-10 , which ha previously been shown to be an efficient catalytic system for olefin polymerization , wa found to be comparable to the highly activated homogeneous combination of Cp2ZrCl2 and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , and more reactive than the originally reported homogeneous catalytic system of Cp2ZrCl2 / Me3Al in the methylalumination reaction of an aryl substituted terminal alkyne . examination of solvent effect in the ethylalumination reaction using Cp2ZrCl2 supported on montmorillonite K-10 , O2Si / HLiO , and O2Si / MgO , indicated that the anionic counterpart of the actual catalytically active zirconocenium cation is highly delocalized , thus suggesting that the actual active zirconocenium cation is only very weakly coordinating with the anionic moiety . this account for the high activity of system using solid such a co-catalysts and a supporting material in olefin polymerization in general . this paper present a study of the effect of different treatment on the polymerization activity of modified clay a cocatalysts . to achieve this goal , an intercalating cation wa introduced into two smectites and these clay were then modified with trimethyl aluminium . the result for ethylene polymerization , when a zirconocene complex wa used a catalyst , and the structure analysis , allow u to obtain interesting deduction about the generation mode of the active specie . all active material employed a support activator presented aluminium in a pentahedral environment together with acidic hydrogen atom . these two feature were detected only after TMA treatment and they seem to be crucial element in active cocatalyst generation . moreover , a material without structural aluminium displayed the best activity pointing to the new aluminium specie generated in the solid matrix a the determining factor for the activity . we proposed a synergic effect between lewis acid aluminium centre and acidic bronsted proton that generate the AlHOSi group that activate the zirconium compound . the reaction of the edge - bridged open zirconocene , Zr(6,6-dmch)2(PMe3)2 ( dmch = dimethylcyclohexadienyl ) with two equivalent of PhC2SiMe3 lead to a <nUm> + <nUm> + <nUm> ring construction , resulting in a 4.3.1 bicyclodecadienyl skeleton . the resulting complex , with e3-allyl , e4-diene , and e5-dienyl coordination , ha a formal <nUm> electron configuration , and contains close contact between the metal center and two lengthened C-C bond , indicative of weak agostic interaction .

titanocene complex <nUm> and <nUm> show much higher activity than the ansa - zirconocene complex <nUm> and <nUm> , and the molecular weight of the polymer obtained by the titanocene complex are significantly higher ( mw , ∼ <nUm> <nUm> ) than those of polymer obtained by the zirconocene complex ( mw , below <nUm> <nUm> ) . the Me2Si - bridged complex <nUm> show extremely high activity for ethylene polymerization and the activity ( <nUm> × <nUm> g / mol h ) is <nUm> time higher than that of [ Me2Si(Me4C 5)(NtBu)]TiCl2 ( CGC ) under the same condition . ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization reactivity of <nUm> and <nUm> have been studied . the complex are inferior to CGC in term of comonomer incorporation ability . copolymer of norbornene with 1-hexene or 1-octene were prepared using the ansa - metallocene [methylene(bis(2,5-dimethylcyclopentadienyl))]zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) in the presence of MAO . the a-olefin content in the copolymer wa determined by 13C NMR spectroscopy and resulted in a dramatic decrease in polymer tg and mw . the catalyst activity wa determined to be <nUm> ± <nUm> kg ( polymer ) / mmol(Zr) h at <nUm> ° C . the reaction of phenylvinylboron chloride ( 11 ) with allylethylamine afforded (N-allyl-N-ethylamino)vinylphenylborane ( 12 ) which on treatment with <nUm> mol % grubbs catalyst gave 1-ethyl-2,5-dihydro-2-phenyl-1H-1,2-azaborole ( 13 ) . the reaction of <nUm> with LDA in ether gave lithium 1-ethyl-2-phenyl-1H-1,2- azaborolide ( 14 ) , which wa silylated with Me2SiCl2 to afford <nUm> . reaction of <nUm> with CpLi followed by LDA and then Cl4Zr gave bridged compound <nUm> . the reaction of <nUm> with <nUm> followed by LDA and then Cl4Zr gave the bridged complex <nUm> . the reaction of <nUm> with Cp*ZrCl3 gave <nUm> . the x-ray crystal structure of <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> show that they closely resemble the corresponding zirconocene dichloride . on activation with excess methylaluminoxane <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> form active catalyst from the polymerization of ethylene . the following ansa -

ES-MS of dilute solution of (bcep)ZrCl2 ( 1 ) ( bcep = PhP(CH2CH2-e5-C5H4)2 ) in acetonitrile - water indicates the presence of three specie in solution : [(bcep)Zr(H2O)2]2+ ( 2 ) , [{(bcep)Zr(m-OH)}2]2+ ( 3 ) , and the singly deprotonated form of dimer <nUm> , [{(bcep)Zr}2(m-O)(m-OH)]+ ( 4 ) . In aqueous solution , reactivity study investigated largely by 31P NMR spectroscopy support the presence of <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> . one equivalent of fluoride wa found to react immediately with <nUm> , but slowly with <nUm> and <nUm> , to give the monofluoro complex [(bcep)ZrF]+ which wa isolated a the BPh4- salt . addition of aqueous sodium sulphate gave insoluble crystal of the sulfato complex (bcep)Zr(SO4) which wa characterised by x-ray crystallography . addition of acid HX ( x = Br , NO3 , HO4S , CHO3 ) to aqueous solution of <nUm> gave specie observed by ES-MS corresponding to [(bcep)ZrX]+ . reaction of phenylethynyl lithium with substituted cyclopentenones gave the corresponding pendant phenylethynyl substituted cyclopentadienes . subsequent deprotonation and transmetallation with TiCl4*2THF , ClZr <nUm> , and Cp1ZrCl3 yielded the alkyne - functionalized metallocene complex [C5Me4(CCPh)] 2MCl2 [ m = Ti ( 1 ) , Zr ( 2 ) ] , Cp1[C 5Me4(CCPh)]ZrCl2 ( 3 ) , and Cp1[C 5H2R'2(CCPh)]ZrCl2 [ R' = me ( 4 ) , ph ( 5 ) ] . these complex were fully characterized by 1H NMR , 13C NMR , MS spectrum , and elemental analysis . the molecular structure of <nUm> wa determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . ethylene polymerization wa studied with these complex in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . four zirconium complex with pendant aryloxy group attached to the metallocene moiety by ethyl or hexyl spacers have been synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic method and HR-MS or elemental analysis . the solid state structure of bis[{6-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)hexyl}cyclopentadienyl] zirconium dichloride wa determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction . the prepared complex were tested a catalyst precursor in the polymerization of ethylene upon activation with MAO . the result showed a marked effect of the spacer length on the catalytic activity , while only a minor effect of the substitution on the aryl group , which affected it steric property . dimethylsilylene bridged 3,4-dimethylcyclopentadienyl / amido titanium and zirconium complex , namely [ Me2Si(C5Me2H 2)(tBuN)]MCl2 ( m = Ti , Zr ) , were synthesized by the reaction of the dilithium salt of the ligand with the corresponding inexpensive metal precursor TiCl4(THF)2 and ClZr <nUm> , respectively . these complex were characterized by spectroscopic technique and single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . In addition , the obtained complex exhibited high catalytic activity in the polymerization of ethylene and copolymerization of ethylene / 1-octene , and afforded PE and poly(ethylene-co-1-octene)s with high molecular weight . especially , the dimethyl-Cp substituted constrained geometry complex ( CGC ) , [ me 2Si(C5Me2H2)(tBuN) ] Cl2Ti exhibited a higher incorporation ratio of 1-octene at <nUm> C compared to the tetramethyl-Cp substituted CGC , [ Me2Si(C 5Me4)(tBuN)]TiCl2 , which wa judged by the density and 13C NMR analysis of the obtained copolymer . this is presumably due to the steric and electronic effect of the two vicinal methyl group in [ Me2Si(C5Me2H2)( tBuN)]MCl2 during the (co)polymerization and specifically , no agostic interaction available in the propagation and termination step of the (co)polymerization . the ansa indenyl ligand precursor C3H5 2(C9H6R)2 ( r = me ( 7 ) , et ( 8 ) , Pr ( 9 ) ) have been prepared by the reaction of the corresponding lithium indene , Li(C9H6R-1) ( r = me ( 4 ) , et ( 5 ) , Pr ( 6 ) ) , with 1,3-dibromopropane . compound 7-9 were converted , by the reaction with butyllithium , to the dilithium compound , Li2{CH2CH 2CH2(C9H5R-3)2 } ( r = me ( 10 ) , et ( 11 ) , Pr ( 12 ) ) . the three carbon atom bridge ansa - bis(indenyl)zirconium complex , [ Zr{CH2CH2CH2(e5- C9H5R-3)2}Cl2 ] ( r = me ( 13 ) , et ( 14 ) Pr ( 15 ) ) were synthesized from the reaction of 10-12 with zirconium tetrachloride . compound 13-15 have been tested a homogeneous catalyst in the polymerization of ethylene . the molecular structure of <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction study . A series of ethylene-bridged C1 - symmetric ansa-(3-R-indenyl) ( fluorenyl ) zirconocene complex 3a-i ( r = 2-[2-(4-methylphenyl)propyl] , 3a ; r = 2-[2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)propyl] , 3b ; r = 2-(2-benzylpropyl) , 3c ; r = 2-methylbenzyl , 3d ; r = 2-(2-cyclohexylpropyl) , 3e ; r = 2-[2-(1-cyclohexenyl) propyl ] , 3f ; r = 2-(2-n-butylpropyl) , <nUm> g ; r = cyclohexyl , <nUm> h ; r = iPr , 3i ) were synthesized by a salt metathesis method and characterized by NMR spectroscopy , elemental analysis ( or HRMS ) and x-ray diffraction ( 3e and <nUm> h ) . upon activation with methylaluminoxane , most of these zirconocene complex exhibited sufficient catalytic activity up to <nUm> × <nUm> g C6 / ( mol - zr*h ) and high selectivity up to <nUm> % toward propylene dimerization , affording 2-methyl-1-pentene a the major isomer which wa confirmed by gas chromatography . remarkably , the selectivity and activity of complex 3a-i were significantly influenced by the structural feature of the substituent on the 3-position of indenyl ring : a pendant aryl or alkyl group linked by a quaternary carbon bridge provided the complex with high selectivity in the range of <nUm> - <nUm> % for 2-methyl-1-pentene and low to moderate catalytic activity ; the lack of a quaternary carbon bridge within the substituent would lead to mainly polypropylene of low molecular weight . the steric hindrance around the active metal center induced by the pendant group might be responsible for the catalytic dimerization behavior , and the presumed mechanism wa discussed . In addition , for complex <nUm> h and 3i , the selectivity for propylene dimerization could also be enhanced with the increase of reaction temperature . noticeably , most of these ansa - zirconocene complex exhibit excellent thermal stability at <nUm> ° C , which is important with regard to industrial application . <nUm> elsevier ltd. all right reserved . catalyst creates new grade of polyethylene while their degradation phenomenon determine the resulting application profile . the resin and the end - product eventually contain residual catalyst . therefore , the effect of the following two residual catalyst - one ziegler - natta [ PQ silica / bu 2Mg / tBuCl / Cl4Ti ] , and the other metallocene [ PQ silica / MAO / (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 ] - on the UV - induced degradation of the resulting unstabilized ethylene homopolymer film were studied . the MetCat HomoPE film wa found to be more susceptible to UV - induced degradation degradation than the Z-N HomoPE one despite the residual Zr level wa <nUm> / 15th of the Ti content . therefore , the zirconocene residual catalyst better ( i ) facilitated the UV - initiated reaction , and ( ii ) decreased the activation energy required for the decomposition of the resulting hydroperoxide . these finding were explained from the difference in ( i ) electronic configuration and atomic radius , and ( ii ) surface chemistry and solid - state electronic environment of these catalyst system . In both film , tpm and tpc did not significantly vary with the exposure time . the change of % crystallinity showed to be irregular and disturbed . As a function of carbonyl index , tpm and tpc,varied in a similar fashion in the MetCat HomoPE film . however , they significantly differed for the Z-N HomoPE film . here , tpm did not appreciably change whereas tpc initially increased very mildly ; then it did not essentially differ . crystalline structure and thermal property of poly(ethylene-co-a ,o-nonconjugated diene)s , [ diene = 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) , 1,7-octadiene ( OD ) , and 1,9-decadiene ( DD ) ] have been investigated in relation to insertion mode of the dienes . In the case of poly(ethylene-co-HD) , the copolymer containing high cis-1,3-cyclopentane unit show lower melting point depression with increasing the comonomer content than the copolymer containing high trans-1,3-cyclopentane unit . In the case of poly(ethylene-co-OD) and poly(ethylene-co-DD) , the copolymer containing pendant vinyl group show higher DHm than that of the copolymer with cyclic unit or branching structure . thermal degradation of the copolymer ha been investigated under nitrogen atmosphere and the degradation of the copolymer containing the cyclic structure begin at lower temperature than the copolymer containing pendant vinyl group . single site olefin polymerisation catalyst are suitable candidate for modelling purpose . their well - defined structure and the almost complete elucidation of their polymerisation mechanism , make these organometallic complex ideal for study based on quantitative structure - activity relationship ( QSAR ) . although the QSAR technique is extensively used in drug design , there are very few report on it application to metallocene - based polymerisation catalysis . this probably ha something to do with the difficulty inherent in controlling experimental condition during the polymerisation process . In the present study , we obtained ethylene polymerisation data using a number of zirconocene catalyst under carefully controlled experimental condition , i.e. keeping all polymerisation variable constant except catalyst structure . the catalytic activity and molecular weight of the resulting polyethylene were experimentally determined . we then applied 3D-QSAR methodology to explain the experimental data in term of three - dimensional ( 3D ) field descriptor related to the structure of the metallocene catalyst . our result provide useful correlation between experimental ethylene polymerisation activity and the steric , LUMO and local softness field of the catalyst . the molecular weight calculated from comparative molecular field analysis ( CoMFA ) model including LUMO and local softness field correlate well with the experimental one . the predictive capacity of the model wa also tested . based on the proposed model , steric and electronic factor affecting polymerisation performance are discussed . the dynamic mechanical and rheological property of five long - chain branched ( LCB ) and three linear ethylene / propylene ( EP ) copolymer were investigated and compared using a dynamic mechanical analyzer ( DMA ) and an oscillatory rheometer . the novel series of LCB EP copolymer were synthesized with a constrained geometry catalyst ( CGC ) , [ C5Me 4(SiMe2NtBu)]TiMe2 , and had various propylene molar fraction of <nUm> - <nUm> and long - chain branch frequency ( LCBF ) of <nUm> - <nUm> . the linear EP copolymer were synthesized with an ansa - zirconocene catalyst , rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( EBI ) , and contained similar level of propylene incorporation a the CGC copolymer , but no LCB . In dynamic mechanical analysis , the dynamic storage modulus ( G' ) and loss modulus ( G'' ) of the copolymer decreased with an increase of propylene molar fraction . the a- and b-transitions of the CGC copolymer were overlaid with each other . high damping ( tand ) value were found with the CGC copolymer at temperature below <nUm> ° C . In oscillatory rheological analysis , compared to the linear EBI counterpart , the LCB CGC copolymer melt showed higher zero shear activation energy , broader plateau of δ and larger elastic contribution , which are essential characteristic of LCB polymer . it wa found that the long chain branching wa the determining factor in controlling rheological property of the polymer melt while the short chain branching from propylene incorporation played a decisive role in affecting dynamic mechanical property . this work represents the first rheological evidence of LCB in EP copolymer synthesized with CGC . polyethylene and isotactic polypropylene containing hydroxylated cyclic unit were synthesized by copolymerization of ethylene or propylene and cyclodiolefins , dicyclopentadiene ( DCPD ) , 5-vinyl-2-norbornene ( VNB ) , 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene ( ENB ) , with zirconocene catalyst and subsequent hydroboration reaction of residual unsaturated group . the resulting hydroxylated copolymer showed higher glass transition temperature ( tg ) than the original and hydrogenated copolymer . relationship between the cyclodiolefin content and DTg ( DTg = difference of T g between hydroxylated copolymer and hydrogenated copolymer ) wa given by a straight line independent of the structure of the comonomers . improvement in shape memory effect wa observed in the hydroxylated ethylene-VNB copolymer . polymerization of vinyl-cyclohexane ( VCH ) in the presence of catalytic system based on zirconocenes belonging to C2 , c2v or Cs symmetry group were performed . all polymer were analyzed by 13C NMR spectroscopy and show isotactic microstructure . A steric control mechanism , involving a like 1,3-asymmetric induction of the chiral carbon of the last inserted unit on the chirality of the incoming monomer coordination , is proposed . this would be the only stereocontrol mechanism in the presence of a c2v-symmetry catalyst , and it would enforce or overcome site control in case of active specie with C2 and C s-symmetry , respectively . isoprene ( 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene ) wa attempted a a comonomer in metallocene - catalyzed propylene polymerization to prepare side chain - unsaturated isotactic polypropylene ( i-PP ) . hydrogen wa added into the sluggish copolymerization of propylene and isoprene mediated by a highly isospecific metallocene complex rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO . catalyst activity wa restored due to breaking by hydrogen of the stable p-allyl zirconocene specie caused by 1,4-isoprene insertion . stunningly , it wa found that the generated Zr-H specie had been able to take the accompanying vinylidene-terminated polymer chain for insertion a a preemptive mode of re-initiation . with a consecutive action of chain release followed by in situ reinsertion , the hydrogen - induced catalyst reactivation wa not accompanied by chain termination . with the smooth occurrence of the copolymerization , the 1,2-insertion of isoprene led to the preparation of i-PP bearing pendant vinylidene group . ansa - zirconocene complex have been studied by three - dimensional quantitative structure - activity relationship ( 3D-QSAR ) . using the comparative molecular field analysis ( CoMFA ) method , the experimental result obtained for catalytic activity and polymer molecular weight have been successfully correlated with the steric and electrostatic 3D structural descriptor , which were calculated by density functional theory ( DFT ) method . heterogeneous cocatalysts , catalyst , and catalyst mixture for the polymerization of ethylene were prepared applying " fumed silica " and mesoporous MCM-41 support material and zirconocene dichloride , titanocene dichloride , and a bis(arylimino)pyridine iron complex a catalyst precursor . the catalyst mixture produced polyethylene which exhibit the property of two single polymer . polyethylene with the desired bimodal molecular weight distribution could be obtained with a series of ternary Zr / Ti / Fe catalyst . the ability of the zirconium and titanium specie to copolymerize short - chain 1-olefins produced by the iron center ( " in situ " copolymerization ) is useful for the production of copolymer from only one monomer ( ethylene ) . A polyethylene / montmorillonite(MMT) nanocomposite wa prepared by in situ polymerization method using MMT - supported methylaluminoxane(MAO) cocatalyst and / or Cp2ZrCl2 catalyst . the catalyst component had been supported on the unmodified MMT-Na and modified commercial product , cloisite <nUm> A . with XRD it wa found that the layered silicate gallery of cloisite <nUm> A wa exfoliated by incorporating MAO cocatalyst and zirconocene catalyst while the d-spacing of MMT-Na wa le changed . the in situ polymerization of ethylene wa carried out to prepare the nanocomposite by using the supported MMT , and the fully exfoliated product wa obtained with cloisite <nUm> A . the decomposition temperature of the obtained nanocomposite increased up to <nUm> ° C , but the melting temperature wa not improved much . cycloalumination of 3'-methylene-(5a)-spirocholestane-3 , 1'-cyclobutane with triethylaluminum catalyzed by Cp2ZrCl <nUm> wa accomplished for the first time to give (5a)- spirocholestane-3,1'-(6'-ethyl-6'-aluminaspiro [3.4] octane ) in <nUm> % . the latter , without isolation , wa converted into spirotetrahydroselenophene or spirotetrahydrofuran . the catalytic cycloalumination of 2'-methylidene-2',3'- ethano-(5a)-cholestane with Et3Al catalyzed by cp 2ZrCl2 wa performed for the first time to give spiro[2',3'-ethano-(5a)-cholestane-2' , 3''-aluminacyclopentane ] in a ∼ <nUm> % yield and with high stereoselectivity ( > <nUm> % ) . the obtained cyclic organoaluminum compound wa transformed in situ into heterocyclic spiran derivative of 2',3'- ethano-(5a)-cholestane . investigation into the compositional heterogeneity of ethylene / 1-hexene copolymer obtained with various zirconocene / MAO catalyst , either homogeneous or supported on inorganic carrier such a a complex of magnesium chloride with tetrahydrofuran or methyl alcohol , were conducted . the dependence between metallocene structure , a well a catalyst immobilization , and the compositional heterogeneity of the related product wa investigated . it wa found that the heterogeneity of copolymer is determined by the metallocene catalyst structure . the amount of peak on the DSC thermogram of copolymer and their division increase with the increase of bulkiness of the ligand in the catalytic system . the immobilization of the investigated catalyst on the magnesium carrier lead to an increase of the copolymer 's compositional heterogeneity . however , the modification of the Cl2Mg carrier by tetrahydrofuran or methyl alcohol seems to not have any influence on the copolymer ' CCD . A route to an enantiopure trisubstituted cyclobutanone ha been devised . the pursuit of this building block begin with d-glucose and feature a zirconocene - promoted ring contraction . benzo-zirconacyclohexadiene-phospha or silacyclobutene fused ring system are easily prepared via a benzynezirconocene intermediate by mean of thermolysis of Cp2ZrPh2 in the presence of bis(alkynyl)phosphanes or silanes . these polyunsaturated system are the source of a variety of new mono- or tricyclic heterocycle incorporating either one or two heteroatoms . A variety of 2,4-pentadienylzirconiums were generated by reacting pentadienyl ether with zirconocene ' Cp2Zr ' . these complex underwent a highly g-regioselective and anti-stereoselective in situ addition with carbonyl compound to afford bis(homoallylic) alcohol in good yield . the reversal of anti v syn selectivity wa simply achieved with BF <nUm> , thus expanding the synthetic potential of the reaction . the 1,4-conjugated addition of alkenylzirconocene chloride complex to a,b-enones , a,b-enoic acid ester , and a,b-enoic acid amide can be efficiently achieved by the use of [RhCl(cod)]2 catalyst . A high diastereoselectivity ( <nUm> % yield , <nUm> % de ) wa obtained through the reaction of a,b-enoic acid amide derived from oppolzer 's sultam and 2-butenoyl chloride , while the use of evans ' chiral oxazolidinone a a chiral auxiliary in place of oppolzer 's sultam gave a poor diastereoselectivity ( <nUm> % yield , <nUm> % de ) . an easy and straightforward new method for the preparation of sp <nUm> zirconocene derivative from a wide range of heterosubstituted alkene such a vinyl sulfide , sulfoxides and sulfones is described . In all case , a complete isomerization of the stereochemistry is observed and only the e-isomer is obtained . the reactivity of the resulting vinylic organometallic can be increased by a transmetalation reaction into organocopper , organozinc or organopalladium specie and , therefore , several carbon-carbon formation were easily realized . cyclopentane and cyclohexane derivative are prepared from 1,5- and 1,6-dienes in a one pot procedure by hydrozirconation , then oxidation of the generated 5- and 6-alkenylzirconocene chloride with ammonium hexanitratocerate . cationic metallocene specie , generated from Cp2MCl2 and AgClO4 ( m = Zr , Hf ) , were used for the glycosylation of catechin derivative <nUm> , enabling a concise synthesis of a glycosyl flavonoid , astilbin ( 1 ) . further study revealed the efficiency of this lewis acidic specie for NS - type activation of the C(4) position of catechin derivative <nUm> , enabling selective substitution with various nucleophiles . reaction pathway a well a stereochemistries and stoichiometry of zirconocene - catalyzed silylation of olefin with chlorosilanes in the presence of nBuMgCl were studied and discussed in detail . rate determining step were examined by kinetic study and labeling experiment . intramolecular alkene-carbonyl coupling reaction of N-benzyl-N-(o- alkenylaryl)carbamate derivative derived from o-aminostyrene , o-(aminomethyl)styrene and o-aminoallylbenzene smoothly proceeded by treating with zirconocene - butene complex to give the corresponding lactam derivative . a-Lithiated phenylsulphonyloxiranes insert into alkenylzirconocene chloride with loss of phenylsulphinate to give zirconyloxiranes which smoothly rearrange by either a- or b- C-O cleavage to afford regiodefined zirconium enolates which may be further elaborated . both vinyl and alkyl zirconocenes undergo rapid coupling with aryl halide under heterogeneous condition in a microwave reactor using Ni / C a catalyst . ligand variation both in type and stoichiometry play major role in the extent of conversion . none none zirconocene - alkene complex Cp2Zr(CH2{double bond , long}CHR ) reacted with chlorophosphate to form zircono-ethylphosphonate with high regioselectivity , which is versatile and could be converted into various functionalized organophosphonates . the regioselectivity of insertion of carbenoids into a variety of unsymmetrical zirconacyclopentanes is reported . for comparison the regioselectivities of isonitrile insertion and protonation have also been determined . the enantioselectivity of chiral Zr catalyst L1L2ZrCl2 [ L1 = L2 = 1-neomenthylindenyl ( ind* ) , <nUm> ; L1 = cp , L2 = ind* <nUm> ; L1 = cp , L2 = 1-neomenthylindenyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl ( cp* ) <nUm> ] in the hydro- , carbo- and cycloalumination of alkene by organoaluminium compound ( OAC ) ( AlMe3 , AlEt3 , HAlBu2i ) ha been studied . it wa found that OAC exhibit the most effect on the reaction chemo- and enantioselectivity . the reaction chemo- and enantioselectivity depend on the catalyst structure and reaction condition ( solvent type , catalyst concentration , temperature ) a well . it is shown that the lack of asymmetric induction in the reaction of a-methylstyrene hydroalumination by HAlBu2i , catalyzed with complex <nUm> or <nUm> , is the result of the formation of Zr hydride complex of different structure a reaction intermediate . MTPA wa used a a derivatization reagent for the enantiomeric excess estimation and absolute configuration assignment of b-chiral alcohol obtained after the oxidation and hydrolysis of the reaction product . the applicability of MTPA for the assignment of the absolute configuration of the stereogenic centre in b-ethyl substituted primary alcohol and b-alkyl-1,4-butanediols is shown . stereodefined butadienyl phosphine and related derivative were readily prepared in high yield with perfect regioselectivity via the zirconocene - mediated pair - selective coupling of alkynylphosphines with ethylene or alkynylphosphines with normal alkyne . interesting and synthetically useful iodination reaction were found when the in situ generated a- phosphinozirconacyclopentenes or a-phosphinozirconacyclopentadienes were treated with I2 . benzylzirconocene intermediate , which wa readily prepared by the reaction of o-alkoxymethylstyrene with ' Cp2Zr ' under mild condition , reacted with allylic halide or phosphate in the presence of catalytic amount of ClCu to give allylated product in good yield . benzylzirconocene intermediate , which wa readily prepared by a reaction of o-alkoxymethylstyrene with ' Cp2Zr ' under mild condition , reacted with acyl chloride in the presence of a catalytic amount of BrCu - SMe <nUm> to give ketone derivative in moderate to good yield . highly enantioselective 1,4-addition of alkenylzirconocene chloride to a,b-enones wa found to be catalyzed by a chiral rhodium complex generated from [Rh(cod)(MeCN)2]BF4 and (S)-BINAP . the reaction can be applied to either cyclic or acyclic enones and the optical yield wa up to <nUm> % ee . the reaction mechanism would involve the transmetalation between the alkenylzirconocene chloride and the rhodium complex to give the alkenylrhodium specie a a key intermediate . cyclopropylcarbinylzirconium complex were generated from homoallylic ether and zirconocene ( cp 2ZrCl <nUm> / 2n-BuLi ) . they underwent further in situ transformation that is , bromination - substitution , transmetallation - functionalization and insertion reaction to afford various cyclopropylcarbinyl derivative . In contrast , ring - opening product could be selectively obtained by treating the zirconium complex with MeLi , prior to functionalization . the presence of catalytic quantity of the copper (I) iodide dimethyl sulfide complex {(CuI)4(SMe2)3} with alkenyl-alkylzincate reagent allows for the complete chemoselective 1,4-addition of various alkenyl group to a number of a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compound in CCl2H2 at + <nUm> ° C . the 1,4-addition of the mixed vinylzincate reagent is more efficient than the corresponding vinylzirconocene reagent in CCl2H2 or THF . by employing CCl2H2 a a medium , the asymmetric copper - catalyzed addition of the vinyl group to a,b-unsaturated imide is facilitated by the presence of TMSOTf to give excellent yield and up to <nUm> : <nUm> diastereomeric ratio ( dr ) . heteroaromatic zirconocene intermediate were generated by the reaction of ' Cp2Zr ' with alkoxymethyl-(TMS-ethynyl)-indole , -benzofuran or -benzothiophene derivative under mild condition in moderate to good yield . copper - catalyzed C-C bond formation of the zirconocene intermediate with allylic halide gave allylation product , which were transformed into heterocyclic dienes through enyne metathesis . preliminary diels - alder reaction of the dienes with DMAD showed notable site selectivity . zirconocene catalyzed cyclization of 2-(5-methoxy-3-penten-1-yl)styrene in the presence of organomagnesium reagent wa studied . the cyclization proceeded in high isolated yield ( up to <nUm> % ) with excellent trans-selectivity ( > <nUm> % ) , which is unusual for the formation of cyclohexane derivative . catalytic cyclization in the presence of Cp2ZrCl2 proceeded a well with similar result . the reaction with (R,R)-(EBTHI)2ZrCl2 gave a ci / trans mixture of <nUm> in low yield and poor ee . treatment of the different kind of alkynyl-substituted dialkynyldiarylsilanes with zirconocene-ethylene complex Cp2Zr(CH2{double bond , long}CH2 ) followed by acidification with <nUm> N ClH gave regio- and stereoselectively the corresponding silacyclobutenes in good yield . desilylation of the silacyclobutenes with tetrabutylammonium fluoride afforded stereoselectively unsymmetrical conjugated (1E,3E)-dienes and -trienes ( R1 or R2 = 1-cyclohexenyl ) in excellent yield . stereoselective formation of carbocycles wa carried out through [RhCl(cod)]2 - catalyzed reaction of alkenylzirconocene chloride to o-carbonyl-a,b-ene carbonyl ( ketone , ester , and amide ) or to bis-enone derivative . the Rh (I) - catalyzed reaction of alkenylzirconocene chloride with o-carbonyl-a,b-enoyl amide , which is derived from oppolzer 's sultam , showed high diastereoselectivity to yield an carbocycle ( <nUm> % yield , > <nUm> % de ) . stereo - defined 1,1,4,4-tetrahalo- and 1,1,4,4-mixed-tetrahalo-1,3-butadienes were obtained in excellent yield via desilylation - halogenation of their corresponding 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)-1,4-dihalo-1,3-dienes , which could be readily prepared from the zirconocene - mediated high - yield and high - regioselective cyclo-dimerization of 1-trimethylsilyl-1-alkynes followed by halogenation . these poly-functionalized gem-dihalodienes are potentially useful building block . the addition of alkenylzirconocene chloride to 3,4-dihydroisoquinoline in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of acylating agent such a (Boc)2O or C3ClH5O2 wa carried out in the presence of a catalytic amount of Cu (I) ( <nUm> mol % ) to give an alkenylation-carbamation product . the enantioselective addition ( 56-75 % ee ) of the alkenylzirconocene chloride wa also achieved under Cu (I) / chiral amine ( <nUm> mol % ) condition . zirconacycles <nUm> prepared from 1-alkynylphosphonates <nUm> , zirconocene dichloride , and <nUm> equiv of EtMgCl are smoothly converted into cyclobutenylphosphonates <nUm> when treated with two equiv of ClCu in 65-81 % isolated yield . the reaction is specific and general only for zirconacyclopentenyl phosphonates . trimethylvinylsilane and disubstituted alkyne underwent coupling reaction in the presence of the lanthanide - originated zirconocene equivalent . both reaction , stoichiometric and catalytic in zirconium , could be carried out ; in the latter case the addition of a stoichiometric amount of AlCl3 wa needed . the catalytic cycle involving bimetallic polarization and a transmetallation step ha been proposed . a-Methylenyl zirconacyclopentenes are synthesized regio- and stereoselectively via reductive intermolecular cross-coupling of alkyne and allenes promoted by zirconocene specie ' Cp2Zr ' . an interesting reductive intramolecular coupling of the a-methylenyl zirconacyclopentene ha been observed in the presence of DMAD / ClCu , resulting in the generation of cyclobutene with an exocyclic double bond . polysubstituted 1,4-dienes can be given with high selectivity and good yield . g,d-Unsaturated o-methyl oxime were cyclized to dihydropyrrole by the treatment of (1-butene)ZrCp2 <nUm> prepared by negishi 's procedure ( reaction with Cp2ZrCl2 and two equivalent of n-BuLi ) . In this cyclization , the geometry of oxime wa affected and syn-oximes were cyclized efficiently . however , it wa found that the anti-oxime is not suitable for the cyclization . mono- and bisaluminacyclopentenes obtained via zirconium - catalyzed cycloalumination with et <nUm> Al and cyclic alkyne or diynes can be converted into the corresponding mono- and biscyclopentenones by treatment with CO <nUm> , ClCOOEt , or CO(OEt) <nUm> in yield of 34-73 % . zirconacyclopentenes , which are easily prepared from alkyne , alkene , and zirconocene compound , reacted with dichlorophenylphosphine to give 2-phospholene in high yield . the reaction wa performed conveniently in one - pot from an alkyne , alkene , dichlorophosphine , and zirconocene compound .

Zr(cp)2Cl2 , <nUm> equiv Mn , and <nUm> equiv ClLi ) ha been developed to facilitate the homocoupling of a wide range of aryl , alkenyl , and alkynyl halide . the reductive coupling of imines in the presence of the lanthanide - originated zirconocene equivalent allows the synthesis of vicinal diamine or imidazolidines under mild condition in good yield with high diastereoselectivity . zirconium - catalyzed cycloalumination of cycloalkadiynes assisted by et 3Al , subsequent treatment of the in situ generated tricyclic dialuminum compound with BrCH2OMe and finally cyclopropanation of the obtained dispiro cyclopropyl dimethylene macrocarbocycles with et 3Al-CH2I2 represents an efficient one - pot synthetic approach to prepare di- and tetraspiro cyclopropane - containing macrocarbocycles in very high yield . insertion of allenyl carbenoids ( 3-tosyloxy-1-lithioalk-1-ynes ) into organozirconium complex gave allenyl-zirconocenes via a 1,2-zirconate rearrangement . trapping of the allenyl-zirconium specie with aldehyde and ketone gave , after hydrolysis , a series of homopropargyl alcohol . enantioenriched product were prepared by insertion of the lithium carbenoid derived from (S)-but-3-yn-2-yl 4-toluenesulfonate into alkyl- and alkenyl-chlorozirconocenes . stereoselective preparation of alkenyl sulfide wa carried out via syn-hydrozirconation of the alkynyl sulfide . regiochemistry of halogenation of the thioalkenyl zirconocene could be switched by different halide . a-Chloroalkenyl sulfide or b-haloalkenyl sulfide ( Br , I ) could be obtained by the treatment of NCS or NBS ( NIS ) , respectively . possible mechanism of halogenation of the thioalkenyl zirconocene wa set up herein . an air - stable lewis acidic binuclear complex of bis(ethylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium perfluorooctanesulfonate ( 1a ) wa successfully synthesized by the reaction of (CH3CH2Cp)2ZrCl2 with AgC8F17O3S . the complex 1a wa characterized by different technique and found to have the nature of air - stability , water tolerance , thermal - stability , and strong lewis-acidity . In addition , it solubility wa higher than that of our previously reported uninuclear zirconocene bis(perfluorooctanesulfonate) . this complex showed high catalytic efficiency , good recyclability , and reusability in the one - pot three - component aza-Friedel-Crafts reaction of indoles with aldehyde and N,N-dimethylaniline . the yield of the corresponding 3-diarylmethyl indoles are higher than those from the traditional lewis acidic catalyst . A borylation reaction of aromatic diazonium salt ha been optimized using titanocene and zirconocene derivative a catalyst . the reaction employ diisopropylaminoborane a a borylating agent and proceeds smoothly at room temperature to provide arylboronates after methanolysis and transesterification with pinacol . the reaction mechanism ha been found to proceed via a radical pathway . addition of oxalyl chloride to zirconacycles prepared from 1-alkynylphosphonates <nUm> zirconocene dichloride , and two equivalent of EtMgBr smoothly produced novel 2-oxo-cyclopentenylphosphonates <nUm> in 58-81 % isolated yield in the presence of a copper catalyst . none ion - ion interaction are a crucial but often overlooked aspect of many polymerization reaction . the precise nature of cation - anion binding is a yet poorly understood , and little is known of the extent of ionic interaction in the typically nonaqueous , low - polarity reaction medium of most polymerization . nevertheless , adequate control of cation - anion interaction can greatly enhance the productivity and efficiency of chemical process and can provide low - energy alternative to current method . this is illustrated here with the carbocationic polymerization of isoalkenes . carbocationic polymerization involve , a the name implies , carbocations a propagating specie . of the various type of substrate that can be polymerized cationically , the copolymerization of isobutene to isobutene - isoprene rubber stand out a the only large - scale , industrially important implementation of this reaction type . the product , elastomer with controlled degree of unsaturation for subsequent cross-linking , have excellent gas barrier and mechanical dampening property that make them indispensable component in polymer composite . for such application , the polymer molecular weight ha to be high , <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> g / mol , with 1-2 mol % isoprene . cationic polymerization are however notoriously difficult to control . As a mean of suppressing chain transfer , the process is carried out at temperature a low a <nUm> ° C , with aluminum chloride initiator in chloromethane . current industrial production of isobutene - isoprene butyl rubber is thus highly energy intensive and produce aluminum and chloride effluent . this account summarizes how highly electrophilic organometallics coupled with new type of very weakly coordinating counteranions can provide the basis for a more environmentally friendly , lower energy alternative . because any copolymerization of two monomer , here primarily isobutene and isoprene , lead to two different propagating specie , each of which is characterized by different chain growth and chain termination kinetics , variation of the associated counteranions can give rather unexpected result . with judicious choice of the initiator and the counteranion , new chemistry can be injected into such process and can open avenue to new family of polymer material . mechanistic investigation of the initiation process with zirconocene hydride illustrate the complexity of this first step . replacing aluminum with zinc initiator not only provides a nontoxic alternative but also generates a system in which the polymer molecular weight is much le affected by temperature and comonomer concentration , which can lead to a range of product , from oligomeric lubricant precursor to C-C - rich high-molecular-weight elastomer . the key in all these case is the construction of either preformed or in situ - generated complex anion that are resistant to electrophilic or redox degradation and are capable of stabilizing tightly associated carbocations . such initiator system allow much more benign operating temperature , reduce the need for chlorocarbon solvent , and can operate at concentration a low a <nUm> × 10-5 m . along the way are provided the first example of structurally characterized sec-alkyl carbocations and carbocation salt of organometallic zincates . macrocyclic compound have attracted considerable attention in numerous application , including host - guest chemistry , chemical sensing , catalysis , and material science . A major obstacle , however , is the limited number of convenient , versatile , and high - yielding synthetic route to functionalized macrocycles . macrocyclic compound have been typically synthesized by ring - closing or condensation reaction , but many of these procedure produce mixture of oligomers and cyclic compound . As a result , macrocycle synthesis are often associated with difficult separation and low yield . some successful approach that circumvent these problem are based on " self - assembly " process utilizing reversible bond - forming reaction , but for many application , it is essential that the resulting macrocycle be built with a strong covalent bond network . In this account , we describe how zirconocene - mediated reductive coupling of alkyne can provide reversible carbon-carbon bond - forming reaction well - suited for this purpose.Zirconocene coupling of alkene and alkyne ha been used extensively a a source of novel , versatile pathway to functionalized organic compound . here , we describe the development of zirconocene - mediated reductive coupling a a highly efficient method for the preparation of macrocycles and cage with diverse composition , size , and shape . this methodology is based on the reversible , regioselective coupling of alkyne with bulky substituents . In particular , silyl substituents provide regioselective , reversible coupling that place them into the a-positions of the resulting zirconacyclopentadiene ring . according to density functional theory ( DFT ) calculation and kinetic study , the mechanism of this coupling involves a stepwise process , whereby an insertion of the second alkyne influence regiochemistry through both steric and electronic factors.Zirconocene coupling of diynes that incorporate silyl substituents generates predictable macrocyclic product in very high yield . In the absence of significant steric repulsion , the macrocyclization appears to be entropically driven , thereby providing the smallest strain - free macrocyclic structure . the scope of the reaction ha been explored by variation of the spacer group between the alkynyl substituents and by incorporation of functional and chiral group into the macrocycle . the size and shape of the resulting macrocycles are largely determined by the length and geometry of the dialkyne spacer , especially in the case of terminal trimethylsilyl-substituted diynes . for example , linear , rigid diynes with four or fewer phenylene ring lead to trimeric macrocycles , whereas bent or flexible diynes produce dimer . depending on the reaction condition , functional group ( such a n-heterocycles and imines ) are tolerated in zirconocene coupling reaction , and in selected case , they can be used to influence the shape of the final macrocyclic product . more recently , cp 2Zr(pyr)(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) ha been employed a a more general zirconocene synthon ; it affords higher yield and increased functional group tolerance . functional group can also be incorporated through transformation of the zirconacyclopentadiene product , with acid hydrolysis to the corresponding butadiene being the most efficient derivatization . furthermore , construction of chiral macrocycles ha been accomplished by stereoselective macrocyclizations , and triynes have been coupled into three - dimensional cage compound . we also discus various design factor , providing a perspective on the utility of zirconocene - mediated coupling in the assembly of macrocyclic and cage compound . characterizing reactive organometallic intermediate is critical for understanding the mechanistic aspect of metal - mediated organic reaction . moreover , the isolation of reactive organometallic intermediate can often result in the ability to design new synthetic method . In this account , we outline synthetic method that we developed for a variety of diverse Zr / Si organo-bimetallic compound and Si / N heteroatom - organic compound through the detailed study of zirconacyclobutene-silacyclobutene fused compounds.Two basic component are involved in this chemistry . the first is the Si - tethered diyne , which owes it rich reactive palette to the combination of the Si-C bond and the C = C triple bond . the second is the low - valent zirconocene specie cp 2Zr(II) , which ha proven very useful in organic synthesis . the reaction of these two component affords the zirconacyclobutene-silacyclobutene fused compound , which is the key reactive Zr / Si organo-bimetallic intermediate discussed here.We discus the three type of reaction that have been developed for the zirconacyclobutene-silacyclobutene fused intermediate . the reaction with nitrile ( the C = N triple bond ) is introduced in the first section . In this one - pot reaction , up to four different component can be combined : the Si - tethered diyne can be reacted with three identical nitrile , with differing nitrile , or with a nitrile and other unsaturated organic substrate such a formamides , isocyanides , acid chloride , aldehyde , carbodiimides , and azide . several unexpected multiring , fused Zr / Si organo-bimetallic intermediate were isolated and characterized . A wide variety of n-heterocycles , such a 5-azaindole , pyrrole , and pyrroloazepine derivative , were obtained . we then discus the reaction with alkyne ( the C = C triple bond ) . A consecutive skeletal rearrangement , differing from that observed in the reaction with nitrile , take place in this reaction . finally , we discus the reaction with the C = x substrate ( where x is O or N ) , including ketone , aldehyde , and isocyanides . oxa- and azazirconacycles are formed via a new skeletal rearrangement.Our result show that the zirconocene and the Si - tethered diyne cooperate a a " chemical transformer " after treatment with various substrate , leading to a diverse range of cyclic Zr / Si organo-bimetallic compound . this mechanism - derived synthesis of organometallic and organic compound demonstrates that the investigation of metal - mediated reaction and the isolation of reactive organometallic intermediate not only contribute to the understanding of complex reaction but can also lead to the discovery of synthetically useful method . (Butadiene)zirconocene add BC18F15 at a terminal diene carbon atom to yield the zirconocene-(m-hydrocarbyl)-borate betaine Cp2-Zr[C4H6-B C6F5 ] ( 4 ) . the dipolar complex <nUm> contains a distorted p-allyl moiety and feature an additional stabilizing Zr-F-C(arene) coordination . under kinetic control , an isomeric betaine system is formed , characterized by an internal Zr+***CH2[B]- ion - pair interaction , that rearranges to <nUm> upon heating . A great variety of ansa-metallocene(butadiene) complex and related system cleanly form analogous metallocene-(m - conjugated diene)-borate betaine upon treatment with BC18F15 and related lewis acid . most of these system represent very active homogeneous single - component ziegler - natta catalyst for a-olefin polymerization and copolymerization . In addition , these betaine catalyst are ideally suited for carrying out mechanistic study in active ziegler - natta catalyst system . they allow for an experimental observation of the first alkene insertion step at the active single - component catalyst . this feature ha been used for studying the mechanism of transfer of the stereochemical information from the bent metallocene backbone and for an experimental characterization of the energy profile of the alkene addition / alkene insertion reaction sequence in active homogeneous ziegler - natta system . the neutral dipolar single - component catalyst ( e.g. , <nUm> ) produce a polyolefin - modified R'-(CHR-CH2)-C4H6-B (C6F5)3- counterion at the end of the initiation period upon entering into the repetitive active catalytic cycle . A thorough investigation of the reaction of diynes , R(C ≡ C)2R , and polyynes , R(C ≡ C)(n)R , with titanocene and zirconocene wa performed using the metallocene source Cp2M(L)(e2-Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) ( m = Ti , L = - ; m = Zr , L = THF , pyridine ) . the conversion show an array of different product generated in complexation , coupling , and cleavage reaction . these result include remarkable structure ( e.g. , five - membered metallacyclocumulenes ) and reaction ( e.g. , C-C single - bond cleavage ) . In addition , the first C-C single - bond metathesis in homogeneous solution wa discovered . the presented finding have been supported by theoretical study . cascade reaction of internal and terminal alkyne , zirconocene hydrochloride , dimethylzinc , and phosphinoyl imines ( prepared in one step from aldehyde and diphenylphosphinoyl amide ) lead to allylic phosphinoyl amide after aqueous workup . microwave acceleration allows the completion of this one - pot reaction sequence in <nUm> min . these allylic amide can be converted into a variety of derivative , including carbamate and sulfonamide , or reacted prior to workup with diiodomethane to give novel c-cyclopropylalkylamides . A solution - phase " library from library " approach wa used to generate an intermediate 20-member library which wa subsequently expanded to a 100-member library by a series of n-functionalizations . the biological activity wa evaluated in an assay for competitive binding to the estrogen receptor ( ERa ) , revealing three potent lead compound of a new structural type . recent abiotic homogeneous catalytic research focusing on the structure and organizational capability of enzyme to discover unique / more efficient catalytic process is compiled . In <nUm> tian et al. reported a series of silane- and siloxane - bridged binuclear zirconocenes and these metallocenes were studied a catalyst for ethylene polymerization in the presence of MAO . sierra et al. described the synthesis of binuclear titanium and zirconium complex , prepared by olefin metathesis . the binuclear CGC titanium catalyst are found to be very active when activated with bisborate B2 or bisborane BN <nUm> cocatalysts . methylene-bridged binuclear bis(imino)pyridyl Fe (II) complex , activated with Al(iBu)3 , are found to exhibit higher activity than the corresponding mononuclear iron catalyst , along with an enhanced molecular weight of the linear polyethylene produced . tetra- and octanuclear half - titanocenes , when activated with MAO , display high ethylene polymerization activity . coupled cluster CCSD(T) calculation with core - valence correlation and complete basis set ( CBS ) limit extrapolation are used to benchmark the performance of commonly used density functionals in computing energy barrier for Zr - mediated reaction involving zirconocene specie . these reaction include ( a ) insertion of the Zr-H bond of Cp2Zr(H)Cl into C = C , ci - C , and C = O bond and ( b ) C-H activation by Zr = N bond in Cp2Zr = NH . the best performing functionals are M06-L , M06 , and M06-2X in the M06 series , all having mean unsigned deviation ( MUD ) le than <nUm> kcal / mol . the worst performing functional is OLYP , with a distinctly large MUD of more than <nUm> kcal / mol . considering also the trend in barrier height and the systematic barrier height deviation , our best recommended functional is M06-2X . In this work , DFT empirical dispersion correction ( DFT-D3 ) is found to improve the performance of barrier height value for most functionals ( especially of OLYP and B3LYP ) . with DFT empirical dispersion correction , we also recommend M06-2X for reaction barrier calculation of Zr - mediated reaction . the compound Cp2M((PR)3) ( m = Zr , r = ph ( 1 ) , cy ( 2 ) ; m = Hf , r = cy ( 3 ) ) and Cp*2Zr((PCy)3) ( 4 ) were prepared and characterized . these compound were prepared by the known reaction of the metallocene dihalide with primary phosphide salt . alternatively , activation of the P-H bond of a primary phosphine by zirconocene yield <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> , respectively . both stabilized metallocene(II) Cp2Zr(SMe2)2 and metallocene generated by in situ reduction were employed . attempt to identify intermediate in these reaction have been undertaken . reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with the phosphide LiPHPh in the presence of NEt4Br affords the specie [Cp2ZrBr((PPh)2)] [NEt4] ( 5 ) . these result suggest a mechanism of formation of the M(PR)3 derivative involving phosphinidene M-PR and M((PR)2) intermediate . intervention in such a mechanism is also accomplished by the additional electron on V(IV) . thus reaction of Cp2V with PH2Ph yield Cp2V((PPh)2) ( 6 ) . although this reaction could not be halted at the intermediate phosphinidene , specie <nUm> wa also generated via the reaction of Cp2VMeCl with LiPHPh . In a similar reaction Cp2V(PC6H2-2,4,6-Me3)2 ) ( 7 ) wa generated in the reaction of Cp2V with PH2(C6H2-2,4,6-Me3) . In contrast , reaction of the specie [Cp2V]+ with PH2Ph led only to the formation of the 18-electron product [Cp2V(PH2Ph)2]+ ( 8 ) . these result are described , and the implication of these result with particular reference to the mechanism of P-P bond formation are considered . compound <nUm> , <nUm> , 4-6 , and <nUm> were characterized crystallographically . compound <nUm> crystallizes in space group P21 / a with a = <nUm> a,b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . compound <nUm> crystallizes in space group P21 / n with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . compound <nUm> crystallizes in space group , I4 / m with a = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . compound <nUm> crystallizes in space group P1 with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . compound <nUm> crystallizes in space group P21 / n with a = <nUm> a,b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . compound <nUm> crystallizes in space group P1 with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , α = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . the complete series of phenylchalcogenolate derivative of permethylzirconocene Cp*2Zr(EPh)2 ( cp* = e5-C5-Me5 ; e = O , S , Se , Te ) ha been prepared by the reaction of Cp*2Zr(CO)2 with PhOH and Ph2E2 ( e = S , Se , Te ) . the molecular structure of all of the derivative Cp*2Zr(EPh)2 have been determined by x-ray diffraction , thereby providing evidence that the nature of the bonding varies a a function of the chalcogen . specifically , the structure of the phenoxo derivative is notably distinct from those of it heavier congener . for example , whereas the Zr-S , Zr-Se , and Zr-Te bond length are comparable to the sum of their respective covalent radius , the Zr-O bond length is significantly shorter than the sum of the covalent radius , a would be anticipated due to an increased ionic contribution to the bonding . In addition , the Zr-O-C bond angle [ <nUm> ° ] in cp*2 - Zr(OPh)2 is effectively linear , whereas the Zr-E-C bond angle for the heavier congener are significantly bent [ <nUm> ° <nUm> ° ] . comparison of the structure of Cp*2Zr(OPh)2 with that of the le substituted zirconocene derivative Cp2Zr(OPh)2 , which posse a bent Zr-O-C moiety [ <nUm> ° ] , suggests that the linearity of Cp*2Zr-(OPh)2 may be attributed to steric factor . thus , short M-OR bond length and linear M-O-R angle are not necessarily a consequence of strong pp-dp lone pair donation from oxygen to the metal . Cp*2Zr(OPh)2 is monoclinic : C2 / c ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , and z = <nUm> . Cp*2Zr(SPh)2 is monoclinic : C2 / c ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> a,b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> - ( 2 ) ° , and z = <nUm> . Cp*2Zr(SePh)2 is hexagonal : P61 ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , and z = <nUm> . Cp*2Zr(TePh)2 is monoclinic : P21 / c ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> a,b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> a,b = <nUm> - ( 2 ) ° , and z = <nUm> . Cp2Zr(OPh)2 is orthorhombic : aba2 ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> a,b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> - ( 8 ) Å , and z = <nUm> . none the five - coordinate , dicationic complex [ cp <nUm> Zr(CH <nUm> CN ) <nUm> ] [ BPh <nUm> ] <nUm> ( 2 ) is formed by reaction of cp <nUm> IZr <nUm> and <nUm> equiv of Ag[BPh <nUm> ] in CH <nUm> CN . A stable derivative of complex <nUm> , [ cp <nUm> Zr(4,4'-dimethylbipyridine)(CH <nUm> CN ) ] [ BPh <nUm> ] <nUm> ( 11 ) , ha been synthesized and fully characterized . reaction of complex <nUm> with PMe <nUm> produce a complex mixture of cp <nUm> Zr IV -PMe <nUm> product . complex <nUm> reacts rapidly with cp <nUm> Zr(CH <nUm> ) <nUm> to form [ cp <nUm> Zr(CH <nUm> )(CH <nUm> CN ) <nUm> ][BPh <nUm> ] ( 10 ) but reacts only slowly with cp <nUm> Zr(CH <nUm> ph ) <nUm> to form [ cp <nUm> zr(e- n CH <nUm> Ph)(CH <nUm> CN)][BPh <nUm> ] ( 3 ) . the relevance of these result to the synthesis of cp <nUm> Zr(R)(L) n + complex is discussed . halide complex cp <nUm> ZrX <nUm> react with complex <nUm> to form the monohalide cation cp <nUm> Zr(X)(L)n + , which are unstable with respect to disproportionation to cp <nUm> ZrX <nUm> and <nUm> in CH <nUm> CN . the chlorozirconocene carboxylates Cp2(Cl)ZrOC(0)R , with formate ( 2a , r = H ) , acetate ( 2b , r = CH3 ) , pivalate ( 2c , r - C4H9 ) , and benzoate ( 2d , r = ph ) a the carboxylate ligand , have been prepared and characterized , and their reaction with the zirconium hydride reagent [Cp2Zr(H)Cl] ] ( 1 ) and [(C5H4Me)2Zr(H)(M-H)]2(6) have been studied . these carboxylates 2a-d are available by treating [Cp2(Cl)Zr]20 with an excess of the requisite carboxylic acid . In CH2C12solution or a BrK pellet , 2a-d have IR spectrum that are consistent with the presence of a chelating , biderttate ( e2-O,O ' ) carboxylate ligand , although the formate also ha equilibrium amount of unidentate ( e1 – O ) carboxylate . In THF solution , however , all exist a solvated e1-O carboxylate complex , possibly Cp2(Cl)Zr(OC(0)R)(THF) . of these zirconocene carboxylates , all but the pivalate react in THF ( but not in toluene ) with <nUm> and yield the requisite aldehyde plus the m-oxo compound [Cp2(Cl)Zr]20 . yield of acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde are 92-93 % . No direct evidence for the postulated m-e1-O,O ’ gem - diolate intermediate Cp2(Cl)ZrOCH(R)-OZr(Cl)Cp2(3a,b,d) during this reduction of ligated carboxylate wa obtained . reduction of the acetate 2b with <nUm> , however , regioselectively affords the m-oxo compound Cp2(Cl)ZrOZr(OCH2CH3)Cp2 , which is consistent with transience of a m-e1'O,O ’ gem - diolate . the kinetics of n-methyl group exchange in zirconocene N,N-dimethyldithiocarbamates , Cp2ZrX(Me2dtc) ( x = Cl , Br , I , me , CH2SiMe3 , CH2CMe2Ph , CH2Ph , OPh , opy ( 4-hydroxypyridinate ) , OXyl ( 2,6-dimethylphenoxide ) ) , and N,N-dimethylthiocarbamates , Cp2ZrX(Me2mtc) ( x = Cl , opy ) , have been studied by variable-temperature1H NMR spectroscopy . for the Cp2ZrX(Me2dtc) complex , rate and activation parameter are relatively independent of the nature of the monodentate ligand when x = halide or alkyl ( k(25 ° C ) = <nUm> – <nUm> s-1 ; DH* = <nUm> – <nUm> kcal / mol ) , but there is a dramatic increase in rate a the p-donating ability of x varies in the order Cl < opy < OPh ; k(25 ° C ) = <nUm> x 104s-1and DH* = <nUm> kcal / mol when x = OPh . No dramatic increase in exchange rate is observed for Cp2ZrX(Me2mtc) a x varies from Cl to opy . except for the aryloxy dithiocarbamate complex , rate and activation parameter are similar to those for related organic dithiocarbamates and thiocarbamates , strongly suggesting a mechanism involving rotation about the C = N bond . Cp2ZrX(Me2dtc) ( x = OPh , opy ) is believed to exchange methyl group by a Zr-S bond - rupture mechanism . this mechanism , which is promoted by the p-donor property of the aryloxy ligand , is inaccessible in aryloxythiocarbamate complex because it would give a higher energy , unobserved stereoisomer . preparative method for the Cp2ZrX(Me2dtc) and Cp2ZrX(Me2mtc) complex and the Cp2Zr(X)Cl intermediate are described . cyclic organohydroborate complex of zirconium monocyclopentadienyl CpZr{(m-H)2BC5H10}3 , <nUm> , and CpZr{(m-H)2BC8H14}3 , <nUm> , were prepared from the reaction of CpZrCl3 with <nUm> mol of K[H2BC5H10] and K[H2BC8H10] respectively , in diethyl ether . compound <nUm> and <nUm> react with the hydride ion abstracting agent BC18F15 to form the same salt [CpZr(OEt)(OEt2)(m-OEt)]2 [HB(C6F5)3]2 , <nUm> . the complex CpZr(Cl){(m-H)2BC8H14}2 , <nUm> , and Cp*Zr(Cl){(m-H)2BC8H14}2 [ where cp* = C2H3 ] , <nUm> , were prepared from the reaction of CpZrCl3 and Cp*ZrCl3 with K[H2BC8H10] in <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio , respectively . an a-hydrogen of a BC8H14 unit form an agostic interaction with Zr in compound <nUm> but not in <nUm> . all of the compound were characterized by single - crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . In reaction of zirconocene dichloride , Cp2ZrCl2 , with <nUm> equiv and an excess amount of BCH6Li , the methyltrihydroborate complex , Cp2ZrCl{(m-H)2BHCH3} , <nUm> , and Cp2Zr{(m-H)2BHCH3}2 , <nUm> , were isolated . the reaction of titanocene dichloride , Cp2TiCl2 , with an excess amount of BCH6Li produced the monosubstituted methyltri-hydroborate complex , Cp2Ti{(m-H)2BHCH3} , <nUm> . the titanium wa reduced from Ti(IV) to Ti (III) , producing a 17- electron , paramagnetic titanocene complex . under a dynamic vacuum at room temperature , compound <nUm> decomposed and produced the zirconium hydride compound Cp2ZrH{(m-H)2BHCH3} . single crystal x-ray structure of <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were determined , crystal data for <nUm> : space group P21 / c , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> . crystal data for <nUm> : space group pna21 , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , z = <nUm> . crystal data for <nUm> : space group fmm2 , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , z = <nUm> . derivatization of silicon surface is an area of intense interest due to the centrality of silicon in the microelectronics industry and because of potential promise for a myriad of other application . In this paper , we investigate the feasibility of Si-Si bond formation directly on the surface to contrast with the more widely studied Si-C and Si-O bond forming reaction . functionalization of hydride - terminated silicon surface with silanes is carried out via early transition metal mediated dehydrogenative silane coupling reaction . zirconocene and titanocene catalyst system were evaluated for heterocoupling of a molecular silane , RSiH3 , with a surface Si-H group on Si ( s ) . the zirconocene catalyst proved to be much more reactive than the titanium system , and so the former wa examined exclusively . the silanes , aromatic or aliphatic , are bonded to the silicon surface through direct Si-Si bond , although the level of incorporation of the trihydroarylsilanes wa substantially higher than that of the aliphatic silanes . the reaction proceeds on nanocrystalline hydride - terminated porous silicon surface , a well a flat Si(100)-Hx and Si(111)-H interface . the reaction were studied by a variety of technique , including FTIR , SIMS , and XPS . an activated side - on - bound ansa - zirconocene dinitrogen complex , [ me <nUm> si(e <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> )(e <nUm> - C <nUm> H <nUm> -3- t Bu)Zr ] <nUm> ( μ <nUm> , η <nUm> ,e <nUm> -N <nUm> ) , ha been prepared by sodium amalgam reduction of the corresponding dichloride precursor under an atmosphere of N <nUm> . both solution spectroscopic and x-ray diffraction data establish diastereoselective formation of the syn homochiral dizirconium dimer . addition of <nUm> atm of H <nUm> resulted in rapid hydrogenation of the N <nUm> ligand to yield one diastereomer of the hydrido zirconocene diazenido complex . kinetic measurement have yielded the barrier for H <nUm> addition and in combination with isotopic labeling study are consistent with a 1,2-addition pathway . In the absence of H <nUm> , the hydrido zirconocene diazenido product undergoes swift diazene dehydrogenation to yield an unusual hydrido zirconocene dinitrogen complex . the N = N bond length of <nUm> Å determined by x-ray crystallography indicates that the side - on - bound N <nUm> ligand is best described a a two - electron reduced [ N <nUm> ] 2- fragment . comparing the barrier for deuterium exchange with [ me <nUm> si(e <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> )(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> -3- t Bu)ZrH ] <nUm> ( μ <nUm> ,e <nUm> , η <nUm> -N <nUm> H <nUm> ) to diazene dehydrogenation is consistent with rapid 1,2-elimination of dihydrogen followed by rate - determining hydride migration to the zirconium . this mechanistic proposal is also corroborated by H <nUm> inhibition and the observation of a normal , primary kinetic isotope effect for dehydrogenation . the current study describes the first in situ synthesis and characterization of a new family of cationic coordination tetrahedron of both the FV and V4E6 type , which are constructed by a new building block based on a trinuclear zirconocene moiety and the dicarboxylate or tricarboxylate anion . by the interaction of (C5H6)2MCl2 ( m = Ti , Zr ) ( <nUm> mol ) and a b-diketone ( keH ) ( <nUm> mol ) , in the presence of triethylamme ( <nUm> mol ) , in acetonitrile solution at <nUm> ° , the compound C5H5MCl(ke)2 weee prepared . A similar reaction with tropolone ( TH ) gave C5H5ZrT3 . the monomeric nonelectrolytes C5H5MCl(ke)2 weee investigated by infrared and variable - temperature 1H nmr spectroscopy , which indicated that these compound all exist a the ci isomer in solution with the exception of C5H5TCl(acac)2 for which two isomer are observed . dimeric Zr (III) complex have been prepared by thermolysis of (e5-C5H5)2ZrII-bis(phosphme) compound . these dimeric Zr (III) complex can also be prepared by treating “ zirconocene ” with phosphine . the structure of these dimeric Zr (III) complex ha been determined spectroscopically to contain (e5-C5H5)(e1:e5-C5H4])Zr unit . “ zirconocene ” is proposed to contain similar unit . oxidation of these Zr (III) compound by secondary phosphine , by O , and by I2 is described . the binuclear zirconocene hydride complex [(e5-C5H4CH3)2ZrH(u-H)]2 wa prepared by the stoichiometric addition of <nUm> equiv of LiAlH(0-t-Bu)3 to <nUm> equiv of (e5-C5H4CH3)2ZrCI2 and wa characterized by elemental analysis , IR , NMR , hydrolysis , and x-ray diffraction method . the molecular structure of this binuclear complex consists of two (e5-C5H4CH3)2ZrH molecular unit linked by two three - center , two - electron Zr-H-Zr bond . it molecular geometry is constrained by a crystallographic center of inversion , which requires a trans orientation for the two terminal hydride . the important bond angle within the H2Zr core are Ht,-Zr-Hb = <nUm> (1)A , Ht-Zr-Hb ‘ = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , Hb-Zr-Hb ‘ = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , and Zr-Hb-Zr ’ = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , and the metal-hydrogen bond distance are Zr-H , = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , Zr-Hb = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , and Zr-Hb ‘ = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å . so that inter-ring repulsion introduced during dimer formation might be relieved , the methylcyclopentadienyl ring have been rotated so that the methyl substituents on opposite side of the molecule are directed away from one another . the compound crystallizes in a triclinic unit cell of PI symmetry with refined lattice parameter of a = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) a,c = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , a = <nUm> ( 3 ) ° , β = <nUm> ( 3 ) ° , γ = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , V = <nUm> ( 3 ) A3 , z = <nUm> dimer of fw <nUm> per cell , and pcalod = <nUm> g / cm3 . full - matrix least - square refinement ( based on F ° <nUm> ) of <nUm> diffractometry data converged with final discrepancy index of R(F0) = <nUm> , R(F02) = <nUm> , and Rw(F ° <nUm> ) = <nUm> with s1 , = <nUm> . the selective synthesis of a AuI complex of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid , namely , [Au(SC6H4-4-COOH)(PMe2Ph)] ( 1 ) , is reported . it show interesting photoluminescence ( PL ) property , for example , high PL quantum yield , multicomponent emission , and an unusually large PL lifetime . this complex wa further applied a a metalloligand for the synthesis of [ Cp*2Zr{k1O-OOCC 6H4-4-SAu(PMe2Ph)}{k2O , O'-OOCC6H4-4-SAu(PMe2Ph) } ] ( 3 ) , one of the rare AuI / IVZr complex . for the first time the exchange between the two ligand , which are bound in mono- and bidentate fashion , respectively , could be observed with the help of variable - temperature NMR spectroscopy . for the corresponding monometallic zirconocene complex [ Cp*2Zr(k1O-O2CC6H 4-4-SH)(k2O,O'-O2CC 6H4-4-SH ) ] ( 2 ) the activation parameter of this exchange could be determined by line shape analysis . A simple new route to access heterometallic alkoxo precursor for a wide range of material is reported . this unique synthetic method comprises elimination of the cyclopentadienyl ring from cp <nUm> MCl <nUm> ( m = Ti , Zr ) a CpH in the presence of M'(OR) <nUm> ( M' = Ca , Mn ; OR = OCH <nUm> CH <nUm> OCH <nUm> or OEt ) in an alcohol a a source of proton . In one - pot reaction , we have prepared four different compound with Ti <nUm> Ca <nUm> ( μ <nUm> -O ) , cp <nUm> Zr <nUm> Ca <nUm> ( μ <nUm> -Cl ) , Zr <nUm> Mn <nUm> ( μ <nUm> -O ) <nUm> , and cp <nUm> Ti <nUm> ( m-OEt ) <nUm> motif . the compound were characterized by single - crystal x-ray structural analysis and NMR spectroscopy . new early - late heterobimetallic hydride (L2ZrCl)(Cp*Ir) ( m-H ) <nUm> ( <nUm> ; L ) cp derivative , cp* ) e5- C5Me5 ) were synthesized from zirconocene derivative ( L2ZrCl2 ) and LiCp*IrH3 via a salt elimination reaction and structurally characterized by NMR and x-ray analysis . upon treatment of <nUm> with an alkyllithium reagent , hydride abstraction complex <nUm> underwent thermolytic ligand elimination at the Zr-Ir system to yield a novel planar square complex (L2Zr)2(Cp*Ir) <nUm> ( μ 3- H ) <nUm> ( 2 ) . when a labeling study of the reaction wa conducted , it wa found that the conversion of <nUm> to <nUm> involves rapid aromatic and benzylic C-H activation by a coordinatively unsaturated dinuclear complex (L2Zr)(Cp*Ir)(H) <nUm> ( 3 ) . the reaction of 5,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)cyclopentadiene with CpZrCl3 ( cp = e5-C5H5 ) affords the monostan - nylated metallocene complex (e5-Me3SnC5H4)CpZrCl2 ( 1 ) , accompanied by variable amount of (e5-ClMe2-SnC5H4)CpZrCl2 ( 2 ) . the complex ( 1 ) reacts with BCl3 or with ClI to afford <nUm> ( Sn-CH3 cleavage ) , but with ClH , Cp2ZrCl2 is obtained instead ( Sn-Cp cleavage ) . depending on the reaction condition , treatment of either <nUm> or <nUm> with BBr3 affords (e5-BrMe2SnC5H4)CpZrBr2 ( 3 ) or (e5-Br2MeSnC5H4)CpZrBr2 ( 4 ) . the reaction of <nUm> with excess I2 affords the iodostannylated complex (e5-IMe2SnC5H4)CpZrCl2 ( 5 ) . two of the complex ( 2*2C6H5CH3 and 4*THF ) are crystallographically characterized . the adduct 4*THF ha a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry about tin with a long O-Sn distance of <nUm> Å . we find overall that Me3Sn substituents undergo electrophilic halodemethylation much more readily than corresponding Me3Si substituents , whereas the reactivity of the halostannylated complex toward nucleophiles such a airborne moisture are much lower than those of their halosilylated counterpart . the kinetics of ethylene / norbornene copolymerization with rac-Et(1-indenyl) 2ZrCl <nUm> ( 1 ) and [ 2,2'-Me(1,3-Me 2Cp ) 2]ZrCl <nUm> ( 2 ) catalyst with modified methylaluminoxane are analyzed through experimentation and theoretical modeling . these catalyst show that the rate of norbornene incorporation into the copolymer is strongly catalyst dependent . for example , while catalyst <nUm> show a decreasing polymerization rate with an increase in the norbornene concentration , catalyst <nUm> show a monotonically increasing polymerization rate with an increase in the norbornene concentration for a norbornene / ethylene mole ratio up to <nUm> in the bulk liquid phase . both terminal and penultimate model are developed to describe the rate process with these catalyst . it is shown that for both catalyst system the penultimate model yield a more accurate description of the copolymerization kinetics than the terminal model . the penultimate model ha also been applied to a continuous copolymerization reactor system with catalyst <nUm> . the copolymerization wa also carried out in a continuous stirred tank reactor . the model simulation result and the experimental data of norbornene conversion , solid content , and glass transition temperature profile obtained from a laboratory - scale continuous reactor operation have been compared . interestingly , the model simulation show that the ethylene concentration in the bulk liquid phase is much lower than the saturated ethylene concentration , suggesting that mass - transfer resistance might be present for the ethylene gas in reaching the catalytic site in the liquid phase . the present study focused on the application of mixed OTi 2-SiO2 - supported methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) with a zirconocene catalyst on the linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) production . At low concentration of O2Ti present in the mixed support , it revealed that O2Ti wa decorated on the O2Si surface and acted a a spacer to anchor MAO to the O2Si surface resulting in le steric hindrance and le interaction . As a result , catalytic activity via ethylene / 1-olefin copolymerization apparently increased with the presence of O2Ti . besides increased activity , the presence of O2Ti in the mixed support can result in a slightly lower molecular weight ( MW ) of polymer , suggesting a higher chain transfer rate . A high - pressure , high - temperature continuous stirred - tank reactor ( CSTR ) system having approximately an ideal residence time distribution ( RTD ) ha been set up for the polymerization of olefin utilizing metallocene catalyst . preliminary experiment of ethylene polymerized with the metallocene catalyst system zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) / modified-methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) / trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) in toluene at <nUm> psig have been carried out . the reactor system showed good control over temperature , pressure , and ethylene feed rate . the steady state wa obtained after four mean residence time ( <nUm> τ 's ) . with increasing Cp2ZrCl2 concentration , the molecular weight ( MW ) of polyethylene ( PE ) decreased and the catalyst activity ( kg of PE / ( [ethylene]*g of catalyst ) ) increased . with increasing temperature between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C , the MW of PE decreased and molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) polydispersity increased . EsP with weight - average molecular weight ( mw ) <nUm> 000-52 <nUm> were obtained . the catalyst activity decreased with increasing temperature with an apparent activation energy of <nUm> kJ / mol . the deactivation of the catalyst is first - order with the rate constant kd = <nUm> × 10-3 s-1 at <nUm> ° C . the rate constant of propagation and b-scission at <nUm> ° C are kp = <nUm> × <nUm> (M*s)-1 and ktr,b = <nUm> s-1 . the first example of a new class of main group metallacycles , stibathiolanes , have been synthesized via transmetalation from zirconocene metallacycles . the x-ray crystal structure of three 1-halostibathiolanes have been determined and the compound found to be polymeric in the crystalline state . physical and spectroscopic data indicate that the compound are monomeric in hydrocarbon solution but that they undergo rapid - reversible halide - exchange reaction . A consequence of one of these exchange reaction is the inversion of stereochemistry at antimony . the process have been investigated by using a variety of NMR and crossover experiment . the proposed intermediate for the inversion of stereochemistry at the metal center is supported by the solid - state structure of the compound in which the proposed connectivity of the intermediate is crystallographically established . zirconocene complex of substituted naphthalynes have been generated in situ and trapped with nitrile to form azametallacycles with excellent regiochemical control . these compound can be converted into ketone , a-iodo ketone , and iodoacylnaphthoquinones with experimentally simple procedure . none none none none none none none none none none reaction of zirconocene and hafnocene silyl derivative CpCp'M(SiR3)Cl ( cp = e5-C5H5 ; cp' = cp or cp* , cp* = e5-C5Me5 ; m = Zr or Hf ; r = me or SiMe3 ) with hydrosilanes have been investigated . the observed product depend on the nature of the starting material , since in some case the initial s-bond metathesis product react further via dehydrocoupling process . for example , Cp2Zr(SiMe3)Cl reacts with PhSiH3 to give the direct product Me3SiH and Cp2Zr(SiH2Ph)Cl , which then combine rapidly with PhSiH3 to produce [Cp2ZrHCl]n , PhH2Si-SiH2Ph , and PhH2Si-SiHPh-SiH2Ph . thus , hydrosilyl complex obtained from such reaction can be contaminated by significant quantity of the corresponding hydride . the s-bond metathesis reaction of CpCp*Hf[Si(SiMe3)3]Cl ( 2 ) with hydrosilanes RR'SiH2 cleanly give the isolable metal silyl derivative CpCp*Hf(SiHRR')Cl ( SiHRR' = SiH2Ph ( 8 ) , SiH2(p-Tol) ( 9 ) , SiH2(p-MeOC6H4) ( 10 ) , SiH2(p-FC6H4) ( 11 ) , SiH2Mes ( <nUm> , me = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2 ) , SiH2CH2Ph ( 13 ) , SiH2Cy ( 14 ) , SiHPh2 ( 15 ) , SiHMePh ( <nUm> , a a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of diastereomers ) , and SiHPhSiH2Ph ( <nUm> , a a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of diastereomers ) ) . In general , primary or secondary silanes will undergo such reaction , provided that a le sterically hindered silyl ligand is introduced at hafnium . tertiary silanes such a Me3SiH and Et3SiH do not react under comparable condition . reaction of <nUm> with bis(silyl) compound have provided the bimetallic complex 1,4-CpCp*(Cl)HfSiH2C6H4SiH2Hf(Cl)CpCp* ( 19 ) and the thiophene derivative 2,5-CpCp*(Cl)HfSiH2(C4H2S)SiH2Hf- (Cl)CpCp* ( 20 ) . the thermal ( dark ) reaction of <nUm> with PhSiH3 obeys a second - order rate law , rate = k[2] [PhSiH3] , with DH' = <nUm> ( 7 ) kcal mol-1 , DS' = <nUm> ( 2 ) eu , and kH / kD ( <nUm> ° C ) = <nUm> ( 1 ) . these parameter suggest that the above s-bond metathesis reaction involve four - center transition state similar to those that have been proposed for “ hydrocarbon activation ” reaction of d0 ; metal complex . visible light accelerates the reaction of <nUm> with hydrosilanes , via excitation of a low - intensity transition at <nUm> nm ( ϵ = <nUm> dm3 mol-1 cm-1 ) , which appears to have considerable silyl - to - metal charge - transfer character . the quantum yield for the reaction of <nUm> with <nUm> or <nUm> equiv of PhSiH3 is 1.0*0.1 . use of radical trap failed to provide evidence for intermediate radical in this photochemistry . possible mechanism for the observed photochemical conversion are discussed . reaction of <nUm> with alkoxyhydrosilanes HSi(OMe)2R' provide route to the new complex CpCp*Hf(SiH2Me)Cl ( <nUm> , R' = me ) and CpCp*Hf(SiH3)Cl ( <nUm> , R' = OMe ) . these reaction appear to proceed via initial , metal - catalyzed redistribution of the alkoxyhydrosilanes ( e.g. , HSiMe(OMe)2 is redistributed to MeSi(OMe)3 and MeSiH3 ) , followed by trapping of the new hydrosilane by <nUm> . the Hf-Si distance observed for <nUm> ( <nUm> ( 4 ) and <nUm> ( 4 ) Å for the two independent molecule ) is much longer than that observed for <nUm> ( <nUm> ( 3 ) Å ) , apparently because of greater ligand - ligand repulsion in <nUm> . In zirconium - catalyzed carbomagnesation of alkene , the dramatic enhancement in reactivity and selectivity induced by an internal lewis base is such that higher order alkylmagnesium halide , normally significantly le reactive than EtMgCl , may be used efficiently . In reaction with n-BuMgCl , two secondary carbon stereogenic center are formed with excellent level of stereocontrol ( <nUm> , > <nUm> % ) . experimental data are presented which demonstrate that the observed level of selectivity and reactivity are not simply the result of regioselective insertion of the alkene into the zirconacyclopropane . A general mechanism scheme for carbomagnesation of bicyclic substrate <nUm> is presented . noteworthy mechanistic issue are the following : ( 1 ) excess alkylmagnesium halide is required for high level of regioselectivity and substrate reactivity . we suggest that the influence of the grignard reagent stem from generation of the zirconate complex <nUm> ( r = H , me , or et ) , which may be more susceptible to ligand exchange than it zirconacyclopropane precursor <nUm> . subsequent formation of the zirconocene complex of the reacting alkene would then lead to the high level of reactivity and selectivity observed in reaction where excess alkylmagnesium halide is present . ( 2 ) deuterium labeling experiment demonstrate that the resident lewis base strictly control and revers the mode of metallacyclopentane cleavage . the heteroatom bind and delivers magnesium to initiate a highly regioselective metallacyclopentane cleavage , effecting a Mg-Zr exchange with inversion of configuration . A mechanism for the dehydropolymerization of hydrosilanes to polysilanes , a catalyzed by early - transition - metal metallocene derivative , is proposed . this mechanism is based on two s-bond metathesis reaction that pas through four - center transition state : ( 1 ) the dehydrometalation of silane , H(SiHR)nH , with a metal hydride to give hydrogen and a silyl derivative , M(SiHR)nH , and ( 2 ) coupling of the metal silyl derivative with more hydrosilane , H(SiHR)mH , to produce H(SiHR)n(SiHR)mH and regenerate the active metal hydride catalyst . this proposal is based on a number of observed , stoichiometric s-bond metathesis reaction involving zirconocene and hafnocene complex . these reaction , which involve silicon , hydrogen , and a d0 metal center , are rather facile and apparently reflect the tendency of silicon to expand it coordination sphere under these condition . one reaction of this type is rapid MH / HSi hydrogen exchange , for example between PhSi3 and CpCp*MHCl ( <nUm> , m = Zr , or <nUm> , m = Hf ) , which is observed via deuterium labeling . hydrogenolysis of CpCp*M[Si(SiMe3)3]Cl ( <nUm> , m = Zr , and <nUm> , m = Hf ) provides a convenient route to the monomeric hydride complex <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . the first step in the proposed polymerization mechanism , which is the reverse of M-Si bond hydrogenolysis , is observed in stoichiometric reaction of <nUm> or <nUm> with PhSi3 to give hydrogen and the phenylsilyl complex CpCp*M(SiH2Ph)Cl ( <nUm> , m = Zr , and <nUm> , m = Hf ) . the thermolytic decomposition of <nUm> to <nUm> result in Si-Si bond formation , with the production of polysilane oligomers . this second - order reaction exhibit a deuterium isotope effect at <nUm> ° C of <nUm> ( 2 ) and activation parameter ( DH ‡ = <nUm> ( 2 ) kcal mol-1 and DS ‡ = <nUm> ( 6 ) eu ) that suggest a four - center transition state . the second - order reaction of <nUm> with PhSiH3 ( to give <nUm> and (SiHPh)n polysilanes ) wa also studied kinetically and found to exhibit similar kinetic parameter . this s-bond metathesis reaction , which corresponds to the second step in the proposed mechanism , is believed to pas through a four - center transition state that result from interaction of the CpCp*(Cl)Hf-SiH2Ph and H-SiH2Ph bond . evidence for the role of hydride complex a true catalyst is obtained by comparing gel permeation chromatogram for polysilanes obtained from both <nUm> and <nUm> a catalyst . observed reaction of CpCp*Hf[Si(SiMe3)3]Me ( 7 ) with PhSiH3 , to give CpCp*Hf(SiH2Ph)Me ( 8 ) and then CpCp*Hf(H)Me ( 9 ) , model proposed process for the activation of catalyst precursor . the step - growth character of the reaction is illustrated by the slow dehydrocoupling of PhSiH3 by Cp*2HfH2 , which allows observation of early polysilane intermediate ( di- , tri- , and tetrasilane ) . the participation of M(SiHPh)nH complex a intermediate in dehydrocoupling wa investigated . partly on the basis of the observed reaction of CpCp*Hf[(SiHPh)3H]Cl ( 11 ) with PhSiH3 to give <nUm> and H(SiHPh)3H , it is concluded that a preferred dehydrocoupling pathway involves monosilyl intermediate , MSiH2Ph , and chain growth by one monomer unit per catalytic cycle . implication of the proposed mechanism are discussed . several example are described where in situ generated ( e2-alkyne ) group <nUm> metallocene type substrate add to X-[M2] reagent ( M2 = main group metal ) to form dimetallabicyclic product Cp2M(m-e1:e2-RCCR)(m-X)[M2] which contain a planar-tetracoordinate carbon center in the m-e1:e2-hydrocarbyl bridge . thus , (e2-cyclohexyne)(PMe3)ZrCp2 ( 4a ) reacts in this way with excess trimethylgallium to give Cp2Zr(m-e1:e2-C6H8)(m-CH3)GaMe2 ( 6a ) . complex 6a is one of the rare example of a gallium compound containing s-hydrocarbyl bridge to this heavy main group metal . complex 6a wa characterized by x-ray diffraction . it crystallizes in space group P21 / c with cell parameter a = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . complex 6a contains a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom C(2) with pertinent bond distance and angle of <nUm> ( 5 ) Å [Zr-C(2)] , <nUm> ( 5 ) Å [Ga-C(2)] , <nUm> ( 8 ) Å [C(2)-C(3)] , <nUm> ( 7 ) Å [C(1)-C(2)] , <nUm> ( 4 ) ° [C(3)-C(2)-C(1)] , <nUm> ( 3 ) ° [C(3)-C(2)-Ga] , <nUm> ( 1 ) ° [Ga-C(2)-Zr] , and <nUm> ( 3 ) ° [C(1)-C(2)-Zr] , both cp ring are disordered . zirconium and gallium seem to form a three - center two - electron bond with C(2) . the planar-tetracoordinate geometry at carbon atom C(2) is probably electronically stabilized by the s-donor property of the attached metal center and by a p-conjugative interaction of the C(2)-C(1)-Zr moiety normal to the s-plane . (e2-1,2-Didehydrobenzene)(PMe3)ZrCp2 ( 4b ) reacts analogously with trimethylgallium to give Cp2Zr(m-e1:e2-C6H4)(m-CH3)GaMe2 ( 6b ) in almost quantitative yield . complex 6b crystallizes isomorphously to the corresponding A1 compound in space group P21 / n with cell parameter a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , μ = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . it also contains a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom [C(2)] . the reaction of ph – C ≡ C – GaMe2 ( 7 ) with (hydrido)zirconocene chloride produce Cp2Zr(m-PhCCH)(m-Cl)GaMe2 ( 9 ) which is probably also a similarly structured “ anti-va n't hoff / LeBel complex ” . complex 6a and 6b react with ethylene or norbornene at room temperature with liberation of Me3Ga and formation of five - membered metallacyclic product ( e.g. , bis(e-cyclopentadienyl)zirconaindane is obtained from 6b and ethylene ) . the olefin polymerization reaction by silylene-bridged zirconocene catalyst ha been investigated theoretically . with the ab initio molecular orbital ( MO ) method the structure and energetics of the reactant , the p-complex , the transition state , and the product for insertion of ethylene into (SiH2Cp2)ZrCH3+ have been determined . the nearly Cs - symmetric transition state ha a low activation barrier ( about <nUm> kcal / mol from the p-complex ) . the product show a strong Cb-H agostic interaction . based on the above transition state structure , molecular mechanic ( MM ) calculation have been carried out to investigate the effect of alkyl substituents on olefin and methyl group and other substituents on the cp ring a well a the effect of the alkyl group on Zr , a model polymer chain end . the regioselectivity in propylene polymerization , that the primary insertion is preferred to the secondary insertion , is reproduced well by the energy difference at the transition state but not by that of the p-complex . As to the stereoselectivity in isotactic polymerization of propylene by SiH2(CpMen)2ZrR+ , the substituents on the cp ring have been found to determine the conformation of the polymer chain end , and the fixed polymer chain end conformation in turn determines the stereochemistry of olefin insertion at the transition state . the direct steric effect of the cp methyl group on the olefin insertion stereochemistry is negligibly small . the same direct control mechanism is operational also in syndiotactic polymerization of propylene and 4-methyl-1-pentene . the cationic complex Cp2Zr(CH3)(THF)+ ( <nUm> , a the BPh4- salt ) reacts with 2,6-diethylpyridine to afford the chelated secondary zirconocene - alkyl complex Cp2Zr(e2-C,N-CH{Me}{6-ethylpyrid-2-yl})+ ( 2 ) . treatment of complex <nUm> with CO , C2H3N , tBuCN , and (PhCH2)(Et)3N+Cr affords Cp2Zr(CH{Me}}6-ethylpyrid-2-yl})(CO)+ ( 3 ) , Cp2Zr(CH{Me}{6-ethylpyrid-2- yl})(CH3CN)+ ( 4 ) , Cp2Zr(CH{Me}6-ethylpyrid-2-yl})(tBuCN)+ ( 5 ) , and Cp2Zr(CH{Me}{6-ethylpyrid-2-yl})(Cl) ( 6 ) , respectively . the thermally sensitive d0 carbonyl complex <nUm> is a rare example of a d0 M(alkyl)-CO adduct and is unambiguously characterized in solution by low - temperature NMR and IR spectroscopy , 13C - labeling and hydrolysis experiment , and decomposition study . IR and NMR data establish that <nUm> contains a terminal CO ligand . an x-ray structure analysis of <nUm> establishes that the CH(Me)(6-ethylpyrid-2-yl) ligand adopts a chelated structure ; the similarity of the spectroscopic data for 3-6 implies that 3-5 have similar chelated structure . At room temperature , <nUm> in CD2Cl2 rapidly decomposes to afford a complex mixture of product . 1H NMR monitoring of the decomposition of <nUm> reveals formation of a transient cationic zirconocene-acyl intermediate <nUm> , which undergoes 1,2-H shift to afford a mixture of isomeric / oligomeric zirconocene - enolates . treatment of this mixture with (PhCH2)(Et)3N+CT affords Cp2Zr(OCH = C{Me}{6-ethylpyrid-2-yl})Cl ( 10 ) a a mixture of e / z isomer , establishing the presence of zirconocene - enolate specie . hydrolysis of the decomposition product of <nUm> affords a mixture of thermally sensitive tautomers , enol <nUm> / aldehyde 11' , which are characterized by NMR , FTIR , and mass spectroscopy . treatment of the ansa - metallocene complex [Me2Si(C5H4)2]Zr(butadiene) ( s-cis- / s-trans-4 ) with BC18F15 yield the corresponding ansa-zirconocene[C4H6B(C6F5)3] betaine <nUm> . complex <nUm> is a homogeneous single component ziegler catalyst that actively polymerizes ethene and propene , respectively . with the olefin ethene , propene , 1-butene , 1-pentene , 1-hexene , or 1,5-hexadiene complex <nUm> undergoes a stoichiometric insertion reaction at <nUm> ° C to generate the metallacyclic carbon - carbon coupling product 9a-9f , which feature an internal C4 = C5 alkene coordination to the metal center and an intramolecular C6-Zr ion pair interaction . the rate of the overall 1-alkene insertion process <nUm> → <nUm> ( k(chem) ) wa measured , and the observed rate constant of the degenerate allyl inversion process of the starting material ( <nUm> → ent-6 , k(m)(obs) ) . this allows for a mathematical kinetic deconvolution of the two - step reaction sequence , namely the initial alkene addition process to <nUm> to generate the reactive (p-alkene)(s-allyl)metallocene - type intermediate <nUm> ( rate of formation ( k1[alkene] , rate of alkene dissociation : k-1 ) and the subsequent insertion reaction <nUm> → <nUm> ( k2 ) to give k1 ( = k(chem) + <nUm> k(m)(obs) ) and the ratio k2 / k-1 ( = k(chem) / <nUm> k(m)(obs) ) . this procedure quantitatively determines the two transition state involved . In each case of the <nUm> → 9b - f series the second transition state is higher than the first one : a general energy profile is observed in which the actual insertion step is rate - determining and is preceded by the alkene addition / alkene dissociation preequilibrium . for example , the rate of 1-pentene dissociation at the stage of the intermediate <nUm> to reform the starting material <nUm> is ~ <nUm> time higher than the competing actually product forming alkene insertion reaction to yield 9d . the difference of transition - state energy range from DDG(+)2 = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 for 1-butene insertion to DDG(+)2 = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 for 1-pentene and 1-hexene insertion , respectively . the kinetic analysis of the alkene insertion reaction at the single component ' constrained geometry ' catalyst [Me2Si(C5H4)N(t)Bu]Zr[C4H6B(C6F5)3] <nUm> wa carried out analogously . BC18F15 addition to [Me2Si(C5H4)N(t)Bu]Zr(butadiene) <nUm> yield a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of the stereoisomeric betaine <nUm> A / 11B ( ' supine / prone ' orientation of the ligand ) . the <nUm> A / 11B complex mixture actively polymerizes ethene . At low temperature the <nUm> A / 11B mixture reacts stoichiometrically with the series of olefin listed above to give the mono-alkene insertion product 14a-f , each found in solution a a single diastereoisomer . the kinetic analysis show an even more pronounced alkene addition / alkene dissociation preequilibrium step ( k-1 / k2 ≃ <nUm> for 1-pentene ) followed by rate - determining insertion ( DDG(+)2 ranging from + <nUm> to + <nUm> kcal mol-1 ) . reaction profile featuring the actual alkene insertion step a the kinetically controlling activation barrier could be characteristic for group <nUm> metallocene ziegler catalyst and related system . none none none none zirconocene dichloride catalyzes the addition of ethylmagnesium halide to chiral allylic and homoallylic alcohol and ether in an efficient manner . these transformation proceed with high level of regio- and stereocontrol ; with the appropriate choice of the neighboring heteroatom substituent ( alcohol v ether ) , either of the two diastereotopic face of a chiral alkene can be selectively functionalized . experimental data described indicate that the regio- and stereoselective outcome of catalytic carbomagnesation of acyclic substrate are unique . simple addition of zirconacyclopropanes to unsaturated alcohol and ether proceeds without stereoselection and affords the derived metallacyclopentanes either with no regiocontrol or with a completely opposite sense of regiochemistry compared to that obtained under the catalytic condition . A detailed mechanistic scheme is provided that account for all the characteristic of a zirconium - catalyzed ethylmagnesation reaction . the proposed paradigm includes a biszirconocene complex a it centerpiece ; intermediacy of the bimetallic complex is supported by rate study and readily account for the observed selectivity . the proposed mechanistic hypothesis rationalizes ( i ) the requirement for excess EtMgCl , ( ii ) the necessity for the presence of a lewis basic heteroatom , and ( iii ) the reason for the highly regioselective rupture of the intermediate metallacyclopentane . disubstituted aryl olefin undergo efficient alkylations in the presence of <nUm> mol % Cp2ZrCl2 , n-BuMgCl , and alkyl tosylates or alkyl bromide . In one class of reaction ( table <nUm> ) , the resulting alkyl zirconocene ( initial alkylation product ) undergoes b-hydride abstraction with a hydrogen atom from within the substrate to afford allylic alkylation product ( scheme <nUm> ) . In another category of reaction , where cyclic allylic ether ( chromenes ) are used ( table <nUm> ) , Zr - alkoxide elimination occurs after the C-C bond formation to effect a net allylic substitution . it is proposed that these reaction involve the nucleophilic attack of substrate - derived zirconates or zirconocene - grignard reagent on various tosylates and bromide . there is little or no competitive electrophile alkylation by the n-alkyl grignard reagent . several mechanistic and synthetic aspect of these Zr - catalyzed C-C bond forming reaction are examined and discussed . none none A series of silylamido complex of zirconium , Cp2Zr(X)(NtBuSiMe2H) ( x = H , I , Br , Cl , F ; <nUm> – <nUm> ) , have been prepared . these complex exhibit agostic b-Si-H interaction with the metal center and have been characterized by spectroscopic and structural method . spectroscopic evidence for the interaction of the Si-H m-bond with zirconium include ( 1 ) abnormally large upfield chemical shift for the silicon hydride and silicon nucleus in the 1H and 29Si NMR spectrum , ( 2 ) unusually small value of the silicon-hydrogen coupling constant ( 1JsiH ) and ( 3 ) low - energy Si-H stretching frequency in the infrared spectrum . AH of the spectroscopic data also establish a clear trend for the strength of the nonclassical Zr-H-Si interaction in Cp2Zr(X)(NtBuSiMe2H) : x = H > I > Br > Cl > F . this ordering directly reflects the relative electrophilicity of the zirconium center . the molecular structure of the hydride and chloride derivative <nUm> and <nUm> a determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction study are also consistent with coordination of the Si-H bond to the metal center . In particular , short Zr-Si distance and acute Zr-N-Si angle point to a severe bending of the silyl group toward zirconium , and the location of the amido group near the center of the metallocene equatorial wedge is consistent with a Cp2ML3 coordination environment , not the Cp2ML2 geometry implied by the formula Cp2Zr(NR2)(X) . kinetics , stoichiometric model reaction , and stereochemical study have been employed to investigate the mechanism of the zirconocene - catalyzed cyclization of nonconjugated dienes with organomagnesium reagent . transmetalation of a zirconacyclopentane intermediate with magnesium alkyl ha been implicated a a key step in the catalytic reaction . A zirconacyclopentane derived from <nUm> , 9-diallylfluorene wa prepared and structurally characterized . zirconium metallacyclopentanes transmetalate with dialkylmagnesium reagent having b-hydrogens to form bis-(magnesiomethyl) - substituted carbocycles and product resulting from the elimination of alkane from dialkylzirconocene . metallacycles of this type also act a catalyst precursor for the catalytic cyclomagnesiation of <nUm> , 7-octadiene . the kinetics of the catalytic cyclomagnesiation of <nUm> , 9-diallylfluorene have been examined . the reaction obeys the following rate law : rate = Kobs[Zr][Bu2Mg] when [Bu2Mg] < <nUm> m , and rate = Kobs[Zr] when [Bu2Mg] > <nUm> m . the stereochemistry of the product depends upon the substrate , the magnesium reagent , the magnesium reagent concentration , and the temperature of the cyclization . the diastereoselectivity of the reaction depends on the relative rate of metallacycle formation , isomerization , and transmetalation . an understanding of these relative rate allows for the rational control of the diastereoselectivity to reflect either the kinetic selectivity of metallacycle formation or the thermodynamic stabilites of the diastereomeric metallacycles . with the aim of a possible rationalization of the probability distribution of stereochemical configuration of the regioirregular unit in isotactic polymer sample ( prepared in the presence of rac-ethylenebis(4 , <nUm> , <nUm> , 7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride or rac-ethylenebis(l-indenyl)zirconium dichloride and methylaluminoxane ) , a detailed molecular mechanic analysis on previously proposed model catalytic site is reported . In particular , catalytic intermediate suitable for primary and secondary insertion of propene on primary and secondary polypropene chain , for both system with rac-ethylenebis(4 , <nUm> , <nUm> , 7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl ) and rac-ethylenebis(l-indenyl) ligand , are compared . the model are able to rationalize the observed enantioselectivities , not only for the regioregular placement but also for the regioirregular placement ( secondary insertion on a primary chain and primary insertion on a secondary chain ) . moreover , the nonbonded interaction in the model give a contribution in favor of the monomer coordination suitable for the primary insertion , even after an occasional secondary insertion , and are able to account for the higher regiospecificity observed for titanocene - based , with respect to zirconocene - based , catalytic system . A structural analysis is reported of roughly <nUm> transition - metal (TM)-chalcogenido complex in a variety of chemical environment . with few exception , agreement between calculated and experimental geometry is excellent . the research provides convincing evidence that computational method employed are adequately describing the bonding in these diverse TM complex . interesting trend in relative TMCh ( RMCh' - RMCh ) bond length are found . experimental and computational data show that other than the zirconocene - and hafnocene-oxos there is similar behavior in relative bond length for widely varying TM - chalcogenido complex . relative bond length versus oxo ( S-O , Se-O , and Te-O ) in group IVB metallocenes tend to be larger than for other family of complex and show le variation among the heavier chalcogens ( Se-S , Te-S , and Te-Se ) . analysis of localized wave function for Cp2ZrCh point to a greater contribution from a singly - bonded Zr-Ch structure ( relative to Zr-Ch ) when ch is O compared to heavier chalcogens . taken together , the data suggest that there is a fundamental difference in the zr-oxo ( and hf-oxo ) bond in relation to heavier chalcogens , consistent with recent experimental data . In previous study of multiply bonded TM complex we have focused on the ability of ECPs to make computation feasible for complex incorporating even the heaviest transition metal . the present work also evaluates ECP method for heavier main group ( MG ) element . the chalcogens ( ch ) O , S , Se , and Te are included in this study . none this is the first report on the simulation of the full dynamic , at a quantum mechanical level , of a catalytic chemical reaction . ab initio molecular dynamic simulation on ethylene insertion in a bridged dicyclopentadienyl-methylzirconocene have revealed that the entire reaction path starting from the p-coordinated ethylene-zirconocene complex up to and including propyl formation take place in about <nUm> f , which is unexpectedly fast . this observation suggests the absence of any significant barrier of activation , a confirmed by static energy minimization . the cp ring are very flexible . starting from a reactant structure without a-agostic interaction , at T = <nUm> K such an interaction evolves during the course of the insertion reaction and before the propyl is formed . the product state exhibit g-H agostic interaction . none none the reaction of B(C6F5)3with zirconocene dimethyl complex L2ZrMe2in hydrocarbon solvent affords base - free cationic zirconium complex L2ZrMe+MeB(C6F5)3- ( L = e5-C5H5 , <nUm> ; e5-Me2C5H3 , <nUm> ; e5-Me5C5 , <nUm> ; e5- (TMS)2C5H3 , <nUm> ) in quantitative yield . A similar reaction using (tBu2C5H3)2ZrMe2results in the formation of the cationic metallacyclic product tBu2C5H3 ) [ tBuC5H3(Me2)CH2Zr+MeB(C6F5)3- ( 6 ) through what is presumably an intramolecular C-H activation process . complex <nUm> and <nUm> undergo rapid hydrogenolysis to yield the corresponding cationic hydrido complex (Me5C5)2ZrH+MeB(C6F5)3- ( 7 ) , (Me5C5)2ZrH+HB(C6F5)3- ( 8 ) ( stepwise ) , and (tBu2C5H3)2ZrH+MeB(C6F5)3- ( 9 ) , respectively . complex <nUm> undergoes slow conversion to { [(Me2C5H3)2ZrMe]2(m- F)]+MeB(C6F5)3- ( 12 ) in C6D6under an inert atmosphere at <nUm> ° C . complex <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> have been characterized by x-ray diffraction ( crystal data : <nUm> , monoclinic , P21 / n , a = <nUm> a,b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , r = <nUm> ; <nUm> , monoclinic , P21 / n , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β - <nUm> ° , r = <nUm> ; <nUm> , triclinic , pi , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , r = <nUm> ; <nUm> , monoclinic , p21a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , r = <nUm> ; <nUm> , triclinic , pi , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , r = <nUm> ; <nUm> , triclinic , p1a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° ,R = <nUm> ) . these structure determination allow detailed analysis of the metrical aspect of L2ZrMe+MeB(C6F5)3- ion pairing on the solid state . As revealed by dynamic1H NMR , complex 1-4 undergo rapid intramolecular Zr-Me / B-Me exchange ( [?]G*(s , kcal / mol , ° C , complex ) = <nUm> ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ; <nUm> ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ; <nUm> ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ; <nUm> ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ) and for <nUm> and <nUm> , symmetrizing ion - pair dissociation - recombination process ( [?]G*(s , kcal / mol , ° C , complex ) = <nUm> ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ; <nUm> ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ) . complex 1-4 , <nUm> , and <nUm> are highly active homogeneous catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene with activity ( <nUm> - <nUm> x <nUm> g polyethylene / mol Zr h atm at <nUm> ° C ) comparable to methylalumoxane - based zirconocene catalyst . complex 1-3 , <nUm> and <nUm> are also active for the atactic polymerization of propylene . In regard to polymerization chain transfer mechanism , NMR endgroup analysis and labeling experiment using CH2 = CH13CH3indicate the predominant pathway for <nUm> and <nUm> is 0-H elimination , while for <nUm> it is 0-CH3elimination . these experiment unambiguously rule out propylene C-H activation process a an important chain transfer pathway . complex <nUm> is highly active for the catalytic dimerization of propylene ( nt = <nUm> s-1at <nUm> ° C ) to form a mixture of 2-methyl-l-pentene and 2-methyl-2-pentene . the development of a new method for the regiospecific synthesis of polysubstituted indoles and indolines is reported . the key step involve the generation of zirconocene - stabilized benzyne complex and subsequent intramolecular olefin insertion reaction to provide tricyclic indoline zirconacycles . the zirconacyclic intermediate were cleaved with iodine to yield diiodo indolines , which were converted to a wide variety of indole and indoline product , such a analog of tryptamine , serotonin , tryptophan , and the pharmacophore of CC - <nUm> . In some case zirconocene — imine complex insert CO2 ; more generally they insert isocyanate and cyclic carbonate . isocyanate can insert into either the Zr – C or the Zr – N bond ; protonolysis of the zirconacycle resulting from Zr – C insertion give an amide , whereas protonolysis of the zirconacycle resulting from Zr – N insertion give a urea . steric hindrance on the imine nitrogen or the isocyanate discourages insertion into the Zr – N bond and give clean Zr – C insertion . the molecular structure of an n-phenyl imine complex ( 5a ) ha been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . A coordinated THF in 5a exchange with free THF by a dissociative mechanism . coordination of isocyanate to the Zr of 5a ha not been observed before their insertion . the isocyanate insertion reaction of imine complex such a <nUm> are irreversible . A chelating o-methoxy substituent on the n-phenyl of an imine complex ( 18 ) also prevents insertion into the Zr – N bond and give clean Zr – C insertion . the treatment of <nUm> with ethylene carbonate give a spirocyclic complex ( 23 ) ; methanolysis of <nUm> in benzene give the methyl ester of phenylglycine . A crossover experiment suggests that the free b-hydroxyethyl ester is an intermediate in the benzene methanolysis of <nUm> . none none none the interaction of (e5-C5H5)2ZrX2 ( x = me , Cl ) with Al (tBu)3 and alumoxanes [ (tBu)2Al{m-OAl (Bu)2}]2 and [ (tBu)Al (m3-O)]n ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ha been investigated . the lewis acid — base complex (e5-C5H5)2Zr ( x ) (m-X)-Al (tBu)3 [ x = me ( 1 ) , Cl ( 2 ) ] have been isolated and characterized by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy . the molecular structure of compound <nUm> ha been obtained by x-ray crystallography , indicating the presence of a Zr (m-Cl)Al moiety . the Zr (m-Cl)Al interaction in compound <nUm> is compared to the Al — Cl bond in [PPN][AlCl- (tBu)3 ] ( 4 ) . [ (tBu)2Al{m-OAl (tBu)2}]2 , which contains two three - coordinate ( unsaturated ) aluminum center , show no reaction with (e5-C5H5)2ZrMe2and no catalytic activity toward ethylene polymerization . In contrast , the closed cage compound [ (tBu)Al (m3-O)]6reacts reversibly to give the ion pair complex [ (e5-C5H5)2ZrMe][ (tBu)6Al6 (O)6Me ] ( 7 ) . the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant keq ha been determined and , hence , the enthalpy and entropy for the formation of complex <nUm> [ DH = <nUm> ( 1 ) kJ mol-1 , DS = <nUm> ( 5 ) J mol-1 K-1 ] . complex <nUm> is active a a catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene . polymerization is also observed for mixture of (e5-C5H5)2ZrMe2with [ (tBu)Al (m3-O)]n ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) despite the lack of observable complex formation . A solution structure of <nUm> is proposed upon the basis of NMR spectroscopy and a comparison with [ (Et2O)Li]2[ (tBu)6Al6 (O)6Me2 ] ( 8 ) , formed from the reaction of f (tBu)Al (m3-O)]6with MeLi in Et2O . upon the basis of NMR spectroscopy , compound <nUm> exists a either the anti ( 8a ) or syn ( 8b ) isomer a a result of endo or exo methylation of the aluminum center . the lithium atom in compound <nUm> are formally two - coordinate ; however , close tert-butyl C — H***Li contact suggest the presence of agostic stabilization . these result are discussed with respect to the commercial (e5-C5H5)2ZrMe2- methylalumoxane ( MAO ) polyolefin catalyst system , and the new concept of “ latent lewis acidity ” (GAL-O)is proposed to account for the reactivity of the cage hexamer [ (tBu)Al (m3-O)]6 . crystal data for <nUm> : orthorhombic , pnma , a = <nUm> ( 9 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , rw = <nUm> . crystal data for <nUm> : monoclinic , P21 / n , a = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 7 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , rw = <nUm> . crystal data for <nUm> : orthorhombic , pbca , a = <nUm> ( 8 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 6 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 9 ) Å , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , rw = <nUm> . none zirconocene - catalyzed carbomagnesation reaction of cyclic ether <nUm> and <nUm> with n-PrMgCl and n-BuMgCl afford homoallylic and bishomoallylic alcohol <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> in ~ <nUm> % yield and exceptional level of enantioselectivity and regiocontrol . where n-BuMgCl is used a the alkylating agent , high level of diastereochemical control are also observed ( cf. <nUm> v <nUm> in entry <nUm> and <nUm> of table <nUm> ) . study reported herein underline a number of important mechanistic issue : ( i ) although zirconocene — alkene complex <nUm> exist a a mixture of diastereomers in solution ( syn and anti ) , it is only one of the isomer which reacts to afford the observed product . ( ii ) whereas insertion of an alkene substrate into the unsymmetric complex <nUm> and <nUm> proceeds with low level of regioselectivity at <nUm> ° C , at <nUm> ° C high level of regiocontrol are observed ( cf. intermediacy of <nUm> v <nUm> in scheme <nUm> ) . In this context , various mechanistic experiment shed light on factor that may be responsible for the observed temperature effect . ( iii ) unusual mode of preference for the regioselectivity in b-hydride abstraction of intermediate dialkylzirconocene are reported ; these observation may be accounted for through consideration of the steric effect imposed by the cyclohexyl group of the chiral ligand and the stereoelectronic requirement of the elimination reaction . the first high molecular weight polystannanes , H(SnR2)nH ( r = nBu , nHex , nOct ) , result from dehydropolymerization of secondary stannanes R2SnH2 by zirconocene catalyst . good catalyst include zirconocenes based on both CpCp*Zr ( cp* = e-CsMes ) and Cp2Zr fragment , and the most active catalyst with respect to production of high molecular weight polystannanes wa Me2C(e5-C5H4)2Zr[Si(SiMe3)3]Me . the latter catalyst produced H(SnnBu2)nH chain ( mw / Mn = <nUm> <nUm> / <nUm> <nUm> ) that were contaminated by ca. <nUm> % ( by weight ) low molecular weight cyclic oligomers . lower molecular weight resulted from dehydropolymerizations of Me2SnH2 , PhMeSnH2 , and Ph2SnH2 . At room temperature , H(SnR2)nH ( r = alkyl group ) polystannanes have amax value at ca. <nUm> — <nUm> nm , attributed to σ — s* transition . thermal gravimetric analysis on the polystannanes reveal that these polymer are a thermally stable a related poly(dialkylsilane)s and have onset temperature for thermal decomposition in the range <nUm> — <nUm> ° C , under both nitrogen and air . the H(SnnBu2)nH polymer ha been shown to be a good precursor to sn02 , a shown by bulk pyrolysis in air ( ceramic yield : <nUm> % ) . preliminary result also indicate that these polymer may be useful a precursor to elemental tin . the polystannanes are photosensitive , and their photobleaching behavior ha been characterized by UV — vi spectrometry and 119Sn NMR spectroscopy , which demonstrated that H(SnnBu2)nH is photochemically depolymerized to a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of cyclo-(SnnBu2)5 and cyclo-(SnnBu2)6 . the polymer H(SnnHex2)nH and H(SnnOct2)nH exhibit thermochromic behavior which is visibly evident a a discoloration from yellow to colorless upon warming above room temperature . this reversible behavior is associated with an abrupt change in amax ( e.g. , from <nUm> to <nUm> nm for film of H(SnnOct2)nH ) and a phase change at ca. <nUm> ° C ( by differential scanning calorimetry ) . thin film of H(SnnBu2)nH and H(SnnOct2)nH on glass slide were doped by exposure to SbF5vapor to conductivity of 10-2and <nUm> S cm-1 , respectively . preliminary experiment suggest that the dehydropolymerization occurs by a a-bond metathesis mechanism involving four - center transition state . A previous report on production of high molecular weight poly(dibutylstannane) by the reductive coupling of nBu2SnCl2by Na / 15-crown-5 wa reinvestigated and found to produce only low molecular weight material with mw / Mn = <nUm> / <nUm> . bis(propynyl)zirconocene ( 7a ) reacts with [ cp <nUm> CHZr <nUm> ( THF ) ] + [ BPh <nUm> ] – ( 8a ) to yield the [ (m-propynyl)(m-e <nUm> : η <nUm> -MeCCMe)(Cp <nUm> Zr ) <nUm> ] cation complex 5b that contains a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom . complex 5b wa characterized by x-ray diffraction . the planar-tetracoordinate carbon center ( C2 ) of 5b exhibit four strong bond to it nearest in plane neighbor , i.e. to two carbon and two zirconium center . In solution , complex 5b is dynamic . the C <nUm> symmetric planar-tetracoordinate carbon compound 5b undergoes a thermally induced automerization reaction [ AG* ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol – <nUm> ] that proceeds through a C 2v -symmetric geometry ( 6b ) that ha the characteristic of a transition state according to a theoretical analysis of the <nUm> ⇌ <nUm> ⇌ <nUm> ’ rearrangement process . this mean that the extra stabilization energy of planar-tetracoordinate carbon relative to ordinary planar - tricoordinate carbon in the “ semi-fenestrane ” environment of the complex <nUm> amount to ca. <nUm> – <nUm> kcal mol – <nUm> . the <nUm> ⇌ <nUm> ’ equilibrium is strongly influenced by substituents at the m-e <nUm> : η <nUm> -RCCCH <nUm> ligand and by electronically active cp substitution . In addition , a strong memory effect is operative in the formation of <nUm> . it can be observed by using suitably substituted pair of isomeric complex <nUm> . thus , the reaction between [ cp <nUm> ZrCD <nUm> ( THF ) ] + ( 8d ) and ( MeCp ) <nUm> -Zr( – C ≡ C – CH <nUm> ) <nUm> ( 7e ) give only complex <nUm> h , which exhibit the CH3 group at the planar-tetracoordinate carbon center C2 , whereas the reaction of the complementary reagent combination [ ( MeCp ) <nUm> ZrCD <nUm> ( THF ) ] + ( 8e ) / cp <nUm> zr-( – C ≡ C – CH <nUm> ) <nUm> ( 7a ) ] in this double - labeling experiment exclusively lead to the same type of product ( 5i ) that ha the CD3 group bonded to C2 . this and other example of this organometallic memory effect indicate that dimetallic intermediate are involved in the formation of the unusually structured stable planar-tetracoordinate carbon compound <nUm> . none none this contribution report the synthesis and activity a precatalysts for stereoselective propylene polymerization of several chiral non-C2 symmetric zirconocene and hafnocene complex , (R)- and (S)-Me2Si(Me4C5)-(C5H3R*)MR2 ( r = cl(2) or me(3) ) where R* = (1R,2S,5R)-trans-5-methyl-cis-2-(2-propyl)cyclohexyl ( (-)-menthyl ; m = Zr , ( a ) and m = Hf , ( b ) ) and (1S,2S,5R)trans-5-methyl-cis-2-(2-propyl)cyclohexyl ( (+)-neomenthyl ; m = Zr ( c ) ) . metallocene dichloride were prepared from MCl4 and Li2Me2Si(Me4C5)(C5H3R*) and converted to the corresponding dimethyl complex with MeLi*LiBr . all complex were characterized by standard technique , with absolute configuration established by circular dichroism and x-ray diffraction . for the ( r ) — R* = ( — )-menthyldichloro complex ( 2a ) : space group = F212121 ; a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> A( - <nUm> ° C ) , z = <nUm> ; R(F) — <nUm> , Rw(F) = <nUm> for <nUm> reflection having I > 3s(I) . for the ( r ) — R* = ( — )-menthyldimethyl complex ( 3a ) : space group = P21 ; a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° ( <nUm> ° C ) , z = <nUm> ; R(F) = <nUm> , RW(F) = <nUm> for <nUm> reflection having I > 3s(I) . reaction of either (R)-3a or (R)-3b with BC18F15 in toluene yield two spectroscopically discernible methyl cation . the temperature dependence of the ion - pair equilibrium constant in toluene yield DH = <nUm> kcal / mol and DS = — <nUm> eu for (R)-3a and DH = <nUm> kcal / mol and AS = <nUm> for (R)-3b . “ cationic ” propylene polymerization catalyst were generated from <nUm> + methylalumoxane or <nUm> + methylalumoxane , BC18F15 , Ph3C+B(C6F5)4_ , or HN(nBu3)+B(C6F5)4_ . polymerization activity , stereoregularities , and polymer molecular weight are strongly dependent on cocatalyst identity and concentration , suggesting strong , structure - sensitive ion - pairing effect . polypropylene isotacticities a high a <nUm> % mmmm pentad content are observed , with stereoregularity increasing and polymerization activity falling with decreasing reaction temperature . none page <nUm> : the constant <nUm> in eq <nUm> and <nUm> in eq <nUm> are in error by <nUm> kcal / mol and should read <nUm> ( eq <nUm> ) and <nUm> ( eq <nUm> ) . consequently , the M-H BDE in table II should be <nUm> kcal / mol greater than indicated . the electrode potential used in the equation are referred to the ( H+ / H ) electrode in acetonitrile . when using this potential scale no correction for the free energy of transfer of the proton from acetonitrile to water is necessary . this correction wa erroneously made in eq <nUm> and <nUm> . the relative value of the BDE in table II are not affected by the correction. , IEEE . all right reserved . none none the coupling reaction of zirconocene alkyne complex with a second alkyne provides a general method for the preparation of asymmetrically substituted zirconacyclopentadienes . the overall transformation is the chemoselective and regioselective intermolecular cross-coupling of two alkyne , a goal that ha not been achieved with other methodology . isomerically pure 1,3-dienes or 1,4-diiodo 1,3-dienes are obtained upon treatment of the metallacyclopentadienes with aqueous acid or iodine . because this synthesis can be carried out a a one - pot procedure starting from the alkyne and schwartz 's reagent ( Cp2ZrHCl ) , it is an attractive alternative to other transition - metal - based method for the synthesis of dienes from vinyl halide and isolated vinylmetal starting material . enynes and diynes react with “ ZrCp2 ” ( where cp = e5-C5H5 generated by treating Cl2ZrCp2 with Mg and Cl2Hg or <nUm> equiv of an alkyllithium , such a n-BuLi , or a grignard reagent , such a EtMgBr , and can produce in excellent yield zirconabicycles represented by <nUm> ( m = Zr ) and <nUm> , respectively . their protonolysis can provide the corresponding exocyclic alkene and conjugated dienes <nUm> , respectively . iodinolysis of <nUm> ( m = Zr ) can give the corresponding diiodides in high yield , while carbonylation of <nUm> ( m = Zr ) can produce bicyclic enones <nUm> ( Y = O ) in moderate to good yield . although the bicyclization reaction fails with terminal alkyne containing substrate , various type of substituents on the alkyne moiety , such a alkyl , alkenyl , aryl , trialkylsilyl , and trialkylstannyl group , can be accommodated . investigation of the n-BuLi-Cl2ZrCp2 reaction ha revealed that it give first (n-Bu)2ZrCp2 at <nUm> ° C , which then decomposes to give Cp2Zr(CH2 = CHEt ) , identified a it PMe3 complex <nUm> . the PMe3 - stabilized complex reacts with diphenylacetylene to produce a crystalline compound which ha been identified a a zirconacyclopropene , 36a . this demonstrated , for the first time , the feasibility of converting alkyne into zirconacyclopropenes . the reaction of preformed , three - membered zirconacycles with alkyne give five - membered zirconacycles . the reaction of diphenylacetylene is ca. <nUm> time a fast a that of (E)-stilbene . these result support a mechanism involving formation of a zirconacyclopropene intermediate followed by it intramolecular carbometalation with the alkene moiety of enynes for the Zr - promoted bicyclization of enynes . A general method for the preparation of zirconocene complex of imines ha been developed . the x-ray crystal structure of the (trimethylsilyl)benzaldimine complex 2b show that these complex should be viewed a metallaaziridenes due to significant p-donation from the zirconium center to the p* orbitals of the coordinated imine . these complex undergo a number of chemo- , regio- , and diastereoselective coupling reaction with unsaturated organic compound to cleanly form metallacyclic compound . In situ generation of the complex followed by coupling with alkyne and hydrolysis affords a general route to geometrically pure allylic amine . none none the development of a new macrocyclization reagent , rosenthal 's Cp2Zr(pyr)(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) , ha allowed the preparation of two large , functionalized macrocycles . the diyne 5,5'-bis(4-trimethylsilylphenyl)-2,2'-bipyridine wa trimerized to the bipyridine - containing macrocycle <nUm> , and 1,4-bis(4-(trimethylsilyl)ethynylphenyl)-2,3-diphenyl-1,4-diazabuta-1,3-diene wa dimerized to macrocycle <nUm> . both zirconocene - containing macrocycles were characterized by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . macrocycle <nUm> , which is cleanly converted to air - stable cyclophane <nUm> with benzoic acid , ha a cavity of van der waals radius <nUm> Å . In general , the Cp2Zr(pyr)(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) reagent give higher yield of macrocycles via the coupling of diynes than doe the reagent generated by addition of n-BuLi to Cp2ZrCl2 . none (Butadiene)zirconocene reacts with acetone azine by CC coupling to give a seven - membered metallacyclic <nUm> : <nUm> addition product . In contrast , benzophenone azine reacts with the diene metallocene system with liberation of butadiene to form Cp2Zr(N-CPh2)2 ( 9b ) . this product is also obtained upon irradiation of Cp2Zr(CO)2 with Ph2C-NN-CPh2 or treatment of Cp2ZrCl2 with <nUm> equiv of LiN-CPh2 . the molecular structure of the bis(alkylideneamido)metallocene complex 9b wa determined by x-ray diffraction . the zirconocene complex crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2 / c with cell constant a - <nUm> ( 5 ) , b - <nUm> ( 1 ) , c - <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 8 ) ° , and z = <nUm> . the zirconium bound — N-CPh2 ligand ( including the ipso carbon of the phenyl substituents ) are oriented in the Cp-Zr-Cp bisecting plane . to a first approximation both Zr_N-CPh2 unit can be regarded a being of a heteroallene structural type , characterized by bisecting C-N and N-Zr p-bonding plane and near to sp - hybridized nitrogen center . accordingly , very short zirconium to nitrogen bond distance are observed : N(1)-Zr , <nUm> ( 2 ) Å ; N(2)-Zr , <nUm> ( 2 ) Å . the Zr-N(2)-C(2) unit ( <nUm> ( 2 ) ° ) is slightly le linearly arranged than Zr-N(l)-C(1) ( <nUm> ( 2 ) ° ) . the solid - state structure show a clear distinction of E- and z-oriented phenyl substituents at the Ph2C-N — Zr moiety . this is not observed in solution , however . In the 13C NMR spectrum even at low temperature ( <nUm> K ) complex 9b exhibit only one set of phenyl group carbon resonance . this indicates a rapid equilibration of (E)- and (Z)-phenyl group . this is an uncommon feature for heteroallene - type (alkylideneamido)metallocene complex . we propose a linear to bent to linear (R2C-N)MCp2(X) isomerization reaction sequence to take place rapidly in solution . this unusual dynamic feature attribute to the organometallic compound 9b an intermediate position between organic schiff base ( sp2 - hybridized nitrogen , bent structure ) and stabilized heteroallene - type ( sp - hybridized nitrogen , linear structure ) inorganic (alkylideneamido)metal complex . A variety of zirconocene thioaldehyde complex <nUm> have been prepared in high yield by heating (alkylthio)-methylzirconocenes <nUm> in the presence of PMe3 . the formation of the thiobenzaldehyde complex ( lb ) from Cp2Zr(Me)SCH2Ph ( 2b ) ha been found to follow first - order kinetics independent of trimethylphosphine concentration , with DH ‡ = <nUm> ( 0.1 ) kcal / mol and DS ‡ = <nUm> ( 0.4 ) eu . A large primary kinetic isotope effect ( kH / kD = <nUm> ( 0.2 ) at <nUm> ° C ) wa observed for the transformation . A hammet plot showed that phenyl substituents exert a modest influence on the reaction rate , with ρ = + <nUm> ( 0.02 ) . these observation are more consistent with a concerted four - center cyclometalation process in which the transition state is polarized so that hydrogen move a a proton than with a stepwise b-hydride elimination / reductive elimination sequence . <nUm> , 6-and <nUm> , 7-enynes are efficiently cyclized to bicyclic metallacyclopentenes with titanocene or zirconocene reagent which are easily generated in situ . the metallacycles can be hydrolyzed to release the alkylidenecycloalkane or can be metathesized with main group halide such a C6S , ClSe , or Ph2SnCl2 to give heterocycle . the zirconium - mediated reaction is more effective for sterically demanding case . the alkylidene moiety is introduced with <nUm> % stereoselectivity for the e-diastereomer ; this provides an excellent starting place for the elaboration of chiral side chain a illustrated by a formal synthesis of the ant pheromone invictolide . the cyclization is compatible with alkyl and silyl ether functionality . sugar enynes , efficiently synthesized from readily available sugar lactones , undergo stereospecific cyclization to highly functional , enantiomerically pure carbocycles . none none none none A general method for the in situ production of zirconocene complex of substituted benzynes is reported . these complex can be trapped with nitrile to form good yield of metallacyclic compound with extremely good regiochemical control . these compound can be converted into ketone , a-iodo ketone , and isothiazoles by using experimentally simple procedure . In addition , generation of the benzyne complex under <nUm> atm of ethylene produce metallacycles which can be readily converted into the corresponding benzocyclobutanes . A family of ketene - alkylaluminum complex of formula [(e5-C5H5)2Zr(C,Oe2-OCCHR)]2(m-AlR'2)(m-X) ha been prepared by treating the zirconocene ketene complex [(e5-C5H5)2Zr(C,O-e2-OCCHR)]2with alkylaluminum reagent R'2A1X ( II , III , r = CH2CMe3 , r ’ = me , x = me ; VIa , vila , r = CH2CMe3 , r ’ = CH3 , x = Cl ; VIIb , r = H , r ’ = CH3 , x = Cl ; IX , x , r = CH2CMe3 , r ’ = et , x = H ) . the crystal and molecular structure of four compound of this series ( III , vila , IX , and x ) have been determined . complex vila crystallizes in space group P21 / c ( z = <nUm> ) with cell constant a = <nUm> ( 14 ) A , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , <nUm> = <nUm> ( 14 ) ° , and V = <nUm> ( 10 ) A3 ( <nUm> reflection , r = <nUm> ) . complex IX crystallizes in space group C2 / c ( z = <nUm> ) with cell constant a = <nUm> ( 5 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 11 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 5 ) ° , V = <nUm> ( 2 ) A3 ( <nUm> reflection , r = <nUm> ) . complex x crystallizes in space group C2 / c ( z = <nUm> ) with cell constant a = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 8 ) ° , and V = <nUm> ( 1 ) A3 ( <nUm> reflection , r = <nUm> ) . structural comparison of these molecule reveal several common feature . two zirconocene ketene monomer are spanned by symmetric dialkylaluminum and hydride , chloride , or methyl bridge to form slightly puckered six - membered ring . A notable feature of these structure is the coordination of the bridging ligand x ( H , Cl , or me ) , which is characterized by a large m – x – m angle and an unusual hybridization for the bridging methyl ligand . the coordination of the bridging methyl group in III represents a new bonding geometry for carbon . this geometry model the structure of intermediate in alkyl transmetallations that proceed with inversion . the reaction of III with acetylene produce a zirconocene cyclic enolate IV. complex III also reacts with carbon monoxide to produce a zirconocene acyl-enol complex V — an unprecedented reaction for group <nUm> ketene complex that is relevant to the behavior of such specie over early transition - metal fischer - tropsch catalyst . the greater reactivity of III is discussed in term of the greater lability of the methyl bridge compared to the chloride or hydride bridge . the reaction of lithiated benzhydryl methyl ether with zirconocene dichloride yield Cp2ZrCl(CPh2OCH3) ( 8 ) . the molecular structure of <nUm> in the crystal wa determined by x-ray diffraction . <nUm> crystallizes in the space group P212121 with cell constant a = <nUm> ( 2 ) A , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) A , c = <nUm> ( 6 ) A , and gcalcd = <nUm> g cm-1for z = <nUm> . the most remarkable structural feature of <nUm> is the strong intramolecular coordination of the ether oxygen to the zirconium center . the oxygen bind to the available central position in the bent metallocene s-ligand plane . the resulting metallaoxirane structural subunit is characterized by bond distance <nUm> ( 6 ) A ( Zr-C ) , <nUm> ( 4 ) A ( Zr-O ) , and <nUm> ( 7 ) A ( O-C ) . upon heating to <nUm> ° C , <nUm> decomposes to give tetraphenylethylene and Cp2Zr(OCH3)Cl a the major component . with zirconium hydride Cp2Zr(H)Cl or Cp2ZrH2 <nUm> reacts by intra- and intermolecular insertion reaction of the CPh2 group into the zirconium-hydrogen bond to give two pair of compound : Cp2Zr(OCH3)Cl ( 9 ) / Cp2Zr(CHPh2)Cl ( 24 ) and Cp2ZrCl2 ( 6 ) / Cp2Zr(CHPh2)OCH3(25) . these reaction are strongly reminiscent of the chemistry of the CH2 specie on a fischer - tropsch catalyst surface . metallaoxiranes a <nUm> might , therefore , be considered to serve a molecular model for fischer - tropsch type chemistry on metal oxide surface . this view is supported by the observation that the bridging metallaoxirane unit in (m-formaldehyde)(Cp2ZrCl)2(1) undergoes the same type of insertion reaction . it CO-derived methylene unit is transferred to form (Cp2ZrCl)2O ( 29 ) and Cp2Zr(CH3)Cl ( 22 ) when treated with the oligomeric zirconocene ( hydrido ) chloride <nUm> at <nUm> ° C . the formation of adduct of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane with strongly coordinating anion such a CN- and [M(CN)4]2- ( m = Ni , Pd ) is a synthetically facile route to the bulky , very weakly coordinating anion [CN{B(C6F5)3}2]- and [M{CNB(C6F5)3}4] 2- which are isolated a stable NHMe2Ph+ and CPh3+ salt . the crystal structure of [CPh3][CN{B(C6F5)3} <nUm> ] ( 1 ) , [CPh3][ClB(C6F5)3] ( 2 ) , [NHMe2Ph]2[Ni{CNB(C6F5) 3}4]*2Me2CO ( 4b*2Me2CO ) , [CPh3]2[Ni{CNB(C6F5) 3}4]*2CH2Cl2 ( 4c*2CH2Cl2 ) , and [CPh3]2[Pd{CNB(C6F5) <nUm> } 4]*2CH2Cl2 ( 5c*2CH2Cl2 ) are reported . the CN stretching frequency in <nUm> and <nUm> are shifted by ∼ <nUm> cm-1 to higher wavenumbers compared to the parent tetracyano complex in aqueous solution , although the M-C and C-N distance show no significant change on BC18F15 coordination . zirconocene dimethyl complex L2ZrMe2 [ L2 = cp2 , SBI = rac-Me2Si(Ind)2 ] react with <nUm> , 4c or 5c in benzene solution at <nUm> ° C to give the salt of binuclear methyl-bridged cation , [(L2ZrMe)2(m-Me)] [CN{B(C6F5)3}2] and [(L2ZrMe)2(m-Me)]2 [M{CNB-(C6F5)3}4] . the reactivity of these specie in solution wa studied in comparison with the known [{(SBI)-ZrMe}2(m-Me)][B(C6F5)4 ] . while the latter reacts with excess [CPh3][B(C6F5)4] in benzene to give the mononuclear ion pair [ (SBI)ZrMe+*** B(C6F5)4- ] in a pseudo-first-order reaction , k = <nUm> × 10-4 s-1 , [(L2-ZrMe)2(m-Me)] [CN{B(C6F5)3}2] reacts to give a mixture of L2ZrMe(m-Me)B(C6F5)3 and L2ZrMe(m-NC)B-(C6F5)3 . recrystallization of [Cp''2Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2] [CN{B(C6F5)3}2] affords Cp''2ZrMe(m-NC) BC18F15 <nUm> , the x-ray structure of which is reported . the stability of [(L2ZrMe)2(m-Me)]+X- decrease in the order x = [B(C6F5)4] > [M{CNB(C6F5)3}4] > [CN{B(C6F5)3}2] and increase strongly with the steric bulk of L2 = cp2 ≪ SBI . activation of (SBI)ZrMe2 by <nUm> in the presence of AlBui3 give extremely active ethene polymerization catalyst . polymerization study at 1-7 bar monomer pressure suggest that these , and by implication most other highly active ethene polymerization catalyst , are strongly mass - transport limited . by contrast , monitoring propene polymerization activity with the system (SBI)ZrMe2 / <nUm> / AlBui3 and CGCTiMe2 / <nUm> / AlBui3 at <nUm> ° C a a function of catalyst concentration demonstrates that in these case mass - transport limitation is absent up to [metal] ≈ <nUm> × 10-5 mol L-1 . propene polymerization activity decrease in the order [CN{B(C6F5)3}2]- > [B(C6F5)4]- > [M{CNB(C6F5)3}4]2- ≫ [MeB(C6F5)3]- , with difference in activation barrier relative to [CN{B(C6F5)3}2]- of DDG ‡ = <nUm> ( B(C6F5)4- ) , <nUm> ( Ni{CNB(C6F5)3}42- ) and <nUm> - <nUm> kJ mol-1 ( MeB(C6F5)3- ) . the data suggest that even in the case of very bulky anion with delocalized negative charge the displacement of the anion by the monomer must be involved in the rate - limiting step . none transition metal have the unique ability to simultaneously stabilize high - energy organic specie and to activate them toward selective attack by a variety of chemical reagent . cyclooctyne is the smallest cycloalkyne to have been prepared in the free state while cycloheptyne and cyclohexyne have been observed a fleeting intermediate by several methods.1 several year ago , bennett and co-worker reported the trapping of in situ generated cyclohexyne and cycloheptyne a their bis(triphenylphosphine)platinum complex . this paper report an integrated chemical / physicochemical investigation of the aqueous chemistry of Cp2TiCl2 , Cp2VCl2 , and Cp2ZrCl2 , employing high - field FT NMR , chloride potentiometry , pH titrimetry , and electrical conductivity . experimental condition include those employed previously to study the hydrolysis of cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum(II) ( “ cisplatin ” ) and those approximating physiological . In unbuffered aqueous <nUm> m KNO3 solution at <nUm> ° C , the order of decreasing hydrolytic stability of the M-(e5-C5H5) bond in the Cp2MCl2 complex ( monitored by high - field FT NMR ) wa found to be V ( kinitiai ≤ <nUm> × 10-3 h-1 ) > Ti ( kinitia| = <nUm> ( 1 ) × 10-3 h-1 ) ≫ Zr ( knitial = <nUm> ( 1 ) × 10-2h-1 ) . of the three complex studied , only Cp2VCl2 wa found to posse a stable M-(e5-C5H5) bond at physiological pH . addition of any of the Cp2MCl2 complex to water ( pure or <nUm> m KNO3 ) result in rapid chloride ion dissociation with approximate half - life for the loss of the second chloride ( the first is too rapid to measure ) of <nUm> min ( m = Ti ) , <nUm> min ( m = Zr ) , and <nUm> min ( m = V ) in contrast to the relatively slow chloride hydrolysis observed with cisplatin . chloride dissociation is also more extensive than that in cisplatin . equilibrium chloride ion concentration measurement indicate that the equilibrium constant ( K1 ) for the first Cp2MCl2 chloride dissociation is too large to measure , while K2 = <nUm> ( 2.7 ) × 10-2 m ( m = Ti ) and <nUm> ( 1.2 ) × 10-3 m ( m = V ) . titrimetric study indicate that the acidity of the Cp2M2+ - bound water molecule is uniformly more acidic than the metal - bound water molecule of cis-[Pt(NH3)2(H2O)2]2+ ( Ti , pKa = <nUm> ( 5 ) and <nUm> ( 9 ) ; V , pKa = <nUm> ( 3 ) and <nUm> ( 13 ) ) . implication of these result for the observed biological activity of the Cp2MCl2 complex are briefly discussed . the reaction of alkyne with a methylalane , such a Me3Al , and a zirconocene derivative , such a Cl2ZrCp2 , provides a convenient and selective route to (E)-2-methyl-1-alkenylalanes in high yield . the reaction is catalytic in Zr . the stereoselectivity is generally > <nUm> % , and the regioselectivity observed with terminal alkyne is typically ca. <nUm> % . although the reaction of alkyne with trialkylalanes containing b-hydrogens and Cl2ZrCp2 is complicated by competitive hydrometalation and diminished ( 70-80 % ) regioselectivity , the hydrometalation reaction can be avoided by using chlorodialkylalanes and Cl2ZrCp2 . the Zr - catalyzed carboalumination reaction of typical alkyne , such a phenylacetylene and 1-octyne , most likely involves direct Al-C bond addition assisted by Zr . none the soluble bis(cyclopentadienyl)bis(phenyl)titanium / methylalumoxane catalyst system produce isotactic polypropylene with a novel stereoblock microstructure consistent with a chain - end stereochemical control mechanism . chiral catalyst derived from the racemic enantiomer of ethylene-bridged indenyl derivative are the first metallocene catalyst to form isotactic polypropylene with the conventional structure predicted by an enantiomorphic - site stereochemical control model . the meso achiral form of the ethylene-bridged titanium indenyl diastereomers and zirconocene derivative produce polypropylene with an ideally atactic structure . differing regiospecificities during ci addition with soluble Ti and V chain - end controlled stereospecific system result in Ti being isotactic specific and V being syndiotactic specific . none ion pair of the type Cpx2ZrMe+***A - containing various ansa - zirconocene methyl cation in contact with Me-B(C6F5)3- or B(C6F5)4- anion have been studied with regard to their anion exchange kinetics by 2D - NMR method in benzene or toluene solution . the result - acceleration of anion exchange by added Li+***Me-B(C6F5) 3- , substantial nonproductive exchange between added and Zr - bound Me-B(C6F5)3- anion , an increase of exchange rate at increased zirconocene concentration , and the exclusively entropic origin of this rate increase - all indicate that anion exchange occurs by way of ion quadruple or higher ionic aggregate , rather than via dissociation to solvent - separated ion . these finding imply that solvent - separated ( i.e. anion - free ) alkyl zirconocene cation are unlikely to be relevant intermediate in reaction system containing Cpx2ZrMe+***A - ion pair and , hence , also in zirconocene - based catalyst system for the polymerization of a-olefins . none none reduction of bis(e-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride with potassium naphthalene , at low temperature in tetra-hydrofuran , yield m-(2-e1;:1-2-e2-naphthyl)-hydrido-bis[bis(e-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium] ( Zr-Zr ) , (e-C5H5)2-Zr(C10H7)(H)Zr(e-C5H5)2 ( hereinafter labeled I ) . the compound wa characterized by a combination of chemical method and x-ray crystallography . crystal of I are orthorhombic , of space group pbca ( centrosymmetric ) , cell parameter a = <nUm> ( 8 ) , b = <nUm> ( 6 ) , and c = <nUm> ( 8 ) nm , and contain eight molecule of C15H14Zr per unit cell . key structural parameter follow : D(Zr-Zr) = <nUm> ( 2 ) , mean D(Zr-C5H5 , centroid ) = <nUm> ( 3 ) , D(Zr-e1-naphthyl , carbon ) = <nUm> ( 1 ) nm . the hydrido ligand in I wa not located by the x-ray work , but it presence wa inferred from 1NMR spectrum in THF-d8 , which show a singlet at d(CH3)4Si-9.3 . reaction of I with excess CH3I yield <nUm> mol CH4 / zr2 unit , which is in accordance with the monohydride structure . with ClH in THF , dicyclopentadienylzirconium dichloride , hydrogen , naphthalene , and a mixture of partially hydrogenated and hydrochlorinated naphthalene are formed . reaction of the complex with H in THF yield naphthalene and dicyclopentadienylzirconium dihydride . In toluene and THF solution , I is a catalyst for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene to cyclohexane . none none zirconocene and hafnocene dichloride react with appropriate organolithium reagent to form stable dimethyl and diphenyl derivative , in the same manner a doe titanocene dichloride . the bis(p-indenyl) dihalides of titanium , zirconium , and hafnium likewise lead to dimethyl and diphenyl compound which in general appear to be more stable than the corresponding p-cyclopentadienyl derivative . an analysis ha been undertaken of trend in the nmr spectrum of these new series of organometallic compound , both with respect to the nature of the metal and to the nature of the p-bonded ligand . the formation and property of bis(p-indenyl)bis(s-pentafluorophenyl) titanium and the new titanium metallocycle 5,5-bis(p-indenyl)dibenzotitanole are also described . none linear oligophenylene diynes containing <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> phenylene ring were synthesized in high yield using the nucleophilic aromatic substitution ( ArNS ) of perfluoroarenes by aryllithium reagent a the key carbon - carbon bond - forming reaction . this reaction wa demonstrated to proceed readily at low temperature with sterically hindered substrate and in the presence of base - sensitive silylalkynyl group . diynes synthesized by this methodology were readily zirconocene - coupled into large dimeric macrocycles using the zirconocene reagent Cp2Zr(py)(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) . none none none reaction of tetraiodobenzene with zirconacyclopentadienes , which were conveniently prepared from two alkyne ( or diynes ) and zirconocene complex , afforded 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted diiodonaphthalene derivative in good isolated yield . these 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted diiodonaphthalene derivative could be converted to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octasubstituted anthracene derivative by reaction with a second zirconacyclopentadiene . when the two zirconacyclopentadienes were different , unsymmetrical anthracenes such a 1,2,3,4-tetraethyl-5,6,7,8-tetraphenylanthracene ( <nUm> % isolated yield ) were obtained . on the other hand , treatment of a 2,3-dihalopyridine such a 2-bromo-3-iodopyridine with zirconacyclopentadienes gave 5,6,7,8-tetrasubstituted quinoline derivative in good to high yield . 3,4-Dihalopyridines such a 4-chloro-3-iodopyridine reacted with zirconacyclopentadienes to afford 5,6,7,8-tetrasubstituted isoquinoline derivative in good to high yield . the hafnium hydrostannyl complex CpCp*Hf(SnHMes2)Cl ( cp* = e5-C5Me5 ) ha been synthesized from the reaction of CpCp*Hf(H)Cl with Mes2SnH2 . this compound ha been identified a an intermediate in the metal - catalyzed dehydrocoupling of Mes2SnH2 to the distannane Mes2HSnSnHMes2 ( me = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl ) . the dehydrocoupling in this system appears to occur by elimination of : SnMes2 from CpCp*Hf(SnHMes2)Cl , with Sn-Sn bond formation proceeding via insertion of the stannylene into a Sn-H bond . the electronic influence of unbridged and ansa - bridged ring substituents on a zirconocene center ha been studied by mean of IR spectroscopic , electrochemical , and computational method . with respect to IR spectroscopy , the average of the symmetric and asymmetric stretch ( vCO(av) ) of a large series of dicarbonyl complex (CpR)2Zr(CO)2 ha been used a a probe of the electronic influence of a cyclopentadienyl ring substituent . for unbridged substituents ( me , et , pri , but , SiMe3 ) , vCO(av) on a per substituent basis correlate well with hammett dmeta parameter , thereby indicating that the influence of these substituents is via a simple inductive effect . In contrast , the reduction potential ( e ° ) of the corresponding dichloride complex (CpR)2ZrCl2 do not correlate well with hammett dmeta parameter , thereby suggesting that factor other than the substituent inductive effect also influence e ° . ansa bridge with single - atom linkers , for example [Me2C] and [Me2Si] , exert a net electron - withdrawing effect , but the effect is diminished upon increasing the length of the bridge . indeed , with a linker comprising a three-carbon chain , the [CH2CH2CH2] ansa bridge becomes electron - donating . In contrast to the electron - withdrawing effect observed for a single [Me2Si] ansa bridge , a pair of vicinal [Me2Si] ansa bridge exerts an electron - donating effect relative to that from the single bridge . DFT calculation demonstrate that the electron - withdrawing effect of the [Me2C] and [Me2Si] ansa - bridge is due to stabilization of the cyclopentadienyl ligand acceptor orbital , which subsequently enhances back - donation from the metal . the calculation also indicate that the electron - donating effect of two vicinal [Me2Si] ansa bridge , relative to that of a single bridge , is a result of it enforcing a ligand conformation that reduces back - donation from the metal . In a study of the reaction system MAO / (C5H5)2ZrMe2 , the size of the ion pair [ ( CH ) 2Zr(mMe)2AlMe2]+ [Me-MAO]- wa determined by pulsed field - gradient NMR of it cationic moiety . A mean effective hydrodynamic radius of <nUm> - <nUm> Å , determined from diffusion rate in benzene solution at different zirconocene and MAO concentration , indicates that the ion pair remains associated even at the lowest concentration studied . At elevated concentration , aggregation to ion quadruple or higher aggregate is indicated by an apparent size increase and by shift of the CH and me 1H NMR signal . the equilibrium constant for the reaction [ ( CH ) 2ZrMe+ ⋯ Me-MAO- ] + <nUm> / 2Al2Me6 ⇌ [ ( CH ) 2Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2]+ [Me-MAO]- change at different Al / Zr ratio ; this indicates that MAO contains various specie that produce Me-MAO- anion with different lewis basicities . the volume of the Me-MAO- anion suggests that it contains 150-200 Al atom . the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with <nUm> equiv of BuLi at <nUm> ° C , followed by the addition of an unsymmetrical tetra- or pentafluorophenyl substituted alkyne R1C ≡ CArf ( R1 , arf = (CH2)4Me , p-C6F4H ; me , p-C6F4H ; ph , C6F5 ) , resulted in regioselective coupling of these alkyne to zirconacyclopentadienes in which the arf substituents preferentially adopt the 3,4-positions ( bb ) of the zirconacyclopentadiene ring . with Cp2Zr(py)(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) a the zirconocene reagent , the coupling could be carried out at room temperature ; however , at higher temperature significant quantity of the 2,4-fluoroaryl substituted ( ab ) isomer were also formed . none of the condition employed produced the 2,5-fluoroaryl substituted ( aa ) isomer . these fluoroaryl-substituted zirconacyclopentadienes were readily converted to butadiene via reaction with acid . the zirconacyclopentadiene Cp2ZrC4-2,5-Ph2-3,4- C6F5 , which resulted from the coupling of PhC ≡ C7F5 , wa converted to the corresponding thiophene by reaction with ClS , and to an arene by reaction with MeO2CC ≡ CCO2Me / ClCu . mechanistic study on zirconocene coupling of (p-CF3C6H4)C ≡ C ( p-MeC6H4 ) indicate that the observed regioselectivities are determined by an electronic factor that control the orientation of at least one of the two alkyne a they are coupled . additionally , these study suggest an unsymmetrical transition state for the zirconocene coupling of alkyne , and this is supported by DFT calculation . the reaction of [ C7F5 ≡ CH ] 2CH2 with Cp2Zr(py)(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) resulted in a zirconacyclopentadiene in which the pentafluorophenyl substituents have been forced into the 2,5-positions ( aa ) . zirconocene coupling of the diyne C7F5 ≡ C-1,4-C6 H4-C ≡ C7F5 provided a route to conjugated polymer bearing electron - withdrawing pentafluorophenyl group . the rate of reductive elimination for a family of zirconocene isobutyl hydride complex , Cp*(CpRn)Zr(CH2CHMe2)H ( cp* = e5-C5Me5 , CpRn = substituted cyclopentadienyl ) , ha been measured a a function of cyclopentadienyl substituent . In general , the rate of reductive elimination increase modestly with the incorporation of sterically demanding substituents such a [CMe3] or [SiMe3] . A series of isotopic labeling experiment wa used to elucidate the mechanism and rate - determining step for the reductive elimination process . from these study , a new zirconocene isobutyl hydride complex , Cp''2Zr(CH2CHMe2)-(H) ( cp'' = e5-C5H3-1,3- (SiMe3)2 ) , wa designed and synthesized such that facile reductive elimination of isobutane and activation of dinitrogen wa observed . the resulting dinitrogen complex , [Cp''2Zr]2(m2 , e2,e2-N2 ) , ha been characterized by x-ray diffraction and display a bond length of <nUm> Å for the N ligand , the longest observed in any metallocene dinitrogen complex . solution magnetic susceptibility demonstrates that [Cp''2Zr]2(m2 , e2 , e2-N2 ) is a ground - state triplet , consistent with two Zr (III) , d1 center . mechanistic study reveal that the dinitrogen complex is derived from the reaction of N with the resulting cyclometalated zirconocene hydride rather than directly from reductive elimination of alkane . the crystal structure and electron density ( ED ) distribution of an imine coupling product with an open zirconocene , Zr(2,4-C7H11)[(i-Pr)NCHPhCH2 CMe = CHCMe = CH2 ] ( C7H11 = dimethylpentadienyl ) , have been derived from accurate synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurement . the molecular structure reveals asymmetric coordination of Zr by the pentadienyl ( 2,4-C7H11 ligand ( <Zr-C>  = <nUm> Å ) , the butadiene fragment ( <Zr-C>  = <nUm> Å ) , and the amide nitrogen atom ( Zr-N = <nUm> Å ) of the second ligand . the study of the ED and it topological analysis affords new insight into the bonding and electronic structure of the title zirconium complex . the interaction between the metal center and the ligand are represented by a Zr-N bond path and one Zr-C bond path with each of the pentadienyl and butadiene moiety , contrary to the usually depicted global metal - ligand bonding . the butadiene and pentadienyl group exhibit a polarization of the corresponding p-like ED in the C-Zr direction , indicating that the whole conjugated system are nonetheless involved . the 4d atomic orbitals of Zr exhibit unusual population according to ligand field consideration , which reveal a high degree of s-donation from the conjugated π system of both ligand . As deduced from numerical integration over the topologically defined atomic basin , the Zr to ligand charge transfer is <nUm> e to the C17H24N ligand and <nUm> e to dimethylpentadienyl . topological analysis of a short intramolecular Zr ⋯ ( C,H ) contact provides no indication of the presence of agostic interaction , despite a small Zr-N-C angle of <nUm> ° . thus , no bond path and BCP ( bond critical point ) of the ED are found in the Zr ⋯ ( C,H ) region , which would have provided evidence for such direct interaction , nor is there any evidence for charge accumulation between the Zr and H atom , or for lengthening of the C-H bond involved in the putative interaction . these characteristic , similar to those in other distorted situation , may be common for other electron - deficient d0 complex . treatment of Cp2ZrBu2 with enol ether containing a remote double bond lead to conjugated metalated diene a single isomer via a tandem isomerization - elimination sequence . 2-Arylsulfonyl 1,3-dienes can also be used a a source of dienyl zirconocene derivative , and the stereochemistry of the diene is dependent on the transmetalation reaction . hydrozirconation of alkyne with zirconocene hydrochloride followed by in situ transmetalation to dimethylzinc provides access to reactive alkenyl organometallic reagent from readily available precursor . upon addition of imines , 1,2-attack lead to synthetically useful allylic amine building block . In the presence of CH <nUm> I <nUm> or CH <nUm> Cl <nUm> , the n-metalated allylic amide intermediate is cyclopropanated and c-cyclopropylalkylamines are formed in high yield and excellent diastereoselectivities favoring the anti product . the use of enynes a starting material for this domino reaction provides conjugated biscyclopropanes and thus allows the stereoselective formation of five new carbon-carbon bond . A transition state that explains the need for both zirconocene complex and alkyl zinc in the cyclopropanation reaction is proposed . the kinetics of propene polymerization catalyzed by ansa - metallocenes were studied using quenched - flow technique . two catalyst system were investigated , (SBI)ZrMe2 / AlBu3 / [Ph3C][CN{B (C6F5)3}2 ] ( <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> ) at <nUm> ° C and BCl2ISZr / methylalumoxane at <nUm> ° C ( Al : Zr = <nUm> : <nUm> ) ( SBI = rac-Me2Si(1-Indenyl)2 ) . the aim of the study were to address fundamental mechanistic aspect of metallocene - catalyzed alkene polymerization , catalyst initiation , the quantitative correlation between catalyst structure and the rate of chain propagation , and the nature of dormant state . one of the most important but largely unknown factor in metallocene catalysis is the distribution of the catalyst between dormant state and specie actively involved in polymer chain growth . measurement of polymer yield Y versus reaction time t for propene concentration [M] = <nUm> - <nUm> mol L-1 and zirconocene concentration in the range [Zr] = ( <nUm> - <nUm> ) × 10-5 mol L-1 for the borate system showed first - order dependence on [M] and [Zr] . up to t ≈ <nUm> s , the half - life of catalyst initiation is comparable to the half - life of chain growth ; that is , this phase is governed by non-steady-state kinetics . we propose a rate law which take account of this and accurately describes the initial rate . curve fitting of y(t) data provides an apparent chain growth rate constant kpapp on the order of <nUm> L mol-1 s-1 . by contrast , the evolution with time of the number - average polymer molecular weight , which is independent of the concentration of catalyst involved , lead to a kp which is an order of magnitude larger , ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) × <nUm> L mol-1 s-1 . the ratio kpapp / kp = <nUm> indicates that under the given condition only about <nUm> % of the total catalyst is actively engaged in chain growth at any one time . the system (SBI)-ZrCl2 / methylalumoxane is significantly le active , kpapp = <nUm> ± <nUm> and kp = ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) × <nUm> L mol-1 s-1 , while , surprisingly , the mole fraction of active specie is essentially identical , <nUm> % . evidently , the energetics of the chain growth sequence are strongly modulated by the nature of the counteranion . increasing the counteranion / zirconium ratio from <nUm> : <nUm> to <nUm> : <nUm> ha no influence on catalyst activity . these finding are consistent with a model of closely associated ion pair throughout the chain growth sequence . for the borate system , propagation is ∼ <nUm> time faster than initiation , while for the MAO catalyst , kp / ki ≈ <nUm> . polymer obtained at <nUm> ° C show <nUm> - <nUm> mol % 2,1-regioerrors , and end - group analysis identifies 2,1- misinsertions a the main cause for chain termination ( <nUm> % ) , a compared to <nUm> % for the vinylidene end group . the result suggest that 2,1-regioerrors are a major contributor to the formation of dormant specie , even at short reaction time . this paper describes the synthesis of base - free (C5R5)2Zr(OtBu)+ cation , the direct observation of nonchelated alkene and alkyne adduct of these cation , and study of the thermodynamic and dynamic property of these novel specie . reaction of Cp2'ZrMe2 ( cp' = C5H4Me ) with tert-butyl alcohol followed by [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] in benzene yield [ Cp2'Zr(O'Bu) ][B(C6F5)4] ( 1 ) , which exists a Cp2'Zr(O'Bu)(CIR)+ solvent adduct in C6D5Cl and CD2Cl2 solution . addition of ligand L ( L = ethylene , propylene , propyne , 2-butyne , CO , phenylacetylene , allene , 1-hexene , cis-2-butene ) to <nUm> in CD2Cl2 at <nUm> ° C result in reversible formation of Cp2'Zr(O'Bu)(L)+ adduct . NMR data for Cp2'Zr(O'Bu)(H2C = CHMe)+ ( 4 ) indicate that the propylene coordinate unsymmetrically and is polarized with positive charge buildup at cint . equilibrium constant , defined by keq = [Zr-L][1]-1[L]-1 , vary in the order CO > propyne > 2-butyne > phenylacetylene > ethylene > allene > propylene > 1-hexene > cis-2-butene > vinyl chloride . loss of L from Cp2'Zr(O'Bu)(L)+to give <nUm> appears to proceed via associative displacement by CD2Cl2 in most case . the synthesis , structural characterization , and abstraction chemistry of ansa - zirconocene ester enolate complex relevant to the isospecific polymerization of methacrylates are reported . reaction of rac - (EBI)ZrMe(OTf) and rac - (EBI)Zr(OTf) <nUm> [ EBI = C 2H 4(Ind) <nUm> ] with <nUm> and <nUm> equiv of lithium isopropylisobutyrate in toluene produce the first example of ansa - zirconocene mono- and diester enolate complex : rac - (EBI)ZrMe[OC(O iPr ) = CMe <nUm> ] ( 1 ) and rac - (EBI)Zr[OC(O iPr ) = CMe <nUm> ] <nUm> ( 2 ) in <nUm> % and <nUm> % isolated yield , respectively . the reaction of <nUm> with B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> wa investigated in six different organic solvent ; in THF at ambient temperature , this reaction cleanly produce the isolable cationic ansa - zirconocene ester enolate complex rac - (EBI)Zr+(THF)[OC(O iPr ) = CMe 2][MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - ( 3 ) in quantitative yield . the analogous reaction of <nUm> with Al(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> in toluene , however , proceeds through a proposed novel , intramolecular proton transfer process in which propylene is eliminated from the isopropoxy group , subsequently producing a carboxylate - bridged tight ion pair rac - (EBI)Zr+(Me)OC( iPr)OAl(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> - ( 4 ) . In addition to standard spectroscopic and analytical characterization for the isolated complex 1-4 , complex <nUm> and <nUm> have also been structurally characterized by x-ray diffraction study . polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) and n-butyl methacrylate ( BMA ) ha been investigated using complex <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> . both the isolated cationic <nUm> and neutral <nUm> ( the latter combined with B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> in situ ) are highly active ( <nUm> min for quantitative MMA conversion ) and highly isospecific ( [mm] > <nUm> % for PMMA ; [mm] > <nUm> % for PBMA ) via enantiomorphic - site control , producing polymethacrylates with extremely narrow molecular weight distribution ( m w / m n = <nUm> ) . the aluminate complex <nUm> , however , produce syndiotactic PMMA predominantly via chain - end control . reductive elimination of alkane from a silylated bis-indenyl zirconium isobutyl hydride affords a zirconium sandwich complex with an unusual e6 indenyl ligand . crystallographic characterization of it adduct with tetrahydrofuran ha been achieved and reveals significant localization in the six - membered ring . complexation of more potent ligand such a carbon monoxide and diphenylacetylene are effective in promoting haptotropic rearrangement of the e6 indenyl ligand and provides familiar bent zirconocene derivative . the zirconium sandwich compound also undergoes oxidative addition of carbon-hydrogen bond of pyridyl ligand , resulting in a crystallographically characterized dimethylamino pyridyl hydride complex of zirconium . the ansa - zirconocene dichloride [ Me2Si(C5H 4)(3-R-C5H3)]ZrCl2 7a-e ( r = H , CH3 , cyclohexyl , -CHMe2 , -CMe3 ) were reacted with butadiene-magnesium to yield the respective ( η 4-butadiene)metallocenes 17a-e . the chiral example give a mixture of two s-cis and two s-trans diastereomers . the strong lewis acid B(C 6F5)3 add selectively to a terminal butadiene carbon atom to yield the (butadiene)metallocene / B(C6F 5)3 betaine complex 18a-e . initially , the formation of the Z-18 isomer is preferred . these consecutively rearrange to the thermodynamically favored isomer E-18 . the dipolar system <nUm> are active single component metallocene catalyst for the stereospecific polymerization of methyl methacrylate . with increasing steric bulk of the attached single alkyl substituent an increasingly isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate ) is obtained . A similar trend is observed in the methyl methacrylate polymerization at the [ Me2Si(C5H4)(3-R-C5H 3)]ZrCH3+ catalyst ( 9a-e ) that were conventionally prepared by methyl abstraction from the corresponding ansa - zirconocene dimethyl complex by treatment with B(C6F 5)3 . A comparison of the poly(methyl methacrylates ) obtained at these two series of catalyst ha revealed substantial difference in stereoselectivity that probably originate from an influence of the respective counteranions . an initial reactive intermediate of methyl methacrylate addition to the dipolar single component metallocene catalyst e-18a wa experimentally observed and characterized by NMR spectroscopy at <nUm> K . the subsequently formed series of [ PMMA-C4H6-B(C 6F5)3]- anion oligomers ( at the catalyst 18c ) wa monitored ( after quenching ) and characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry . several dienyl zirconocene derivative were easily prepared , a unique geometrical isomer , from simple non-conjugated unsaturated enol ether with (1-butene)ZrCp <nUm> complex . this new methodology is based on a tandem allylic C-H bond activation - elimination sequence and the mechanism ha been mapped out by deuterium labeling experiment . the stereochemical outcome of this process wa determined by addition of several electrophiles . moreover , when the organometallic derivative is vinylic a well a allylic such a in 44-47Zr , an unexpected reversal of the stereochemistry ha been found during the zirconium to copper transmetalation step . the presence of " free " trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) in methylalumoxane ( MAO ) solution can be highly detrimental to the performance of metallocene and " post-metallocene " olefin polymerization catalyst . the most used strategy to remove " free " TMA is to evaporate MAO solution to dryness , until a free - flowing white powder ( " solid MAO " ) is left . this procedure is tedious and potentially hazardous , because in some case the distillate is a concentrated hydrocarbon solution of TMA . moreover , " solid MAO " is poorly soluble in common polymerization medium , and once in solution it can regenerate TMA to some extent . this communication report on a facile alternative , which consists in the controlled addition of a sterically hindered phenol , such a 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol , effectively trapping " free " TMA . we show here that 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol / MAO solution activate equally well the dichloro-precursors of well - known zirconocene and bis(phenoxyimine)Ti catalyst , and that their use in propene polymerization result in a substantially higher productivity , polymer stereoregularity , and / or average molecular mass compared with activation by MAO alone . none monomeric imidozirconocene complex of the type Cp2(L)Zr = NCMe3 ( cp = cyclopentadienyl , L = lewis base ) have been shown to activate the carbon-hydrogen bond of benzene , but not the C-H bond of saturated hydrocarbon . to our knowledge , this singularly important class of C-H activation reaction ha heretofore not been observed in imidometallocene system . the m = NR bond formed on heating the racemic ethylenebis(tetrahydro)indenyl methyl tert-butyl amide complex , however , cleanly and quantitatively activates a wide range of n-alkane , alkene , and arene C-H bond . mechanistic experiment support the proposal of intramolecular elimination of methane followed by a concerted addition of the hydrocarbon C-H bond . product formed by activation of sp2 C-H bond are generally more thermodynamically stable than those formed by activation of sp3 C-H bond , and those resulting from reaction at primary C-H bond are preferred over secondary sp3 C-H activation product . there is also evidence that thermodynamic selectivity among C-H bond is sterically rather than electronically controlled . the organometallic multicomponent reaction of alkenyl zirconocene , alkynyl imine , and zinc carbenoid in the presence of dimethylzinc lead to novel C,C-dicyclopropylmethylamines . the formation of intermediate bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes represents the first synthetically useful example of a double C,C-s - bond insertion , and the increase in structural complexity from starting material is highlighted by the formation of nine new C,C - bond in the final product . A series of enantiopure C1 - symmetric metallocenes , { ( SiMe 2)2[e5-C5H(CHMe 2)2][e5-C5H2((S) CHMeCMe3)]}ZrCl2 , (S)-2 , { ( SiMe2 ) 2[e5-C5H(CHEt2) 2][e5-C5H2((S)-CHMeCMe 3)]}ZrCl2 , (S)-6 , and { ( SiMe2 ) 2[e5-C5HCy2][e5- C5H2((S)-CHMeCMe3)]}ZrCl2 ) , (S)-7 ( cy = cyclohexyl ) , zirconocene dichloride that have an enantiopure methylneopentyl substituent on the " upper " cyclopentadienyl ligand , and diastereomerically pure precatalysts , { ( SiMe2 ) 2[e5-C5H((S)-CHMeCy)(CHMe 2)][e5-C5H3]}ZrCl2 , (S)-8a and (S)-8b , which have an enantiopure , 1-cyclohexylethyl substituent on the " lower " cyclopentadienyl ligand , ha been synthesized for use in the polymerization of chiral a-olefins . when activated with methylaluminoxane , these metallocenes show unprecedented activity for the polymerization of bulky racemic monomer bearing substitution at the 3- and / or 4-positions . due to the optically pure nature of these single site catalyst , they effect kinetic resolution of racemic monomer : the polymeric product is enriched with the faster reacting enantiomer , while recovered monomer is enriched with the slower reacting enantiomer . the two component are easily separated . for most olefin surveyed , a partial kinetic resolution wa achieved ( s = kfaster / kslower ≈ <nUm> ) , but , in one case , the polymerization of 3,4-dimethyl-1-pentene , high level of separation were obtained ( s > <nUm> ) . 13C NMR spectroscopy of poly ( 3-methyl-1-pentene ) produced with (S)-2 indicates that the polymer are highly isotactic material . x-ray crystal structure determination for (S)-2 , { (SiMe2)2[e 5-C5H(CHMe2)2][e5- C5H2((S)-CHMeCMe3)]}Zr(SC6H 5)2 , (S)-6 , and (S)-7 have been used in combination with molecular mechanic calculation to examine the prevailing steric interaction expected in the diastereomeric transition state for propagation during polymerization . precatalysts (S)-8a and (S)-8b are le selective polymerization catalyst for the kinetic resolution of 3-methyl-1-pentene than are (S)-2 , (S)-6 , and (S)-7 . A family of isolable , well - defined bis-indenyl zirconium sandwich complex , ( e5-C9H5-1,3-R 2)-(e9-C9H5-1,3-R 2)Zr ( r = silyl , alkyl ) , have been prepared by either alkane reductive elimination or alkali metal reduction of a suitable zirconium(IV) dihalide precursor . crystallographic characterization of two of these derivative , r = SiMe2CMe3 and CHMe2 , reveals unprecedented e9 coordination of one of the indenyl ligand . variable - temperature and EXSY NMR study establish that the e5 and e9 ring are rapidly interconverting in solution . the sandwich complex serve a effective source of low - valent zirconium reacting rapidly with both olefin and alkyne at ambient temperature . In contrast to bis-cyclopentadienyl chemistry , the olefin adduct of the bis-indenyl zirconium sandwich undergo preferential C-H activation to yield the corresponding allyl hydride compound , although reaction with excess olefin proceeds through the e2-olefin adduct , forming the corresponding zirconacyclopentane . the reaction of the chiral chelated bis-amide complex Zr{(2R,4R)-PhNCHMeCH2CHMeNPh}Cl2(THF)2 ( R,R-7 ) with lithium ansa-bis-indenyl reagent Li2[SBI](Et2O) ( 8a , SBI = (1-indenyl)2SiMe2 ) or Li2[EBI](Et2O) ( 8b , EBI = 1,2-(1-indenyl)2ethane ) in THF affords the corresponding ansa - zirconocenes S,S-(SBI)Zr{(2R,4R)-PhNCHMeCH2CHMeNPh} ( S,S,R,R-9a ) or S,S-(EBI)Zr{(2R,4R)-PhNCHMeCH2CHMeNPh} ( S,S,R,R-9b ) in > <nUm> % isolated yield and > <nUm> % enantiomeric excess . compound 9b wa converted to the corresponding enantiomerically pure dichloride S,S - (EBI)ZrCl2 ( S,S-10b ) in <nUm> % isolated yield by reaction with ClH in Et2O . the chiral diamine (2R,4R)-HPhNCHMeCH2CHMeNHPh ( R,R-5 ) wa recovered from this reaction . the origin of the hydrogenation of the dinitrogen ligand in [(e5-C5Me4H)2Zr]2(m2,e2,e2-N2) ha been investigated by a combined computational and experimental study . density functional theory calculation on the zirconocene dinitrogen complex demonstrate significant imido character in the zirconium nitrogen bond , arising from effective p-back - bonding from the low - valent zirconium and the side-on bound N ligand . the twisted ground - state structure of the N complex is a key requirement for nitrogen hydrogenation , a calculation on the model complex [(e5-C5H5)2Zr]2(m2,e2,e2-N2) reveal reduced overlap a the dihedral angle between the zirconocene wedge approach <nUm> ° . experimentally , isotopic labeling study on the microscopic reverse are consistent with a 1,2-addition mechanism for nitrogen hydrogenation . the generation and property of nonchelated zr-aryl-alkyne and zr-aryl-alkene complex that are stabilized by the presence of b-Si-substituents in the alkyne and alkene ligand and fluorination of the aryl ligand are described . reaction of [Cp'2Zr(OtBu)(ClCD2Cl)][B(C6F5)4] ( <nUm> , cp' = C5H4Me ) with alkyne and alkene substrate ( L ) generates Cp'2Zr(OtBu)(L)+ adduct ( L = HC ≡ CCH2SiMe3 ( 2 ) ; CH2 = CHCH2SiMe3 ( 3 ) ; HC ≡ CMe ( 4 ) ; CH2 = CHCH2CMe3 ( 5 ) ) . equilibrium constant for substrate binding ( keq = [Zr-L][1]-1[L]-1 ; CD2Cl2 , <nUm> ° C ) are much larger for the b-Si - substituted compound <nUm> ( <nUm> × <nUm> M-1 ) and <nUm> ( <nUm> × <nUm> M-1 ) than for hydrocarbon analogue <nUm> ( <nUm> × <nUm> M-1 ) and <nUm> ( <nUm> M-1 ) , which is ascribed to b-Si stabilization of the partial positive charge on cint of the bound substrate . [Cp2Zr(C6F5)][B(C6F5)4] ( <nUm> , cp = CH ) wa generated by the reaction of Cp2Zr(C6F5)Me with [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] in C6D5Cl . reaction of <nUm> with alkyne and alkene substrate ( L ) generates Cp2Zr(C6F5)(L)+ adduct ( L = HC ≡ CCH2SiMe3 ( 8 ) ; H = CCHCH2SiMe3 ( 10 ) ) . No insertion of the substrate into the Zr-C6F5 bond is observed in <nUm> ( at <nUm> ° C ) or <nUm> ( up to <nUm> ° C ) . the allyltrimethylsilane ligand in <nUm> undergoes nondissociative alkene face exchange ( " alkene flipping " , i.e. , exchange of the Cp2Zr(C6F5)+ unit between the two alkene enantiofaces without alkene dissociation ) , with a first - order rate constant kflip = <nUm> s-1 ( C6D5Cl , <nUm> ° C ) . <nUm> also undergoes slower reversible decomplexation of the alkene ( kdissoc = <nUm> s-1 ; C6D5Cl , <nUm> ° C ) . the reaction of Zr{PhN(CH2)3NPh}Cl 2(THF)2 ( 5 ) with lithium ansa-bis-indenyl reagent Li 2[XBI]-(Et2O) ( XBI = (1-indenyl)2SiMe <nUm> ( SBI , 7a ) , (2-methyl-1-indenyl)2SiMe2 ( MSBI , 7b ) , (2-methyl-4,5-benz-1-indenyl)2SiMe2 ( MBSBI , 7c ) , (2-methyl-4-phenyl-1-indenyl)2SiMe2 ( MPSBI , 7d ) , and 1,2-(1-indenyl)2ethane ( EBI , 7e ) ) affords rac - (XBI)Zr{PhN(CH 2)3NPh } ( 8a-e ) in high yield . the meso isomer were not detected by 1H NMR . x-ray crystallographic study show that the Zr{PhN(CH2)3NPh} ring in <nUm> , 8a , 8c , and ( C 5H5)2-Zr{PhN(CH2)3NPh} ( 10 ) adopt twist conformation that position the N-Ph group on opposite side of the N-Zr-N plane . this conformation complement the metallocene structure of rac-8a-e but would destabilize the corresponding meso isomer . it is proposed that the Zr{PhN(CH2)3NPh} ring adopts a similar twist conformation in the stereodetermining transition state for addition of the second indenyl ring in these reaction , which lead to a preference for rac product . the result of metallocene synthesis from other Zr amide precursor support this proposal . 8a-e are converted to the corresponding rac - (XBI)ZrCl2 complex ( 9a-e ) by reaction with ClH . the reactivity of [rac-(C2H4(1-indenyl)2)Zr(n-butyl)][MeB(C6F5)3] ( 4 ) , [rac-(C2H4(1-indenyl)2)Zr(sec-butyl)][MeB(C6F5)3] ( 5 ) , and [rac-(C2H4(1-indenyl)2)Zr(polypropenyl)][MeB(C6F5)3] with propene , ethene , and hydrogen wa studied by low - temperature ( < <nUm> ° C ) 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy in toluene solution . In contrast with previous suggestion that <nUm> ° zirconium alkyl specie such a <nUm> are dormant site , these measurement demonstrate reactivity of <nUm> ° zirconium alkyl with propene and ethene comparable to the <nUm> ° zirconium alkyl specie <nUm> and [rac-(C2H4(1-indenyl)2)Zr(polypropenyl)][MeB(C6F5)3] . because 2,1-insertion of propene is an infrequent event , these result preclude significant accumulation of catalyst in the form of <nUm> ° zirconium alkyl for this metallocene and counterion . the reactivity of <nUm> with hydrogen is at least <nUm> order of magnitude faster than other <nUm> ° zirconium alkyl . such high reactivity account for the puzzlingly high fraction of butyl end group in prior hydrooligomerization study and implies that catalyst responsivity to H a a molecular weight control agent correlate with the regioselectivity of the catalyst . the dimethylsilanediyl-bridged ansa - zirconocene dichloride <nUm> , that contains a pendent allyl substituent at a cp - ring , add HB(C6F 5)2 to the vinyl group to yield the bifunctional zirconocene / borane complex <nUm> . substituted benzimidazoles were added to the strongly electrophilic borane moiety a protective group , which allowed subsequent chloride versus -CH2SiMe3 exchange at zirconium to take place by treatment with the respective alkyllithium reagent . alternatively , the introduction of active s-ligands at zirconium is carried out first , followed by the hydroboration reaction . this route wa followed for the synthesis of the diphenyl-ansa-zirconocene / borane complex <nUm> . complex <nUm> reacts slowly in solution by intramolecular electrophilic attack of the borane at it adjacent cp - ring , followed by deprotonation using a [Zr]-Ph group to yield the zwitterionic complex <nUm> featuring a borata-tetrahydroindenyl moiety a part of the ansametallocene framework . complex <nUm> wa characterized by x-ray diffraction . it add PMe3 at zirconium to yield <nUm> . thermolysis of <nUm> with excess PMe3 lead to the formation of the (aryne)zirconocene complex <nUm> , which is stabilized by PMe3 coordination to zirconium and PMe3 addition to boron . N-Methylbenzimidazole add to the -B(C6F5)2 unit of <nUm> to give the <nUm> : <nUm> adduct <nUm> . thermolysis of <nUm> at <nUm> ° C in benzene solution in the presence of one additional equivalent of n-methylbenzimidazole result in deprotonation of the substrate to yield the s-N- methylbenzimidazolyl zirconium complex <nUm> ( a a mixture of two diastereoisomers ) . an additional n-methylbenzimidazole ligand is bonded to the BC12F10 unit in this product . zirconocene - olefin complex Cp2Zr(H2C = CHR ) , prepared in benzene-THF at <nUm> ° C , react with acid chloride to provide homoallylic alcohol . the key is an equilibrium between the zirconocene - olefin complex and the corresponding zirconocene allyl hydride complex via allylic C-H bond cleavage of the coordinating alkene . furthermore , the zirconocene - olefin complex are also available for the reaction with 1,4-diketone to afford anti-1,4-diols with excellent diastereoselectivity . thus , Cp2Zr(H2C = CHR ) serf a a donor of both hydride and an allylic group . these reaction also proceed efficiently by using zirconocene - olefin complex , derived from Cp2ZrCl2 , Mg metal , and 1-alkenes . the nucleophilic character of a charge neutral , high oxidation d0 zirconium trimethylenemethane ( TMM ) class of compound of general structure Cp*Zr(TMM)[N(R1)C(Me)N(R2)] , 1a ( R1 = R2 = i-Pr ) and 1b ( R1 = t-Bu , R2 = et ) , is presented through documentation of it reactivity with a range of alkyl and silyl halide and triflates , including unactivated one such a ethyl triflate . these result should contribute to effort directed toward expanding the synthetic chemist 's toolbox of synthetic method for the construction of complex organic molecule . one Si - tethered diyne is coupled in one pot with three molecule of organonitriles promoted by a low - valent zirconocene specie . cleavage of one of the three C ≡ N triple bond and cleavage of the two Si-C bond take place to afford pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridine derivative after hydrolysis . cyclohexene ( CHE ) ha been incorporated into the polymer chain in ethylene / CHE copolymerization by nonbridged half - titanocenes containing aryloxo ligand of the type , Cp'TiCl2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) , in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) cocatalyst . the effect of the substituent in the cyclopentadienyl fragment wa found to be very important for CHE incorporation ; both the tert-BuCp ( 3 ) and 1,2,4-Me3Cp analogue ( 4 ) showed efficient CHE incorporation , whereas a negligible amount of CHE incorporation wa observed by both the indenyl ( 1 ) and the cp* analogue ( 2 ) under the same condition . cp - ketimide analogue , CpTiCl2(N = CtBu2 ) ( 5 ) , zirconocene - like Cp2ZrCl2 ( 6 ) , and linked half - titanocene - like [Me2Si(C5Me4)(NtBu)]TiCl2 ( 7 ) did not show any CHE incorporation under the same condition ; unique characteristic for using this type of catalyst precursor for the present copolymerization have thus been emphasized . functionalization of the N ligand in the side-on bound dinitrogen complex , [ ( e5-C5Me4H ) 2Zr]2-(m2,e2 , e2-N2 ) , ha been accomplished by addition of terminal alkyne to furnish acetylide zirconocene diazenido complex , [ (e5-C5Me4H)2Zr(C ≡ CR ) ] <nUm> ( m2,e2,e2-N 2H2 ) ( r = nBu , tBu , ph ) . characterization of [ ( e5- C5Me4H ) 2Zr(C ≡ CCMe3)]2(m2 , e2,e2-N2H2 ) by x-ray diffraction revealed a side-on bound diazenido ligand in the solid state , while variable - temperature 1H and <nUm> N NMR study established rapid interconversion between e1,e1 and e2,e2 hapticity of the [ HN2 2]2- ligand in solution . synthesis of alkyl , halide , and triflato zirconocene diazenido complex , [ ( e5-C 5Me4H)2ZrX]2(m2 , e1,e1-N2H2 ) ( x = Cl , I , OTf , CH2Ph , CH2SiMe3 ) , afforded e1,e1 coordination of the [ HN2 2]2- fragment both in the solid state and in solution , demonstrating that sterically demanding , in some case p-donating , ligand can overcome the electronically preferred side-on bonding mode . unlike [(e5-C5Me4H)2ZrH] <nUm> ( m2,e2,e2-N 2H2 ) , the acetylide and alkyl zirconocene diazenido complex are thermally robust , resisting a-migration and N cleavage up to temperature of <nUm> ° C . dinitrogen functionalization with [(e5-C5Me4H)2Zr] <nUm> ( m2,e2,e2-N <nUm> ) wa also accomplished by addition of proton donor . weak bronsted acid such a water and ethanol yield hydrazine and ( e5-C 5Me4H)2Zr(OH)2 and (e5-C5Me4H)2-Zr(OEt) <nUm> , respectively . treatment of [ ( e5-C 5Me4H)2Zr]2(m2 , e2,e2-N2 ) with HNMe2 or H2NNMe2 furnished amido or hydrazido zirconocene diazenido complex that ultimately produce hydrazine upon protonation with ethanol . these result contrast previous observation with [ ( e5-C 5Me5)2Zr(e1-N2) ] <nUm> ( m2,e1,e1-N <nUm> ) where loss of free dinitrogen is observed upon treatment with weak acid . these study highlight the importance of cyclopentadienyl substituents on transformation involving coordinated dinitrogen . poly(propylene-ran-1,3-butadiene) that contained pendant vinyl group derived from 1,2-inserted butadiene unit wa selectively synthesized by rac-dimethylsilylbis(2-methyl-4-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( ph - ind ) activated with modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) in the presence of hydrogen . the copolymer obtained without hydrogen had 1,2-inserted and 1,4-inserted butadiene unit . the addition of hydrogen to the copolymerization improved the activity by ∼ 1000-fold and gave the copolymer only with 1,2-inserted butadiene unit , of which the content wa equal to the copolymer obtained without hydrogen . the 13C NMR analysis of the copolymer clarified that butadiene also inserted into the copolymer a a tetramethylene unit , of which the content wa almost the same a that of 1,4-inserted butadiene unit observed in the absence of hydrogen . No signal that could be assigned to cyclic structure or long branched side chain wa observed . these result indicate that p-allyl specie of zirconocenes formed by 1,4-butadiene insertion at the growing polymer chain end transformed to the tetramethylene chain end by hydrogenation and continued successive propylene insertion . the zirconocene - complexed dibismuthene , Cp2Zr(BiR)2 ( cp = CH ; r = C6H3-2,6-Mes2 ) , wa prepared by the reaction of sodium metal with Cp2ZrCl2 and RBiCl2 . the air- and moisture - sensitive dark reddish / brown compound is the first organometallic compound containing Bi-Zr bond and the only example of a Bi2Zr ring . moreover , our computation on associated model system offer insight into the nature of the interaction of the heaviest dipnictene with a metallocene center . reaction of the disilenide <nUm> with Cp2ZrCl2 yield <nUm> , the first transition metal complex with an e1-s - bonded disilene moiety . the compound <nUm> exhibit a strongly red - shifted UV - vi absorption , resulting in an intensely green color . the Si = Si bond in <nUm> is considerably activated a shown by the rearrangement to a silyl-substituted zirconocene <nUm> . x-ray diffraction study on <nUm> reveal that the Si = Si bond is significantly longer than that in the precursor <nUm> . conversely , the Zr-Si distance is considerably smaller than the corresponding distance in <nUm> , suggesting a certain degree of electron donation toward the 16e- zirconium center . the rate of hydrogenation of the N ligand in the side-on bound dinitrogen compound , [ ( e5-C5Me4H ) 2Zr]2(m2,e2 , e2-N2 ) and [ ( e5-C5Me 5)(e5-C5H2-1,2-Me 2-4-R)Zr]2(m2,e2 , e2-N2 ) ( r = me , ph ) , to afford the corresponding hydrido zirconocene diazenido complex have been measured by electronic spectroscopy . determination of the rate law for the hydrogenation of [ (e5-C5Me5)(e5-C 5H2-1,2,4-Me3)Zr]2(m2 , e2,e2-N2 ) establishes an overall second - order reaction , first order with respect to each reagent . these data , in combination with a normal , primary kinetic isotope effect of <nUm> for H <nUm> versus D2 addition , establish the first H addition a the rate - determining step in N hydrogenation . kinetic isotope effect of similar direction and magnitude have also been measured for hydrogenation ( deuteration ) of the two other zirconocene dinitrogen complex . measuring the rate constant for the hydrogenation of [ ( e5-C 5Me5)(e5-C5H2-1,2,4- Me3)Zr]2(m2,e2 , e2-N2 ) over a <nUm> ° C temperature range provided activation parameter of DH ‡ = <nUm> kcal / mol and DS ‡ = <nUm> eu . the entropy of activation is consistent with an ordered four - centered transition structure , where H undergoes formal 1,2-addition to a zirconium-nitrogen bond with considerable multiple bond character . support for this hypothesis stem from the observation of N functionalization by C-H activation of a cyclopentadienyl methyl substituent in the mixed ring dinitrogen complex , [ ( e5- C5Me5)(e5-C5H 2-1,2-Me2-4-R)Zr]2(m2 , e2,e2-N2 ) ( r = me , ph ) , to afford cyclometalated zirconocene diazenido derivative . transition metal-benzyne complex have found many application in organic synthesis , mechanistic study , and the synthesis of functional material . In sharp contrast , the reaction chemistry of transition metal-carboryne complex is virtually unknown although the theoretical calculation indicated that the formation of carboryne ( 1,2-C2B10H10 ) and benzyne is very energetically comparable . this communication report a novel zirconocene-carboranyl complex Cp2Zr(m-Cl)(m-C2B10H10)Li(OEt2)2 ( 1 ) , an efficient precursor of the zirconocene-carboryne specie , prepared from the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with <nUm> equiv of B5CH5Li in Et2O . the reactivity study indicated that <nUm> resembles zirconocene-benzyne in reaction with polar unsaturated organic molecule . on the other hand , it show no reactivity toward alkyne and alkene , a reactivity pattern which is quite different from that of zirconocene-benzyne . this work also furnishes a novel method for the preparation of functional o-carboranes and their metal complex which can not be synthesized by other method presently known . the reaction of Cp'2Zr(OtBu)Me ( cp' = C5H4Me ) and [Ph3C][B(C6F 5)4 ] yield the base - free complex [ cp' 2Zr(OtBu)][B(C6F5)4] ( 6 ) , which exists a Cp'2Zr(OtBu)(CIR)+ halocarbon adduct in CD2Cl2 or C6D 5Cl solution . addition of alkene to <nUm> in CD2Cl <nUm> solution at low temperature give equilibrium mixture of cp'2- Zr(OtBu)(alkene)+ ( 12a-l ) , <nUm> , and free alkene . the NMR data for 12a-l are consistent with unsymmetrical alkene bonding and polarization of the alkene C = C bond with positive charge buildup at cint and negative charge buildup at cterm . these feature arise due to the lack of d-p* back - bonding . equilibrium constant for alkene coordination to <nUm> in CD2Cl2 at <nUm> ° C , K eq = [12][6]-1[alkene]-1 , vary in the order : vinylferrocene ( <nUm> M-1 ) ≫ ethylene ( 7.0 ) ≈ a-olefins > cis-2-butene ( 2.2 ) > trans-2-butene ( < <nUm> ) . alkene coordination is inhibited by sterically bulky substituents on the alkene but is greatly enhanced by electron - donating group and the b-Si effect . compound 12a-l undergo two dynamic process : reversible alkene decomplexation via associative substitution of a CD2Cl2 molecule , and rapid rotation of the alkene around the metal - ( alkene centroid ) axis . this paper describes the generation and property of nonchelated d <nUm> zirconocene-aryl-alkene and alkyne adduct that are stabilized by the presence of b-SiMe3 substituents on the substrate and the weak nucleophilicity of the -C6F5 ligand . the cationic complex [ (C5H4R)2Zr(C6F 5)][B(C6F5)4] ( 4a : r = H , 4b : r = me ) were generated by methide abstraction from ( C5H 4R)2Zr(C6F5)Me by ph 3C+ . NMR study show that 4a,b contain an o-CF ⋯ Zr dative interaction and probably coordinate a PhCl molecule in PhCl solution . addition of allyltrimethylsilane ( ATMS ) to 4a,b in C6D5Cl solution at low temperature produce an equilibrium mixture of ( C 5H4R)2Zr(C6F5)(H 2C = CHCH2SiMe3)+ ( 7a,b ) , 4a,b , and free ATMS . similarly , addition of propargyltrimethylsilane ( PTMS ) to 4a produce an equilibrium mixture of Cp2Zr(C6F5)(HC = CCH2SiMe3)+ ( 8a ) , 4a , and free PTMS . the NMR data for 7a,b,and 8a are consistent with highly unsymmetrical substrate coordination and substantial polarization of the substrate multiple bond with significant positive charge buildup at cint and negative charge buildup at cterm . PTMS bind to 4a more strongly than ATMS doe . the ATMS adduct undergo nondissociative alkene face exchange ( " alkene flipping " ) , i.e. , exchange of the ( C5H4R ) 2Zr(C6F5)+ unit between the two alkene enantiofaces without decomplexation of the alkene , on the NMR time scale . exposure of e9,e5-bis(indenyl)zirconium sandwich complex to <nUm> atm of H resulted in facile oxidative addition to furnish the corresponding zirconocene dihydrides , ( e5-C9H5-1,3-R2 ) 2ZrH2 ( r = SiMe3 , SiMe2Ph , CHMe <nUm> ) . continued hydrogenation completed conversion to the tetrahydroindenyl derivative , ( e5-C9H 9-1,3-R2)2ZrH2 . deuterium labeling study established that dihydrogen ( dideuterium ) addition to the benzo ring is intramolecular and stereospecific , occurring solely from the endo face of the ligand , proximal to the zirconium . In the absence of dihydrogen , the bis(indenyl)zirconium dihydrides rearranged to new zirconium monohydride complex containing an unusual e5,e3-4,5- dihydroindenediyl ligand , arising from metal - to - benzo ring hydrogen transfer . mechanistic study , including a normal , primary kinetic isotope effect measured at <nUm> ° C , are consistent with a pathway involving regio- and stereoselective insertion of a benzo C = C bond into a zirconium hydride . the stereochemistry of the insertion reaction , and hence the e5 , e3-4,5-dihydroindenediyl product , is influenced by the presence of donor ligand and controlled by the preferred conformation of the indenyl ring . exposure of the zirconium hydride containing the e5 , e3-4,5-dihydroindenediyl ring to <nUm> atm of dihydrogen afforded the tetrahydroindenyl zirconium dihydride complex , establishing the intermediacy of this unusual coordination environment during benzo ring hydrogenation . treatment of the η <nUm> ,e <nUm> -bis(indenyl)zirconium sandwich complex , ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> -1,3-(SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> )(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> -1,3- ( SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> )Zr , with dialkyl ether such a diethyl ether , CH <nUm> OR ( r = et , n bu , t bu ) , n bu <nUm> O , or i Pr <nUm> O resulted in facile C-O bond scission furnishing an η <nUm> ,e <nUm> -bis(indenyl)zirconium alkoxy hydride complex and free olefin . In case where ethylene is formed , trapping by the zirconocene sandwich yield a rare example of a crystallographically characterized , base - free η <nUm> , η <nUm> -bis(indenyl)zirconium ethylene complex . observation of normal , primary kinetic isotope effect in combination with rate study and the stability of various model compound support a mechanism involving rate - determining C-H activation to yield an η <nUm> ,e <nUm> - bis(indenyl) - zirconium alkyl hydride intermediate followed by rapid b-alkoxide elimination . for isolable η <nUm> ,e <nUm> - bis(indenyl) - zirconium THF compound , thermolysis at <nUm> ° C also resulted in C-O bond cleavage to yield the corresponding zirconacycle . both mechanistic and computational study again support a pathway involving haptotropic rearrangement to η <nUm> ,e <nUm> -bis(indenyl)zirconium intermediate that promote rate - determining C-H activation and ultimately C-O bond scission . the mechanism of stereocontrol in the site - controlled stereospecific polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) with C2- and C s-symmetric zirconocenes is investigated with a DFT based approach . our model explains the experimentally observed isospecificity in MMA polymerization with the C2 - symmetric rac-C2H 4(Ind)2Zr - based system a well a the experimentally observed syndiospecificity in MMA polymerization with the C s-symmetric Me2C(Cp)(Flu)Zr - based system . In both case , the chiral metallocene induces a chiral orientation of the ester enolate growing chain . In turn , the chirally oriented growing chain selects it own enantioface . comparison with the mechanism of stereocontrol operative in the case of propene polymerization by the same zirconocenes is performed to stress similarity and difference . although analogy are expected , surprising difference also exist . the most peculiar is that the in the case of 1-olefins , the enantioselective event is selection between the enantiofaces of the prochiral monomer . instead , in the case of acrylate , the enantioselective event is selection between the enantiofaces of the prochiral growing chain . the specie on the zirconocene catalyst is changed from two cp 's to the brintzinger ligand and catalytic amount of MAO are used to usually effect a > <nUm> % regiocontrol of negishi carboaluminations of 1-alkynes in toluene . an investigation of the use of Cp2Zr(H)Cl ( schwartz 's reagent ) to reduce a variety of amide to the corresponding aldehyde under very mild reaction condition and in high yield is reported . A range of tertiary amide , including weinreb 's amide , can be converted directly to the corresponding aldehyde with remarkable chemoselectivity . primary and secondary amide proved to be viable substrate for reduction a well , although the yield were somewhat diminished a compared to the corresponding tertiary amide . result from NMR experiment suggested the presence of a stable , 18-electron zirconacycle intermediate that presumably affords the aldehyde upon water or silica gel workup . A series of competition experiment revealed a preference of the reagent for substrate in which the lone pair of the nitrogen is electron releasing and thus more delocalized across the amide bond by resonance . this trend account for the observed excellent selectivity for tertiary amide versus ester . experiment regarding the solvent dependence of the reaction suggested a kinetic profile similar to that postulated for the hydrozirconation of alkene and alkyne . addition of p-anisidine to the reaction intermediate resulted in the formation of the corresponding imine mimicking the addition of water that form the aldehyde . the reaction of Li2[Me2Si(3-R-C5H3)2] salt with Zr{Me3SiN(CH2)3NSiMe3}Cl2(THF)2 in THF quantitatively afforded rac-Me2Si(3-R-C5H3)2Zr{Me3SiN(CH2)3NSiMe3} zirconocenes with <nUm> % stereoselectivity . NMR monitoring study showed that these reaction initially form rac / meso mixture , which undergo isomerization to pure rac . the isomerization requires cp - enantioface exchange and is catalyzed by chloride ion , which reversibly displaces cp- from Me2Si(3-R-C5H3)2Zr{Me3SiN(CH2)3NSiMe3} . kinetic analysis for selected complex showed first - order dependence of the isomerization rate on both metallocene and chloride concentration . reversible cp- / cl- exchange is also facile for {ansa-bis-Cp}ZrCl2 and nonbridged Cp2ZrCl2 complex . silica - tethered fluorinated sulfonic acid in combination with trimethylaluminum activate metallocenes for the polymerization of ethylene . various control experiment indicate that the in situ formation of known cocatalysts such a methylaluminoxane is not likely . it is proposed that the interaction between the alkylaluminum and the supported sulfonic acid creates a site that can activate the zirconocene precatalyst to form the polymerization catalyst . this is a new combined support / activator for single - site olefin polymerization . the zirconocene complex [Cp2ZrMe]+ reacts with 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene to give methane and the allyl complex [Cp2Zr(e3-CH2C(CH2CHMe2)CH2)]+ . the reaction involves a an intermediate the unprecedented alkyl e1-alkene complex [Cp2Zr(Me)(e1-CH2CMeCH2CHMe2)]+ , in which C(2) is essentially carbocationic and the C(1) - C(2) bond order is sufficiently low that rotation about it occurs . the hydrogen atom of the methyl group on C(2) are sufficiently acidic that proton transfer to the Zr-Me group occurs to generate the allylic product . it seems likely that the chemistry described here provides a rationale for deactivation of propene polymerization catalyst since the normal product of chain transfer , polymer with vinylidene end group , should form allylic specie in the same way . multisubstituted olefin are efficiently prepared by the zirconocene - mediated regio- and stereoselective coupling between 1-alkynylboronates and ethylene , followed by sequential transformation in moderate to high yield . the proper combination of substrate and reaction condition is important for high yield . the synthesis of various tetrasubstituted alkene in a regio- and stereocontrolled manner is described . this methodology ha been applied to the synthesis of (Z)-tamoxifen in a concise , regio- and stereoselective manner . this multicomponent coupling strategy involves the characteristic of 1-alkynylboronates toward high selectivity followed by palladium(0) - mediated cross-coupling with aryl halide . the first asymmetric iridium - catalyzed C-C bond forming hydrogenation is described . by simply hydrogenating alkyne in the presence of n-arylsulfonyl imines using an iridium catalyst modified by (R)-Cl,MeO-BIPHEP , one may obtain the corresponding allylic amine 1b-21b in highly optically enriched form ( 92-99 % ee ) . this protocol circumvents the use of preformed vinyl metal reagent and is applicable to aromatic , heteroaromatic , and aliphatic n-arylsulfonyl aldimines 1a-16a . the reductive coupling product , allylic amine 1b-21b , are produced a single geometrical isomer ( ≥ <nUm> : <nUm> , e : z ) . nonsymmetric alkyne couple to imines 8a and 12a under standard condition with excellent level of regioselection . absolute stereochemical assignment of allylic amine 1b-21b is based upon single - crystal x-ray diffraction analysis of 22b , the p-bromophenylsulfonyl analogue of adduct 1b , using the anomalous dispersion method . A stereochemical model accounting for the observed sense of absolute stereoinduction and regioselectivity is provided . the insertion of enantiopure C2 - symmetric diphenylethylene carbonate into the Zr-C bond of zirconaaziridines lead to the asymmetric synthesis of amino acid methyl ester . because the zirconaaziridine enantiomer interconvert , the reaction is a dynamic kinetic resolution ( DKR ) . the efficiency of the DKR ( the ratio of the two diastereomeric product ) is determined by the balance between the rate of enantiomer interconversion and the rate of insertion ; slow addition of the inserting enantiopure carbonate is often required to maximize the stereoselectivity . for a case when enantiomer interconversion is fast , it rate constant kinv ha been determined by NMR line broadening ; for a case when interconversion is slow , kinv ha been determined by computer simulation of the formation of the diastereomeric product a a function of time ; for several intermediate case , kinv ha been determined by making the zirconaaziridine enantioenriched and monitoring it racemization by CD spectroscopy . the observed kinv is independent of [THF] , implying that interconversion occurs with THF coordinated . interconversion presumably occurs via an achiral intermediate , either a rapidly inverting ( via an e1-N structure ) e3-azaallyl hydride or an e1-imine . As addition of THF slows insertion without affecting enantiomer interconversion , it produce a more efficient DKR without slow addition of the enantiopure carbonate . the reaction of Cp2Zr(4-F-o-tolyl)(CD2Cl2M)+ ( A ) with 2-butyne at <nUm> ° C in CD2Cl2 proceeds by reversible formation of the alkyne complex Cp2Zr(4-F-o-tolyl)(2-butyne)+ ( C ) , followed by rate limiting insertion to produce Cp2Zr{CMe = CMe(4-F-o-tolyl)}+ ( d ) . analysis of this system by pre-equilibrium kinetics ( <nUm> ° C ) give keq = <nUm> M-1 for 2-butyne coordination to A and kinsert = <nUm> × 10-4 s-1 and δ g ‡ insert = <nUm> kcal / mol for the insertion step . stabilization of C by an agostic interaction and steric crowding in the transition state contribute to the high insertion barrier . the scope of CO-induced N <nUm> cleavage in a series of zirconocene and hafnocene complex containing activated , side-on bound dinitrogen ligand ha been studied . In each case , bridging oxamidide ligand , [ N 2C 2O <nUm> ] 4- , were formed from N-N bond cleavage coupled to N-C and C-C bond assembly . for the zirconium example , [ ( η 5-C 5Me 4H ) 2Zr ] <nUm> ( μ 2,e 2,e 2-N <nUm> ) and [ me 2Si(e 5-C 5Me 4)(e 5-C 5H 3-3- tBu)Zr ] <nUm> ( μ 2,e <nUm> , η 2-N <nUm> ) , dinitrogen loss became competitive with N <nUm> carbonylation , and significant quantity of the zirconocene dicarbonyl accompanied oxamidide formation . In contrast , the hafnocene complex [ ( η 5-C 5Me 4H ) 2Hf ] <nUm> ( μ 2,e 2,e 2-N <nUm> ) underwent clean carbonylative dinitrogen cleavage with no evidence of N <nUm> loss . CO-induced N <nUm> cleavage wa also coupled to N-H bond formation by hydrogenation and C-H bond activation , a carbonylation of the zirconocene and hafnocene dinitrogen complex in the presence of H <nUm> or phenylacetylene furnished isocyanato metallocene complex with bridging imido ( m-NH ) ligand . In the case of the ansa - hafnocene dinitrogen complex , replacing the dihydrogen atmosphere with various primary silanes yielded an isocyanato hafnocene m-oxo hydride resulting from cleavage of N <nUm> and CO , the diatomics with the two strongest bond in chemistry . the alkylaluminum - complexed zirconocene trihydride cation [(SBI)Zr(m-H)3(AliBu2)2] + , which is obtained by reaction of BCl2ISZr with [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] and excess AlH iBu2 in toluene solution , catalyzes the formation of isotactic polypropene when exposed to propene at <nUm> ° C . this cation remains the sole observable specie in catalyst system free of AlMe compound . In the presence of AlMe3 , however , exposure to propene cause the trihydride cation to be completely converted , under concurrent consumption of all hydride specie by propene hydroalumination , to the doubly me - bridged cation [(SBI)Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2]+ . the latter then becomes the resting state for further propene polymerization , which produce , by chain transfer to Al , mainly AlMe2 - capped isotactic polypropene . the ansa - zirconocene complex rac-Me2Si(1-indenyl) 2ZrCl2 ( BCl2ISZr ) reacts with diisobutylaluminum hydride and trityl tetrakis(perfluorophenyl)borate in hydrocarbon solution to give the cation [ (SBI)Zr(m-H)3(Al iBu2)2]+ , the identity of which is derived from NMR data and supported by a crystallographic structure determination . analogous reaction proceed with many other zirconocene dichloride complex . [ (SBI)Zr(m-H)3(AliBu 2)2]+ reacts reversibly with AlCl iBu2 to give the dichloro-bridged cation [(SBI)Zr(m-Cl)2AliBu2]+ . reaction with AlMe3 first lead to mixed - alkyl specie [ (SBI)Zr(m-H) <nUm> ( AlMex iBu2 - x)2 ] + by exchange of alkyl group between aluminum center . At higher AlMe3 / Zr ratio , [(SBI)Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2] + , a constituent of methylalumoxane - activated catalyst system , is formed in an equilibrium , in which the hydride cation [ (SBI)Zr(m-H) 3(AlR2)2]+ strongly predominates at comparable HAliBu2 and AlMe3 concentration , thus implicating the presence of this hydride cation in olefin polymerization catalyst system . accurate active - site count are necessary for the establishment of olefin polymerization kinetics , yet current technique are often tedious and limited in sensitivity . herein , we describe the development of a novel method for determining the fraction of initiated catalyst using standard gel - permeation chromatography ( GPC ) . the first insertion of monomer into the chromophore - bearing zirconocene <nUm> generates a single equivalent of a labeled polymer chain . the polymer - bound label can be quantified a a function of polymer molecular weight using a GPC with a UV detector ; simultaneous RI detection allows both the extent of monomer conversion and the molecular - weight distribution to also be established . we estimate that monomer to catalyst ratio of a high a <nUm> : <nUm> can be measured using this technique . 91Zr ( I = <nUm> / <nUm> ) solid - state NMR ( SSNMR ) spectrum of the zirconocene compound , Cp2ZrCl2 , cp* 2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) , Cp2ZrBr2 ( 2 ) , ( me 3SiC5H4)2ZrBr2 ( 3 ) , O(Me2SiC5H4)2ZrBr2 ( 4 ) , (1,3-C5H3)(SiMe2OSiMe2) 2(1,3-C5H3)ZrBr2 ( 5 ) , ind 2ZrCl2 ( 6 ) , Cp2ZrMeCl ( 7 ) , cp 2ZrMe2 ( 8 ) , and [Cp2ZrMe][MeB(C 6F5)3 ] ( 9 ) have been acquired . static 91Zr SSNMR spectrum have been acquired for all complex at magnetic field of <nUm> and <nUm> T. Cp2ZrCl2 and complex <nUm> to <nUm> posse relatively narrow central transition powder pattern which allows for magic - angle spinning ( MAS ) 91Zr solid - state NMR spectrum to be acquired at a moderate field strength of <nUm> T . complex <nUm> to <nUm> posse ultrawideline central transition SSNMR spectrum necessitating piece-wise acquisition technique . from the static and MAS 91Zr SSNMR spectrum , it is possible to measure 91Zr electric field gradient ( EFG ) and chemical shift ( CS ) tensor parameter , a well a the euler angle which describe their relative orientation . basis set and method for the accurate quantum chemical calculation of 91Zr EFG and CS tensor have been identified . the origin of the observed EFG and CS tensor parameter are further investigated by visualization of the EFG and CS tensor orientation within the molecular frame . correlation between the observed and calculated NMR tensor parameter and molecular symmetry and structure are made . all of these observation suggest that 91Zr SSNMR spectroscopy can be utilized to probe the molecular structure of a variety of homogeneous and heterogeneous olefin polymerization catalyst . the reaction of the low - valent metallocene(II) source cp 2Ti(n2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) ( 7 ) and Cp2Zr(py)(n2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ( <nUm> , cp = n5-cyclopentadienyl , py = pyridine ) with carbodiimides RN = C = NR ( r = cy , i-Pr , p-Tol ) lead to the formation of five membered hetero-metallacycloallenes Cp2M{Me3SiC = C = C[N(SiMe3)(R)]-N ( r ) } ( 9M-R ) ( m = Ti , r = i-Pr ; m = Zr , r = cy , i-Pr , p-Tol ) . elimination of the alkyne ( a the hitherto known reactivity of titanocene and zirconocene alkyne complex would suggest ) wa not observed . the molecular structure of the obtained complex were confirmed by x-ray study . moreover , the structure and bonding of the complex 9Zr-Cy and 9Zr-p-Tol wa investigated by DFT calculation . ( figure presented ) the cationic zirconocene - phosphinoaryloxide complex [ cp 2ZrOC6H4P(t-Bu)2][B(C 6F5)4 ] ( 3 ) and [ Cp*2ZrOC 6H4P(t-Bu)2][B(C6F5) <nUm> ] ( 4 ) were synthesized by the reaction of Cp2ZrMe <nUm> or Cp*2ZrMe2 with 2-(diphenylphosphino) phenol followed by protonation with [2,6-di-tert-butylpyridinium][B(C 6F5)4 ] . compound <nUm> exhibit a Zr-P bond , whereas the bulkier cp* derivative <nUm> wa isolated a a chlorobenzene adduct without this Zr-P interaction . these compound can be described a transition - metal - containing version of linked frustrated lewis pair ( FLPs ) , and treatment of <nUm> with H under mild condition cleaved H <nUm> in a fashion analogous to that for main - group FLPs . their reactivity in amine borane dehydrogenation also mimic that of main - group FLPs , and they dehydrogenate a range of amine borane adduct . however , in contrast to main - group FLPs , <nUm> and <nUm> achieve this transformation in a catalytic rather than stoichiometric sense , with rate superior to those for previous high - valent catalyst . the extension of the frustrated lewis pair ( FLP ) concept to the transition series with cationic zirconocene - phosphinoaryloxide complex is demonstrated . such complex mimic the reactivity of main group FLPs in reaction such a heterolytic hydrogen cleavage , CO <nUm> activation , olefin and alkyne addition , and ring - opening of tetrahydrofuran . the interplay between sterics and electronics is shown to have an important role in determining the reactivity of these compound with hydrogen in particular . the Zr-H specie generated from the heterolytic activation of hydrogen is shown to undergo insertion reaction with both CO <nUm> and CO . crucially , these transition metal FLPs are markedly more reactive than main group system in many case , and in addition to the usual array of reaction they demonstrate unprecedented reactivity in the activation of small molecule . this includes S N and E2 reaction with alkyl chloride and fluoride , enolate formation from acetone , and the cleavage of C-O bond to facilitate S N type reaction with noncyclic dialkyl ether . reaction of cp 2Zr(m-Cl)(m-C 2B 10H 10)Li(OEt <nUm> ) <nUm> with alkyne r 1C ≡ CR <nUm> gave a insertion product zirconacyclopentenes incorporating a carboranyl unit , 1,2-[Cp 2ZrC(R <nUm> ) = C(R 2)]-1,2-C 2B 10H <nUm> ( 1 ) . treatment of <nUm> with another type of alkyne r 3C ≡ CR <nUm> in the presence of stoichiometric amount of ClNi <nUm> and ClFe <nUm> or a catalytic amount of ClNi <nUm> afforded symmetric or unsymmetric benzocarboranes . the regioselectivity wa dominated by the polarity of the corresponding alkyne . these reaction could also be carried out in one pot , leading to the equivalent of a three - component [ <nUm> + <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition of carboryne and two different alkyne promoted by transition metal . A reaction mechanism wa proposed after the isolation and structural characterization of the key intermediate nickelacycle . these result show that nickel complex are more reactive than the iron one toward the insertion of alkyne but that the latter do not initiate the trimerization of alkyne , making the insertion of activated alkyne possible . this work also demonstrates that a catalytic amount of nickel work a well a a stoichiometric amount of nickel in the presence of excess ClFe <nUm> for the reaction . such a catalytic reaction may shed some light on the development of zirconocene - based catalytic reaction . coordination polymerization of renewable a-methylene-g-(methyl) butyrolactones by chiral C 2-symmetric zirconocene catalyst produce stereo - random , highly stereo - regular , or perfectly stereo - regular polymer , depending on the monomer and catalyst structure . computational study yield a fundamental understanding of the stereocontrol mechanism governing these new polymerization reaction mediated by chiral metallocenium catalyst . salt metathesis reaction of cp <nUm> ( NR 2)ZrX ( x = Cl , I , OTf ) and lithium hydrosilazides ultimately afford hydride product cp <nUm> ( NR 2)ZrH that suggest unusual b-hydrogen elimination process . A likely intermediate in one of these reaction , cp 2Zr[N(SiHMe 2)t-Bu][N(SiHMe <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , is isolated under controlled synthetic condition . addition of alkali metal salt to this zirconium hydrosilazide compound produce the corresponding zirconium hydride . however a condition are varied , a number of other pathway are also accessible , including C-H / Si-H dehydrocoupling , g-abstraction of a CH , and b-abstraction of a HSi . our observation suggest that the conversion of (hydrosilazido)zirconocene to zirconium hydride and silanimine doe not follow the classical four - center mechanism for b-elimination . chemistry research is an eloquent , yet extremely complex discipline consisting of a diverse range of topic . the complexity of every sub-discipline requires extensive focus , which can limit cross-talk between field , thus leading to their isolation . In particular , natural product and material chemistry have experienced this trend , and it ha led to an ever growing separation between them . yet by looking at the fundamental aspect of the relationship between molecular design and the resulting property , it is possible to remind chemist of their ability to bridge these research area . it is intradisciplinary collaboration that can provide a path toward collectively addressing the many challenge of chemistry . reduction of Zr(IV) metallocenium cation with sodium amalgam ( HgNa ) produce EPR signal assignable to Zr (III) metallocene complex . the chloro-bridged heterodinuclear ansa - zirconocenium cation [ (SBI)Zr(m-Cl) 2AlMe2]+ ( SBI = rac-dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl) ) , present in toluene solution a it BC6F5 <nUm> - salt , thus give rise to an EPR signal assignable to the complex (SBI)ZrIII(m-Cl)2AlMe2 , while (SBI)ZrIII-Me and (SBI)ZrIII(m-H)2Al iBu2 are formed by reduction of [ (SBI)Zr(m-Me) 2AlMe2]+ BC6F5 <nUm> - and [ (SBI)Zr(m-H)3(AliBu 2)2]+ BC6F5 <nUm> - , respectively . these product can also be accessed , along with (SBI)ZrIII - iBu and [(SBI)ZrIII] + AlR4 - , when (SBI)ZrMe2 is allowed to react with HAliBu2 , eliminating isobutane en route to the Zr (III) complex . further study concern interconversion reaction between these and other (SBI)Zr(III) complex and reaction mechanism involved in their formation . the reactivity of a series of disilazido zirconocene complex is dominated by the migration of anionic group ( hydrogen , alkyl , halide , OTf ) between the zirconium and silicon center . the direction of these migration is controlled by the addition of two - electron donor ( lewis base ) or two - electron acceptor ( lewis acid ) . the cationic nonclassical [ Cp2ZrN(SiHMe 2)2]+ ( [2]+ ) is prepared from Cp2Zr{N(SiHMe2)2}H ( 1 ) and B(C 6F5)3 or [Ph3C][B(C 6F5)4 ] , while reaction of B(C 6F5)3 and Cp2Zr{N(SiHMe 2)2}R ( r = me ( 3 ) , et ( 5 ) , n-C3H7 ( 7 ) , CHi -CHSiMe3 ( 9 ) ) provide a mixture of [2]+ and [Cp2ZrN(SiHMe2)(SiRMe2)]+ . the latter product are formed through BC18F15 abstraction of a b-H and r group migration from Zr to the b-Si center . related b-hydrogen abstraction and x group migration reaction are observed for Cp2Zr{N(SiHMe2)2}X ( x = OTf ( 11 ) , Cl ( 13 ) , OMe ( 15 ) , O-i-C3H7 ( 16 ) ) . alternatively , addition of DMAP ( DMAP = 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine ) to [2]+ result in coordination to a Si center and hydrogen migration to zirconium , giving the cationic complex [Cp2Zr{N(SiHMe2)(SiMe2DMAP)}H] + ( [19]+ ) . related hydrogen migration occurs from [ cp 2ZrN(SiHMe2)(SiMe2OCHMe2) ] + ( [18]+ ) to give [ Cp2Zr{N(SiMe 2DMAP)(SiMe2OCHMe2)}H]+ ( [22] + ) , whereas x group migration is observed upon addition of DMAP to [Cp2ZrN(SiHMe2)(SiMe2X)]+ ( x = OTf ( [12]+ ) , Cl ( [14]+ ) ) to give [ cp 2Zr{N(SiHMe2)(SiMe2DMAP)}X]+ ( x = OTf ( [26]+ ) , Cl ( [20]+ ) ) . the specie involved in these transformation are described by resonance structure that suggest b-elimination . notably , such pathway are previously unknown in early metal amide chemistry . finally , these migration facilitate direct Si-H addition to carbonyl , which is proposed to occur through a pathway that previously had been reserved for later transition metal compound . treatment of a [(trimethylsilylethynyl)alkenyl]ZrCp2 complex with pier ' borane [HB(C6F5)2] resulted in the clean formation of the Zr / B complex [ e2-(C6F 5)2B-Ci - C-SiMe3]ZrCp2 ( 3 ) . this compound show some unique reaction pattern . with a variety of typical donor ligand ( carbon monoxide , an isonitrile , a nitrile , THF-d8 , ) it form the respective adduct <nUm> ( four example characterized by x-ray diffraction ) . toward terminal alkyne ( RCi - CH ) compound <nUm> behaves a a Zr (II) metal lewis base / boron lewis acid frustrated lewis pair ( FLP ) and undergoes typical regioselective 1,2-Zr / B addition reaction to yield the metallaheterocyclic product <nUm> ( four example characterized by x-ray diffraction ) . compound <nUm> also undergoes characteristic 1,4-Zr / B FLP addition to a silyl-substituted conjugated enyne ( to give <nUm> ) and also to 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)butadiyne to yield a metallacyclic butatriene derivative <nUm> ( both <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by x-ray diffraction ) . eventually , compound <nUm> reacted with mes2P-Ci - CH to give the metallacycloallenoid product <nUm> , which wa probably formed by mean of 1,2-Zr / B FLP addition followed by alkynyl shift from boron to zirconium and reductive coupling . treatment of <nUm> with tolane gave the closely related zirconacycloallenoid complex <nUm> by carbon carbon coupling . both the product <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by x-ray diffraction . Cs - ligated ansa - zirconocene bis- and mono(ester enolate ) complex incorporating the diphenylmethylidene-(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl) ligand , upon activation with appropriate activator , are highly active catalyst for the syndiospecific polymerization of MMA at ambient temperature , leading to the production of PMMA with high syndiotacticity ( rrrr = <nUm> % ) and glass transition temperature ( tg = <nUm> ° C ) . the mechanism of reversible alkyne coupling at zirconium wa investigated by examination of the kinetics of zirconacyclopentadiene cleavage to produce free alkyne . the zirconacyclopentadiene ring studied posse trimethylsilyl substituents in the a-positions , and the ancillary cp2 , me 2C(e5-C5H4)2 , and CpCp* ( cp* = e5-C5Me5 ) bis(cyclopentadienyl) ligand set were employed . fragmentation of the zirconacyclopentadiene ring in Cp2Zr[2,5-(Me3Si) 2-3,4-Ph2C4 ] with PMe3 , to produce Cp2Zr(e2-PhC ≡ CSiMe3)-(PMe <nUm> ) and free PhC ≡ CSiMe3 , is first - order in initial zirconacycle concentration and zero - order in incoming phosphine ( kob = 1-4(2) × 10-5 s-1 at <nUm> ° C ) , and the activation parameter determined by an eyring analysis ( DH ‡ = <nUm> kcal mol-1 and DS ‡ = <nUm> eu ) are consistent with a dissociative mechanism . the analogous reaction of the ansa - bridged complex Me2C(e 5-C5H4)2Zr[2,5-(Me 3Si)2-3,4-Ph2C4 ] is <nUm> time faster than that for the corresponding cp2 complex , while the corresponding CpCp* complex reacts <nUm> time slower than the cp2 derivative . these rate appear to be largely influenced by the steric property of the ancillary ligand . addition of <nUm> equiv of carbon dioxide to the ansa - zirconocene dinitrogen complex resulted in selective insertion into each zirconium nitrogen bond , forming a C2 symmetric dicarboxylated diazenido compound . treatment with excess Me3SiI furnished the ansa - zirconocene diiodide along with the N,N-dicarboxylated silylated hydrazine . new nitrogen-carbon bond were also assembled by addition of methyl triflate . tri- and tetrasubstituted hydrazine could be formed by treatment with water and Me3SiI , respectively . the regiochemistry of the N carboxylation is controlled by the ansa-cyclopentadienyl ligand where the sterically demanding tert-butyl substituents and the C2 symmetry of the dimer dictate the stereochemistry of CO2 insertion . these result demonstrate the ability of zirconium dinitrogen compound to participate in heterocumulene insertion chemistry . exposure of the isolable zirconocene sandwich compound , (e5-C5Me5)(e5-C 9H5-1-R1-3-R2)Zr ( R1 = me , iPr , tBu ; R2 = me ) to one atmosphere of dinitrogen resulted in N coordination . x-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy establish that the resulting dimeric dinitrogen compound contain an unusual m2,e2-bridging indenyl ring and a weakly activated N ligand . N coordination from the isolable zirconium sandwich compound is extremely sensitive to the number and size of the indenyl subsituents . compound bearing two [iPr] or three methyl substituents are stable a e9 sandwich compound for week under dinitrogen likely due to the inability to dimerize through a two - atom N <nUm> bridge . performing the reduction of ( e5-C 5Me5)(e5-C9H5-1- R1-3-R2)ZrCl2 ( R1 = iPr , tBu ; R2 = me ; R1 = R2 = SiMe <nUm> ) under an N atmosphere produced a different outcome ; rare example of side-on , end-on zirconium dinitrogen compound were isolated and in one case , crystallographically characterized . protonolysis study with weak bronsted acid were used to evaluate the relative activation of the bridging dinitrogen ligand . sodium amalgam reduction of the bis(indenyl)zirconium dihalide complex , (e5-C9H5-1-iPr-3-Me)2ZrX2 ( x = Cl , Br , I ) , yielded the corresponding end-on dinitrogen complex , [(e5-C9H5-1-iPr-3-Me)2Zr(NaX)]2(m2 , e1 , e1-N2 ) , with inclusion of <nUm> equiv of salt per zirconocene . the solid state structure of the chloro and iodo congener establish short Zr = N and elongated N-N bond , consistent with modest to strong activation of the coordinated dinitrogen molecule . exposure of the N compound to <nUm> atm of dihydrogenresulted in rapid N-H bond formation to yield a hydrido zirconocene hydrazido compound concomitant with salt elimination . these study establish a new structural type of zirconocene dinitrogen complex and demonstrate that side-on coordination of the N ligand in the ground state is not a prerequisite for dinitrogen hydrogenation . reaction of unbridged zirconocene dichloride , ( r n C <nUm> H 5-n ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> , or <nUm> ) , with diisobutylaluminum hydride ( HAI'Bu <nUm> ) result in the formation of tetranuclear trihydride cluster of the type ( r n C <nUm> H 5-n ) <nUm> Zr(m-H) <nUm> ( Al i Bu2)3(m-CI) <nUm> , which contain three [ Al i bu <nUm> ] unit . ring - bridged ansa - zirconocene dichloride , Me2E(R n C <nUm> H 4-n ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> with e = C or Si , on the other hand , are found to form binuclear dihydride complex of the type Me2E(R n C <nUm> H 4-n ) <nUm> Zr(CI)(m-H) <nUm> Al i bu <nUm> with only one [ AIBu <nUm> ] unit . the dichotomy between unbridged and bridged zirconocene derivative with regard to tetranuclear versus binuclear product formation is proposed to be connected to different degree of rotational freedom of their C <nUm> - ring ligand . alkylaluminum - complexed zirconocene dihydrides , previously observed in zirconocene - based precatalyst system activated by methylalumoxane ( MAO ) upon addition of HAI'Bu <nUm> or Al i bu <nUm> , are proposed to be specie of the type me <nUm> si(ind) <nUm> Zr(Me)(m-H) <nUm> Al i bu <nUm> , stabilized by interaction of their terminal me group with a lewis acidic site of MAO . low - valent zirconocene specie reacted with 1,1,6,6-tetraalkyl-1,2,3,4,5- hexapentaenes to form both 1-zirconacyclopent-3-ynes and n2-p- coordinated complex according to the alkyl group ( r ) and the existence of the neutral ligand ( L ) . haptotropic interconvertion between these two complex wa observed . it wa proposed that double insertion of isocyanide into the Zr-C bond of 1-zirconacyclopent-3-ynes take place via the isocyanide adduct of the n2-p - complex a an intermediate . treatment of the bis-acetylide zirconocene complex ( RCp ) 2Zr(C ≡ C-SiMe3)2 ( 8a,R = CH3 ; 8b,R = tert-butyl ) with BC12F10H result in the formation of the five - membered organometallic zirconacycloallenoid product ( 9a , 9b ) . both were characterized by x-ray diffraction , and the special bonding feature of 9a were studied by DFT calculation . the overall reaction wa followed by NMR experiment at variable temperature . starting from 8a the reaction proceeds by alkynyl abstraction to give a zwitterionic [ ( MeCp ) 2ZrC ≡ C-SiMe3]+[e-Ar2 FB(H)C ≡ C-SiMe3]- intermediate ( 12a ) , single crystal of which were obtained at <nUm> ° C for characterization by x-ray diffraction , followed by a 1,1-hydroboration / s-ligand coupling sequence to give the new five - membered zirconacycloallenoid product 9a . reaction of <nUm> equivs of MesC ≡ CPh with cp 2Zr( e2-Me 3SiC ≡ CSiMe 3)(pyr) afforded the zircona-cyclopentadiene cp 2Zr[2,5-Ph2-3,4-Mes 2C <nUm> ] . the regiochemistry of this isomer ( sss with respect to the mesityl substituents ) wa determined through single - crystal x-ray analysis and 2D ( NOESY , HSQC , HMBC ) NMR experiment . this selectivity is attributed largely to a steric - based directing effect of the o-methyl ring substituents since coupling of 1,3-dimethyl-2-(phenylethynyl)benzene with zirconocene gave a single regioisomer ( o-xylyl group in both ss-positions ) while coupling of 1,3-dimethyl-5-(phenylethynl)benzene gave a statistical distribution of zirconacyclopentadiene regioisomers . the coupling reaction of <nUm> equivs of MeC ≡ CMes or CPr ≡ CMes with cp 2Zr(e 2-Me 3SiC ≡ CSiMe 3)(pyr) at ambient temperature gave the sss regioisomers , cp 2Zr[2,5-Me2-3,4-Mes 2C <nUm> ] and cp 2Zr[2,5-Pr2-3,4-Mes 2C4 ] , respectively , a the major product . heating solution of these zirconacycles at <nUm> ° C for several hour resulted in an increase in the amount of the unsymmetrical product . for reaction mixture of CPr ≡ CMes and cp 2Zr(e 2-Me 3SiC ≡ CSiMe 3)(pyr) the major ( and apparently thermodynamic ) product under these reaction condition wa cp 2Zr[2,4-Mes 2-3,5-Pr 2C <nUm> ] . the steric strain in the mesityl-substituted zirconacycles allowed for facile substitution reaction of MesC ≡ CPh or CPr ≡ CMes by le bulky alkyne ( i.e. , tolan and 3-hexyne ) to give the unsymmetrical ziconacyclopentadienes cp 2Zr[2,4,5-Ph 3-3-MesC <nUm> ] , cp 2Zr[2-Ph- 3-Mes-4,5-Et 2C <nUm> ] , and cp 2Zr[2-Pr-3-Mes-4,5- ph 2C <nUm> ] . reaction of a mesityl-terminated diyne containing a rigid dihexylfluorenylene spacer with zirconocene afforded poly(p-fluorenylenedienylene) after demetalation with benzoic acid . ( chemical equation presented ) the reaction of cpx 2ZrCl2 ( cpx = cp , cp* ) with ammonia borane in presence of n-butyllithium yielded Cp2Zr(Cl)NH 2BH3 and Cpx2Zr(H)NH 2BH3 . these derivative are isoelectronic with the ethyl zirconocene chloride and hydride , respectively , and feature a chelating amidoborane ligand coordinating through a Zr-N bond and a Zr-H-B bridge . In solution , each of the complex consists of an equilibrium mixture of two isomer differing in the orientation of the amidoborane ligand with respect to the Zr-X bond ( x = H , Cl ) , while in the solid state , only one isomer wa observed . such isomer have not been characterized for any metal complex containing the isoelectronic b-agostic ethyl ligand or any other agostic alkyl group . treatment of the hafnocene complex bearing a strongly activated , side-on bound dinitrogen ligand , [ ( e5-C5Me4H ) 2Hf]2(m2,e2 , e2-N2 ) , with two equivalent of methyl triflate yielded a mixture of product , one of which wa identified a the triflato hafnocene methyl diazenide compound , ( e5-C5Me 4H)2Hf(OTf)(N2(CH3)) , arising from methylation of one of the nitrogen atom . this reactivity contrast with that of the zirconocene congener , [ ( e5-C5Me 4H)2Zr]2(m2,e2 , e2-N2 ) , where methyl triflate addition yield a variety of product that lack new nitrogen-carbon bond . the methylated hafnocene product , ( e5-C5Me4H ) 2Hf(OTf)(N2(CH3)) provides a platform for additional transformation for the functionalized dinitrogen core . treatment with additional methyl triflate result in a second nitrogen-carbon bond formation to yield a rare example of a triflato hafnocene hydrazonato complex . loss of methane and formation of the hafnocene bis(triflate) accompany the transformation . isotopic labeling study and other experiment are consistent with a pathway involving initial methylation of the unsubstituted nitrogen in the methyl diazenido ligand followed by deprotonation by a triflate anion . reaction of 1,2-dipotassiotetrakis(trimethylsilyl)disilane with group <nUm> metallocene dichloride lead to the formation of the respective metallocene 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)disilene complex . while the disilene titanocene complex could be structurally characterized , the zirconocene and hafnocene compound , which are believed to posse some degree of bis-[bis(trimethylsilyl)silylene] character , can only be isolated in substance a the respective trimethylphosphane adduct . analogous metallocene 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)digermene complex and a tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)silagermene complex were prepared . instead of metallocene 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)distannene complex , four - membered ring composed of a metallocene and three bis(trimethylsilyl)stannylene unit were obtained . ( chemical equation presented ) the C-D activation of bromobenzene-d <nUm> by [Cp*2ZrMe(BrC6D5-kBr)] [B(C6F5)4] to form s-aryl complex [Cp*2Zr(2-BrC6D4-k2Br,C)] [B(C6F5)4] is accelerated when the decamethylzirconocene methyl cation is generated in the presence of tertiary amine . computational study suggest that the overall B - bond metathesis reaction proceeds , in the presence of tertiary amine , via initial deprotonation of bromobenzene in the coordination sphere of the metal center . In a subsequent step , the resulting neutral methyl aryl specie , Cp*2ZrMe(2- BrC6D4 ) , reacts with the concurrently generated trialkylammonium cation to generate [ Cp*2Zr(2-BrC 6D4-k2Br,C ) ] [B(C6F5)4] . ( chemical equation presented ) addition of 1-hexene to methylalumoxane- activated catalyst system based on rac-Me2Si(ind)2ZrMe2 cause , concurrent with polyhexene formation and diminution of the otherwise prevalent cation [ rac-Me2Si(ind)2Zr(m -Me ) 2AlMe2]+ , formation of a hitherto unobserved specie [ rac-Me2Si(ind)2Zr(m -R)(m -Me)AlMe 2]+ , where r is a Zr - bound polyhexyl chain . As hexene is increasingly consumed , this cation decay , mainly back to [ rac-Me 2Si(ind)2Zr(m -Me)2AlMe2 ] + and , in part , to some specie containing a Zr - bound allylic chain end . the reaction of internal and terminal alkyne with organoalanes containing et , n-Pr , and i-Bu group in the presence of cp 2ZrCl <nUm> and MeZrCp 2Cl were investigated with the goal of clarifying mechanistic detail of some representative case . three fundamentally different process , i.e. , ( i ) C-M bond addition without C-H activation in the alkyl group , ( ii ) cyclic C-M bond addition via C-H activation , and ( iii ) hydrometalation , have been observed , and the course of these reaction significantly depend on ( i ) the nature and number of alkyl group in organoalanes , ( ii ) their amount , and ( iii ) solvent . the reaction of alkyne with et 3Al in the presence of <nUm> equiv of cp 2ZrCl <nUm> in nonpolar solvent , e.g. , hexane , proceeds via C-H activation to give the corresponding aluminacyclopentenes . investigation of the reaction of 5-decyne with 1-3 equiv of et 3Al and <nUm> equiv of cp 2ZrCl <nUm> , which gave mono- , di- , or trideuterated (Z)-5-ethyl-5-decene a shown , together with the previously reported structural study on the reaction of et 3Al with cp 2ZrCl <nUm> leading to the formation of well - characterized bimetallic specie <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> , support a catalytic cycle involving bimetallic specie <nUm> and <nUm> . In summary , this process requires a zirconocene derivative containing one Zr - bound et group which is linked to et 3Al ( but not to et 2AlCl ) through a Cl bridge , i.e. , <nUm> , to produce <nUm> via β C-H activation . In sharp contrast , the reaction of et 2AlCl-Cp 2ZrCl <nUm> a well a of ( n-Pr ) 2AlCl-Cp 2ZrCl <nUm> doe not involve any C-H activation process . it proceeds well in chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent , e.g. , ( CH 2Cl ) <nUm> , but it is extremely sluggish in nonpolar solvent , e.g. , hexane . the reaction may well involve direct C-Al bond addition to alkyne , a suggested earlier for Zr - catalyzed Me-Al bond addition to alkyne , but a few other alternative can not be ruled out on the basis of the currently available data . the reaction of alkyne with ( n-Pr ) 3Al-Cp 2ZrCl <nUm> in nonpolar solvent proceeds partially via C-H activation and partially via hydrometalation . In contrast with the C-H activation process observed with et 3Al , that with ( n-Pr ) 3Al is totally dominated by dimerization of alkyne to give aluminacyclopentadienes rather than aluminacyclopentenes , reflecting a previously established generalization that propene can be much more readily displaced from Zr by alkyne than ethylene . hydrometalation is the exclusive process with ( i-Bu ) 3Al-Cp 2ZrCl <nUm> . this hydrometalation reaction , however , reveals a few interesting complication . alkyl-substituted internal alkyne give double bond migrated product in addition to the expected hydrometalation product . with terminal alkyne the reaction produce the expected hydrometalation product and the 1,1-dimetalloalkanes in comparable yield . various other related reaction involving other alkyne , e.g. , PhC ≡ CPh , n-OctC ≡ CH , and PhC ≡ CH , and other reagent , e.g. , et 3Al-MeZrCp 2Cl , et 2AlCl-MeZrCp 2Cl , and ( n-Pr ) 3Al-MeZrCp 2Cl , were also studied . In polymer made from (E)- or (Z)-[1-D]propene with methyl alumoxane (MAO)-activated ansa - zirconocene catalyst , signal of deuterium - labeled mrrm pentad document that stereoerrors arise mainly from an isomerization of the Zr - bound chain end . reduced d - atom redistribution in poly( [2-D]propene ) indicates a kinetic isotope effect of k(H) / k(D) ~ <nUm> for the b-H / d transfer associated with the isomerization reaction . In all poly([1- and [2-D]propenes ) studied , d - labeled mmmm pentad occur with a probability similar to that of d - labeled mrrm pentad ; this observation requires further mechanistic clarification . olefinic chain end of polymer obtained with C <nUm> H <nUm> ( thind ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> -MAO from (E)- or (Z)-[1-D]propene deviate in their d - label distribution from the expected stereochemistry . isomerization of the Zr - bound chain end , probably via a Zr - bound tertiary alkyl intermediate , thus contributes also to chain - growth termination . with the sterically hindered catalyst me <nUm> Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> -MAO , almost all chain termination appear to occur via chain - end isomerization , which doe not lead to stereoerrors here . with the high - performance catalyst me <nUm> Si(2-Me-benz[e]indenyl) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> -MAO , finally , no d - label is found in the mrrm and mmmm pentad signal ; here , Zr - alkyl isomerization can apparently not compete with the high rate of olefin insertion . none the mechanism of diimine-Ni - catalyzed ethylene polymerization reaction ha been studied theoretically using the B3LYP density functional method . the chain initiation reaction proceeds with the coordination of ethylene to the model active catalyst [L2NiCH3]+ , L2 - CH2N , followed by ethylene insertion into the metal - alkyl bond with a rate - determining <nUm> kcal / mol free energy barrier to form a g-agostic intermediate , which with a small barrier rearranges to a more stable b-agostic intermediate and then form an olefin alkyl complex upon coordination of the next ethylene . linear polymer propagation take place from this olefin alkyl complex , the resting state in the catalytic cycle , via the same insertion , rearrangement , and coordination pathway . an alternative pathway from the olefin alkyl complex pass over a 14-15 kcal / mol barrier for b-hydride elimination and reinsertion for branched polymer propagation . these energetics suggest that the Ni (II) - catalyzed reaction is expected to produce more linear than methyl-branched polymer , and that higher temperature increase and higher ethylene pressure decrease the branching . hydrogenolysis is an energetically favorable termination pathway , proceeding via coordination of a hydrogen molecule to the metal center , followed by H-H activation though a four - centered ' metathesis - like ' transition state and reductive elimination of alkane . A comparison with zirconocene - catalyzed ethylene polymerization show that the Ni(II)catalyzed polymerization should be slightly slower and should give more branching . the microstructures of polypropene produced with several zirconocene- based catalyst system are compared , to verify the possible correlation between the type of stereospecificity and the amount of regioirregularities . it is confirmed that , while syndiospecific and aspecific zirconocenes are highly regiospecific , isospecific system produce substantial amount of regioirregular monomeric unit . the amount of these secondary unit strongly depends on the nature of the p-ligands and on the type of the bridge connecting them . molecular mechanic calculation are reported , indicating that the intermediate which are energetically suitable for the secondary and primary insertion , for isospecific or syndiospecific complex , coordinate monomer enantiofaces of the opposite or the same chirality , respectively . this difference account for the lower regiospecificity of the isospecific catalytic complex , assuming that the energy barrier for the rotation of the coordinated monomer around the metal - olefin bond , between the orientation suitable for the primary and secondary insertion is lower than ( or comparable to ) the activation energy for secondary monomer insertion . the reaction of so called ' tuck-in ' permethyl zirconocene compound Cp*(e5-e1-C5Me4CH2)ZrX ( x = cl(1a) , C6H5 ( 1b ) , CH3 ( 1c ) ) with the highly electrophilic boranes BC12F10H and BC18F15 are described . the product are zwitterionic olefin polymerization catalyst . reaction with 1a and 1b yielded single product cleanly , but reaction with tuck-in methyl starting material 1c gave mixture . spectroscopic and structural study showed that the electrophilic zirconium center in the product zwitterions wa stabilized by a variety of mechanism . In the product of reaction between 1a and 1b with BC12F10H , Cp*[e5,e1-C5Me4CH2B(C6F5)2(m-H)]ZrX ( x = Cl ( 2a ) , <nUm> % ) , C6H5 ( 2b , <nUm> % ) ) , the metal is chelated by a pendant hydridoborate moiety . chloride product 2a wa characterized crystallographically . In the reaction of BC18F15 with 1a , the fluxional zwitterionic product Cp*[e5-C5Me4CH2B(C6F5)3]ZrCl ( 3a , <nUm> % ) is stabilized by a weak donor interaction between one of the ortho-fluorine atom of the -CH2B- C6F5 counteranion and the zirconium center ( Zr-F = <nUm> Å ) . In the product of the reaction between lb and BC18F15 , Cp*[e5-C5Me4CH2B(C6F5)3]ZrC6H5 ( 3b , <nUm> % ) , a similar ortho- fluorine interaction wa found in a yellow kinetic product ( y-3b ) , which converted upon heating gently to a thermodynamic orange polymorph ( o-3b ) in which the zirconium center is compensated via an agostic interaction from an ortho C-H bond of the phenyl group and an interaction between the methylene group of the -CH2B C6F5 counteranion . these compound were both characterized by x-ray crystallography . zwitterion o-3b reacts with H to form the zwitterionic hydride Cp*[e5-C5Me4CH2B(C6F5)3]ZrH ( <nUm> , <nUm> % ) , characterized by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography to reveal a return to the ortho-fluorine mode of stabilization . compound 2a , 3a , o-3b , and <nUm> were all found to be active ethlyene polymerization catalyst ; the chloride derivative required minimal amount of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) to alkylate the zirconium center . polymerization data are discussed in light of the structural finding for the catalyst employed . the extrusion of methane from (2-phosphininyl)(methyl) zirconocenes 3a-c at <nUm> ° C in benzene affords the corresponding < eta > 2-phosphabenzyne-zirconocene dimer 4a-c , one of which ha been characterized by x-ray crystal structure analysis . the parameter of the C-C-Zr three - membered ring are exactly similar to those found in the < eta > 2-benzyne-zirconocene complex : C-C , <nUm> ; C-Zr , <nUm> and <nUm> Å . the P-Zr distance are normal at <nUm> and <nUm> Å . the reaction of these < eta > 2-phosphabenzyne complex with acetonitrile , Ph3P = S , (diphenylphosphino)- and (trimethylsilyl)alkynes , aldehyde , and (+)-camphor have been investigated . In all case , an insertion into the C2-Zr bond is observed . hydrolysis of the intermediate zirconacycles thus obtained yielded several new 2-functional phosphinines , including a thiol ( 6 ) , a vinylphosphine ( 8 ) , two secondary alcohol ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) , and an homochiral phosphinine - substituted alcohol ( 17 ) . the regiospecificity of the insertion is ascribed to the huge concentration of negative charge at the a-position of the phosphinine ring . the lewis acid tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane add to the (butadiene)group <nUm> metallocenes 1a-d ( metallocene = Cp2Zr , Cp2Hf , (MeCp)2Zr , (Me3CCp)2Zr ) to give the metallocene-(m-C4H6)-borate-betaine complex 2a-d . (Isoprene)zirconocene ( 1e ) and (2-phenylbutadiene)zirconocene ( if ) add the BC18F15 reagent regioselectively at the carbon atom C-4 to give the complex 2e and 2f , respectively . the complex <nUm> all show a pronounced M***F-C interaction with one of the six ortho-B(C6F5)3 fluorine atom . the resulting metallacyclic structure were characterized by x-ray diffraction of the complex 2c and 2e ( Zr***F ~ <nUm> Å , angle Zr-F-C ~ <nUm> ° ) . the bridging fluorine atom of the complex in solution is characterized by an extreme upfield shift of it 19F NMR resonance ( δ ~ <nUm> to <nUm> ppm ) relative to the signal of the remaining five o-F resonance of the BC18F15 moiety ( average δ ~ <nUm> ppm ) . the 19F NMR spectrum of the complex <nUm> are dynamic even in the noncoordinating solvent toluene-d8 . all six o-fluorine signal equilibrate with coalescence temperature around <nUm> K at <nUm> MHz to give a single resonance signal at high temperature . this fluorine equilibration process of the -B(C6F5)3 end of the metallocene-borate-betaine complex <nUm> is very likely to proceed via a rate determining cleavage of the coordinative M***F-C interaction . from the activation barrier of this process , obtained from the dynamic fluorine NMR spectrum , Zr***F bond dissociation energy of ca. <nUm> kcal / mol were estimated for the complex <nUm> . this magnitude of the M***F-C band dissociation energy make the internal fluorocarbon coordination a very suitable tool for protecting active electrophilic metal catalyst center . the Zr***F-C bond of the complex <nUm> is cleaved by the addition of the donor solvent THF with formation of acyclic 1,2-e2-allyl metallocene complex . none synthetic pathway to several salt of the anion [Cp*2ZrH3]- have been developed . reaction of Cp*2ZrH2 ( 3 ) prepared from [Cp*2Zr(N2)]2(m-N2) ( 2 ) , with KH in THF , afforded [Cp*2ZrH3]K ( 1 ) in a <nUm> % yield . In a similar manner , addition of HLi gave [Cp*2ZrH3]Li ( 4 ) . while this synthetic pathway provides reproducible route to land <nUm> , purification of <nUm> is problematic . another preparation involving the reaction of Cp*2ZrC12 with <nUm> equiv of n-BuLi under H affords 4.0.5(LiCI-THF) . alternatively , reaction of Cp*2ZrC12 with AlH4Li afforded the specie Cp*2ZrH(m2-H2AlH2) ( 5 ) in virtually quantitative yield . subsequent reaction of <nUm> with n-BuLl afforded the direct and high - yield conversion to <nUm> . deuteration and NMR study infer attack of BuLi occurs at the Al center exclusively prompting transfer of a hydride to Zr and liberation of the Zr trihydride anion . variable - temperature 1H NMR spectrum and H / d scrambling experiment for <nUm> and 4-d3 are consistent with the hydride exchango process mediated by ion pairing while T1 study infer a classical trihydride formulation is appropriate . crystallographic study of 4-0.5(LiCI*THF) , <nUm> , and <nUm> also affirm cation - anion pairing in <nUm> and 4.0.5(LiCl*THF) and hydride bridging between A1 and Zr in <nUm> . treatment of bis(phenylethynyl)silane ( PhC ≡ C ) <nUm> SiR <nUm> ( r = me ( 2a ) , et ( 2b ) or ph ( 2c ) ) with cp <nUm> ZrEt <nUm> ( 1 ) ( cp = cyclopentadienyl ) and H <nUm> O / ClCu in this order afforded (1E,3E)-1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene ( 3 ) in 56-88 % yield after hydrolysis . on the other hand , hydrolysis of the reaction mixture of 2a-h with cp <nUm> ZrEt <nUm> gave silacyclobutene derivative 4a-h in 61-87 % yield . zirconium - containing intermediate <nUm> wa obtained a crystal suitable for X- ray analysis when t-BuC <nUm> H <nUm> wa used a the ligand of a zirconocene derivative . structure of <nUm> showed that the intermediate contained the zirconacyclobutene-silacyclobutene fused ring system . reaction of silacyclobutene 4a with ClCu selectively opened the silacyclobutene ring . the further treatment of the reaction mixture with phi in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(PPh <nUm> ) <nUm> gave 1,3,4-triphenyl-1-silyl-1,3-butadiene compound <nUm> . zirconacyclopentadienes with an alkynylsilyl group at the a- position afforded zirconacyclohexadiene derivative <nUm> in 82-98 % yield . when t-BuC <nUm> H <nUm> wa used a the ligand instead of two cp , the structure wa determined by x-ray analysis . the structure clearly showed that <nUm> had the zirconacyclohexadiene-silacyclobutene fused ring system . A new class of isospecific and highly regiospecific C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes , characterized by a bisindenyl ansa ligand with bulky substituents in the <nUm> position of indence and a single carbon bridge is disclosed : variation of the size of the substituent in C(3) ha a strong effect on the extent of chain transfer and isospecificity in propene polymerization . In fact , while rac-[Me2C(1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 produce low molecular weight and moderately isotactic polypropene ( iPP ) also containing some regioirregularities ( m(n) = <nUm> , mmmm ca. <nUm> % and 2,1(tot) = <nUm> % at <nUm> ° C in liquid monomer ) , rac-[Me2C(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 produce iPP with molecular weight between <nUm> ( t(p) = <nUm> ° C ) and <nUm> ( t(p) = <nUm> ° C ) and a fairly high isotacticity ( mmmm ca. <nUm> % at <nUm> ° C ) , with no detectable <nUm> unit . the influence of polymerization temperature on the catalyst performance ha been investigated by polymerizing liquid propene in the temperature range of 20-70 ° C : the experimental DDE value for enantioface selectivity have been estimated for two member of the new class ( rac-[Me2C(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 DDE(enant) = <nUm> kcal / mol ; rac-[Me2C(3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 DDE(enant) = <nUm> kcal / mol ) . for comparison , brintzinger 's moderately isospecific , benchmark catalyst rac-[ethylene(1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 ( DDE(enant) = <nUm> kcal / mol ) , the single carbon bridged , unsubstituted rac-[Me2C(1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 ( DDE(enant) = <nUm> kcal / mol ) , and the C2 - symmetric , practically aspecific , rac-[ethylene(3-methyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 ( DDE(enant) = <nUm> kcal / mol ) are also reported . the molecular structure of rac-[Me2C(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 and rac-[Me2C(3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 have been determined . the zirconocene - coupling of diynes with internal silicon substituents , MeC ≡ CMe2SiArSiMe2C ≡ CMe ( <nUm> : Ar = 1,4-C6H4 ; <nUm> : Ar = 1,3-C6H4 ; <nUm> : Ar = 1,3-C6H4 ; <nUm> : Ar = 4,4'-C6H4C6H4 ) , generates regiospecific polymer containing zirconacyclopentadiene in the main chain ( 5-7 ) . these organometallic polymer hydrolyze cleanly to butadienediyl polymer of the type [ Me2SiArSiMe2CH = CMeCMe = CH](n) ( 11-13 ) , and polymer <nUm> reacts with iodine to give the iodine - containing polymer [ 1,4-Me2SiC6H4SiMe2C(I) = CMeCMe = C(I)](n) ( 14 ) . the organometallic polymer undergo facile and high - yield degradation to macrocycles under mild condition ( refluxing tetrahydrofuran solution ) . the size and shape of the resulting macrocycles depend upon the nature of the diyne spacer group . thus , polymer <nUm> and <nUm> containing parallel diyne unit convert to the trimeric macrocycles [Me2SiArSiMe2C4Me2ZrCp2]3 ( <nUm> : Ar = 1,4-C6H4 ; <nUm> : Ar = 4,4'- C3H2 ) , while polymer <nUm> give the dimeric macrocycle [ 1,3- Me2SiC6H4SiMe2C4Me2ZrCp2]2 ( 18 ) . the dimeric macrocycle [Me2SiC6H4SiMe2C6H4SiMe2C4Me2ZrCp2]2 ( 20 ) wa obtained directly from the zirconocene coupling of Me2Si[(1,4-C6H4)- SiMe2(C ≡ CMe)]2 ( 4 ) by heating the reaction mixture to reflux . In a similar manner , the diyne Me2Si(C ≡ CMe)2 wa converted in high yield to the hexameric macrocycle [Me2SiC4Me2ZrCp2]6 ( 22 ) . the macrocycles <nUm> , [1,4-Me2SiC6H4SiMe2C4Me2H2]3 ( 16 ) , and <nUm> were characterized by single - crystal x-ray crystallography . molecule of <nUm> adopt a nearly planar C3 macrocyclic structure with a cavity described by an average transannular Si***Si distance of <nUm> Å , while the hydrolyzed macrocycle <nUm> ha a chair conformation . this conformation change result from conversion of ci diene group in the zirconacyclopendiene fragment to trans diene group in <nUm> . the high- yield formation of macrocycles apparently result from the reversible nature of the alkyne - coupling reaction , which allows for a low - energy pathway to the smallest macrocycle possessing minimal ring strain . none none bis(e-methylcyclopentadienyl)(e4-butadiene)zirconium add <nUm> equiv of the organometallic lewis acid BC18F15 to yield the metallocene- (mC4H6)-borate betaine <nUm> , which is an active , homogeneous , one - component ziegler catalyst for the polymerization of 1-alkenes . the metallacyclic metallocene betaine <nUm> undergoes a degenerate p=s=p-allyl interconversion on the NMR time scale in toluene solution ( DG([?])(m(obs))-(toluene) = <nUm> kcal mol-1 ) which becomes markedly faster in the presence of added reactive 1-alkenes ( DG([?])(m(obs)) = <nUm> ( 1-hexene ) , <nUm> ( 1-pentene ) , <nUm> ( 1- buterie ) , <nUm> kcal mo1-1 ( propene ) ) . this lowering of the activation barrier is probably due to an increased stabilization of the (s-alkyl)(p- alkene)metallocene betaine intermediate <nUm> , which at the same time is passed a the essential intermediate stage of the insertion of these alkene into the reactive zirconium carbon bond of <nUm> to yield the mono olefin insertion product <nUm> . the gibbs activation energy of this chemical insertion reaction ( DG([?])(chem) = <nUm> ( 1-hexene ) , <nUm> ( 1-pentene ) , <nUm> ( 1-butene ) , <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( propene ) ) are similar in magnitude to the activation energy of magnetical exchange ( DG([?])(m(obs)) ) . this creates the interesting situation that in the presence of these reactive 1-alkenes , the ( reversible ) magnetical exchange rate ( k(m(obs)) ) , a determined by the dynamic NMR experiment , is dependent on the rate of the competing ( irreversible ) overall chemical addition reaction ( k(chem) ) . the rate constant k(m(obs)) and k(chem) were measured in the presence of these 1-alkenes , which allowed for a determination of the height of the first , i.e. , the complexation barrier ( DG([?])1 = <nUm> ( 1-hexene ) , <nUm> ( 1-pentene ) , <nUm> ( 1-buterie ) , <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( propene ) ; standard state c(Th) = <nUm> mol L-1 ) and it difference ( DDG([?])2 ) to the top of the actual insertion barrier ( DDG([?])2 = <nUm> ( 1-hexene ) , <nUm> ( 1-pentene ) , <nUm> ( 1-butene ) , <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( propene ) ) . these value , together with the activation energy of the degenerate allyl ligand interconversion of the model system (s-allyl)(p-allyl)zirconocene ( 10 ) ( DG([?])3 = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ) , allowed for a good experimentally based estimate of the intrinsic activation energy ( reaction <nUm> → <nUm> ) of the insertion of these 1-alkenes into the zirconium carbon bond at this group <nUm> bent metallocene unit . the thus obtained insertion barrier is DG([?]) / ( in ) ≃ 10-11 kcal mol-1 for the 1-alkenes used in this study . the alkene decomplexation barrier ( reaction <nUm> → <nUm> ) is lower by ca , 1-2 kcal mol-1 . A series of substituted poly(p-phenylenediyne)s ( 1a-f ) wa synthesized by the palladium - catalyzed cross-coupling condensation of terminal dialkynylalkanes with substituted diiodobenzenes . polymerization were conducted with 1,4-diiodo-5-hexoxy-2-methoxybenzene or 1,4-diiodo-5-hexyl-2- methylbenzene and with 1,6-hexadiyne , 1,7-heptadiyne , or 1,8-octadiyne . thus , six different poly(p-phenylenediyne)s ( 1a-f , [ ArC ≡ C(CH2)(n)C ≡ c](m) ; Ar = 5-hexoxy-2-methoxyphenylene or 5-hexyl-2-methylphenylene , and n = <nUm> , <nUm> , or <nUm> ) were obtained . intramolecular zirconocene coupling of 1a-f afforded zirconacyclopentadiene - containing polymer 2a-f . these metal - containing polymer were then cleanly hydrolyzed to the substituted poly(p-phenylene- dieneylene)s ( 3a-f , [ ArCH = C(CH2)(n)C = CH](m) ; Ar = 5-hexoxy-2- methoxyphenylene or 5-hexyl-2-methylphenylene , and n = <nUm> , <nUm> , or <nUm> ) . variation of the polymer structure allows for manipulation of the absorption and emission maximum over the range of 316-524 nm and 437-619 nm , respectively . the optical property of model compound 9a-f , ( ArCH = C(CH2)(n)C = ArCH ; Ar = phenyl or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl , and n = <nUm> , <nUm> , or <nUm> ) are very similar to those for polymer 3a-f . the structure of 9c ( Ar = 2,5-dimethoxy-4- methylphenyl , n = <nUm> ) and 9d ( Ar = phenyl , n = <nUm> ) were determined by single- crystal x-ray crystallography . molecule of 9c are almost completely planar , while molecule of 9d are twisted and have poor ap-orbital overlap . the conformation of the diene unit in polymer 3a-f and the model compound 9a-f are largely responsible for the observed variation in optical property . finer tuning of the optical property for poly(p-phenylenedienylene)s may be achieved via synthesis of copolymer from mixture of 1,6-heptadiyne and 1,7- octadiyne . the optical property of the resulting copolymer represent weighted average for the corresponding homopolymers . investigation of the photophysical property of polymer retaining some of the diyne unit suggest that defect play a major role in defining the emissive property of the poly(p-phenylenedienylene)s described here . (Alkenyl)zirconocene chloride Cp2Zr(Cl)(CH = CHR ) ( <nUm> , r = H , phenyl , n- butyl , or cyclohexyl ) react with ' Cp2Zr ' generated from various precursor to yield the neutral dinuclear alkenyl-bridged bis(metallocene) complex <nUm> [ Cp2Zr(m-Cl)(m-n1:n2-CH = CHR)ZrCp2 ] . the complex <nUm> are regioselectively protonated by treatment with (HNMe2Ph+)(BPh4-) ( 8a ) to yield the unusually structured product <nUm> [ Cp2Zr(m-Cl)(m-n1:n2- C1H2C2HR)ZrCp2+ ] , which exhibit an unsymmetrically bridged hydrocarbyl ligand containing a novel type of a hypercoordinated carbon center ( C1 ) inside the rigid organometallic framework . from the NMR analysis and an X- ray crystal structure determination of the example 10c [ (MeCp)2Zr(m- Cl)(m-C1H2C2Hn-butyl)Zr(MeCp)2 / + ] , it is evident that the hypercarbon atom C1 is coordinated to four close neighboring atom ( zr1 , zr2 , C2 , and h(1a) ) in a distorted square - planar arrangement with the remaining C1-H(1b) bond being oriented perpendicular to it . h(1b) thus mark the apex of a distorted square pyramid ; the hypercarbon atom C1 is located in the center of the basal plane . this unusual structural coordination geometry around C1 is determined by the stereoelectronic feature of the two adjacent group <nUm> bent metallocene unit . from the dynamic feature of complex 9a ( r = H ) , a stabilization energy of ca. <nUm> kcal mol-1 is estimated for the uncommon coordination mode of C1 , which is favored here , relative to a ' normal ' sp3- hybridized structure in a c(2v)-symmetric metallacyclic framework . part of the pronounced thermodynamic stabilization of this unusual pentacoordinate carbon geometry originates from the strong a-agostic Zr***H(la)-C1 interaction in the basal plane . from the monodeuterated derivative 9a-C1HD , an energy difference of <nUm> cal mol-1 between d and H favoring the bridging position wa determined . none A new method for the directed meta acylation of aromatic compound is described . this method involves an ortho lithiation procedure combined with zirconocene-benzyne chemistry . 3-Acyl-1 - substituted benzene derivative were obtained by acidic hydrolysis of the azazirconacycle intermediate which result from the coupling of a nitrile with a zirconocene-benzyne complex . similarly , 3-acyl-2-iodo-1 - substituted benzene derivative were obtained by the iodination of the same intermediate followed by acidic hydrolysis . these procedure , which utilize simple , readily available starting material , give good yield of regiochemically pure product . absolute metal - ligand σ bond enthalpy have been determined for a series of titanocene , zirconocene , and hafnocene halide and dimethyls by iodinolytic titration calorimetry . absolute metal - iodine bond disruption enthalpy were measured by iodination of the monomeric trivalent group <nUm> metallocenes Cp(tt)2TiI , (Me5C5)2TiI , Cp(tt)2ZrI , and Cp(tt)2HfI ( cp(tt) = e5-1,3-di-tert-butylcyclopentadienyl ) . iodinolysis of Cp(tt)2ZrMe2 and Cp(tt)2HfMe2 in turn yield absolute Zr-Me and Hf-Me bond enthalpy . derived value ( kcal / mol ) are D[Cp(tt)2Ti(I)-I] = <nUm> ; D[(Me5C5)2Ti(I)-I] = <nUm> ; D[Cp(tt)2Zr(I)-I] = <nUm> ; D[Cp(tt)2Hf(I)-I] = <nUm> ; D[Cp(tt)2Zr-Me2] = <nUm> ; and D[Cp(tt)2Hf- me2 ] = <nUm> . that D[Cp(tt)2Zr(I)-(I)] ≃ D(I3Zr-I) and D[(Me5C5)2Ti(I)-I] ≃ D(I3Ti-I) , while D[Cp(tt)2Ti(I)-I] ≃ D(I3Ti-I) - <nUm> kcal / mol , argues for more reliable transferability of D(M(IV)-I) in sterically le congested metallocenes . the molecular structure of Cp2(tt)ZrI2 , Cp2(tt)ZrI , and Cp2(tt)HfI were determined by x-ray diffraction . In Cp(tt)2ZrI2 , the Zr ligation is pseudotetrahedral , and the ring tert-butyl group ' straddle ' the Zr-I bond to minimize steric interaction . the geometry about Zr in Cp(tt)2ZrI is pseudotrigonal , with contracted Zr - ring centroid and Zr-I distance versus Cp(tt)2grI2 , primarily reflecting substantially diminished ligand - ligand repulsive nonbonded interaction in the latter . Cp(tt)2HfI is isomorphous with Cp(tt)2ZrI , and the slightly different metrical parameter are in accord with Hf v Zr ionic radius . the significant difference in interligand repulsive interaction in the trivalent versus tetravalent complex are confirmed by van der waals calculation . high - resolution UV PE spectrum combined with ab initio relativistic effective core potential calculation provide detail of electronic structure . absolute ionization energy value indicate that iodine behaves a both a strong σ and π donor . trend in the large Cp2MX(n) structural database can be understood in term of the interplay between electronic and molecular structure factor , which are highly sensitive to the substitution pattern of the cyclopentadienyl ligand and , in particular , to competing σ v π M-X bonding . bis(2-arylindenyl)zirconium dichloride activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) produce elastomeric polypropylene . the elastic property of this material are proposed to arise from a stereoblock microstructure . the silyl bridged catalyst rac- and meso-dimethylsilyl(bis(2-phenylindenyl))zirconium dichloride were prepared and used to model the polymerization behavior of the unbridged catalyst . the meso isomer is approximately twice a productive a the rac isomer in propylene polymerization . additionally , blend of isotactic and atactic polypropylene were prepared by using varying amount of the rac and meso isomer until the IR and NMR characteristic matched polypropylene produced from bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride . these study suggest ( 1 ) that the rac isomer is favored in the isomerization equilibrium for the unbridged catalyst and ( 2 ) that the larger fraction of atactic polymer in the elastomeric polypropylene is a consequence of the higher rate of polymerization for the meso isomer . double [ SiMe <nUm> ] - bridged metallocenes ( 1,2-SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> { η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> -4- r}{e <nUm> -C <nUm> H-3,5-(CHMe <nUm> ) <nUm> }ZrCl <nUm> ( r = H ( 1a ) , CHMe <nUm> ( 1b ) , SiMe <nUm> ( 1c ) , CHMe(CMe <nUm> ) ( 1d ) , (+)-menthyl ( 1e ) ) , when activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , catalyze propylene polymerization with high activity . the preparation and x-ray structure of the dilithio salt of an enantiopure , double silylene-bridged bis(cyclopentadienyl) ligand , Li <nUm> [ ( 1,2-Me <nUm> Si ) <nUm> - { C <nUm> H <nUm> -4-(1R,2S,5R-menthyl)}{(C <nUm> H-3,5-(CHMe <nUm> ) <nUm> )}]*3THF , a well a the corresponding zirconocene dichloride , [ ( 1,2-Me <nUm> Si ) <nUm> { η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> H <nUm> -4- (1R,2S,5R-menthyl)}{e <nUm> -C <nUm> H-3,5-(CHMe <nUm> ) <nUm> }]ZrCl <nUm> ( 1e ) , are reported . the C ( s ) - symmetric system 1a-c are highly regiospecific and syndiospecific ( > <nUm> % ) in neat propylene . At lower propylene concentration , polymer with lower molecular weight and tacticity ( mostly m - type steroerrors ) are obtained . the microstructures of polymer produced under differing reaction condition are consistent with stereocontrol dominated by a site epimerization process , an inversion of configuration at zirconium resulting from the polymer chain swinging from one side of the metallocene wedge to the other without monomer insertion . the relative importance of chain epimerization ( at the β carbon ) ha been established by parallel polymerization of 2,d <nUm> -propylene and d <nUm> -propylene with 1b / MAO at low propylene concentration . the C <nUm> -symmetric system 1d,e / MAO display an unusual dependence of sterospecificity on propylene concentration , switching from isospecific to syndiospecific with increasing propylene pressure , consistent with a competitive unimolecular site epimerization process and a bimolecular chain propagation . the microstructures of the polypropylene produced by 1d / MAO and 1e / MAO with [r] ≃ <nUm> % resemble the hemiisotactic microstructure produced by me <nUm> c(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> -3-Me)(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> ( 2b ) / MAO . contrastingly , the hemiisotactic polypropylene microstructure obtained with 2b / MAO is found to be maintained at all propylene concentration examined . the new C1 - symmetric complex rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(2- methylbenz[e]-1-e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 14a ) , rac-[1-(9- e5-fluorenyl)-2-(4,5-cyclohexa-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 14b ) , and rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl- 1-e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 15 ) were prepared in up to <nUm> % yield . these compound , activated with methyl aluminoxane , exhibit high active propene polymerization rate which remain constant over hour , even at elevated polymerization temperature of <nUm> and <nUm> ° C . the two different coordination site of these ' dual - side ' catalyst lead to isotactic polypropene with variable amount of stereoerrors , depending on the monomer concentration . the 2-methyl substituent of the indenyl ligand result , at the same time , in significantly increased molecular weight of the polymer product ( up to <nUm> x <nUm> g mol-1 ) , the bulk property of which can be adjusted from flexible , semicrystalline thermoplastic to excellent thermoplastic elastic . enantiopure biphenyl-bridged titanocene and zirconocene complex were obtained , by an asymmetric thermal transformation of the binaphthol complex formed from the metallocene racemates and subsequent transformation to the corresponding dichloride , in practically quantitative yield . increased rate of this transformation in the presence of O gas or TEMPO indicate a radical reaction mechanism . the biphenyl-bridged titanocene enantiomer give rise to an efficient asymmetric catalysis for the hydrogenation of cyclic and noncyclic imines . phosphinozirconocene complex react with isocyanides to give unprecedented bi- or tricyclic b-phosphino imines through three successive and controlled step . spectroscopic and chemical evidence for the formation of the first neutral e1-imine zirconocene complex in the reductive elimination reaction sequence is presented . none none isotopically labeled alkyl zirconocene complex of the form ( CpR n ) <nUm> Zr(CH <nUm> CDR' <nUm> )(X) ( CpR n = alkyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl ; R' = H , alkyl group ; x = H , d , me ) undergo isomerization of the alkyl ligand a well a exchange with free olefin in solution under ambient condition . increasing the substitution on the cp ring result in slower isomerization reaction , but these steric effect are small . In contrast , changing x ha a very large effect on the rate of isomerization . pure s-bonding ligand such a methyl and hydride promote rapid isomerization , whereas p-donor ligand inhibit b-H elimination and hence alkyl isomerization . for ( e-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Zr(R)(Cl) , internal alkyl complex have been observed for the first time . the rate of isomerization depends on the length of the alkyl group : longer alkyl chain ( heptyl , hexyl ) isomerize faster than shorter chain ( butyl ) . the transient intermediate specie have been identified by a combination of isotopic labeling and <nUm> H , <nUm> H , and <nUm> C NMR experiment . the solid - state structure of the zirconocene cyclopentyl chloride complex , cp <nUm> Zr(cyclo-C <nUm> H <nUm> )(Cl) , ha been determined by x-ray diffraction . none by kinetically stabilizing imidozirconocene complex through the use of a sterically demanding ligand , or by generating a more thermodynamically stable resting state with addition of diphenylacetylene , we have developed transition metal - catalyzed imine metathesis reaction that are mechanistically analogous to olefin metathesis reaction catalyzed by metal carbene complex . when <nUm> mol % of Cp*Cp(THF)Zr = N'Bu is used a the catalyst precursor in the metathesis reaction between PhCH = NPh and p-TolCH = N-p-Tol , a <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> equilibrium mixture with the two mixed imines p-TolCH = NPh and PhCH = N-p-Tol is generated in C6D6 at <nUm> ° C . the catalyst wa still active after <nUm> day with an estimated <nUm> turnover ( t(1 / <nUm> ) <nUm> m ; TON = <nUm> h-1 ) . when the azametallacyclobutene Cp2Zr(N(Tol)C(Ph) = C(Ph) ) is used a the catalyst precursor under similar reaction condition , a total of <nUm> turnover are obtained after <nUm> day ( t(1 / <nUm> ) <nUm> m ; TON = <nUm> h-1 ) . an extensive kinetic and equilibrium analysis of the metallacyclobutene- catalyzed metathesis of PhCH = N-p-Tol and p-F-C6H4CH = N-p-F-C6H4 wa carded out by monitoring the concentration of imines and observable metal- containing intermediate over time . numerical integration method were used to fit these data to a detailed mechanism involving coordinatively unsaturated ( 16-electron ) imido complex a critical intermediate . examination of the scope of reaction between different organic imines revealed characteristic selectivity that appears to be unique to the zirconium - mediated system . several zirconocene complex that could generate the catalytically active ' CpCp'Zr = ArN ' ( cp ' = cp or cp* ) specie in situ were found to be effective agent in the metathetical exchange between different n-aryl imines . N-Alkyl aldimines were found to be completely unreactive toward metathesis with n-aryl aldimines , and metathesis reaction involving the two n-alkyl imines TolCH = NPr and PhCH = NMe gave slow or erratic result , depending on the catalyst used . metathesis wa observed between n-aryl ketimines and n-aryl aldimines , but for n-aryl ketimine substrate , the catalyst resting state consists of zirconocene enamido complex , generated by the formal C-H activation of the α position of the ketimine substrate . none none we report the joint application of ab initio computation and total synthesis to assign the absolute configuration of a new natural product . the expected specific rotation of the (7S,10R)- and (7R,10R)-isomers of pitiamide A in a CCl3H solvent continuum model were determined a + <nUm> and - <nUm> , respectively , by CADPAC calculation of the electric-dipole-magnetic- dipole polarizability tensor . total synthesis of these two stereoisomers of the marine metabolite were achieved by a convergent strategy that utilized evans ' oxazolidinone alkylation , a novel water - accelerated modification of negishi 's zirconocene - catalyzed asymmetric carbometalation a well a an unusual segment condensation via mitsunobu alkylation of a nosyl-activated amide . the experimental optical rotation measurement confirmed the result of the computational optical rotation prediction . on the basis of NMR comparison , the configuration of pitiamide A wa assigned a ( 7R,10R ) . these study highlight the considerable structural significance of [a](D) data , but , because the optical rotation of the natural product wa different from either synthetic diastereomer , our work serf also a an illustration of potential problem with obtaining accurate experimental [a](D) data for natural sample . rapid hydrozirconation of alkene by zirconocene hydrochloride , followed by addition of <nUm> equiv of enone and catalytic amount of Cu (I) salt , led to the corresponding 1,4-addition product in moderate to high yield and provided the first protocol for in situ preparation of alkyl cuprates from alkene . the spirocyclic 1,2,7,7a-tetrahydrocycloprop-[1,2-c]indol-4-one subunit of CC - <nUm> and duocarmycin A , which comprises the common pharmacophore of the two antibiotic , ha been efficiently synthesized in six step from readily available starting material . the key step of the synthesis utilizes a zirconocene - stabilized benzyne complex . none (Butadiene)zirconocene ( 4 ) wa reacted with <nUm> mol equiv of pivalonitrile to give the nine - membered metallacyclic product <nUm> . 1,4-Selective coupling of butadiene with the two nitrile functionality wa achieved at the zirconocene template . subsequent hydrolytic cleavage ( H2O / THF ) gave (3Z,5E,7Z)-3,8-diamino-2,2,9,9-tetramethyldeca-3,5,7-triene ( 13 ) . the stable conjugated primary enamine <nUm> wa isolated in <nUm> % yield . it wa characterized by an x-ray crystal structure analysis . compound <nUm> crystallizes in space group pbca with cell parameter a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , rw = <nUm> . analogously , coupling of two 4-methylbenzonitrile molecule with butadiene at the zirconocene template followed by hydrolysis yielded l,6-diamino-1,6-di-p-tolyl-1,3,5-hexatriene ( 6b ) . compound 6b crystallizes in space group P21 / a with cell parameter a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , rw = <nUm> . both primary enamine contain planar conjugated polyene framework with alternating carbon-carbon double and single bond . the geometry at the sp2-CNH2 group of the stable conjugated primary enamine 6b and <nUm> are very similar a observed in aromatic amine . it wa shown by ab initio calculation of suitable model system on the MP2 / <nUm> – 31+G* / / <nUm> – 31+G* level that the conjugated tail - to - tail connection of two CH-C(NH2)H primary enamine moiety result in an unfavorable repulsive electron interaction which may become effectively compensated when the conjugated system separating the H2N substituents is sufficiently extended a is the case in the framework found in <nUm> or <nUm> . therefore , some development of the chemistry of stable , isolable primary enamine may be based on suitably substituted 1,6-diamino-1,3,5-hexatriene system which will be easily available by our novel template synthesis . (+-)-N2-(Benzenesulfonyl)-CPI ( 16 ) , the protected a-unit of CC - <nUm> , wa synthesized in <nUm> step from <nUm> with an overall yield of <nUm> % . the two pyrrole moiety in <nUm> were obtained by a zirconocene and a Pd (0)-initiated cyclization . it should be stressed that in the first cyclization a iodinated benzene moiety 7a is obtained with the iodine at the correct position a needed for the following heck reaction . also , the nitrogen at C-5 wa introduced completely regioselectively . thus , the described synthesis represents an excellent entry to the racemic CPI unit . however , also the enantiopure CPI unit may be synthesized by this route , since boger et al.8 have shown that <nUm> can be resolved after cleavage of the n-benzenesulfonyl group and formation of a BOC amide . none none Bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium(IV) complex , Cp2ZrH2(1) and Cp2Zr(0-i-Pr)2(4) , in the presence of an appropriate hydrogen acceptor such a benzaldehyde or cyclohexanone catalyze the oppenauer - type oxidation of allylic alcohol to a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compound . for instance , primary allylic terpenoid alcohol , geraniol and nerol , were oxidized to a- and 0-citrals , which are essential compound in the perfumery industry , in substantial yield without any treatment . similarly , secondary allylic alcohol such a 3-hexen-2-ol and 2-cyclohexen-l-ol were also oxidized with ease to give 3-hexen-2-one and 2-cyclohexen-l-one in <nUm> % and <nUm> % yield , respectively . but the present OPP - type oxidation by zirconocene complex is ineffective for propargylic alcohol . group IVA metallocene complex such a bis(n5-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dihydrides , Cp2ZrH2 ( 1 ) , and hafnium dihydrides , Cp2HfH2 ( 8 ) , catalyze the chemoselective reduction of polycarbonyl compound to hydroxy carbonyl compound . for instance , the reduction of keto aldehyde 3-ketobutanal ( <nUm> g ) and 2-phenyl-2-ketoethanal ( <nUm> h ) proceeded selectively at aldehyde group to provide the corresponding hydroxy ketone <nUm> g and <nUm> h in <nUm> % and <nUm> % yield , respectively . under similar condition , however , cyclohexanediones were easily aromatized to benzenediols . on the other hand , <nUm> and <nUm> also catalyze the selective 1,2-reduction of various type of a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compound , giving the corresponding allylic alcohol in good to excellent yield . thus , steroidal dicarbonyl compound , having an enone framework in their molecule d4-androstene-3,17-dione ( 11a ) and d4-progestene-3,20-dione ( 11b ) were reduced by <nUm> to 17-hydroxy-D4-androsten-3-one ( 12a ) and 20-hydroxy-D4-progest-3-one ( 12b ) , which are essential human hormone , in <nUm> % and <nUm> % yield , respectively . 2,6-Dialkylphenols , which are difficult to prepare by conventional method , have been conveniently synthesized in one step via zirconocene - catalyzed crossaromatization of cyclohexanones with aldehyde . A one - pot method for the transformation of an aryl bromide , an internal alkyne , and sulfur dichloride into a polysubstituted benzothiophene , in high yield , is described . the method involves the generation and trapping of a zirconocene complex of a substituted benzyne . the reaction of Cp2Zr(CH <nUm> CH2R <nUm> )2 with a monosubstituted terminal alkene ( H <nUm> C = CHR <nUm> ) can produce , in a highly regio- and diastereoselective manner , zirconacyclopentane derivative ; the trans-3,4-disubstituted derivative may be formed to the extent of > <nUm> % in case where both r <nUm> and r <nUm> are alkyl , while the trans-2-aryl-4-alkyl derivative may be formed to the extent of > <nUm> % in the coupling between a monoalkyl-substituted olefin and styrene or it derivative . chiral tricyclic lactam ( 5 ) wa sequentionally metalated ( LDA or LDA / zirconocene halide ) and alkylated to give quaternary alkylation product ( 8 ) in 6-54 : <nUm> diastereomeric ratio . reduction and hydrolysis furnish the title compound in three step with > <nUm> % enantiomeric purity . under the influence of zirconocene complex , Cp2ZrH2(1) or Cp2Zr(0-i-Pr)2(9) , cycloalkanones <nUm> condensed directly with aliphatic aldehyde <nUm> or primary alcohol <nUm> to form 2-alkylidenecycloalkanones <nUm> or 2-alkyl-2-cycloalken-l-ones <nUm> , respectively , in fair to substantial yield . the selectivity of the cross-condensations wa slightly improved by using <nUm> in combination with a metal salt such a Cl2Ni . dihydrojasmone ( 13 ) wa synthesized in <nUm> % yield by one - step reaction from the commercially available 3-methylcyclopentanone ( 2e ) with pentanol ( 7b ) in the presence of <nUm> and Cl2Ni . none none two one - pot multicomponent synthetic method for highly substituted indene are described . the intermolecular coupling of aromatic ketone with alkyne on low - valent zirconocene specie generates oxazirconacyclopentenes , which upon hydrolysis with <nUm> % ClH for <nUm> h afforded indene derivative in good to excellent yield . similarly , the pair - selective coupling of two identical or different alkyne bearing at least one aromatic substituent formed zirconacyclopentadienes . quenching of the reaction mixture with concentrated H2O4S also result in the formation of highly substituted indene in high yield . three different component involving alkyne , ethylene , and aldehyde were selectively integrated in a one - pot procedure to afford homoallyl ketone in good yield , via an effective combination of zirconocene - mediated C-C bond forming reaction and lewis acid mediated organic transformation . mechanistic study revealed that a formal oppenauer oxidation of seven - membered oxazirconacycles , generated in situ from the reaction of zirconacyclopentenes and aldehyde , wa promoted by lewis acid-aldehyde adduct . As a whole , the first aldehyde wa incorporated into the product and the second aldehyde wa reduced to an alcohol . multiply deuterated homoallyl ketone could be readily prepared in high yield with more than <nUm> % deuterium incorporation by using this method . ( chemical equation presented ) o-Alkenyl or alkynyl benzylzirconocene intermediate , which wa readily generated by the reaction of 2-alkoxymethyl-styrene or 2-alkoxymethyl-1-(trimethylsilylethynyl)-benzene derivative with zirconocene - butene complex ( negishi reagent , " cp 2Zr " ) , reacted with allyl or propargyl halide in the presence of a catalytic amount of ClCu to give allylation or allenylation product . conversion to dane 's diene , which is a key intermediate for estrone synthesis , wa efficiently carried out by enyne olefin metathesis of the allylation product . ( chemical equation presented ) In the presence of CCuN , reaction of g,g-dialkoxyallylic zirconium specie <nUm> , generated in situ by treating triethyl orthoacrylate with zirconocene - butene complex , with allylic and propargylic phosphate proceeded at the a-position of <nUm> in a highly SN2' - selective manner to give the corresponding 5-alkenoates and 4,5-alkadienoates , respectively . In the present Cu (I) - mediated coupling reaction , the g,g-dialkoxyallylic zirconium specie <nUm> serf a a synthetically useful homoenolate anion equivalent of propionate . the combination of zirconocene - mediated coupling of silylated alkyne with a protonation - desilylation or bromination - desilylation process afforded otherwise unavailable butadiene derivative . when (E,E)-2,3-dialkyl-1,4- bis(trimethylsilyl)-1,3-butadienes were treated with <nUm> equiv of br2 in CCl2H2 , (E)-2,3-dialkyl-1,1,4,4-tetrabromo-2-butenes were obtained in excellent yield with perfect stereoselectivity . the reaction of ene - imine with cp <nUm> ZrBu <nUm> wa carried out . when a crude imine , which wa prepared from ene - aldehyde and primary amine in the presence of MgOS <nUm> , wa treated with cp <nUm> ZrBu <nUm> at room temperature overnight , cyclopentane derivative having trans-substituents wa obtained in high yield along with a small amount of cyclopentane derivative having cis-substituents . presumably , cis-zirconacycle is a thermodynamic product . reaction using various ene - imines were carried out . In the case of ene - imine prepared from ene - aldehyde and t BuNH <nUm> , only cyclopentane having cis-substituents wa produced . In this reaction , chiral amine wa used , and diastereoselective cyclization of ene - imine wa carried out . As a result , cyclopentane derivative having cis-substituents wa obtained in an optically active form after hydrogenolysis of the cyclized compound . A novel method for preparation of allylic zirconium reagent directly from 1-alkenes via zirconoceneolefin complex ha been developed . selective transfer of the hydride of zirconocene allyl hydride complex , a tautomer of zirconocene - olefin complex , to diisopropyl ketone generates the corresponding zirconocene alkoxide allyl . the allylic zirconium reagent formed effect stereoselective allylation of aldehyde at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> ° C to provide syn- and anti-homoallyl alcohol , respectively . the anti-isomer is formed via a six - membered chair transition state under kinetic control . the syn-selectivity can be rationalized by considering isomerization of the anti-adduct by a retroallylation process . reaction of o-(alkoxymethyl)styrene derivative with a stoichiometric amount of zirconocenebutene complex ( zirconocene equivalent , " cp 2Zr " ) brought about an insertion of the zirconocene specie into a benzylic carbon-oxygen bond . the oxidative insertion of Cp2Zr to the benzylic carbon-oxygen bond is a result of sequential reaction : ( i ) formation of zirconacyclopropane by the ligand exchange with o-(alkoxymethyl)styrene , ( ii ) elimination of the alkoxy group through an aromatic conjugate system giving metalated o-quinodimethane specie , and ( iii ) transfer of zirconium metal to the benzylic position . through use of a catalytic amount of " Cp2Zr " , however , unprecedented homo-coupling reaction ( dimerization ) of o-(alkoxymethyl)styrene derivative occurred to give a tetracyclic compound . on the other hand , reaction of o-(1-alkoxyisopropyl) styrene derivative gave rise to the analogous tetracyclic compound regardless of the amount of " Cp2Zr " ( stoichiometric or catalytic ) . heterocoupling product between o-(1-alkoxyisopropyl)styrene and styrene congener wa obtained in high ci stereo- and regioselectivity by treating o-(1-alkoxyisopropyl)styrene derivative with " Cp2Zr " in the presence of an excess amount of styrene derivative . D-Arabinose and d-glucose are transformed into the identical vinyl furanoside , whose role is to serve a the precursor to enantiopure cyclooctadienone <nUm> . the key step of this relay involve a zirconocene - promoted ring contraction and [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement of an enynol . subsequently defined are convenient synthetic route to several cyclooctane-1,2,3-triols , 1,2,3,4,5-pentaols , and structurally related glycomimetics . multi-substituted pentacenes , such a 1,2,3,4,6,8,9,10,11,13- decasubstituted pentacenes ( type I ) , 1,2,3,4,6,-13-hexasubstituted pentacenes ( type II ) , 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted pentacenes ( type III ) , and 2,3-disubstituted pentacenes ( type IV ) , 1,2,3,4,6,11-hexasubstituted naphthacenes ( type V ) , 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted naphthacenes ( type VI ) , and 2,3-disubstituted naphthacenes ( type VII ) , were prepared by a homologation method . the homologation method involved the conversion of phthalic acid ester derivative to two ring extended phthalic acid ester derivative via diynes and metallacyclopentadienes using transition metal , such a Zr and Rh . for the formation of pentacenes of type III and type IV and naphthacenes of type VII , trimethylsilyl-substituted diynes were used for zirconocene - mediated cyclization . elimination of the trimethylsilyl group after the cyclization afforded nonsubstituted position on pentacenes or naphthacenes . structure of 1,4,6,8,9,10,11,13-octaethyl-2,3-bis(methoxycarbonyl)pentacene ( 9a ) and 8,9,10,11-tetraethyl-2,3-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-1,4,6,13-tetrapropylpentacene ( 9b ) were determined by x-ray analysis . the structure of 9a had the herringbone packing system in the crystal like nonsubstituted pentacene . however , 9b , whose substituents at 1,4,6,13-positions were changed from et to Pr at 1,4,6,13-positions of 9a , had the face parallel plane system in the crystal . we report herein the total synthesis of the corynanthe alkaloid dihydrocorynantheol and the formal synthesis of the indole alkaloid tacamonine , rhynchophylline , and hirsutine . the strategy for assembling the corynanthe and tacaman skeletal framework comprised of both the classical ABD → ABCD and ABC → ABCD approach wherein the variously substituted piperidinone d-rings were formed via ring - closing metathesis ( RCM ) followed by a 1,4-addition to introduce the requisite side chain at C(15) . since 1,4-additions to a,b-unsaturated lactams represent an underdeveloped field , we conducted a series of study with two unsaturated lactams employing organocuprates and metal enolates a the nucleophiles . these study revealed that organocuprates derived from grignard reagent and either stoichiometric amount of CCuN or catalytic amount of CuBr*DMS complex are excellent nucleophiles for such addition ; TMSC1 wa a crucial additive for optimizing these reaction . the anion derived from ethyl 1,3-dithiolane-2-carboxylate wa also an excellent nucleophile in these 1,4-additions , although the stereochemistry of such 1,4-additions to carboline - derived , unsaturated lactams wa sensitive to substitution on the indole nitrogen atom . the ABD → ABCD approach to these alkaloid featured a novel one - pot sequence of an RCM reaction and a zirconocene - catalyzed carbomagnesation followed by a second RCM to generate the d - ring . ( chemical equation presented ) alkenylphosphines with various substituents were prepared by the reaction of an alkenylzirconocene with a chlorophosphine . reaction of ( a-unsubstituted alkenyl)zirconocenes with ph <nUm> ClP or PhPCl <nUm> gave the corresponding alkenylphosphines in good yield . on the other hand , direct reaction of ( a-unsubstituted alkenyl)zirconocenes with i Pr <nUm> ClP did not proceed . analogously , ( a-substituted alkenyl)zirconocenes did not react with chlorophosphines directly . however , these reaction proceeded in the presence of ClCu affording the corresponding alkenylphosphines a ClCu complex . treatment of the copper complex with Na <nUm> ( dtc ) ( dtc = N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate ) or Na <nUm> ( edta ) liberated free alkenylphosphines from the copper center . the overall protocol could be applicable to preparation of a variety of alkenylphosphines from alkyne via alkenylzirconocene specie . ( figure presented ) A synthetic approach to synthesize EDOT and EDOS from a common precursor <nUm> is reported . the method involves zirconocene dichloride mediated reaction of a common diyne <nUm> followed by treatment with disulfur dichloride ( ClS ) and in situ prepared selenium dichloride ( Cl2Se ) . the higher lability of a-trimethylsilyl group in EDOS compared to EDOT is explained using DFT calculation . large , soluble polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAHs ) have been synthesized using Zr - mediated and stille - type biphenylation reaction . both the Zr and stille methodology have been adopted to incorporate tert-butyl substituents , permitting the direct synthesis of alkylated PAHs that are much more soluble than their unsubstituted analogue . to demonstrate the utility of these method and the importance of solubilizing functionality , several large PAHs were synthesized and crystallographically characterized . the scope of the Zr - mediated and stille methodology is shown to be complementary . the stille methodology often give higher yield but is ineffective for the introduction of strain and failed with some polybrominated arenes . In these difficult case , the zirconium methodology is effective , albeit in low yield . ( chemical equation presented ) an enantiodivergent strategy for the total chemical synthesis of both naturally occurring (+)-fomannosin ( 1 ) and it (-)-antipode ( ent-1 ) from a-D-glucose ha been developed and successfully implemented . the key step in the overall pathway include the following : ( i ) application of the zirconocene - mediated ring contraction of vinyl furanosides for the construction of highly substituted cyclobutanols ; ( ii ) the use of ring - closing metathesis to form the pendant five - membered ring ; ( iii ) making recourse to a monothio malonic ester to allow for chemoselective reduction to sensitive lactone intermediate <nUm> ; ( iv ) hydroxyl-directed dihydroxylation with O4Os to generate <nUm> ; and ( v ) sequential elimination via a cyclic sulfite and a cyclobutyl triflate . the bridge between the enantiomeric series consisted of a six - step linkup involving the structural modification of <nUm> so a to generate ent-30b . optical activity wa fully preserved throughout . ( chemical equation presented ) A new and diastereoselective method for the synthesis of the estrone skeleton from a substituted styrene based on sequential 3-fold use of Cp2ZrBu2 ( oxidative addition - alkylation and two cyclization - alkylation sequence ) and a ruthenium complex catalyzed RC - metathesis of a sterically hindered diene wa developed . the prepared estratetraene wa obtained in <nUm> step from a commercially available starting material and thus the overall synthesis of estrone could be accomplished in <nUm> step . moreover , we have also found that the course of the reaction of substrate bearing the 2-halo-1,7-diene moiety with Cp2ZrBu <nUm> , i.e. , cyclization or oxidative addition to the C-X bond , could be controlled by the nature of the halogen leaving group . none reaction of vinylcyclopropane derivative with a zirconocene-1-butene complex ( " Cp2Zr " ) caused regioselective cleavage of the cyclopropyl bond to give e3 p-allylic and / or e1 s-allylic complex . the regioselectivity of the bond cleavage and the formation of a e3 p-allylic or e1 s-allylic complex depend on the bulkiness of the substituents on the cyclopropyl group and the presence of leaving functionality . A catalytic use of " Cp2Zr " in the presence of excess grignard reagent also caused a ring opening of the vinylcyclopropane derivative with the same sense of regiochemical selectivity . the reaction of the thermally equilibrated " Cp2Zr " -propenylcyclopropane complex with acetone indicated the possibility for the synthesis of the steroidal side chain in either natural or unnatural form . the synthetic utility of the present mCp2Zr " -vinylcyclopropane chemistry wa ascertained by the stereocontrolled preparation of the C-20 , C-24 dimethylated steroidal side chain which is identical to the active metabolite of vitamin D2 . imine complex of zirconocene , generated by a b-hydrogen abstraction process , which posse a carbon-carbon multiple bond , undergo inter- or intramolecular carbometalation to afford 1,4-cyclohexanediamine or cycloalkylaniline derivative depending on the relative position of the unsaturated moiety with respect to the imine complex . A new diastereoselective synthesis of azetidines ha been developed by treatment of azazirconacyclopentanes with iodine . the aldol condensation of a- and b-(benzyloxy) aldehyde with enol silanes , catalyzed by Cp2Zr(OTf)2THF or Cp2Zr(OTf)2 , in a variety of solvent were studied . the simple diastereoselectivity of these reaction is modest and comparable to that observed using simple aldehyde of similar steric requirement . study have revealed that TMSOTf is directly produced on reaction with the zirconocene catalyst with the enol silane in nitroalkane solvent or is formed during catalysis in dichloromethane solution . although TMSOTf is known to catalyze cross-aldol reaction under these condition , the rate of this process is not always competitive with that observed using the zirconocene catalyst . In particular , sterically unhindered or aromatic aldehyde react via a mechanism that appears to be mainly Zr - catalyzed , based on both the difference in rate between zr- and Si - mediated reaction a well a difference in enol silane / silyl triflate reactivity in crossover - type experiment . with sterically hindered aldehyde in dichloromethane or nitromethane , catalysis is mediated by Si . the Zr - catalyzed process occurs via formation of a Zr - aldolate complex from aldehyde and enol silane , with liberation of TMSOTf , followed by rate - limiting o-silylation of the metal aldolate by TMSOTf , a revealed by both model study and in situ monitoring during catalysis . zirconocene - coupling reaction of 6,6'-bis[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]-2,2'-bipyridine and 5,5'-bis[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]-2,2'-bipyridine give trimeric , zirconocene - containing macrocycles ( <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ) in high yield . molecule of <nUm> in the solid state are chiral about their crystallographic C2 axis of symmetry , with each bipyridine unit in an anti conformation . compound <nUm> exists in solution a a mixture of diastereomers ( with D3 and C2 symmetry ) that could not be distinguished in the solid state by x-ray crystallography . compound <nUm> and <nUm> are cleanly converted to the corresponding l,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)butadiene derivative <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively , via demetalation with acetic acid . the latter cyclophanes are le conformationally rigid , a determined by variable - temperature NMR experiment . none we have developed a highly convergent synthesis of the manumycin - type m- C7N-antibiotic nisamycin that is applicable to other member of this family of antibiotic . the synthesis feature a three - step sequence to the epoxyquinol core that serf a a scaffold for the attachment of the polyene side chain . the eastern polyene side chain wa constructed via a novel organozirconocene - mediated synthesis . zirconocene methodology wa also applied to the synthesis of the polyene side chain of asukamycin . the southern side chain of nisamycin wa introduced via a stille reaction that employed a vinyl bromo ketone , derived from an acid - sensitive bromo ketal . Pd - mediated coupling of the vinyl bromide with a stannyl TIPS ester gave TIPS - protected nisamycin that wa readily converted to the natural product . the relative energetic stability of the " rac " and the " meso " rotational isomer of metallocene - based ziegler - natta ( ZN ) catalyst play an important role in determining the structural , physical and chemical property of synthesized polymer . due to the large molecular size of these system , ab initio calculation are often prohibitive . to circumvent this problem , we use the QM - pot approach , which treat the metal center and it surrounding atom / ligand by quantum mechanic ( QM ) , whereas the ( organic ) atom / functional group away from the metal center are described by an interatomic potential function ( pot ) . As a concrete example , we choose a commercially important zirconocene - based catalyst and compute : ( 1 ) the relative energy of the rac and meso structure ; ( 2 ) the activation barrier for the rotational transition from one to the other ; and ( 3 ) the effect of the addition of organic functional group on the above energy . due to small mismatch between QM and pot potential surface , one ha to be careful in defining the QM cluster . In particular , larger QM cluster do not necessarily yield better result . despite these difficulty , we show that it is possible to define a cluster for which the hybrid approach yield meaningful result when compared to full QM calculation . A bridged d0 zirconocene dichloride is reported a a first group <nUm> metal complex possessing rare long - lived ligand - to - metal charge transfer ( LMCT ) excited state with high emission yield and excited - state lifetime in fluid solution ( e.g. , PhLUM = <nUm> and τ = <nUm> m in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at <nUm> ° C ) . the basic emission parameter PhLUM and τ are shown to be extremely solvent - dependent in fluid at room temperature . the first principle dependence of LMCT emission parameter on solvent property are revealed with use of the target complex . for fluid solution , the linear correlation between PhLUM and τ is reported , thus suggesting that a solvent determines the rate constant for nonradiative decay , knr . we propose route for the catalytic cycle and possible termination reaction for the polymerization of ethylene with cationic chromium complex of the type [CpCr(L)R] + which contain donor ligand with phosphorus or nitrogen ( L = PR <nUm> or NR <nUm> ) . we confirm the rate - determining character of the insertion of ethylene into the chromium - alkyl bond . contrary to the situation with late transition metal , the resulting agostic isomer will readily isomerize . the termination of the polymerization reaction by b-hydrogen elimination to the chromium center and subsequent dissociation of the resulting olefin is found to require about <nUm> kcal / mol and to be thermodynamically much le feasible than the alternative termination process by b-hydrogen transfer to a monomer . the latter process involves spin change ; two minimum - energy crossing point a well a further transition state and intermediate have been identified . our calculation predict that adduct formation with the polymerization additive 9-BBN should be feasible both from a cp - quinoline - based chromium catalyst and a zirconocene catalyst . however , only the latter undergoes exergonic chain transfer , which is in accordance with the experimentally observed formation of ultrahigh m W polyethylene when using 9-BBN a polymerization additive in combination with Cr catalyst . for the first time , quantum dynamic simulation of such open - shell system have been performed , which give a lifetime of the Cr - alkyl complex with regard to ethylene insertion of only <nUm> f . the simulation indicate that the dissociation of ethylene from the chromium center should be relatively insignificant compared to migratory insertion . some metallocene methyl cation made of zirconium , that have been used a catalyst in polymerization of ethylene , were studied by mean of the conceptual density functional theory ( DFT ) . up to now , catalytic activity , a pure experimental parameter , that measure the kilogram of polyethylene produced per gram of metallocene , per time unit , per temperature unit , and per pressure unit , ha been mainly explained in term of steric hindrance at least qualitatively , meaning that a catalyst having a higher steric hindrance will present a lower catalytic activity . however , there ha not been a satisfactory explanation for those few case in which the steric effect can not be linked with the catalytic activity , thus meaning that the electronic inductive effect predominates over the steric effect . As a consequence , the electronic inductive effect must be quantified through the use of a proper descriptor based on quantum chemical calculation and , in addition , this descriptor should be able to explain high value of catalytic activity even when the steric effect seems to play an unfavorable role . this work ha demonstrated that a local reactivity descriptor called local hyper - softness coming from the conceptual DFT is a suitable pure theoretical parameter that explains such anomaly in some value of catalytic activity . it is expected that the finding exposed here can help to estimate catalytic activity and lead to a more rational design of new catalyst by mean of computational chemistry . ethene polymerization with bis(2-dimethylsilyl-indenyl)zirconium(IV) dichloride ( 1 ) / MAO and bis(2-trimethylsilyl-indenyl)zirconium(IV) dichloride ( 2 ) / MAO and ethene-co-1-hexene polymerization with <nUm> / MAO are presented . the end group analysis of homopolymers reveals a pronounced dependence of the termination rate on temperature change . In combination with the high molecular weight obtained , these result are in accord with theoretical prediction . gel permeation chromatography , fourier transform infrared , and 13C NMR analysis of copolymerization product from <nUm> / MAO a a function of comonomer concentration at two different temperature series denote it tendency to form inhomogeneous polymer blend . thermal analysis and fractionation result of one such blend indicate an inhomogeneity in the enchainment process and the existence of multiple active site of differing geometry . these indication are further supported by AMBER force field and density functional theory study of the catalyst precursor and the active site of <nUm> / MAO . for this system , d-agostic interaction for the stabilization of the zirconium cation are favored over b-agostic interaction , which , in contrast to the situation in study on bis-Cp system , is a sparsely populated specie . the gap in activation enthalphies for b-hydride transfer and elimination is marginalized for these bulky zirconocenes , and conceptually new mechanism for the isomerization of the vinyl end group are discussed . further , unexpected activation of the silicon-hydrogen bond within the ligand framework is observed with an activation enthalpy a low a <nUm> kcal / mol . cationic zirconocene complex are active specie in ziegler - natta catalysis for olefin polymerization . their structure and metal - ligand bond strength strongly influence their activity . In the present work , the infrared multiphoton dissociation ( IRMPD ) spectrum of mass selected Zr(C 5H5)2(OH)(CH3CN)- cation wa obtained in the 300-1500 cm-1 fingerprint range by coupling a fourier - transform ion cyclotron resonance ( FT - ICR ) mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization ( ESI ) source and the infrared free electron laser ( IR - FEL ) at the centre laser infrarouge d'Orsay ( CLIO ) . the experimental effort are complemented by quantum chemical calculation at the MP2 and B3LYP level using the 6-311G basis set . vibrational assignment of transition observed in the IRMPD spectrum to mode of the Zr-O-H , C5H <nUm> , and C2H3N moiety are based on comparison to calculated linear absorption spectrum . both the experimental data and the calculation provide unprecedented information about structure , metal - ligand bonding , charge distribution , and binding energy of the complex . the effect of zirconocenes , used a drug for various therapeutic application , on the crystal growth of hydroxyapatite wa investigated at sustained supersaturation . all zirconocenes weee found to inhibit crystal growth of hydroxyapatite possibily through adsorption onto the active site for crystal growth . the kinetics result favored a langmuir - type isotherm , suggesting a high affinity of zirconocene dichloride for hydroxyapatite . ethylene ( e ) / propylene ( P ) solution copolymerizations with low propylene ratio were carried out using constrained geometry catalyst , [C5Me4(SiMe2NtBu)]TiMe2 ( CGC ) , and ansa - zirconocene , rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( EBI ) , at 130-150 ° C and <nUm> × <nUm> kPa . ethylene / propylene copolymer with long chain branch ( LCB ) density from <nUm> to <nUm> carbon per <nUm> <nUm> carbon , molecular weight distribution close to <nUm> , and narrow comonomer composition distribution were synthesized with CGC . broad molecular weight and comonomer composition distribution were found in the EBI copolymer . reactivity ratio showed that CGC wa more active for propylene incorporation than EBI . terminal group analysis indicated that more terminal unsaturation occurred with EBI than with CGC . two additional type of terminal unsaturated group , vinylidene with side group having more than three carbon ( 2VD ) and trans-vinylene ( VE ) , were found with EBI while the terminal vinyl ( V ) and vinylidene with methyl side group ( 1VD ) were determined in both CGC and EBI copolymer . long chain branch structure were formed by the V type macromonomer incorporation . the long chain branching rate constant were also estimated . the hydro-oligomerization of cyclopentene in toluene solution using [ethylenebis(e5-indenyl)]-zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) or bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride and methylaluminoxane a catalyst wa studied . the crude oligomer mixture obtained using the former catalyst wa extracted with hot toluene to provide a fraction consisting predominantly of dimer , trimer , and tetramer . distillation provided trimer of <nUm> % purity . pure tetramer wa precipitated from methanol-toluene a a crystalline solid . hydro-oligomerization of cyclopentene with zirconocene dichloride a catalyst provided two tetramers , one of which wa identical to that produced using the chiral catalyst . the structure of the trimer , including stereochemistry , wa established by total synthesis . these result conclusively demonstrate that the original structure assigned to poly(cyclopentene) is incorrect and that enchainment of cyclopentene occurs predominantly by cis-1,3-insertion . A mechanism for the polymerization of cyclopentene using catalyst <nUm> is discussed . the termination process of zirconocene - MAO olefin polymerization catalyst under high pressure of 100-1500 MP were studied . it wa found that the ratio of olefinic polymer end depend on the reaction pressure , and trans-vinylene group predominantly form under high pressure . the b-hydrogen transfer to olefin wa accelerated under <nUm> MPa in hexene polymerization with (C5H4Me)2ZrCl2 . the diastereoselectivity of the cyclization step in the cyclopolymerization of 1,5-hexadiene with homogeneous catalyst based on zirconocene / methylalumoxane system is investigated through the analysis of the nonbonded interaction on model catalytic site analogous to those proposed for a-olefin polymerization . A model which doe not include any cyclopentadienyl ring present a small trans specificity : the minimum energy intermediate brings the formation of trans ring and resembles a cyclohexane chair in which the growing chain occupies a pseudoequatorial position ( trans-chair conformation ) . the addition of two cyclopentadienyl ring to the Zr atom , due to interaction with the growing chain which occupies a pseudoaxial position , disfavor the two most stable ci conformation ( a cis-chair and a cis-boat ) . As a consequence , the model with two cyclopentadienyl ring show a higher trans specificity than the “ bare ” model . In the presence of two pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ring , the steric interaction of the aromatic ligand tend to disfavor the trans-chair with respect to a cis-twist conformation and the model becomes cis-specific . A good qualitative agreement between the modeling and polymerization result is observed . none substantial transfer of growing polypropyl chain to methylalumoxane and trimethylaluminum occurs with the highly substituted , isospecific zirconocene catalyst Me2Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C5H2)2ZrCl2 / MAO , while little if any such chain transfer is observed for the more open isospecific catalyst Me2Si(2-MeInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO , for aspecific H4C2(Flu)2ZrCl2 / MAO , and for syndiospecific Ph2C(Cp)FluZrCl2 / MAO . propene polymerization with MAO - activated mixture of Me2Si(2-MeInd)2ZrCl2 and H4C2(Flu)2ZrCl2 give completely separable mixture of the isotactic and atactic polymer characteristic for each of the individual catalyst . MAO - activated mixture of Me2Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C5H2)2ZrCl2 and H4C2(Flu)2ZrCl2 , however , give polypropene mixture that contain , besides isotactic and atactic polymer , polymer fraction in which isotactic and atactic polypropene chain segment are inseparably linked . while clear evidence for isotactic - syndiotactic stereoblock formation wa not obtained , some polymeryl exchange between isospecific and syndiospecific catalyst site in MAO - activated mixture of Me2Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C5H2)2ZrCl2 and Ph2C(Cp)-FluZRCl2 is indicated by increased stereoerror frequency in some fraction of the polymer product mixture obtained by temperature - rising elution fractionation . structural prerequisite for an efficient transfer of growing polymer chain between different type of catalyst center are discussed . the correlation between relative reactivity of the two styrene enantiofaces and geometry of ansa - zirconocene system ha been determined by 13C NMR microstructural analysis of the poly(propylene-co-styrene-ethylene) ( P / S-E ) obtained in the presence of C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocene catalyst . the chemical shift assignment accomplished by using configurational additivity rule suggests that secondary styrene insertion with C2 - symmetric metallocene occurs with the opposite enantioface with respect to primary propylene insertion . on the contrary the analysis of 13C enriched copolymer obtained in the presence of Cs - symmetric catalyst seems to indicate that the secondary styrene insertion occurs with same enantioface with respect to propylene . this stereochemistry is what one expects for a simple olefin inserting in secondary fashion despite the peculiar behavior of the aromatic monomer toward zirconocene - based catalyst . copolymerization of ethylene with 5-vinyl-2-norbornene ( VNB ) using the dicyclopentadienylzirconium dichloride / methylaluminoxane ( zirconocene / MAO ) catalyst system ha been shown to occur with regioselective insertion of the endocyclic double bond of VNB into the copolymer chain , leaving the exocyclic vinyl double bond a a pendant unsaturation . the pendant vinyl group in the copolymer can be readily converted to the hydroxy / epoxy group with complete conversion under mild reaction condition , giving rise to the corresponding functionalized copolymer . the copolymer ( parent and functionalized ) have been characterized using IR , NMR , TGA , DSC , and intrinsic viscosity measurement . the influence of the ligand structure of zirconocene polymerization catalyst on the accessibility of the active reaction center wa studied by an ab initio hartree - fock method . the variation in the accessibility were elucidated by comparing molecular structure and relative stability of <nUm> bridged zirconocene catalyst with <nUm> different bridging unit , <nUm> ancillary cp' ligand , and <nUm> ligand substituents . ligand variation gave rise to various steric and electronic effect affecting both the nature and the concentration of active metal center in the system , such a steric blocking or shielding of the metal center , and stabilization or destabilization of the active cationic specie . comparison to experimental work demonstrated clear correlation between accessibility of the active reaction center and observed polymerization activity . furthermore , interaction between the lewis acidic aluminum center and lewis basic functionality were observed . the consequence of such interaction are discussed . poly(l-butene) wa obtained by polymerization of 1-butene at <nUm> ° C using rac-(dimethyl-silyl)bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( I ) a catalyst and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) a cocatalyst . the product wa characterized by NMR ( 1H and 13C ) , size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) , and vapor pressure osmometry ( VPO ) . the number - average molecular weight of the polymer wa determined a <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> by SEC , VPO , and NMR , respectively . the poly(l-butene) is <nUm> % isotactic and ha high regioselectivity ( ca. <nUm> % 1,2-addition ) . both saturated and unsaturated end group were characterized by NMR . vinylidene and trisubstituted double bond comprise approximately <nUm> % and <nUm> % , respectively , of the unsaturated end group with the remainder consisting of vinylene , vinyl , and tetrasubstituted double bond . n-Butyl and sec-butyl group constitute the saturated end group in the approximate ratio <nUm> : <nUm> . there is a slight excess of saturated end group relative to unsaturated end group . these result are discussed in term of a reaction mechanism of initiation and propagation with various chain - transfer reaction ( b-hydride transfer with and without rearrangement , transfer to aluminum , transfer to vinylidene end group , and b-alkyl transfer ) . polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) wa conducted with the catalyst system of rac-Et(Ind)2Zr(CH3)2 / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 , rac-Et(IndH4)2Zr(CH3)2 / ph3CB(C6F5)6 , and rac-Me2Si(Ind)2Zr(CH5)2 / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 . these catalyst only weee found to be inactive . however , the addition of suitable lewis acid like alkylzinc and alkylaluminum compound gave highly isotactic PMMA . the isotactic pentad [mmmm] in PMMA a well a the propagation rate constant ( kp ) depended significantly upon the zirconocene compound . both the microstructure ( [mmmm] ) and propagation rate constant ( kp ) increased in the following order : Me2Si(Ind)2 < Et(IndH4)2 < Et(Ind)2 . the microstructure of PMMA wa also affected slightly by alkylzinc compound : C3H5 = CH2 < C2H5 > C4H9 . when the polymerization wa initiated by the rac-Et(Ind)2Zr(CH3)2 / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 / Zn(C2H4CH = CH2)2 catalyst system at <nUm> ° C in toluene , the molecular weight of PMMA increased in proportion to the conversion of MMA . the increase of temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C caused a decrease in isotactic pentad content by approximately <nUm> % . the isotactic polymerization of MMA wa revealed to proceed by an enantiomorphic site - controlled mechanism . ethylene-styrene copolymer have been prepared in the presence of the catalytic system based on [(methyl)(phenyl)methylene(1-cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)]zirconium dichloride , methylalumoxane , and Al(13CH3)3 . end - group analysis show that in the initiation step the regiospecificity of styrene insertion into the Zr — 13CH3 bond is prevailingly secondary . c2v-symmetric ethylenebis(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) and it C2 - symmetric bis-[9-(1-methyl)fluorenyl] derivative ( 2 ) have been synthesized in good yield using a convenient synthetic route . precursor <nUm> activated with triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( 3 ) catalyzes propylene polymerization with a constant activity of ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) × <nUm> g of PP / ( ( mol of Zr)*[C3H6]*h ) between <nUm> and + <nUm> ° C . the polypropylene is ideally atactic and ha the same of ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) × <nUm> . the above system catalyzes ethylene polymerization with a maximum activity of <nUm> × <nUm> g of PE / ( ( mol of Zr)*[C2H4]*h ) at <nUm> ° C which decrease exponentially with an increase of tp . all the polyethylene produced between <nUm> and + <nUm> ° C have the same of ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) × <nUm> . In contrast , precursor <nUm> catalyzed the formation of anisotactic polypropylene of low stereoregularity . molecular mechanic calculation indicated that substituents on the fluorenyl ring have little effect on both diastereomeric ratio in the synthesis and stereoselectivities in the polymerization . we report the stereospecific polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) with single - component cationic zirconocene catalyst . the complex Me2CCpIndZrMe(thf)+BPh4- ( 1 ) and Me2CCp2-ZrMe(thf)+BPh4- ( 2 ) are active catalyst for the polymerization of MMA , in remarkable contrast to other cationic zirconocenes . while <nUm> yield highly isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) , <nUm> is syndiospecific at low temperature . this is the first example for a rational control of PMMA microstructure via catalyst symmetry . polymerization kinetics and stereospecificity control in MMA polymerization with <nUm> and <nUm> are discussed . on the basis of the experimental data , a possible polymerization mechanism is proposed . A new poly(oxyphenylene) derivative containing a 3-(trialkylammonio)propyl substituent wa synthesized via hydroiodinated poly(oxy-2-allyl-6-methyl-1,4-phenylene) followed by quaternization with trialkylamine . poly(oxy-2-allyl-6-methyl-1,4-phenylene) obtained by oxidative polymerization of 2-allyl-6-methylphenol wa allowed to react with bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium chloride hydride ( ZrCp2 - ClH ) at room temperature in inert atmosphere in which the allyl group wa converted to a terminally zirconocene - substituted propyl group . the activated propyl group can react with I2 to yield the 3-iodopropyl group . the quaternization of the resulting polymer wa performed through the menshutkin reaction with a series of trialkylamines to obtain the poly[oxy-2-[3-(trialkylammonio)propyl]-6-methyl-1,4-phenylene iodide ] . the resulting polyammonium salt a an ion exchange resin exhibit higher thermal stability than poly[oxy-2-[(trimethylammonio)methyl]-6-methyl-1,4-phenylene salt ] , e.g. , no decomposition in water below <nUm> ° C for <nUm> h . A new monocyclopentadienylamido complex , [ e5:e1-(2,3-Me2 Benz[e]Ind)SiMe2NtBu]TiCl2 ( I ) , wa synthesized a catalyst precursor . the study on the homopolymerization and copolymenzation of 4-methyl-1-pentene ( P ) and ethylene ( e ) were presented , by comparing complex I with other CpA complex and Cp2M zirconocenes . the complex I , activated with methylaluminoxane , provided an enhanced copolymerization activity , an excellent incorporation of 4-methyl-1-pentene into the polyethylene chain , and an increased copolymer molecular weight . analysis of 13C NMR spectrum of polymer , combined with the monomer reactivity ratio and the polymerization result , demonstrated that the regioselectivity of monomer insertion , tacticity , productivity , molecular weight , and polymer microstructure are significantly dependent on the ligand substitution pattern and the metal atom in CpA complex . the CpA I - derived poly(4-methyl-1-pentene-co-ethylene)s contained a significant amount of regioirregular arrangement of 4-methyl-1-pentene unit , but with no virtually consecutive 4-methyl-1-pentene sequence . In contrast , the [ e5:e1-(Me4C5) SiMe2NtBu]TiCl2 (IV)-derived copolymer revealed the small clustered sequence ( e.g. , EPPE ) but without any regioirregular arrangement of 4-methyl-1-pentene unit . the copolymer prepared with [e5:e1-(Flu)SiMe2NtBu] Cl2Ti ( VI ) not only showed quite different microstructure from that based on catalyst I and IV but also manifested the more pronounced tendency to form an alternating distribution of monomer in the polymer chain . furthermore , the VI - derived copolymer contained neither a regioregular insertion of comonomer nor the consecutive 4-methyl-1-pentene sequence . A structural analysis of the oriented γ form of isotactic polypropylene ( iPP ) is presented . the x-ray diffraction intensity distribution in the oriented γ form is quantitatively evaluated for the first time . the structural analysis is performed on a new , poorly stereoregular ( [mmmm] = <nUm> % ) polypropylene material , prepared with a novel C2 - symmetric zirconocene based catalytic system , showing elastomeric property . the sample , initially amorphous , partially crystallizes upon aging . In the oriented crystalline material , obtained by stretching the aged sample , the crystallite tend to assume a preferred orientation with the chain ax parallel to the draw direction . disorder is present in the structure . for low draw ratio ( le than twice the initial length ) disordered crystalline modification , very close to the γ form of iPP , are obtained ; increasing the draw ratio , crystalline modification , closer to the α form of iPP , are observed . the structural disorder occurring in our stretched sample originates from the random succession of bilayers of chain with chain parallel ( like in the α form ) or tilted ≈ <nUm> ° each other ( like in the γ form ) . the result of this analysis are the follows . for the sample stretched at a low draw ratio , ≈ <nUm> % of the bilayers of chain are faced each other like in the γ form so that the fraction of bilayers with chain ax pointing preferentially along the draw direction is on the order of 60-65 % ( the remaining 35-40 % , being oriented with the chain ax tilted ≈ <nUm> ° to the draw direction ) . for the sample stretched at higher draw ratio , the fraction of bilayers facing each other like in the γ form is reduced to 20-30 % , so that only 10-15 % of the bilayers result oriented with the chain ax nearly normal to the draw direction . this is a if , in all case , the region of the crystal with chain arranged like in the α form tend to be oriented with the chain ax parallel to the stretching direction rather than tilted ≈ <nUm> ° . A continuum of disordered modification intermediate between the pure γ and α form could exist . the possible inclusion in the crystalline domain of stereo defect ( mainly of the kind mrrm ) , which would favor the γ , - like packing situation on the local scale , is discussed . In order to gain further insight into dicarbollide - catalyzed ethylene-norbornene polymerization , the behavior of the (e5-C2B9H11)- Zr(NRt2)2(NHEt2) - TIBA catalyst wa studied and preliminary compared with that of Me2Si(3-tBuCp)(adamantylamido)- Cl2Zr / MAO ( 2 ) and (e5-C5Me5)- Cl3Zr - MAO ( 3 ) . several ethylene-norbornene copolymerizations were carried out over a wide range of monomer composition . the resulting polymer product were analyzed by 13C NMR spectroscopy to gain information about the copolymer microstructure . rac-[Methylene(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 activated by MAO , employed a catalyst in the ethylene-styrene copolymerization , show a peculiar behavior . actually , it produce block copolymer , whereas the homogeneous catalytic system known to copolymerize these monomer preferentially give rise to alternating sequence of ethylene and styrene . the polystyrene block are isotactic and show crystallinity , also when their average length is a short a <nUm> unit . some evidence suggests the primary styrene insertion into the metal-carbon bond of the growing chain : this unusual regiochemistry could account for the observed tendency to give homosequences . polyethylene and isotactic polypropylene having 1,2- or 1,3-disubstituted cyclopentane structure were prepared by copolymerization of ethylene or propylene with cyclopentene ( CPE ) or 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) using zirconocene catalyst . effect of the cyclopentane structure on the melting point and crystalline structure of the copolymer wa investigated . In the case of ethylene-based copolymer , polyethylene containing 1,3-disubstituted cyclopentane structure , poly(ethylene-co-HD) , showed a lower degree of melting - point depression and decreasing crystallinity with increasing cyclopentane content than polyethylene containing 1,2-disubstituted cyclopentane structure , poly(ethylene-co-CPE) . expansion of crystalline unit cell , especially along the a-axis , with increasing cyclopentane content wa observed in the wide - angle x-ray diffraction pattern of the poly(ethylene-co-HD) . the phenomenon indicated incorporation of 1,3-disubstituted cyclopentane structure in the crystalline phase of polyethylene . on the other hand , both poly(propylene-co-CPE) and poly(propylene-co-HD) showed similar profile in the relationship between the comonomer content and the melting point or the crystallinity of the copolymer . lowest energy ligand - to - metal charge - transfer ( LMCT ) transition of racemic siloxy-substituted ethylene-bridged bis(indenyl) - type zirconocenes reacted with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) were studied using UV / vi spectroscopy in combination with the ab initio hartree - fock method . the LMCT absorption were recorded at various [Al] / [Zr] ratio , representing dichloride , methylated , and cationic form of the zirconocenes . the experimental LMCT absorption energy of each intermediate were compared to the calculated energy of the indenyl ligand - based HOMO and the zirconium - based LUMO . the lowest energy LMCT absorption were directly proportional to the calculated LUMO - HOMO energy gap . furthermore , the LMCT absorption energy were demonstrated to correlate with ethylene polymerization activity of the siloxy-substituted complex . this correlation wa clarified by a frontier orbital analysis , suggesting that decreasing absorption energy is related to the feasibility of the activation of the catalyst . density functional ( DFT ) calculation were carried out on the B3LYP level of theory on bridged and unbridged cationic zirconocene complex to clarify why unbridged [Zr(Cp)2(Me)(thf)][BPh4] is not active in the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) , whereas [Zr{(Cp)2CMe2}(Me)(thf)][BPh4] polymerizes MMA readily , a we showed experimentally . it is shown , that the initial step of the polymerization - the transfer of the metallocene bound methyl group to the first MMA molecule-is endothermic for [Zr(Cp)2(Me)(MMA)]+ but exothermic for [Zr{(Cp)2CMe2}(Me)(MMA)]+ . furthermore - and more important - the activation energy is higher for the reaction of the unbridged compound compared to the activation energy of the bridged compound . from these result and an estimation of the rate constant it follows that in the temperature range investigated experimentally ( <nUm> to + <nUm> ° C ) either the endothermic product is not formed at all and / or the reversed reaction to the reactant is much faster than the reaction with the next MMA molecule . these result are confirmed by the inclusion of solvent effect by the CPCM solvation model ( also known a COSMO ) . alternative reaction path for both cation were also investigated and found to be energetically much le favorable . an investigation of the ethylene polymerization with meso ansa metallocenes of group <nUm> allows clarifying some aspect of the branching formation observed in the polyethylene produced with these catalyst . the meso structure of the zirconocene precursor is more effective in promoting the chain growing isomerization when indenyl ligand bear no substituents . but the same coordinating neighborhood when surrounding the Ti(IV) or Hf(IV) ion give rise to complex not effective in the ethyl-branched polyethylene synthesis . on the other hand , several activator in combination with meso-ethylenebis(1-indenyl)Zr(CH3)2 produce catalyst able to polymerize ethylene to ethyl-branched polyethylene . No difference ha been detected in the amount of branch with respect to that observed with MAO - activated meso-ethylenebis(1-indenyl)ZrCl2 . recently , an asymmetric ansa - zirconocene dichloride complex that is able to introduce single stereoerrors into an isotactic polypropene chain a a function of monomer concentration is described . though , one major requirement for the practical application of such new material is a molecular weight high enough to ensure satisfying tensile and creep property below and above room temperature . this paper report on a series of new asymmetric zirconocene dimethyl , hafnocene dichloride , and hafnocene dimethyl complex for the homopolymerization of propene in toluene solution and in liquid monomer after MAO and borate activation . stereoregular PPs having a hydroxyl group at the side chain were easily synthesized . the method employed is the stereospecific propene polymerization by zirconocene dichlorides-[Ph <nUm> C][B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] combined with ODIBA , in place of usual trialkylaluminum , followed by quenching with O <nUm> . ethene homopolymerization and copolymerization in toluene solution with varying amount of 1-hexene were catalyzed by the methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) activated zirconocene catalyst (1,2,4-Me3-Cp)2ZrCl2 and (Me5Cp)2ZrCl2 and a mixture of these two in a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio . the dual site catalyst ( <nUm> : <nUm> mixture ) ha a homo- and copolymerization activity intermediate between the individual catalyst . deviation from the expected average behaviour taking into account the ca. 6-fold higher <nUm> h yield of (1,2,4-Me3Cp)2 Cl2Zr are observed . the dual site system result in a copolymer with ca. <nUm> % too low comonomer incorporation . the melting endotherm attributed to (Me5Cp)2ZrCl2 is found to be ca. 30-70 % too high , and the observed molecular weight for the copolymer are higher than expected and even higher than for the two individual catalyst . chain transfer to trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) is found to become le important at high comonomer concentration concurrent with an increase of the concentration of vinyl and trans-vinylene unsaturations . further , it is noteworthy that with the dual site system it is possible to produce ethene / 1-hexene copolymer with narrow molecular weight distribution a a mixture of chain containing low and high comonomer content . the observed discrepancy in the mixed system from the average of the (1,2,4-Me3Cp)2ZrCl2 and (Me5Cp)2ZrCl2 catalyst are provisionally explained by chain transfer between the site coupled with an activity increase of the latter of these site . the copolymerizations of propylene with allyl monomer carrying alcohol or amine were conducted by the rac-dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride / methylaluminoxane catalyst system . the allyl monomer were pretreated by alkylaluminum before the polymerization . although the efficiency of the introduction of allyl alcohol - based comonomer wa extraordinary low ( <nUm> - <nUm> mol % in polymer ) , the trimethylaluminum - treated allylamine wa found to be introduced more effectively ( <nUm> mol % in polymer ) . the 13C NMR study indicated that the position of allylamine unit in the copolymer wa influenced by the kind of alkylaluminum used at the polymerization . In the presence of trimethylaluminum , the terminally aminated polypropylene wa obtained ( [ amino end polymer ] / [ whole polymer ] = <nUm> ) . In the presence of triisobutylaluminum , however , the allylamine unit is located both on the main chain and at the chain end . the end - aminated polymer wa probably obtained due to the formation of dormant specie after the insertion of the comonomer followed by the chain transfer to alkylaluminum . the activation of 1-siloxy-substituted zirconocene with MAO occurs slowly , in 4-6 h . the slow activation process involves three distinct ligand to metal charge transfer ( LMCT ) band shift in the UV / vi spectrum before the maximum LMCT absorption energy and intensity of the third appearing band is reached . In addition , at very high MAO concentration , a fourth band at <nUm> nm begin to form . on the contrary , the corresponding 2-siloxy-substituted a well a the unsubstituted zirconocene react with MAO in le than a minute , immediately producing the final specie , a confirmed by only one observed LMCT band shift . the 1-silyl-substituted zirconocene reacts with MAO , producing the final active specie in <nUm> h . UV / vi spectroscopic observation were interpreted with the aid of molecular modeling study , demonstrating that the interaction of the oxygen donor atom of the siloxy substituent with electron deficient Zr center and coordinatively unsaturated Al in MAO play a prominent role in the activation process . vinyl chloride monomer ( VCM ) ha been employed a a chain transfer agent to yield polyolefins with one vinyl end group per chain ; subsequent incorporation of these macromonomers ha resulted in the formation of branched polyolefins . the use of VCM a a comonomer in transition - metal - catalyzed olefin polymerization result in b-chloride elimination , yielding polymer that contain vinyl end group and a chlorinated catalyst . through reactivation of the catalyst by advantageous MAO , or other aluminum alkyl , reinitiation of the olefin polymerization can occur ; the combination of elimination and reactivation allows for VCM to behave a a chain transfer agent . the use of VCM a a chain transfer agent result in the exclusive formation of vinyl end group ( no vinylidene or internal vinyl end group ) in polyethylene , both homopolyethylene and copolymer with octene ; in propylene polymerization , vinyl end group are formed in addition to vinylidene end group , the result of b-hydride elimination which occurs even in the absence of VCM . the chain transfer constant for VCM in ethylene polymerization for a variety of single site catalyst were determined and found to be very similar , with Cs × <nUm> ∼ <nUm> ; for a propylene polymerization using a zirconocene catalyst , Cs × <nUm> ∼ <nUm> . it wa further observed that the resulting macromonomers formed in the polyethylene polymerization could be incorporated into the growing polymer chain , resulting in the formation of long chain branch . the cationic zirconocene trihydrides [ Cp'4Zr2H (m-H)2]+X- , generated from [Cp'2ZrH2]2 with various trityl salt of weakly coordinating anion , are powerful initiator for the polymerization of isobutene ( IB ) and it copolymerization with isoprene ( IP ) ( cp' = C5H4SiMe3 ) . this study is concerned with the quantification of the effect of the counteranion and of trace moisture on IB / IP copolymer and the nature of the initiating specie . polymer molecular weight increase with decreasing anion nucleophilicity in the order x = [B(C6F5)4] ≈ [H2N{B(C6F5)3}2] > [CN{B(C6F5)3}2] . using [Cp'4Zr2H3]- [CN{B(C6F5)3}2]- , high copolymer molecular weight are found ( mw ≈ <nUm> × <nUm> g / mol at <nUm> ° C ) . there is little reduction in either rate or molecular weight on addition of isoprene . polymer molecular weight are substantially higher than with the Et2AlCl / BuCl initiator system under identical condition . water wa shown to be an important chain - transfer agent ; substoichiometric quantity of water reduced activity , and copolymer molecular weight decreased linearly with increasing [H2O] . mechanistic study suggest that [ Cp'4Zr2H- (m-H)2]+ doe not itself act a a cationic initiator but is transformed into one or more other binuclear ( polynuclear ? ) specie , accompanied by alkene insertion into the Zr-H bond and a monomer hydrogenation step . tentative structure for these reactive intermediate are suggested . methylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride substituted in C(3) , activated by methylalumoxane , is able to give polystyrene and ethylene-styrene copolymer . In this study hydrooligomers , whose structure , determined by 13C NMR and GC-MS technique , give information about the regiochemistry and the stereochemistry of styrene insertion , have been purposefully prepared . the regiochemistry of the styrene insertion is related to the encumbrance of substituents in C(3) . rac-[Methylene-(3-R-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 with r = H , CH3 , or C2H5 induces a prevailingly secondary styrene insertion into the zirconium-carbon bond . with increasing the substituent 's steric hindrance ( r = C3H7 ) , regiochemistry inversion occurs and the primary insertion becomes prevailing . the analysis of ethylene-styrene copolymer obtained in the presence of the different catalyst allows confirming the correlation between regiochemistry and comonomers ' reactivity . besides , also the stereospecificity can be evaluated from the structure of the hydrotrimers , when the insertion is primary . whereas the isospecificity in the absence of substituents ( secondary insertion ) and in the presence of the tert-butyl substituent ( primary insertion ) is well - known , a surprising syndiospecificity is observed when the indenyl ligand bear the isopropyl substituent in C(3) . copolymerizations of ethylene with 1,3-butadiene in the presence of catalytic system based on some C2 - symmetric zirconocenes ( rac-[CH2(3-R-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 where r = -C(CH3)3 ( 1 ) , -CH(CH3)2 ( 2 ) , -CH2CH3 ( 3 ) , -CH3 ( 4 ) , and -H ( 5 ) ) are compared . the chemical nature and the relative amount of constitutional comonomer unit from butadiene are strongly affected by the bulkiness of the substituent in position <nUm> and 3' . DFT calculation indicate that the observed dependence of constitutional unit from butadiene on the bulkiness of the alkyl ligand substituent can be easily rationalized by the occurrence of an unusual insertion mechanism for butadiene . this mechanism , involving butadiene if primary coordination followed by it primary vinyl insertion , becomes largely predominant for catalytic system based on the zirconocenes ( 1-4 ) , which present r ≥ CH3 . this kind of butadiene insertion mechanism is also able to account for the high stereoregularity which is observed for adjacent methylene-1,2-cyclopropane unit . poly(propylene-ran-1,3-butadiene) that contained selectively inserted 1,4-butadiene unit wa successfully synthesized by ind-1 activated with MAOs . the average amount of 1,4-BD per polymer chain and thus the average length of propylene unit between 1,4-BDs of the copolymer could be controlled by the butadiene concentration in the feed . the copolymer with high molecular weight were converted to a,o-divinyl isotactic PP by ethenolysis . the synthesis of a vinyl-terminated , hyperbranched polysilane and the additional hydroboration with bis(pentafluorophenyl) borohydride are reported . quantitative transformation wa proved by 1H NMR and FT-IR analysis . the polymeric borane wa tested a cocatalyst in the metallocene - catalyzed polymerization of propylene . the corresponding catalyst system comprising rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1- e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconocene dichloride and the polymeric borane wa activated in situ in the presence of triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) . polymerization were performed at temperature of <nUm> and <nUm> ° C with a propylene concentration of <nUm> mol / L in toluene solution using various cocatalyst : catalyst ratio ( <nUm> : <nUm> , <nUm> : <nUm> , and <nUm> : <nUm> ) . this polymer - supported catalyst system produce polypropylene with excellent activity and good molecular weight . these result were compared with an additional set of polymerization experiment using molecular dispersed BC18F15 a cocatalyst , resulting in significantly reduced polymerization activity . this indicates a hindered catalyst mobility inside the hyperbranched cocatalyst matrix , leading to a higher concentration of active specie within the hyperbranched nanostructure . addition of aluminum or zinc alkyl ( AIRs or ZnR2 , r = me or et ) lower the molar mass of norbornene - ethene ( N / e ) copolymer obtained with the catalyst system Me2C(Ind)(Cp)ZrCl2 / MAO or rac-C 2H4(2-tBuMe2SiO-Ind) 2ZrCl2 / MAO to different degree . these chain - shortening effect and change in relative end - group abundance indicate the degree to which e / N copolymer growing at a Zr catalyst center are transferred to Al or Zn center by alkyl-polymeryl exchange . increased molar mass of copolymer obtained in the presence of added Al(iBu)3 indicate that this reagent suppresses polymer chain exchange between Zr catalyst center and methylaluminum specie contained in the MAO activator . these observation are interpreted in term of reversible adduct formation between Al or Zn alkyl and cationic zirconocene alkyl specie . mechanistic study of isospecific polymerization of methacrylates by a cationic , chiral ansa - zirconocene ester enolate complex , rac - (EBI)Zr +(THF)[OC(O iPr ) = CMe 2][MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) 3]- [ <nUm> ; EBI = C 2H 4-(Ind)2 ] , are reported . complex <nUm> effect isospecific and living (co)polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) and re-butyl methacrylate ( BMA ) , producing highly isotactic homopolymers and block copolymer with narrow molecular weight distribution and high initiator efficiency . investigation of statistical copolymerizations of MMA and BMA have yielded monomer reactivity ratio of τ MMA = <nUm> and τ BMA = <nUm> ( the kelen - tudos method ) , indicating that the copolymer formed instantaneously ha a somewhat alternating character . study of MMA polymerization kinetics have shown that propagation is first order in both concentration of the monomer and the active specie . the single MMA addition product , rac - (EBI)ZrMe[OC(OMe) = C(Me)CH 2C(Me <nUm> ) C(O iPr)-O ] ( 3 ) , ha been isolated from the reaction between the neutral roc - (EBI)ZrMe[OC(O iPr ) - C(Me) <nUm> ] ( 2 ) and MMA ; however , subsequent MMA addition do not proceed , unless the single addition product is further treated with B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> to generate the eight - membered - ring cyclic ester enolate specie , rac - (EBI)Zr +[OC(OMe) = C(Me)CH 2C(Me 2)C(O iPr)-O][MeB-(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - ( 4 ) , which corresponds to the structure of the intermediate for the single MMA addition product of <nUm> . all result presented here are consistent with the conclusion that isospecific polymerization of methacrylates by 1-which model the proposed isospecific propagating specie for the methacrylate polymerization by chiral ansa - zirconocene complexes-is enantiomorphic site controlled and proceeds in a monometallic , intramolecular michael addition mechanism . A new method to prepare polypropylene-graft-polystyrene copolymer with tailored structure ha been developed . the ability of a series of copolymer with variable structure to compatibilize the polypropylene-polystyrene blend wa evaluated through microscopic observation of the morphology of the blend . the synthesis is a two - step process , the first one being the preparation , in the presence of ansa - zirconocene - based catalyst , of the backbone formed by i-PP sequence spaced by p-methylstyreneethylene unit . In the second step , the methyl group in the aromatic ring are reacted with sec-butyllithium , and the resulting metalated polymer allowed to add the styrene to initiate the side polystyrene chain growth . this synthesis turn out versatile both in the first step because by changing monomer feed ratio , backbone with different number of the site of growth of the graft and with different length of the polypropylene sequence can be obtained , and in the last step because , by tuning styrene concentration and reaction time , the side chain length can be regulated . the PP-g-PS copolymer with PP sequence varying in the range of 24-98 unit , with number of the side chain from <nUm> to <nUm> and with PS side chain length from <nUm> × <nUm> to <nUm> × <nUm> unit , were obtained and afterward tested a compatibilizers in the PP / PS blend . the morphology of the blend , analyzed and compared by scanning electron microscopy , suggest that the compatibility of PP / PS blend is improved with increasing either the PP sequence length or the PS side chain length or the number of the side chain in the PP-g-PS copolymer . the coordination acrylamide polymerization by the cationic , chiral ansa - zirconocene ester enolate complex wa discussed . the feature of the polymerization include the high degree of control over polymerization stereochemistry and polymer molecular weight distribution . Poly(N,N- dimethylacrylamide ) ( PDMMA ) with unprecedented isotacticity , high m n , low polydispersity index ( PDI ) and T m a high a <nUm> ° C is synthesized . the effort are underway to synthesize other type of stereoregular polyacrylamides using this technique . A comparative analysis of the structure and mechanical property of two elastomeric amorphous and semicrystalline polypropylene sample , produced with c2v-symmetric and chiral C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocene catalyst , respectively , is presented . the poorly isotactic polypropylene ( iam-PP ) of medium molecular weight , prepared with the chiral C 2-symmetric catalyst , slowly crystallizes , by aging at room temperature or by stretching , in a continuum of disordered modification intermediate between α and γ form of isotactic polypropylene . structural and morphological transformation occur during stretching . disordered α / γ modification , containing a high fraction of perpendicular chain , present in the unoriented film , transform by stretching at high deformation into structure more similar to the α form with a high content of parallel chain . the development of the small level of crystallinity induces elastic property . the small crystalline domain in the amorphous matrix , indeed , act a physical knot of the elastomeric lattice . this poorly isotactic iam-PP sample show , instead , poor elastic property and viscous flow at high deformation in the amorphous state , before crystallization , because of the not high molecular weight . the unique crystallization mode of the iam-PP sample explains the remarkable enhancement of elastic property in low stereoregular polypropylene upon development of crystallinity . the fully amorphous high molecular weight atactic polypropylene ( a-PP ) , prepared with the c2v-symmetric catalyst , present elastic behavior only in a small deformation range ( up to <nUm> % strain ) and experience viscous flow of the chain at high deformation . the elasticity arises from the physical network generated by the high degree of entanglement of the polymeric chain generated by the high molecular weight of the sample . the poorly isotactic iam-PP sample , before crystallization , present much poorer elastic property than the a-PP sample because of the lower molecular weight . after crystallization , it show better elastic property in a large range of deformation with higher strength , notwithstanding the lower molecular weight , due to the presence of crystallinity . unbridged zirconocene catalyst , where a seven- or eight - membered ring fused to a cyclopentadiene is associated with a phenyl substituent in position <nUm> ( C7Ph-Zr and C8Ph-Zr ) , were tested , under the same polymerization condition , to produce polypropene with microstructure , molecular property , and thermal behavior similar to those prepared with (IndPh)2ZrCl2 ( w-Zr ) , the " classical " waymouth catalyst . different result were obtained from the homologue titanium catalyst ( C7Ph-Ti and C8Ph-Ti ) and from the titanium benzyl derivative ( C7Bn-Ti ) , which produced quite heterogeneous material with broad molecular weight and that can be separated into fraction spanning from completely atactic to fraction characterized by the presence of long isotactic block . A quite interesting behavior is observed with the zirconium benzyl derivative C7Bn-Zr , which produce good yield of a polymer with narrow polydispersity , which , despite it rather high isotacticity , show a hardly detectable melting peak and is completely ether soluble . quite surprisingly , the same sample , after prolonged annealing , show a narrow melting peak at low temperature ( 55-65 ° C ) . this result , together with the x-ray analysis , is in favor of a quite homogeneous material , capable of giving crystallite of small size . density functional calculation have been performed on different conformers and isomer of the propyl group in alkyl cation [L2Zr-Pr] - ( L = cp , cp* ; Pr = n-propyl ) , corresponding to two catalyst with different observed rate order ( n ) for ethylene polymerization , to explore the single - center , two - state kinetic model for olefin polymerization . for L = cp ( n ≈ <nUm> ) , the b-agostic conformer is found to be the most stable structure and also the most reactive with respect to ethylene coordination , which is commensurate with unity rate order . for L = cp* ( n ≈ <nUm> ) , the favored propagation route involves the g- and a-agostic conformation of the alkyl complex , with coordination taking place to an a-agostic conformation in order to minimize the steric hindrance experienced by the incoming ethylene . the barrier to rearrangement from the a- and g-agostic conformers to the more stable b-agostic structure are significantly lower than those of propagation . moreover , no structure wa found to be of lower energy than the b-agostic conformation , and the latter thus take the role of the resting state for both catalyst in the present study . assuming that the single - center , two - state model applies to zirconocene - catalyzed ethylene polymerization , our calculation thus suggest that the corresponding fast and slow , or dormant , state do not originate from equilibrium of the alkyl group a investigated here . A protocol is described in which zirconocene - catalyzed alkene polymerization reaction are terminated by bromine to give polymer containing brominated end group , Br - polymeryl . using NMR spectroscopy , the Br - polymeryl group can be identified a primary or secondary , thus providing information concerning the nature of the Zr - polymeryl linkage ( s ) , and ( via integration ) quantified , thus giving information about the relative concentration ( s ) of the Zr - polymeryl linkage ( s ) . the procedure can in principle give very useful information concerning the nature and concentration of Zr - polymeryl group in existence during polymerization process and is tested through ethylene polymerization by the Cp2ZrMe2 / B(C6F 5)3 catalyst system and propylene polymerization by the Cp2ZrMe2 / BC18F15 , (indenyl)2 - ZrMe2 / BC6F5 <nUm> , and rac-{C2H4(1-indenyl)2} ZrMe2 / BC18F15 catalyst system . to this point the resulting data concerning Zr - polymeryl concentration are generally consistent with data in the literature but are rather more easily obtained . A kinetic model based on the coordination - insertion mechanism wa developed to characterize metallocene - catalyzed propylene polymerization using two different catalyst system : rac - Et(Ind) 2ZrCl <nUm> / MAO ( I / MAO ) and rac-Et(4,7-Me 2-1-Ind ) 2ZrCl <nUm> / MAO ( II / MAO ) . slurry propylene polymerization were performed in a semibatch reactor at <nUm> ° C to investigate the effect of propylene partial pressure and MAO / Zr ratio . the kinetic model account for the formation of regioirregularities , the occurrence of chain transfer to trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) , and b-hydride chain transfer to both monomer and metal to predict the effect of propylene partial pressure and the MAO concentration on polymer molecular weight and the formation of isobutyl end group . A systematic optimization strategy wa applied to estimate the kinetic parameter from on - line measurement of the reaction rate and end - of - batch measurement of the molecular weight and percentage of end group . the formation of <nUm> , 1-insertions wa more frequent for catalyst II / MAO ( k s = <nUm> L mol <nUm> s <nUm> v k s = <nUm> L mol <nUm> s <nUm> for I / MAO ) . the m w of polymer produced with I / MAO decreased at low pressure due to the high rate of monomolecular b-hydride transfer to the metal ( k H = <nUm> s <nUm> ) . chain transfer to TMA wa more significant with the catalyst II / MAO ( k Al = <nUm> × <nUm> + <nUm> L mol <nUm> s <nUm> v k Al = <nUm> × <nUm> + <nUm> L mol <nUm> s <nUm> for I / MAO ) . this work study the mechanism and application of the novel diastereospecific ion - pairing polymerization ( DIPP ) effected by a catalyst system comprising chiral zirconocene bis(ester enolate ) rac-(EBI)-Zr[OC(O iPr ) = CMe <nUm> ] <nUm> [ <nUm> , EBI = C 2H 4(Ind) <nUm> ] and <nUm> equiv of lewis acid A1(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> . the <nUm> / 2Al(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> system effectively promotes DIPP of functionalized alkene such a methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) , producing polymer having various stereoregularities , including isotactic , syndiotactic , and isotactic-e-syndiotactic multiblock microstructures , depending on the [monomer] / [catalyst] ratio employed . our detailed investigation into the polymerization characteristic and kinetics , elementary reaction , characterization and behavior of the isolated key intermediate , a well a temperature and lewis acid effect have yielded a mechanism for the DIPP of MMA by the l / 2Al(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> system . this mechanism consists of four manifold - isospecific , syndiospecific , anion - monomer exchange , and chain - transfer domain - and satisfactorily explains the formation of various polymer stereomicrostructures under given condition . the most significant part of this overall mechanism is for the production of the isotactic-b-syndiotactic stereomultiblock structure , which is made possible by two pathway that can interconvert diastereospecific propagating manifold : exchange between the coordinated anion and monomer a well a chain transfer . this unique polymerization technique ha also been applied to the copolymerization of MMA with methacrylates having longer alkyl chain , leading to functionalized polymeric material with tunable property that are controlled by their stereomicrostructures and nature of the comonomer . the systematic investigation of the synthesis , thermal property , and microstructures of isotactic poly(3-methyl-l-butene) ( iP3M1B ) wa performed . three C2 methallocene catalyst , namely , (DMSBMPI)ZrCI2 , (DMSBI)ZrCl2 , and (DMSMBI)ZrC12 with MAO , are used for the synthesis of iP3M1B . it wa synthesized in a <nUm> mL three - necked glass bottle equipped with a magnetic stirrer . the reaction equipment wa evacuated for half an hour and filled with nitrogen before polymerization . the melt - state NMR analysis revealed that sample synthesized with (DMSMBI)ZrCl2 show a high regiospecificity . melt - state NMR analysis yield important microstructure information for insoluble polymer , similar to that obtained by solution - state NMR analysis , although melt - state NMR analysis suffers from a lower spectral resolution . the calculation based on the density functional theory ( DFT ) to investigate the experimental difference observed in the molecular weight of the polymer obtained using different zirconocene catalyst have been performed . geometric structure and gibbs free energy profile were obtained using the B3LYP hybrid DFT functional and LANL2DZ basis set for all atom . all calculation were performed using the gaussian03 package , while thermodynamic data were calculated for <nUm> bar ethylene pressure and <nUm> K using standard statistical thermodynamic method implemented in the gaussian package . it wa observed that the silyl-bridged bis-indenyl catalyst containing linear alkyl substituents in the 3-position of the indenyl ligand yield polyethylene with different molecular weight depending on the alkyl chain length . the corresponding product present a metallacycle structure and the polymer chain ejected from the catalyst . the effect of cyclopentadienyl ring substitution on the immobilization and activation of zirconocenes on support of type Cl2Mg / AlR n(OEt)3-n ha been investigated . comparison of the activity of immobilized zirconocenes (RCp)2ZrCl2 in ethylene polymerization , using simple aluminum alkyl such a AlEt3 or AliBu3 a a cocatalyst , revealed a remarkable effect of the substituent r in the cyclopentadienyl ring . low activity ( < <nUm> kg / mol bar h ) wa obtained with r = H or et , but longer alkyl substituents , notably n-Pr or n-Bu , gave more than an order of magnitude increase in activity . zirconocenes with branched substituents ( i-Pr , t-Bu ) were le easily immobilized and gave relatively low activity , while the activity of zirconocenes of composition cp - (RCp)ZrCl2 ( r = n-Pr , n-Bu , n-pentyl ) were intermediate between those of Cp2ZrCl2 and (RCp)2ZrCl2 . experiment carried out under homogeneous condition with aluminoxane cocatalysts indicated that the effect of cyclopentadienyl ring substitution can be related to difference in the ease of formation of the active specie . an inverse relationship between activity and the catalyst loading on the support wa found . At a low loading of <nUm> mmol (n-PrCp)2ZrCl2 / g support , an activity greater than <nUm> <nUm> kg / mol bar h wa obtained in ethylene polymerization at <nUm> ° C , with AliBu3 a the cocatalyst . the result demonstrate that with certain Cl2Mg - immobilized zirconocenes it is possible to achieve very high polymerization activity without the use of methylaluminoxane or a borate activator , but the strong effect of catalyst loading on activity implies the presence of a relatively low number of active specie . the mechanism of stereoselectivity in methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) monometallic polymerization promoted by the C1 - symmetric ansa-Me 2C(Cp)(Ind)Zr - based zirconocene , presenting two diastereotopic coordination site , wa investigated within density functional theory . At variance from the case of propene polymerization , our result suggest that MMA addition is stereoselective when the growing chain is in the more hindered a well a in the more open diastereotopic coordination site . In both case the same enantioface of the enolate bond of the ester enolate growing chain is selected , although selectivity is higher when the growing chain is in the more hindered diastereotopic coordination site . further , there is no substantial energy difference between these two situation , which indicates that the moderate isotacticity of the produced PMMA is consistent with an almost regular chain - migratory mechanism . the different stereoselectivity of the two diastereotopic site is due to different steric interaction between the growing chain ( chain effect ) or MMA ( monomer effect ) with the indenyl ligand . this decomposition of stereoselectivity into chain and monomer effect is used to reinvestigate the stereoselectivity of strictly related C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocenes . A liquid crystalline phase ha been discovered in a polyolefin of poly(methylene-1,3-cyclopentane) ( PMCP ) having low molecular weight , which wa obtained with cyclization polymerization of 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) using a zirconocene catalyst in the presence of chain transfer reagent . PMCP clearly show fluidity and birefringence above the glass transition temperature under the ambient condition . schlieren - like texture , which indicates nematic liquid crystalline phase , ha been detected in place . clear diffraction pattern is observed in wide - angle x-ray diffraction analysis below the isotropization temperature . the isotropization temperature decrease with decreasing of molecular weight of the PMCP . PMCP with the higher molecular weight take the longer time for liquid crystallization from isotropic phase . Non-Newtonian viscosity region in the range of low share rate , which is a characteristic of liquid crystal , ha been detected below the isotropization temperature . the copolymerization of ethylene with tert-butylethylene ( TBE , 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene ) using various half - titanocene [ cp' TiCl2X ( x = O-2,6-iPr2C6H <nUm> , N = CtBu2 ) ] - cocatalyst system ha been carried out . the aryloxo-containing half - titanocenes , Cp'TiCl 2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) ( cp' = cp* , tBuC5F4 , 1,2,4-Me3C5H2 ) , displayed the capability to bring about TBE incorporation in the presence of MAO a a cocatalyst , while their ketimide analogue , Cp'TiCl2(N = CtBu <nUm> ) ( cp' = cp , cp * , tBUC5H4 ) , could not accomplish TBE enchainment in ethylene / TBE copolymerization . among aryloxo derivative , those carrying tert-butyl and trimethyl substituents on the cyclopentadienyl moiety , Cp'TiCl2(O-2,6- iPr2C6H3 ) ( cp' = tBuC5H4 , 1,2,4-Me3C 5H2 ) , exhibited efficient TBE incorporation and moderate catalytic activity in the presence of MAO , affording ethylene / TBE copolymer with relatively high molecular weight and uniform molecular weight distribution . however , the copolymerization conducted by employing constrained geometry catalyst ( linked half - titanocene ) , [ Me2Si(C5Me 4)(NtBu)]TiCl2 , and zirconocene [ cp 2ZrCl2]-MAO catalyst system resulted in polyethylene without TBE incorporation . furthermore , the copolymerization of 1-hexene ( 1-Hex ) with TBE and vinyltrimethylsilane ( VTMS ) , by ( tBuC5F 4OTiC12(O-2,6-iPr2C 6H3 ) and CpTiCi2(N = CtBu <nUm> ) - MAO catalyst system , indicated a considerably higher reactivity of VTMS . the 1-Hex / VTMS copolymerization ha been elucidated to proceed via 1,2-insertion a manifested by the remarkably efficient VTMS enchainment , hence revealing the difference in the reactivity of TBE and VTMS to arise from that in their electronic and / or steric nature . poly(methylene-1,3-cyclopentane) ( PMCP ) , which is composed with alternating linkage of methylene and 1,3-cyclopentane unit , wa synthesized by cyclization polymerization of 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) with various metallocene catalyst . the optically active PMCP sample were prepared by cyclization polymerization of HD with an optically active zirconocene catalyst , [ (+)-(S,S)-ethylene-1,2- bis(n5-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)- 1,1'-bi-2-naphtholate ] , combined with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) a a cocatalyst in the presence of triethylaluminum ( A1Et3 ) a a chain transfer reagent to control the molecular weight in toluene at room temperature . the PMCP sample obtained with the optically active zirconocene catalyst show optical rotation in chloroform solution . the MnS of the PMCP sample were measured by gel - permeation chromatography and relatively calibrated with standard polystyrene sample . the birefringent texture of PMCP with relatively high molecular weight showed the fingerprint texture indicating cholesteric liquid crystal . low molecular weight ( ca. <nUm> ) ethylene - 1-butene copolymer were synthesized at <nUm> ° C using rac-(dimethylsilyl)bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( I ) catalyst and methyl-aluminoxane ( MAO ) cocatalyst . comonomer composition , triad sequence distribution , and end group were analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR . the average polymer molecule contains about one double bond and one saturated end group . the unsaturated end group were formed almost exclusively by transfer from propagating chain containing 1-butene a the terminal unit . At least <nUm> % of the unsaturated end group are vinylidene and trisubstituted double bond , which are present in the approximate ratio <nUm> : <nUm> . saturated end group result from the initiation process . both ethylene and 1-butene are involved in initiation , but ethylene more than 1-butene . the product is a random copolymer with very short block ( no longer than 2-3 monomer unit ) of both ethylene and 1-butene . the comonomer sequence distribution determined by 13C NMR were fitted to first - order markovian statistic , which allowed calculation of the monomer reactivity ratio . the result are discussed in term of a reaction mechanism consisting of initiation , propagation , and chain transfer reaction . A molecular mechanic analysis on model metallocene complex , a possible intermediate for the propene polymerization , in which the two coordination position available for the monomer and the growing chain are diastereotopic , is presented . the energy difference between the corresponding diastereoisomeric preinsertion intermediate appears to be relevant for the model complex based on the meso-ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl) ligand ( 1 ) , the isopropylidene[(3-methyl(e5-cyclopen > r tadienyl))(e5-9-fluorenyl) ligand ( 2 ) , and the rac-ethylene[1-(e5-9-fluorenyl)-1-phenyl-2-(e 5-1-indenyl ) ] ligand ( 3 ) , while it appears to be small for those based on the rac-ethylene[1-(e5-cyclopentadienyl)-1-phenyl-2-(e 5-1-indenyl ) ] ligand ( 4 ) . it is suggested that these energy difference can be related to an increased probability of a back - skip of the growing chain toward the outward coordination position after the monomer insertion and prior to the coordination of a new olefin molecule . the kinetic competition between the back - skip of the chain outwards and the monomer coordination is able to rationalize the kind of defect in prevailingly hemi-isotactic chain obtained with system based on <nUm> , a well a the increased stereoregularity at decreasing monomer concentration for system based on <nUm> ( not shown by system based on <nUm> ) . the molecular mechanic analysis show that the nonbonded interaction are also able to account for the influence of the ethylene bridge conformation on the stereospecificity of the propene polymerization in ansa - zirconocene complex . none the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) , initiated by zirconocene complex cp2 - ZrMe2 ( 1 ) and [Cp2ZrMe(THF)][BPh4] ( 2 ) , provides partially syndiotactic poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) in high yield and with a narrow molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) . the kinetics of this process were studied and reveal that in this system , the rate of initiation is much slower than that of propagation . initiation appears to involve the rate - limiting reaction of complex <nUm> with monomer to generate a cationic enolate complex ( 3 ) . the latter compound also initiate polymerization of MMA , albeit at a much slower rate than that observed using initiator <nUm> and <nUm> . the mechanism for propagation in polymerization initiated by complex <nUm> and <nUm> ha a rate - limiting step involving the reaction of neutral zirconium enolate specie ( 4 ) , produced in situ from <nUm> and <nUm> , with monomer , activated by coordination to complex <nUm> . neutral enolate complex <nUm> and complex <nUm> function a effective initiator of MMA polymerization in which the rate of initiation is greater than or equal to the rate of propagation . under these condition . PMMA can be produced with very narrow MWD and the polymerization process is living at or below <nUm> ° C . the rate of this process is highly sensitive to the presence of impurity and thus the degree of polymerization is practically limited by initiator concentration . the polymerization of MMA , using initiator <nUm> and <nUm> , in the presence of trialkylaluminum compound wa studied with a view to overcoming these limitation . alkylaluminum compound appear to act a chain transfer termination reagent in these polymerization , although the rate of this process is much slower than the rate of propagation . In particular , triisobutylaluminum can be used to purify monomer and solvent and allows production of PMMA with a narrow MWD at high conversion . the polymerization of n-butyl acrylate ( BuA ) , initiated by complex <nUm> and <nUm> , wa studied . poly(n - butyl acrylate ) ( P(BuA) ) can be prepared in high yield at low temperature with a narrow MWD . this process is not living and the principal termination process involves back - biting cyclization a revealed by MALDI - TOF mass spectrum of low-MW polymer . At higher temperature , the growing chain are deactivated by this process and also by competitive a-hydrogen transfer , such that high monomer conversion are not obtained . the zirconocene coupling of conjugated dines is a versatile route to a new family of polymer with primarily cross-conjugated structure . this partially cross-conjugated and irregular structure result in the relatively wide band gap of the polymer which appear to be responsible for the observed emission of blue light . A kinetic study of the ethylene-styrene copolymerization in the presence of rac-(ethylenebis-(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride activated by MAO show the peculiar behavior of this catalytic system that is known to produce crystalline nearly alternating copolymer . some inference on the monomer - metal interaction are made on the basis of this study . the parallel investigation on the catalyst based on isopropylidene(1-cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride allows u to produce a stereoregular nearly alternating ethylene-styrene copolymer also with this catalytic system . the same main tacticity seems to characterize the copolymer obtained with the C2 and Cs symmetric catalyst in accordance with the generally accepted mechanism of stereocontrol in the 1-alkene polymerization . cationic metallocene / borate catalyst , generated from zirconocene dimethyl compound , LnZrMe2 , and anilinium borate , [HNMe2Ph]+[B(C6F5)4] - , were used to polymerize 5-amino-1-pentenes and one 4-amino-1-butene with dimethyl , diethyl , diisopropyl , or diphenyl substitution pattern on nitrogen . the monomer 5-(N,N-diisopropylamino)-1-pentene showed the highest activity with Cp*2ZrMe2 / borate and wa used for all further investigation . the catalytic system Cp*2ZrMe2 / borate wa <nUm> time more active than the corresponding methylaluminoxane - based system and <nUm> time more active than the heterogeneous system , Cl3Ti / Al(i-Bu)3 . 1-Hexene and 5-(N,N-diisopropylamino)-1-pentene were polymerized with Cp*2ZrMe2 and rac-ethylenebis(tetrahydroindenyl) zirconium dimethyl , rac-EB(THI)-ZrMe2 . polymerization of both monomer with Cp*2ZrMe2 displayed similar activity . hexene polymerization with rac - EB(THI)ZrMe2 were <nUm> time more active than those with aminopentene . 5-(N,N-Diisopropylamino)-1-pentene polymerization gave rise to isotactic poly(aminopentene) with C2 symmetric catalyst , syndiotactic polymer with a Cs symmetric catalyst , and atactic polymer with achiral catalyst precursor . synthesis of " meso " - and " racemic " - like diastereomers of Me2Si(3-MeInd)(Ind)ZrCl2 ( <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ) wa achieved through either metathetical reaction between the dianion of Me2(3-MeIndH)-(IndH) ( 4 ) with Cl4Zr or via amine elimination reaction , followed by fractional crystallization . propylene polymerization using meso-5 in the presence of methyl aluminoxane under a variety of condition lead to the formation of low molecular weight , semicrystalline , low tacticity , poly(propylene) ( PP ) . the dominant chain transfer mechanism in this case is shown to involve b-H transfer to monomer . In contrast , rac-6 provides higher molecular weight , semicrystalline , elastomeric poly(propylene) ( elPP ) under a variety of condition ; chain transfer in this case involves , predominantly , b-H transfer to Zr . the property of elPP produced using catalyst <nUm> show a gradual change from a lightly , cross-linked elastomer to a poorly crystalline thermoplastic , depending on both polymer molecular weight and crystallinity a revealed by differential scanning calorimetry and tensile testing . In particular , more crystalline material exhibit a higher initial modulus , yielding behavior and lower strain to break than le crystalline material of equivalent molecular weight . these finding further define polymer property for the synthesis of flexible elastomer using this class of catalyst . the zirconocene complex CP2ZrMe2 and Cp*2ZrMe2 activated with BC18F15 initiate the carbocationic polymerization of isobutene and isobutene - isoprene copolymerizations to IIR rubber at temperature a high a <nUm> ° C . unlike conventional metal halide initiator , these metallocene - based initiator system produce both homo- and copolymer of broadly similar molecular weight . copolymer prepared in the presence of ca. <nUm> mol % isoprene show a diene incorporation rate of <nUm> - <nUm> % , with the typical 1,4-trans structure . comparison of the effectiveness of zirconocene dialkyls with that of the metallocene hydrolysis product Cp*2Zr(OH)2 and (Cp2ZrMe)2(m-O) in the presence of BC18F15 suggests that initiation by trace of proton is le efficient than initiation by cationic metallocene alkyl specie , while oxo-bridged complex (Cp'2ZrMe)2(m-O) / B(C6F 5)3 ( cp' = CH or C5H4SiMe3 ) are inactive . A possible rationalization of the dependence of regiospecificity of propene polymerization for catalytic system based on C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes ( and hafnocenes ) on the p-ligand alkyl substitution is presented . with this aim , model of preinsertion intermediate and transition state for primary and secondary monomer insertion reaction are compared through molecular mechanic analysis . the nonbonded energy contribution to the regioselectivity , a well a the enantioselectivities of regioregular and regioirregular insertion step have been investigated . nonbonded energy interaction are able to account for the increase of regiospecificity experimentally observed for zirconocene - based catalytic system when the p-ligands are alkyl substituted in position <nUm> or <nUm> a well a the decrease of regiospecificity observed when the p-ligands are dimethyl substituted in position <nUm> and <nUm> . the property of three elastomeric stereoblock polypropylene ( PP ) sample made with unbridged 2-phenylindene zirconocene catalyst were investigated . one of the characteristic of these catalyst is the ability to control the structure and property of the polypropylene by manipulation of the reaction condition . sample PP1 and PP2 were prepared to have similar tacticities ( a indicated by IR and NMR spectroscopy ) yet different molecular weight . the molecular weight of PP2 is approximately half the molecular weight of PP1 . sample PP3 ha a molecular weight similar that of PP2 but is lower in isotactic pentad content . all three sample were separated into fraction that differ in their solubility in boiling ether and heptane . the fractionation appeared to be governed by tacticity and molecular weight . thermal analysis by differential scanning calorimetry showed very broad melting endotherms . the broadness of the transition and the relatively large standard deviation calculated for the enthalpy of fusion are indicative of a multiphase material . x-ray powder diffraction pattern of the three sample and their fraction ( except the ether - soluble fraction ) all showed characteristic peak of the α crystalline phase . the heptane - insoluble fraction of both PP1 and PP2 also exhibited g-phase reflection , whereas in the heptane - soluble fraction , that reflection is le evident . tensile test performed on PP1 and PP2 yielded a similar tensile modulus for the two , indicating similar degree of crystallinity . PP1 exhibited better recovery property , a measured in test at <nUm> % and <nUm> % elongation . A kinetic model for chain propagation that can account for reaction order higher than one on monomer concentration , observed for several insertion polymerization , is discussed . this model is based on the presence of a ` single - center , two - state catalyst ' system , where the slower state is of lower energy and the interconversion rate between the two state is intermediate between the fast and slow propagation rate . this kinetic model fit available experimental data on polymerization rate , a a function of propene concentration , in the presence of zirconocene catalyst . different possibility for the chemical nature of the two catalyst state are discussed . the solid - state structure and physical behavior of an elastomeric polypropylene ( PP1 ) synthesized with unbridged 2-phenylindene zirconocene catalyst were examined using solid - state 13C NMR spectroscopy , differential scanning calorimetry , wide - angle x-ray powder diffraction , and birefringence measurement of relaxation behavior . extraction of these elastomeric polypropylene with boiling ether and heptane yielded three fraction of different molecular weight and tacticity . the ether - soluble fraction is the lowest in isotactic pentad content and exhibit no detectable crystallinity . for the other fraction and the parent homopolymer , the degree of crystallinity estimated from DSC and WAXD result are similar . the amount of the immobile phase determined by solid - state NMR , however , appears much higher than the degree of crystallinity . an increase in temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C result in a loss in the relative fraction of mobile and immobile phase a measured by solid - state NMR and a corresponding loss in the percent crystallinity a measured by DSC . the relaxation of polymer sample subjected to step shear a a function of increasing temperature wa investigated using polarized optical birefringence measurement . these study revealed that the elastic network remains stable up to temperature of <nUm> ° C . blend of atactic and isotactic polypropylene with similar average isotactic pentad content a PP1 and it heptane - insoluble fraction were examined in comparison . despite their similar taciticities and degree of crystallinity , the blend show no evidence of a network structure after being subjected to a step shear but instead relax back to an isotropic orientation . RHF / 3-21G ab initio , density functional theory ( B3LYP / 3-21G ) , and single - point calculation using an effective core potential ( B3LYP / 6-31G*-ECP(S) / / 3-21G ) are performed for different mechanism of polymerization of acrylic acid and methyl acrylate by dicyclopentadienyl-zirconocene enolate complex . polymerization is considered involving a cationic zirconocene complex and a neutral zirconocene complex , respectively . In addition , a mechanism proposed by collins is treated which involves a neutral and a cationic zirconocene complex in the CC bond - forming step at the same time . catalytic cycle can be devised in all case which suggest that all three mechanism may be realizable under suitable condition . however , the ' bimetallic ' mechanism proposed by collins show the lowest energy of activation for the propagation step . it is shown that bridging of the cyclopentadienyl ring should be important not only with respect to reactivity but also with respect to the possible catalytic cycle . methyl methacrylate is not included in the treatment ; i.e. , the problem of tacticity in these polymerization is not addressed . an experiment wa conducted to show the presence of ethylene a catalyst reactivator in the propene - styrene copolymerization . the copolymerizations have been performed by bubbling the gaseous monomer at atmospheric pressure into a flask containing a styrene solution of the prototypical ansa - zirconocene complex rac-(ethylene)bis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride activated by methylalumoxane . In structure A one tertiary carbon atom bearing the phenyl ring is surrounded in both side by sequence of two methylene group while in structure B the junction is characterized by the presence of two tertiary carbon atom bearing the phenyl ring separated by three methylene group . by reducing the styrene content in the comonomer feed composition ( [E] / [P] / [S] ) <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> in the liquid phase ) a copolymer with a <nUm> % styrene unit is obtained . the result reported show that it is possible to introduce some styrene unit in an isotactic polypropylene sequence by using a small amount of ethylene to reactivate the catalyst after the styrene insertion . the synthesis and polymerization behavior of a new C1 - symmetric bridged indenyl-fluorenyl zirconocene dimethylsilylene [9-fluorenyl][(2,4,7-trimethyl)indenyl]zirconium dichloride ( 5 ) is reported . the complex when activated by MAO wa found to polymerize ethylene and propylene , although the activity and stereoselectivity of <nUm> for propylene were found to be lower than for the previously prepared ethylene-bridged analogue <nUm> and several other ethylene-bridged precursor . it ha been found that , depending on both the substitution pattern on the indenyl ligand and the nature of the bridge in this series of asymmetric zirconocenes , polypropylene with varying microstructures from aspecific to highly isospecific are obtained . the propylene polymerization behavior of the new complex ha been studied in detail , and the mechanistic aspect of polymerization are discussed . various technique were applied to study thermoplastic elastomeric polypropylene derived from oscillating bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconocene in order to provide information on the morphology of this stereoblock polymer . multiple melting fraction in the differential scanning calorimetry scan of thermally fractionated sample characterized the polydispersity of the crystallizable block length . crystal morphology of these material and their change during and after tensile extension were observed using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . In addition , AFM and acid digestion study provided estimated of the crystallizable sequence length in these elastomer . polymerization of 1-hexene or 1-octene under high pressure ( 100-1000 MPa ) wa investigated using permethylated ansa - metallocenes / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) a catalyst system . besides the known zirconocene complex ( <nUm> , Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)2ZrCl2 ) , dialkylsilyene- and dimethyl-germylene-bridged hafnocene dichloride , R2E(e5-C5Me4)2HfCl2 ( <nUm> , r = me , e = Si ; <nUm> , r = et , e = Si ; <nUm> , r = vinyl , e = Si ; <nUm> , r = me , e = Ge ) , were synthesized and structurally characterized . the catalytic activity of the ansa - metallocenes wa remarkably enhanced under high pressure despite their very congested structure . poly(1-hexene) with unprecedented high molecular weight such a mw = <nUm> × <nUm> ( mw / Mn = <nUm> , by GPC ) wa obtained under <nUm> MPa with <nUm> . study on termination reaction revealed that the bimolecular chain - transfer process ( b-hydrogen transfer to olefin ) is much accelerated under <nUm> MPa in <nUm> , while b-hydrogen elimination to metal is still major termination process in <nUm> . this indicated that two complex that have same structure but central metal showed quite different high - pressure effect . Cp2ZrCl2 is presented a both an effective photoinitiator and additive for radical photopolymerization reaction in aerated condition . this compound is characterized by remarkable property : ( i ) an efficiency higher than that of a reference type I photoinitiator ( 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone , DMPA ) , ( ii ) an excellent ability , when added to DMPA , to overcome the oxygen inhibition of the polymerization , and ( iii ) a never reported in situ photoinduced and oxygen - mediated formation of zirconium - based nanoparticles ( diameter ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> nm ) . the photochemical property of Cp2ZrCl2 are investigated by steady state photolysis and electron spin resonance ( ESR ) experiment . the high reactivity of this compound is ascribed to a bimolecular homolytic substitution H2S ( clearly characterized by molecular orbital calculation ) which convert the peroxyls into new polymerization - initiating radical and oxygenated Zr - based nanoparticles . ( matrix presented ) the zirconocene - catalyzed enantioselective methylalumination of terminal alkene is greatly accelerated in the presence of water . terminal olefin that are inert under the standard condition can be readily methylated in good yield and with good to high enantioselectivities . furthermore , methylaluminoxane is also shown to accelerate the reaction , albeit at a lesser rate .

A new regio- and stereoselective zirconocene - catalyzed reaction for the synthesis of medium - sized ring is described . the global reaction supposes a formal ring expansion of a cyclic enol ether to give a functionalized carbocycle . trimeric diphenylanthracene macrocycles were synthesized via the zirconocene - mediated coupling of 9,10-bis-[4-trimethylsilyl(ethynyl)phenyl] anthracene . the macrocycles feature a strained architecture due to orientation of the anthracene unit into the plane of the macrocycle . the demetalated cyclophane exhibit a considerably higher flexibility in solution , while the zirconocene - containing macrocycle is quite rigid . ( figure presented ) A one - pot synthesis of pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyridazine derivative via zirconocene - mediated four - component coupling of one Si - tethered diyne , two nitrile , and one azide is reported . when TMSN3 wa used , pyrrole-2,3-diones were formed in good yield . further condensation of these highly functionalized pyrrole-2,3-diones with hydrazine and hydroxylamine afforded useful pyrrole - fused heterocycle . stereoselective synthesis of the northern and the southern fragment <nUm> and <nUm> of leupyrrin A1 are reported . the convergent preparation of <nUm> is highlighted by a zirconocene - mediated one - pot cyclization - regioselective opening of an advanced diyne while the route to <nUm> involves a krische allylation and a one - pot sharpless dihydroxylation-cyclization . comparison of the spectroscopic data with those reported for the natural product support a relative stereochemical assignment within these heterocycle . ( chemical equation presented ) A new , mild , one - pot method for the synthesis of cyclobutabenzenes by the zirconium - promoted cross-coupling reaction of aryllithium compound and alkenyl bromide is reported . formation of an arynezirconocene complex and it regioselective coupling with an alkenyl bromide are the key step of the process . this method allows the regio- and diastereoselective synthesis of functionalized cyclobutabenzene derivative from simple and easily available starting material . heating grey selenium with [e5-C5H4(t-Bu)]2Zr(C6H4(p-OCH3))2in boiling octane affords the diselenophenylenezirconocene complex containing a methoxy group in the ortho position . A similar reaction , although le selective , occurs when starting from [e5-C5H4(t-Bu)]2Zr-(C6H4(p-CH3))2 . the structure of the diselenophenylenezirconocenes obtained were confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and definitively proved by comparison with the authentic orthosubstituted derivative prepared from the corresponding methyl-o-anisyl- and methyl-o-tolylzirconocene . the mechanism proposed to explain this transformation involves the activation of a tert-butyl C — H bond by a transient benzynezirconocene specie . the cyclometalation product , which is obtained by heating the diphenylzirconocene , reacts toward selenium and unsaturated organic compound like the benzynezirconocene but the reaction take place at room temperature . the cyclometalation pathway allows a more sterically hindered selenium - containing derivative [e5-C5H4(t-Bu)]2ZrSe2C6H3(o,o'-(CH3)2) to be prepared . the new diselenophenylenezirconocenes described are good precursor to generate benzodiselenagermoles and related spiro compound by a zirconium - germanium transmetalation reaction . all the new product synthesized , zirconocene complex and cyclometalated derivative , benzodiselenagermoles , and spirobisbenzodiselenagermoles , were identified by the multinuclear NMR method and mass spectrometry . the structure of the cyclometalated product [e5-C5H4(t-Bu)]Zr[(2,5-(CH3)2C6H3)(e1:e5-CH2C(CH3)2C5H4)] wa determined by x-ray diffraction analysis . this compound crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21 / c with two molecule per asymmetric unit with cell dimension a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , and β = <nUm> ° at <nUm> K . least - square refinement led to a value for the final r index of <nUm> for <nUm> reflection with I > 2s(I) . the titanium and zirconium complex ( e5- C5H5)2M(OAr)2 ( m = Ti , Zr ; Ar = C6H5 , p-MeOC6H4 , p-MeC6H4,p-ClC6H4 , p-CNC6H4 are shown to be convenient , stable precursor of dehydrocoupling catalyst . their reaction with a primary silane , at <nUm> ° C or below , generate active catalyst for RSiH3 dehydrocoupling at <nUm> ° C . all - electron RHF and RMP2 ab initio calculation with split valence basis set of double- and triple-x quality have been used to study reaction path for the reaction of acetylene ( 1 ) with the model compound Cl2ZrH+ ( 2 ) and Cl2ZrCH3+ ( 3 ) . At the RMP2 / / RHF level the insertion process is calculated to have a barrier of <nUm> ( 2 ) and <nUm> kcal / mol ( 3 ) with respect to complexed acetylene and to be <nUm> ( 2 ) and <nUm> kcal / mol ( 3 ) exothermic with respect to free acetylene . the transition state ( TS ) are four membered cycle . the product and TS of Cl2ZrCH3(C2H2)+ are stabilized through an agostic interaction . the calculated energetics of the reaction path are compared with available theoretical a well a experimental data for insertion of unsaturated hydrocarbon into metal — r ( r = H , CH3 ) σ bond . on the basis of extended huckel calculation a MO picture of the insertion path is provided for the reaction of acetylene with Cp2ZrH+ and Cp2ZrCH3+ . the crystal and molecular structure of the C2 symmetric rac-(EBI)ZrCl2(1r) [ monoclinic , space group I2 / c , no. <nUm> , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° ] and of it meso isomer ( <nUm> m ) [ monoclinic , space group P21 / n , no. <nUm> , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° ] have been solved . 1r is in the indenyl-forward ( ∏ ) conformation , a is the case for most of the chiral ansa ethylene-bridged bisindenyl-type metallocenes . In solution however , already at room temperature there is a rapid ( NMR time scale ) interconversion between the two ∏ and Y ( indenyl-backward ) conformation , a shown by conformational analysis on the proton spectrum of the bridge methylene . this equilibrium is shifted toward the lower energy conformation δ at lower temperature and is influenced by both the solvent and the s-ligands . the solid state structure of <nUm> m show that this meso form is actually in a chiral conformation ( C1 symmetry ) because of the staggered placement of the two indenyl ligand ( Ind[?]Ind = <nUm> ° ) . In solution this aspecific zirconocene give a perfectly symmetric 1H NMR spectrum , indicating that , a in the case of the rac - isomer , there is a rapid interconversion between the two equienergetic , mirrorimage limit conformation . it ha been shown that a nickel(0) complex of bis(trimethylsilyl)butadiyne , (Ph3P)2Ni(e2-Me3SiC ≡ CC ≡ CSiMe3 ) , readily reacts with the titanocene Cp2Ti(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) and zirconocene Cp2Zr(THF)(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) complex to form the heterobimetallic , doubly acetylide bridged complex Cp2M(m-e1:e2-C ≡ CSiMe3)Ni(PPh3)(m-e1:e2-C ≡ CSiMe3 ) ( m = Ti ( 1 ) , m = Zr ( 2 ) ) . the structure of these complex have been established by x-ray crystal structure analysis . two s,p-bridging acetylide unit are a-bonded to different metal and p-bonded to the second metal . compound <nUm> in solution at <nUm> K is highly fluxional . an NMR study showed that at <nUm> K an equilibrium exists between one isomer with two nonequivalent and another isomer with two equivalent acetylide unit . the cleavage of the central C-C single bond of the butadiyne wa not observed in the reaction of the unsymmetrically substituted butadiyne PhC ≡ CC ≡ CSiMe3with titanocene “ Cp2Ti ” generator Cp2Ti(Me3SiC = CSiMe3 ) . the product is a bridging tetradehydro-(1-3-e):(2-4-e)-trans,transbutadiene unit ( zigzag butadiyne ) between two titanium center in Cp2Ti{m-(1-3-e):(2-4-e)-trans,trans-PhC ≡ CC ≡ CSiMe3}TiCp2(5) . if the phenyl(trimethylsilyl)butadiyne is complexed by nickel(0) , the reaction with the titanocene generated from Cp2Ti(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) yield the heterobimetallic complex Cp2Ti(m-e1:e2-C ≡ CSiMe3)(m-e1:e2-C ≡ CPh)Ni(PPh3) ( 6 ) . both acetylide unit are s-bonded to the titanium atom and p-bonded to the nickel atom , giving a “ tweezerlike ” structure . the titanocene and zirconocene derivative Cp2Ti(Me3SiC2SiMe3) and Cp2Zr(pyridine)(Me3SiC2SiMe3) generate under mild condition unstable metallocenes “ CP2M ” , which react in situ with two molecule of the ketimine HN = CPh2 to form metallocene amido alkylideneamido complex Cp2M(NH — CHPh2)(N = CPh2 ) ( m = Ti ( 1 ) , Zr ( 2 ) ) by hydrogen transfer of the ketimine moiety . by C-C coupling of two aldimine molecule PhN = CHPh , “ zirconocene ” affords the cyclic diamido complex ( 3 ) . the structure of the product have been established by x-ray structure analysis . pinacolborane ( <nUm> equiv ) hydroborates both terminal and internal alkyne , in the presence of <nUm> mol % zirconocene chloride hydride ( HZrCp2Cl ) at <nUm> ° C , in excellent yield and with excellent regio- and stereoselectivity . without HZrCp2Cl and under otherwise identical condition , hydroboration proceeds to an extent of only 2-20 % . the functionalized (fluoroaryl)borate salt Ph3C+B(C6F4TBS)4 - and Ph3C+B(C6F4TIPS)4 - ( TBS = tBuMe2Si ; TIPS = iPr3Si ) are prepared in three step from 1,4-HC6F4Br , reaction with zirconocene dimethyls yield crystalline , thermally stable , soluble L2ZrCH3 +B-(C6F4SiR3)4 - and L'2ZrH+B(C6SiR3)4 - salt ( L = e5-C5H5 ; e5-1,2-Me2C5H3 ; L ' = e-Me5C5 ) which function a highly active ethylene polymerization catalyst . the reaction of the ansa - titanocene dichloride [(e5-C5H5R1)(e5-C5H5R2)SiMeR3]TiCl2(1a , R1 = R2 = H , R3 = me ; 1b , R1 = H , R2 = SiMe3 , R3 = me ; 1c , R1 = R2 = SiMe3 , R3 = ph ) with <nUm> equiv of CLi ≡ CSiMe3 ( 2 ) yield the bis(alkynyl) ansa - titanocenes [(e5-C5H5R1)(e5-C5H5R2)SiMeR3]Ti(C ≡ CSiMe3)2(3a , R1 = R2 = H , R3 = me ; 3b , R1 = H , R2 = SiMe3 , R3 = me ; 3c , R1 = R2 = SiMe3 , R3 = ph ) . these compound react with Ni(CO)4(4) to afford { [(e5-C5H3R1)(e5-C5H3R2)SiMeR3]Ti(C ≡ CSiMe3)2}Ni(CO) ( 5a , R1 = R2 = H , R3 = me ; 5b , R1 = H , R2 = SiMe3 , R3 = me ; 5c , R1 = R2 = SiMe3 , R3 = ph ) in high yield . compound 5a-c contain a low - valent nickel-monocarbonyl fragment , which is stabilized by the chelating effect of both alkynyl ligand of <nUm> . In contrast , the ansa - zirconocene dichloride [(e5-C5H4)(e5-C5H3SiMe3)SiMe2]ZrCl2(6) lead with <nUm> equiv of CLi ≡ CSiMe3(2) to a variety of reaction product , of which the s,e2-doubly alkynyl-bridged dinuclear zirconocene { [(e5-C5H4)(e5-C5H3SiMe3)SiMe2]Zr(C ≡ CSiMe3)}2(7) can be crystallized . compound <nUm> can be synthesized in much better yield by reacting <nUm> first with CLi ≡ CSiMe3 and secondly with n-butyllithium ; a possible mechanism for the formation of <nUm> will be discussed . In <nUm> the alkynyl ligand act both a s-and p-donors . compound <nUm> contains two formal ZrIII center . the x-ray structure analysis of lb , 3a , and <nUm> are reported . crystal of 1b and 3a are monoclinic , space group P21 / n ( lb ) and P21 / a ( 3a ) : 1b , cell constant a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> ; 3a , cell constant a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . complex <nUm> crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1 with the cell constant a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . the property of the MeRSi - bridged titanocenes <nUm> and <nUm> in comparison to the appropriate unbridged specie are discussed . the tilt caused by the one - atom interannular bridge in a zirconocene unit in <nUm> imposed at bis(e6-benzene)vanadium ( 3* ) is very small . As judged from EPR spectroscopy , the electronic structure of 3* is virtually unaffected by zircona[1]vanadocyclophane formation . the novel binuclear complex are very robust thermally but quite labile chemically . the latter property precludes a thorough electrochemical study of metal — metal interaction in 7* . the reaction of main - group ( B , Al , and Ga ) alkoxides with zirconocene complex of benzynes wa used to prepare novel zirconium - group <nUm> heterobimetallic compound [R2E-(m-OR')(m-l,2-aryl)Zr(e5-C5H5)2] [ e = B , r = et , r ' = me , aryl = phenyl ( 1 ) ; e = B , r = me , r ' = et , aryl = phenyl ( 2 ) ; e = B , r = et , r ' = me , aryl = 3-methoxyphenyl ( 3 ) ; e = Al , r = et , r ' = et , aryl = phenyl ( 5 ) ; e = Ga , r = me , r ' = me , aryl = 3-methoxyphenyl ( 6 ) ] and [(EtO)2B(m-l,2-naphthyl)Zr(e5-C5H5)2(OEt)] ( 4 ) . complex <nUm> and <nUm> have been characterized by x-ray crystallography . compound <nUm> contains a dative bond from an oxygen lone pair of the methoxy ligand on the zirconium to an acceptor p-orbital on the boron atom ( 11B NMR ; δ <nUm> ppm ) . In contrast , the weakly lewis acidic boron center in <nUm> ( 11B NMR ; δ <nUm> ppm ) doe not show a bonding interaction between the alkoxy ligand on the zirconocene fragment and the boron center . the synthesis of a variety of nonbridged optically active C2- and C1 - symmetric titanocenes and zirconocenes is reported together with a detailed investigation of the ability of these complex to effect the catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of 2-phenyl-1-butene and 2-(a-naphthyl)-1-butene . the respective dihydro product are shown to be produced with enantiomeric excess ranging from <nUm> % to <nUm> % . the absolute configuration of these 2-arylbutanes wa noted to be sensitive to the three - dimensional characteristic of the particular bicyclo - fused ligand involved . for a series of verbenone - related metallocenes , an increase in the size of a substituent positioned a and syn to the metal center wa found to be unfavorable for stereoinduction . this phenomenon ha been rationalized in transition state term , with the alkene approaching laterally to engage in hydrogen atom transfer . the three - dimensional stereochemical model advanced in explanation of the observed catalytic selectivity underscore the development of steric bias during olefin coordination to the reactive metal hydride intermediate . tandem mass spectrometry method were used to assign the structure of C10H10Zr*+ ion produced by electron impact ionization of C12H16Zr and [(C5H5)2ZrO]2 . the result were consistent with the formation of the zirconocenium radical - cation . the neutralization - reionization mass spectrum of this specie showed a recovery signal , indicating that neutral monomeric zirconocene had been generated in the gas phase . the formation of η <nUm> -imine-zirconocene complex ( zirconaziridines ) ( cp <nUm> Zr(NR <nUm> CR <nUm> r <nUm> ) by elimination of r <nUm> H from cp <nUm> Zr(R <nUm> )(NR <nUm> CHR <nUm> r <nUm> ) ha been investigated with regard to the variation in r <nUm> , r <nUm> , r <nUm> , and r <nUm> , in particular by making use of hammett type structure / rate correlation ( r <nUm> , r <nUm> , r <nUm> = p-XC <nUm> H <nUm> , x = me <nUm> N , MeO , H , Cl , CO <nUm> me ; r <nUm> , ρ = <nUm> ; r <nUm> , ρ = <nUm> ; r <nUm> , = − <nUm> ) . the elimination is first order in the zirconocene complex , ha a deuterium isotope effect for the hydrogen eliminated of <nUm> at <nUm> ° C , and kinetic study on cp <nUm> Zr(Me)(NPhCHMe <nUm> ) give the activation parameter DH ‡ = <nUm> kJ mol − <nUm> and DS ‡ = − <nUm> J K − <nUm> mol − <nUm> for the elimination of methane . A cyclometalation involving deprotonation a to nitrogen by ( r <nUm> ) - best fit the data . the relationship between the rate of the reaction and the structure of the amine show a marked dependency on both electronic and steric effect ranging between no reaction after <nUm> h at <nUm> ° C for piperidine to below room temperature for silylamines and benzylanilines . for the first time η <nUm> -imine complex have been formed even from simple amine such a dibutylamine and trapped with an alkyne to form secondary allylic amine on workup . In the absence of a trap η <nUm> -(PhN = CMe <nUm> )ZrCp <nUm> rearranges via a rapidly reversible hydride shift to afford a η <nUm> -azaallylzirconocene hydride . (2-Methylcyclopenta[l]phenanthryl)2ZrCl2 and (2-phenylcyclopenta[l]phenanthryl)2ZrCl2 were synthesized and used , after activation with MAO , a catalyst for the polymerization of propene . the resulting polymer had low isotacticities ( 8-18 % [mmmm] ) . ligand rotation barrier for the corresponding zr-dibenzyl derivative were determined by dynamic NMR spectroscopy . pathway and transition state for ligand rotation in this series of complex were studied by molecular - mechanic calculation and are discussed in relation to the microstructure of the respective polymer product . the zirconocene e2-formaldehyde dimer <nUm> reacts with trialkylchlorosilanes R3SiCl ( r = ethyl , methyl , isopropyl ) to yield the (e2-(trialkylsiloxy)methyl)zirconocene chloride complex cp2- Zr(Cl)CH2OSiR3 ( 7a-c ) . these complex exhibit internal o-coordination ; they belong to a metallaoxirane structural type . thermolysis of 7b,c at <nUm> ° C lead to equilibration with the isomer 8b,c and 9b,c . complex <nUm> are the acyclic Cp2Zr(Cl)CH2OSiR3 isomer of <nUm> , whereas dyotropic rearrangement ha resulted in the formation of the Cp2Zr(Cl) OCH2SiR3 product <nUm> . the kinetics of the thermally induced rearrangement of 7b ( r = CH3 ) is described by a 8b ⇌ 7b → 9b kinetic scheme . At <nUm> ° C the k(8b ⇌ 7b ) equilibrium constant is <nUm> . the gibbs activation energy of the 7b → 8b isomerization at <nUm> ° C is DG ‡ isom(383 K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 . the activation barrier of the 7b -9b transformation is in the expected range of a concerted dyotropic rearrangement process at DG ‡ dyo(383 K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 . treatment of <nUm> with triphenylchlorosilane ha resulted in the direct formation of the acyclic addition product Cp2Zr(Cl)CH2OSiPh3 ( 8d ) . our study underline the important participation of metallaoxirane type structure in dyotropic rearrangement system . two general synthetic route for the preparation of ethylene-bridged ansa - zirconocene dichloride rac-[1-(e5-Cp1)-1-R1-2-(e5-Cp2)-2-R2-C2H2]ZrCl2 ( 6a-c ) bearing different cyclopentadienyl fragment [ Cp1,Cp2 = cp ( cyclopentadienyl ) , ind ( indenyl ) , flu ( fluorenyl ) ] and a variable bridge substitution pattern ( R1 , R2 = H , ph ) are described , using chiral epoxides a starting material . diastereomeric complex were separated by crystallization . the solidstate structure of two representative example are reported . In combination with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , rac-[1-(e5-9-fluorenyl)-2-(e5-1-indenyl)ethane]ZrCl2 ( 6a ) , carrying no bulky bridge substituent , and the diastereomeric system rac-[1- (e5-9-fluorenyl)-1(R,S)-phenyl-2-(e5-1(R,S)-indenyl)ethane]ZrCl2 ( 6b1 = RR,SS ; 6b2 = RS,SR ) , showing different bridge conformation , were used for propene polymerization . the stereoselectivity depends on monomer concentration for all three unsymmetric catalyst . under comparable condition 6a and 6b <nUm> produce polypropene with significantly different stereoregularities . this demonstrates the importance of a defined bridge conformation for the design of highly stereoselective catalyst . page <nUm> . figure <nUm> and the text should reflect that the distance between the Zr atom and ha in 6b and 7b ha been calculated to be <nUm> Å for 6b and <nUm> Å for 7b . the distance between and Zr amount to <nUm> Å for 6b and <nUm> A for 7b . synthesis of rac-[((1,2,3,4-tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene-1,4-diyl)germylene)bis(1-e5-indenyl)]dichlorozirconium ( 1 ) wa achieved with substantial suppression of the undesired meso diastereomer a predicted by MM2 force field calculation . the corresponding zirconocenium ion of <nUm> polymerizes propylene with high catalytic activity and stereospecificity to very high molecular weight . the characteristic of this catalysis are essentially independent of polymerization temperature over a broad temperature range . the synthesis of seven new bridged zirconocenes is described , which make isotactic polypropylene when used in polymerization of propylene with methylaluminoxane a cocatalyst . their polymerization behavior in propylene and ethylene polymerization is examined and discussed . aromatic substituents in appropriate position of the zirconocene ligand frame result in catalyst with activity , stereospecificities , and polypropylene molecular weight much higher than those of any previously described metallocene system . by structure variation it is demonstrated that the effectiveness of these substitution strongly depends on their position and on a nonincremental synergism with alkyl substituents on the ligand frame . the high activity of the system can be explained well by electronic effect , whereas steric effect obviously play the more important role for the high stereospecificities and high molecular weight of the polymer . the dimethylsilyl-bridged zirconocene complex (CH3)2Si(benz[e]indenyl)2ZrCl2 ( I ) and (CH3)2Si(2-methylbenz[e]indenyl)2ZrCl2 ( II ) have been synthesized ; the structure of II wa determined by x-ray diffraction . complex I is about <nUm> time more active in polymerizing propene than it bis(indenyl) analog when activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) under otherwise identical condition . the resulting catalyst system polymerizes also the g-branched olefin 3-methyl-1-butene and 3-methyl-1-pentene . polymer produced with complex II have molecular weight about <nUm> time higher than those obtained with complex I under identical condition . the a-methyl substituents of II appear to block those chain termination which arise from b-H transfer directly to a coordinated monomer molecule . treatment of the zirconocene terminal imido complex (CpR)2ZrqqNtBu(THF) ( 1a-THF : r = H ; 1b-TNF : r = me ) with acetylene result in the formation of a dinuclear product , [(CpR)2Zr]2(m-CHCHNtBu)(m-NtBu) ( 3a , r = H ; 3b , r = me ) , in which the zirconium center are bridged by nitrogen and carbon . upon heating , the dinuclear complex <nUm> is cleaved into the azametallacyclobutene (CpR)2Zr(e2-NtBuCHCH) ( 4 ) and the terminal imido complex (CpR)2ZrqqNtBu ( 1 ) , which can be trapped with lewis base or alkyne . heating <nUm> in the absence of trap cleanly produce the alkynyl-bridged specie [(CpR)2ZrNHtBu]2(m-CqqC) ( 5 ) . kinetic data indicate that the dinuclear complex <nUm> fragment into the mononuclear specie <nUm> and <nUm> prior to C-H activation to form <nUm> . the x-ray structure of [Cp2Zr]2(m-CHCHNtBu)-(m-NtBu) ( 3a ) and [Cp2ZrNHtBu]2(m-CqqC) ( 5a ) are reported ; the structure of the dinuclear specie [(Cp2Zr)((CpMe)2Zr)](m-CHCHNtBu)(m-NtBu) ( 3c ) is included in the supporting information . A mixture of Cp2Zr(PMe3) complex of cycloheptadienyne ( 5a-c ) ha been prepared . hydride abstraction from the mixture gave the first example of a zirconium complex of tropyne . reaction of 5a-c with , 2-butyne followed by hydride abstraction gave the first example of a transition - metal metallacycle with the π framework of an azulene . the use of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane , BC18F15 , a a cocatalyst in the dehydrocoupling of phenylsilane , in the presence of zirconocene - derived catalyst , lead to suppression of chain scission reaction and to an increase in polysilane chain length ( Mn > <nUm> ) . an exhaustive multinuclear NMR study of the catalytic specie lead to the conclusion that they are zirconocene - ( IV ) hydride bridged dimer , with a “ cation - like ” silylium ligand on each zirconium : [Cp2Zr(SiHPh)(m-H)]2[Bu2(C6F5)2B]2 . the synthesis of the Zr primary phosphido complex Cp2Zr(PH(C6H2-2,4,6-t-Bu3))Cl ( 1 ) and Cp2Zr(PH(C6H2-2,4,6-Me3))Cl ( 2 ) from the appropriate LiPHR and <nUm> equiv of Cp2ZrCl2 are described . In reaction of PH2(C6H2-2,4,6-Me3) or PH2SiMe3 with Cp2ZrHCl , the respective bridging - phosphinidene derivative (Cp2ZrCl)2(m2-PC6H2-2,4,6-Me3) ( 3 ) and Cp2Zr(m2-PSiPh3)(m2-e1:e5-C5H4)ZrCpCl ( 4 ) are obtained . these product are planar at phosphorus , indicative of Zr – P p-bonding . reaction of PH(C6H2-2,4,6-t-Bu3) with excess Cp2ZrHCl result in the formation of the planar , trinuclear phosphide complex (Cp2Zr)2(m2-Cl)(m3-P)(ZrCp2Cl) ( 5 ) . this specie <nUm> is also generated from the addition of PH(C6H2-2,4,6-t-Bu3) to a mixture of Cp2ZrCl2 and Mg . the mixed - valent product <nUm> is paramagnetic , exhibiting an EPR spectrum typical of Zr(III)-P specie . under similar reaction condition , but with prolonged exposure to Mg , the diamagnetic phosphide derivative (CpZr(m2-e1:e5-C5H4))3(m3-P) ( 6 ) is obtained .

In particular , the structural data for the Zr (III) specie are considered in light of recent postulate of “ super-long ” metalmetal bonding in related zirconocene dimer . some of the discussion is supported by the result of fenske - hall and extended huckel molecular orbital calculation . this paper outline the generation of the transient monomeric imido complex Cp2ZrNR ( 1a – e ) , their successful trapping with unsaturated organic molecule and dative ligand , and their use in activating C — H bond . the generation of Cp2ZrNR ha been accomplished by thermolysis of the alkyl amide Cp2Zr(NHR)(R') ( 2a – d ) and bis(amides) Cp2Zr(NHR)2 ( 3a – c ) via a-abstraction of alkane and amine , respectively . the imido intermediate 1a , generated from alkyl amide 2a ( r = 4-tert-butylphenyl , R' = me ) in THF , resulted in the formation of the bridging imido dimer 4a in <nUm> % yield . In contrast , the generation of intermediate 1b – d ( 1b r = tert-Bu ; 1c r = 2,6-dimethylphenyl ; 1d r = Si(CMe3)Me2 ) under similar condition furnished the monomeric imido THF complex 5b – d in <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> % yield . imido dimer 4a and monomer 5b were characterized crystallographically . the THF ligand of 5b – d are weakly bound , a demonstrated by the exchange of bound and free THF in 5c on the NMR time scale and by facile substitution of Ph3PO for THF in 5b , giving the triphenylphosphine oxide adduct Cp2Zr(NCMe3)(OPPh3) ( 6b ) . thermolysis of the alkyl amide 2b and 2d at <nUm> – <nUm> ° C in benzene resulted in the addition of the C — H bond of benzene across the Zr — N linkage to provide the phenyl amide 7b and 7d . similarly , the THF adduct 5b reacted with benzene under the same condition to give the C — H activation product 7b . the imido intermediate Cp2ZrNR undergo cycloaddition reaction with a variety of unsaturated organic compound . In addition to formation of azametallacyclobutenes ( e.g. , 8b , 8c , 9c , 10b ) from alkyne , certain olefin react with cp2 - ZrNR to give azametallacyclobutanes . thus , upon reaction of norbornene or ethylene with imido complex 5b an equilibrium mixture of 5b , free olefin , free THF , and the metallacycles 12b and 13b , respectively , were observed . addition of a large excess of norbornene shifted the equilibrium almost entirely to the azametallacyclobutane 12b and facilitated it isolation . the structure of 12b wa determined after crystallization from hexamethyldisiloxane . complex 5b also reacted with benzophenone and tert-butyl isocyanate to provide the tert-butylimine of benzophenone and di-tert-butylcarbodiimide in <nUm> and <nUm> % yield , respectively . monomer 5b reacted with tert-butyl isocyanide to provide the coupling / trapping product Cp2Zr-(N(CMe3)CNCMe3)(CNCMe3) ( 16 ) , while reaction of 5b with isobutene oxide gave the epoxideopened product Cp2Zr(NHCMe3)(OCH2C(Me)CH2) ( 17 ) . finally , heating the alkyl amide Cp2Zr(NHCHPh2)(CH2CH2CMe3) ( 2e ) ( which contains hydrogen both α and β to nitrogen ) with diphenylacetylene yielded the azametallacyclobutene product formed via a-abstraction in <nUm> % yield . zirconocene and hafnocene complex such a CP <nUm> MH <nUm> and cp <nUm> M(Cl)H ( m = Zr or Hf ) were found to catalyze efficiently the selective dimerization of aldehyde to ester under mild condition . hafnocene complex exhibited higher activity than the corresponding zirconocene complex , while titanocene complex were inert in the present reaction . the reaction wa found to be markedly influenced by the structure of the aldehyde used . cross-dimerization could be achieved by allowing cp <nUm> HZr <nUm> or cp <nUm> ClHZr to react with two different aldehyde whose reactivity are slightly different from each other . the result of ab initio RHF and RMP2 geometry optimization on the model compound of the postulated intermediate in ziegler – natta catalysis Cl2ZrCH2CH3+ ( 3 ) and Cl2ZrCH-CH2+ ( 4 ) and for comparison on three neutral complex Cl2Zr(X)CH = CH2 , x = H ( 5 ) , CH3 ( 6 ) , Cl ( 7 ) , show that these specie are stabilized through a three - center 2-electron Zr – Hb-C interaction . In <nUm> – <nUm> this interaction is regiospecific and take place either ci ( 5a ) or trans ( 6b , 7b ) to the Zr – x bond , depending on the steric repulsion between x and hb . the examination of the potential energy surface on the basis of extended huckel calculation on substituted specie Cp2ZrC(R1)-CH(R2)+ , R1 = SiMe3 ( 8 ) , CMe3 ( 9 ) and R2 = H ( a ) , me ( b ) , H3Si ( c ) , CMe3 ( d ) , SiMe3 ( e ) , ph ( f ) , reveals that <nUm> and <nUm> can be stabilized through either g-Si ( C ) – C or b-CH agostic interaction , depending on the subtle balance between the electronic and steric effect on R1 and R2 . to expand the availability of transition - metal aldehyde complex for study , a new method for their synthesis ha been developed . our first application of this method ha been to the synthesis of zirconocene e2-aldehyde complex . proceeding through a-stannylalkoxide intermediate ( M-OCHR-SnMe3 ) , this route provides ready access to both neutral and anionic complex under mild condition . the first x-ray structure of an anionic aldehyde complex is reported . the neutral complex dimerize producing meso and racemic diastereomers . monomeric zirconaoxiranes are shown to be excluded from the reaction coordinate during insertion and isomerization reaction of these neutral complex .

A new silicon - bridged [1][1]zirconocenophane , (SiMe2)2(e5- C5H3)2Zr(NEt2)2 ( 3a ) , wa synthesized by reaction of Zr(NEt2)4 with (C5H4)2(SiMe2)2 ( 4 ) . single - crystal x-ray diffraction revealed a highly tilted structure with an angle of <nUm> ° , a significant increase over the untethered compound (e5-MeC5H4)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , which posse a tilt angle of <nUm> ° . this and the related compound (SiMe2)(e5-C5H4)2 MCl2 ( 1a , m = Ti ; 1b , m = Zr ) and (SiMe2)2(e5-C5 H3)2ZrCl2 ( 3b ) were tested for transition - metal catalyzed ROP behavior in the presence of pt(0) catalyst but were found to be inactive . the novel spirocyclic silacyclobutane - bridged monomer (CH2)3Si(e5-C5 H4)2ZrCl2 ( 7b ) wa prepared via a " fly trap " amine elimination reaction between cyclotrimethylenedicyclopentadienylsilane ( 8 ) and Zr(NMe2)4 ; this initially yielded (CH2)3Si(e5-C5 H4)2Zr(NMe2)2 ( 7a ) , which wa converted to 7b by reaction with a slight excess of Me3SiCl . 7a and 7b were characterized by 29Si , 13C , and 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry a well a single - crystal x-ray diffraction . both showed moderate tilt angle ( <nUm> ° and <nUm> ° , respectively ) a well a highly strained silacyclobutane ring with C-Si-C bond angle of <nUm> ° and <nUm> ° , respectively . transition - metal - catalyzed ROP of 7b led to the formation of the polycarbosilane [ (CH2)3Si(e5-C5 H4)2ZrCl2]n ( 10 ) . both the soluble and insoluble fraction of <nUm> were characterized by CP - MAS 29Si and 13C NMR , and the soluble , oligomeric fraction wa further characterized by solution 29Si , 13C , and 1H NMR . complex 7a , 7b , and polyzirconocene <nUm> were found to exhibit moderate activity a ethylene polymerization catalyst . treatment of the reagent [C5H4B(C6F5)3] Na,Li*Et2O ( 4 ) with zirconocene dichloride gave the neutral tris(cyclopentadienyl)Zr-betaine - type complex (e5-Cp)2[e5-C5H4B (C6F5)3]Zr ( 1 ) . In the crystal complex <nUm> contains the three e-cyclopentadienide ligand in a nearly trigonal - planar coordination around zirconium with a pronounced Zr-F-C(aryl) coordination perpendicular to it . the Zr-F bond length is <nUm> Å . the Zr-F-C(aryl) coordination is persistent in solution . the activation energy of the reversible cleavage of the Zr-F linkage of <nUm> wa determined a DG ‡ ( Zr - f)diss(253 K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 by dynamic 19F NMR spectroscopy in toluene-d8 . ( e6-Phenol ) tricarbonylchromium complex are conveniently converted to [(e6-phenoxide)Cr(CO)3]- specie on treatment with aqueous base . the phenoxide chromium anion , which are readily isolated a crystalline tetraethylammonium salt , react with main - group electrophiles ( (p-tol)SO2Cl or C2ClF3O ) to produce new sulfonate - and carboxylate - substituted arene chromium complex . similar reaction between the phenoxide anion and metal electrophiles ( CpFe(CO)3 + or Cp2ZrCl2 ) result in electron - transfer reaction that consume the starting arene complex . transition - metal complex bearing (e-phenoxide)Cr(CO)3 ligand are conveniently prepared through alcoholysis reaction with metal alkoxide and metal dimethylamide precursor . an x-ray crystallographic study of Cp2Zr{(e-OC6H5)Cr(CO)3}2 wa carried out . for <nUm> unique intensity data collected by using Cu ka radiation in a θ – 2th scan procedure , the space group for the molecule wa determined to be pnma with unit cell parameter a = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 5 ) Å , and c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å . the refinement converged to an R(F) of <nUm> and an RW(F) of <nUm> . the molecule show general structural feature common to other bent zirconocene and p-arene chromium complex but show some unexpected feature associated with the Zr - aryloxide bonding . little evidence is found for either steric interaction between the (e-OC6H5)Cr(CO)3 unit or for Zr-O π bonding . the o-arene bond doe show a small degree of multiple - bond character . this observation is supported by the deviation of the O-C arene vector from the least - square arene plane , suggesting that a small degree of a cyclohexadienone resonance form is contributing to Zr - arene bonding . none bis(alkynyl)zirconocene and -hafnocene complex (R1Cp)2M(C ≡ CR)2 ( 6 ) were prepared by reacting metallocene dihalides (R1Cp)2MCl2 ( R1 = H , CH3 , terf - butyl ) with alkynyl anion equivalent . subsequent comproportionation of <nUm> with additional (R1Cp)2MCl2 yielded mono(alkynyl)metallocene chloride <nUm> . complex <nUm> and <nUm> were treated with zirconocenes (R2Cp)2Zr , generated in situ from the corresponding (e4-butadiene)metallocene system to give binuclear alkynyl-bridged complex (R1Cp)2M(m-Cl)(m-C ≡ CR)Zr(CpR2)2 ( 9 ) or (R1Cp2)M(m-C ≡ CR)2Zr(CpR2)2 ( 10 ) , respectively ( m = Zr , Hf ; R1 R2 = H , CH3 , t-Bu ; r = CH3 , ph ) . the x-ray crystal structure analysis of Cp2Zr(C ≡ CCH3)2 ( 6a ) revealed no noticeable conjugative interaction of the 16-electron d0-configurated early - transition - metal center with the acetylenic p-system . complex 6a crystallizes in space group pnc2 with cell constant a = <nUm> ( 7 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 9 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 5 ) Å ; d(Zr-C(1)) = <nUm> ( 3 ) , C(1) - C(2) = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å ; C(1)-Zr-C(1*) = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , Zr-C(1)-C(2) = <nUm> ( 3 ) ° . In contrast , the metal-acetylide unit in the Cm symmetric (H3CCp)2Zr(C ≡ CPh ) dimer ( 10f ) ha a much shorter Zr-Ca bond ( <nUm> ( 2 ) Å ) , a revealed by x-ray diffraction . together with the other pertinent bonding feature [ d(Ca ≡ cb ) = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å ; . Zr*-Ca / cb = <nUm> ( 2 ) / <nUm> ( 2 ) Å ; Zr***Zr* = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å ; Ca***Ca* = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å ] this indicates a substantial p-interaction between the metal and the C ≡ CR unit of the binuclear complex of type <nUm> . nevertheless , complex <nUm> are highly fluxional — the alkynyl ligand undergo rapid intramolecular exchange between adjacent metal center ( DG* ≈ <nUm> – <nUm> kcal / mol ) . for one example , the (t-BuCp)2Zr(m-C ≡ CCH3)2ZrCp2 system , the temperature - dependent dynamic NMR spectrum have disclosed the presence of a novel c2v symmetric binuclear specie ( 13a ) equilibrating with the Cs symmetric doubly alkynyl-bridged complex 10d . this may indicate that in such system the automerization process by sequential s-alkynyl ligand migration ( via <nUm> ) is favored over the concerted exchange involving the common d2h symmetric transition state . A series of (alkoxymethyl)zirconocene chloride ( <nUm> , Cp2Zr(Cl)CH2OR , cp = e5-C5H5 ) ha been prepared by treatment of Cp2ZrCl2 with (alkoxymethyl)lithium reagent . compound lc , Cp2Zr(Cl)CH2OCH2C6H5 , crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group pbca , with a = <nUm> ( 9 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 9 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 8 ) Å , and z = <nUm> . the x-ray crystal structure show that the alkoxymethyl ligand is e2 , with a significant Zr-O interaction . compound <nUm> with r = benzyl or substituted benzyl undergo a wittig rearrangement when heated to give product <nUm> ( Cp2Zr(Cl)OCH2R ) . the activation parameter that were determined for the transformation , the effect of substituents on the rate of the reaction , the identity of the reaction 's side product , and the retention of configuration at the benzylic carbon are all consistent with the formation of a short - lived radical pair intermediate . thermally generated (e2-1,2-didehydrobenzene)titanocene and - zirconocene react with hexacarbonylmolybdenum or - tungsten at <nUm> ° C to give five - membered metallacyclic titan - and zirconoxycarbene complex <nUm> . the carbene complex Cp2ZrOC[ = W(CO)5]C6H4 ( 4a ) is an organometallic lewis acid . At room temperature 4a add <nUm> equiv of acetophenone giving the adduct <nUm> [ IR dvc = <nUm> = <nUm> cm-1 ; 13C NMR ( acetophenone carbonyl C ) dd = + <nUm> ppm ) . complex 4a is oligomeric in the solid state . bridging between the monomeric unit occurs by formation of [W] — C ≡ O — [Zr] connection using the CO group at tungsten trans to the carbene ligand . In contrast , (Me3CCp)2ZrOC( = C11H4O5W ( <nUm> g ) is monomeric in the crystal ; the bulky tert-butyl cp substituents shield the electrophilic zirconium center effectively from nucleophilic attack . complex <nUm> g crystallizes in space group P43 with cell constant a = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . the metallacycle 4a reacts with phenol to give the zirconoxycarbene complex Cp2Zr(OPh)OC[ = W(CO)5]C6H5 ( 10 ) . complex <nUm> crystallizes in space group P212121 with cell constant a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> .

[SiMe2-(C5H4)2][(C5Me5)ZrCl2]2*1 / 2C7H8 crystallizes in a triclinic unit cell of PI symmetry with a = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , α = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , β = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , γ = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , V = <nUm> ( 8 ) A3 , z = <nUm> , and dcalcd = <nUm> g / cm3 , whereas [SiMe2(C5H4)2][(C5H5)ZrCl]2(m-O) crystallizes in a monoclinic crystal lattice of P21 / c symmetry with a = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , V = <nUm> ( 1 ) A3 , z = <nUm> , and dcalcd = <nUm> g / cm3 . full - matrix least - square refinement ( based on F02 ) of diffractometry data converged with final discrepancy index of R(F0) = <nUm> with s1 = <nUm> and R(F0) = <nUm> with s1 = <nUm> , respectively . reaction of the isodicyclopentadienide anion with RCpTiCl3 ( r = H , CH3 , t-Bu ) and Cp'TiCl3 in tetrahydrofuran solution at-78 ° C is shown to proceed stereoselectively with formation of endo titanocene dichloride complex . when the same reaction are performed at <nUm> ° C up to the reflux temperature of the solvent , the stereoisomeric exo complex are cleanly formed instead . control experiment have not led to the interconversion of these isomer pair . comparable reaction of isodiCpLi with CpZrCl3 and Cp'ZrCl3 in boiling tetrahydrofuran also delivered only exo complex . the structural parameter of several product , a defined by x-ray crystallographic analysis , are discussed . the endo complex appear to be more sterically constrained than the exo isomer . their formation at low temperature is thought to be kinetically controlled and to stem from electronic feature imparted to the cp anion portion of the isodicyclopentadienyl ligand by it fused norbornyl framework . reaction of phenyl(trimethylsilyl)acetylene with hydridozirconocene chloride yield the b-CH agostic alkenylzirconocene chloride formula - omitted ( 2a ) . halogen exchange with lithium bromide or iodide produce the analogous alkenylzirconocene bromide 2b and iodide 2c , respectively . In contrast , hydrozirconation of (trimethylsilyl)acetylene give Cp2ZrCl( — CH = CHSiMe3 ) ( 4 ) , exhibiting the bulky SiMe3 substituent at the b-position of the a-alkenyl ligand , which lack the b-agostic metal-C-H interaction that is characteristic of <nUm> . the molecular structure of 2b and <nUm> were determined by x-ray diffraction . complex 2b crystallizes in space group P21 / n with cell constant a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . the alkenylmetallocene <nUm> crystallizes in space group P21 / c with cell parameter o = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . model calculation have confirmed that steric in addition to electronic factor are mainly responsible for the formation of the b-CH agostic interaction in the alkenylzirconocene complex <nUm> . hydrozirconation of phenyl(trimethylsilyl)acetylene at ambient temperature yield mixture of the b-CH agostic alkenylmetallocene complex [ inline formula omitted ] zirconocene dichloride ( 5 ) , and the metallacyclopentadiene Cp2ZrC(SiMe3) = CPhCPh = C(SiMe3) ( 3a ) . the last product probably is formed from 2a and [Cp2Zr(H)Cl] via hydride / chloride exchange , producing the intermediate [ inline formula omitted ] the intermediate [ inline formula omitted ] ( 4a ) , which loses dihydrogen and add <nUm> equiv of Me3SiC = CPh to give 3a . photolysis of 2a also yield a mixture of 3a and <nUm> . complex 3a wa characterized by x-ray diffraction . it crystallizes in space group C2 / c with cell parameter a = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . the reaction of 2a with lithioacetylides CLi = CR ( r = CH3 , ph ) produce metallacycles a well . the complex [ inline formula omitted ] ( 3b,c ) are thought to be produced via b-CH agostic alkenylalkynylmetallocene intermediate [ inline formula omitted](4b,c) . intramolecular abstraction of the acidic agostic alkenyl proton by the a-alkynyl ligand directly lead to the formation of bis(alkyne)metallocene complex ( 7b,c ) , which undergo rapid ring closure to give 3b and 3c , respectively . complex 3c ( r = ph ) wa characterized by x-ray diffraction . it crystallizes in space group P21 / n with cell parameter a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . from EHMO model calculation it is suggested that the “ anomalous ” hydrozirconation of diphenylacetylene , for example , which cleanly give Cp2ZrCl2 and the metallacycle [ inline formula omitted ] also proceeds via intermediate b-CH agostic ( alkenyl ) Cp2Zr(X) type intermediate . the first structurally characterized transitionmetal complex of cyclobutene is described . the complex is formed by the elimination of methane from cyclobutylmethylzirconocene with subsequent trapping by trimethylphosphine . the reactivity of the complex with unsaturated organic molecule and it x-ray crystal structure are reported . the crystal and molecular structure of ( s-cis-2,3-dimethylbutadiene ) hafnocene ( 3b ) , (1,2-bis(methylene)cyclohexane)zirconocene ( 4a ) , and (1,2-bis(methylene)cyclohexane)hafnocene ( 4b ) have been determined from x-ray data . 3b crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group pnma with a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , V = <nUm> A3 , and dcalcd = <nUm> g cm-3 for z = <nUm> . full - matrix least - square refinement of <nUm> parameter with <nUm> unique observed reflection converged at r = <nUm> . it is isostructural with the previously reported (s-ds-2,3-dimethylbutadiene)zirconocene complex ( 3a ) . 4a crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1 with a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , α = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , β = <nUm> ( 7 ) ° , γ = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and dcalcd = <nUm> g cm-3 for z = <nUm> . refinement of <nUm> parameter based on <nUm> reflection led to a final r of <nUm> . 4b crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21 / n with a = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 9 ) ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and dcalcd = <nUm> g cm-3 for z = <nUm> . refinement of <nUm> parameter with <nUm> reflection produced r = <nUm> . In all three complex the diene is e4-bonded to the metallocene fragment with the metal in a ps-tetrahedral coordination . the bond of the diene terminus to the metal are noticeably shorter than those of the internal C atom of the dienes . the respective bond length ( 3b , <nUm> (5)-2.641 ( 5 ) Å ; 4a , <nUm> ( 2 ) – <nUm> ( 6 ) Å ; 4b , <nUm> (8)-2.72 ( 1 ) Å ) are in a range typical for M-C σ and π bond of the respective element . together with the other geometrical parameter of the diene-metallocene framework they allow the following generalization : ( a ) (s-cis-e4-diene)zirconocenes and -hafnocenes are best described a s2,p complex , ( b ) the σ / π ratio in the metal-diene bonding is smaller for the zirconocene complex than for their Hf analogue , ( c ) this ratio is smaller for 3b than for 4b , a trend which is similar in the previously reported (s-cis-e4-2,3-dimethylbutadiene)zirconocene ( 3a ) and 4a , and ( d ) , Zr-C bond are slightly longer than their Hf counterpart . difference in the chemical behavior of corresponding ( s-cis - conjugated diene)zirconocene and -hafnocene complex can be rationalized in view of their characteristic structural feature . the reactivity of [(e5-C5H4CH3)2ZrH(m-H)]2 with various substituted acetylene ha been investigated . diphenylacetylene and phenylacetylene react with [(e5-C5H4CH3ZrH(m-H)]2 below <nUm> ° C to yield primarily (e5-C6H4CH3)2Zr(C4(C6H5)4) and the 2,5-diphenyl-substituted isomer of (e5-C5H4CH3)2Zr(C4(C6H5)2) , respectively . under appropriate condition substantial hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene to trans-stilbene and phenylacetylene to ethylbenzene , respectively , is observed . these result suggest that at least two competing process — zirconacyclopentadiene formation and acetylene hydrogenation — are present . complementary EPR study for the reaction of [(e5-C5H4CH3)2ZrH(m-H)]2 with diphenylacetylene , 1-phenylpropyne , and 2-butyne have further revealed the formation of a paramagnetic zirconocene specie (e5-C5H4CH3)2Zr(H)(RC ≡ CR ) . the possible participation of this adduct in the acetylene chemistry of [(e5-C5H4CH3)2ZrH(m-H)]2 is discussed . an electrochemical cell designed to work in the cavity of an ESR spectrometer at variable temperature wa used to study the electrochemical reduction of zirconocene compound Cp2ZrX2 ( x = halogen ( hal ) ; cp = e5-C5H5 ) and Cp2Zr(CH3)2 in THF . it is shown that in each case zirconocene(III) specie are formed . on the basis of their spectral parameter they are characterized a the anion radical (Cp2ZrX2)- . for x = Cl , Br , and CH3 and a the monohalide Cp2ZrX for x = I . halogen hyperfine interaction are resolved for the first time . for x = Cl and Br , electrochemical reduction in the presence of PMe3 and PMePh2 yield spectrum attributable to the specie Cp2ZrX(PMe3) and Cp2ZrX(PMePh2) . the reaction of methylenetriphenyl-phosphorane with |Cp2Zr(H)Cl]x , Cp2Zr(CH3)2 , and Cp2Zr(C6H5)2 have been studied . At <nUm> ° C methylene transfer from CH2 = PPh3 to the hydridozirconocene chloride occurs producing methylzirconocene chloride and triphenylphosphine . In contrast to dimethylzirconocene , which turn out to be unreactive up to <nUm> ° C , diphenylzirconocene at <nUm> ° C reacts with the ylide to form Cp2Zr(C6H5)CHPPh3 ( 1c ) . this reaction proceeds through an (e2-aryne)zirconocene intermediate a revealed by a labeling experiment . the Cp2Zr(C6H5) - substituted ylide ha been characterized by NMR spectrum at various temperature and an x-ray structure analysis . 1c crystallizes in space group pbca with a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , and z = <nUm> . the preferred conformation and a rather short Zr-C7 bond distance ( <nUm> ( 4 ) Å ) indicate substantial p-interaction of the Zr-C(ylide) linkage . photolysis of diphenylzirconocene ( 5 ) at low temperature ( <nUm> ° C ) in the presence of the isomerically pure dienes (Z,Z)- and (Z,E)-2,4-hexadiene ( 8a ) and (Z,Z)- and (Z,E)-1,4-diphenylbutadiene ( 8b ) , respectively , lead to the stereospecific formation of the corresponding ( s-trans-e4 - conjugated diene)zirconocene complex 1a-ZZ , 1a-ZE , 1b-ZZ , and 1b-ZE . upon thermolysis , 1a-ZZ ( t1 / <nUm> ≈ <nUm> min at <nUm> ° C ) first rearranges to give 1a-ZE exclusively , which consecutively rearranges to a thermodynamic <nUm> / <nUm> mixture of <nUm> a EE / 3a-EE at higher temperature ( + <nUm> ° C ) . similarly , 1b-ZE undergoes a thermally induced geometrical isomerization at + <nUm> ° C to form 1b-EE / 3b-EE ( <nUm> / <nUm> ) . the same product mixture is obtained directly from 1b-ZZ at + <nUm> ° C . the observed stepwise loss of the stereochemical information at the terminal carbon center of the conjugated diene ligand of <nUm> indicates a rearrangement process proceeding through a p-allyl-type intermediate ( 4 ) . this interpretation is supported by the result of an extended huckel calculation : an approximate transition state ( 10a ' ) for a related isomerization process with an unsubstituted butadiene system can be reached by rotating this ligand around a Zr - cterm bond ( <nUm> ° ) , lifting the exposed CH2 group by <nUm> ° , and rotating it <nUm> ° . A barrier of <nUm> kcal / mol wa computed . the orbitals of 10a are in agreement with the formulation of an allyl complex . A low - lying LUMO predominantly localized at the exposed CH2 moiety indicates carbenium ion character at this carbon . terminal p-donor substituents at the butadiene ligand cause a drop of the rearrangement barrier to <nUm> kcal / mol , which can be explained by mean of delocalization of carbenium p orbital character into filled wave function of the p-donor residue . stereochemistry and calculation have thus revealed a third general mechanistic pathway for an intramolecular diene transition - metal complex isomerization : rearrangement through p-allyl-type intermediate <nUm> can be of importance in addition to the established diene rotation and topomerization mechanism . parallel thermolysis ( at <nUm> ° C in solution ) and photolysis ( <nUm> ° C ) study of [(e5-C5H4CH3)2ZrH(m-H)]2 , <nUm> , and {[SiR2(C5H4)2]ZrH(m-H)}2(R = ch3 , 2a ; r = C2H5 , 2b ; r = n-C3H7 , 2c ) have shown that these dinuclear zirconocene hydride complex reductively eliminate H . In each case , this process is accompanied by the initial formation of a paramagnetic zirconocene hydride specie , which exhibit a hydride doublet with A(1H) = <nUm> g in the corresponding solution EPR spectrum . the result from a low temperature gas chromatographic analysis of the gas mixture containing H , HD , and d2generated during the thermolysis of <nUm> in the presence of a large excess of d2are consistent with deuterium incorporation into the methylcyclopentadienyl ring and the hydride position . further evidence for the involvement of the methylcyclopentadienyl ring during the thermolysis of <nUm> is provided by the fact that <nUm> equiv of h2are eliminated per equivalent of <nUm> . comparable experiment conducted on <nUm> , however , clearly reveal that the chelating [SiR2(C5H4)2]2- ligand significantly restricts the chemical participation of the ring . linking the ring with a dialkylsilyl bridge reduces the number of equivalent of h2evolved per equivalent of <nUm> to ca. two upon prolonged thermolysis and stabilizes the corresponding paramagnetic zirconocenophane hydride specie produced during the initial reductive elimination step . A series of consecutive solution EPR experiment have demonstrated that this Zr(III)-H intermediate undergoes reversible H / d exchange at the hydride position . complementary NMR measurement have further confirmed that deuterium incorporation is restricted to only the hydride position of <nUm> . the role of paramagnetic zirconocene hydride specie in these H / d exchange reaction is discussed . the compound cp <nUm> ScR ( cp = r = H , me , p-tol ) react readily with nitrile R'CN to provide azomethine complex cp <nUm> ScNC(R)R ‘ containing a C = N double bond <nUm> – <nUm> cm <nUm> ). if is used , further reaction may occur to give product containing two nitrile . the related complex cp <nUm> HZr <nUm> will insert two nitrile in a stepwise manner ; however , the dimethyl analogue is unreactive toward nitrile . the compound cp <nUm> ScNC(H)R may be hydrogenated under relatively mild condition to yield the corresponding amide complex this transformation is reversible ; addition of ethylene lead to dehydrogenation of the amide complex and production of ethane . the amide complex may be independently synthesized by reaction of cp <nUm> ScR ( r = H , me ) and the corresponding amine , with resultant elimination of hydrogen or methane , respectively . cp <nUm> CH2NSc <nUm> CMe <nUm> will catalytically hydrogenate ( <nUm> atm of H <nUm> ) me <nUm> CCN to me <nUm> CCH <nUm> NH <nUm> ; however , termination occurs by insertion of the nitrile into the scandium - amide bond to form cp <nUm> ScNC(CMe <nUm> )NHCH <nUm> CMe <nUm> , the NC bond of which is not hydrogenated under these condition . labeling experiment show that hydrogen can add reversibly across the Sc-N bond of the amide , and this step is believed to play a crucial role in the catalytic reaction . (e2-Benzophenone)zirconocene ha been obtained by the thermolysis of (e2-benzoyl)phenylzirconocene . In the solid state this (e2-ketone)metallocene complex adopts a dimeric structure and crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21 / n with lattice parameter a = <nUm> ( 4 ) A , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) A , c = <nUm> ( 5 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , V = <nUm> ( 1.6 ) A3 , and z = <nUm> . In [(e5-C5H5)2Zr(e2-OC(C6H5)2)]2(3) , the two independent three - membered Zr-O-C ring , which contain short zirconium-oxygen bond ( zr1 – O1 = <nUm> ( 2 ) , zr2 – O = <nUm> ( 2 ) A ) and long zirconium-carbon distance ( zr1 – C1 = <nUm> ( 3 ) , Zr2-C2 = <nUm> ( 3 ) A ) , are linked together by relatively weak zr1 – O ( <nUm> ( 2 ) A ) and zr2 – ol ( <nUm> ( 2 ) A ) bond . In contrast to many other oligomeric (e2-ketone)- and (e2-aldehyde)MCp2 complex , the central four - membered zr202- unit in <nUm> is nonplanar with a folding angle of <nUm> ° . In solution <nUm> reacts with electron - deficient transition metal or main - group metal hydride to form <nUm> : <nUm> adduct containing the monomeric (e2-benzophenone)zirconocene unit . the reaction of <nUm> with (Cp2ZrH2)x yield the binuclear complex Cp2Zr(m-e1(O):e2-OC(C6H5)2)(m-H)ZrCp2H ( 17 ) . the corresponding <nUm> : <nUm> adduct between Cp2Zr(e2-OC(C6H5)2) and hafnocene dihydride undergoes a thermally induced “ dyotropic ” rearrangement to give an equilibrium mixture of Cp2Zr(m-e1(0):e2-0C(C6H5)2)(m-H)ZfCp2H ( 18 ) and Cp2Hf(m-e1(0):e2-OC(C6H5)2)(m-H)ZrCp2H ( 19 ) . the reaction of <nUm> with methylenetriphenylphosphorane proceeds with ring opening of the metallaoxirane structural subunit . transfer of one ylide hydrogen to the carbonyl carbon atom of the former e2-ketone ligand lead to the formation of the metallocene - substituted phosphorus ylide Cp2Zr(OCHPh2)(CHPPh3) ( 25 ) . the metathesis of lithium (diphenylphosphino)cyclopentadienide with bis(tetrahydrofuran)tetrachlorozirconium in benzene lead to the formation of [(C6H5)2P(C5H4)]2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) in <nUm> % yield . this functionalized canted zirconocene specie readily displaces the norbornadiene from (norbornadiene)-tetracarbonylmolybdenum to give [(C6H5)2P(C5H4)]2ZrCl2Mo(CO)4 ( 2 ) in <nUm> % yield . the CO stretch observed in the infrared spectrum of <nUm> are consistent with cis-disubstituted molybdenum tetracarbonyl complex L2Mo(CO)4 , where L2 = 2PPh3 or (CH2PPh2)2 . this heterobinuclear complex form triclinic crystal of P1 symmetry from chloroform / hexane . the refined lattice parameter are a = <nUm> ( 2 ) A , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) A , c = <nUm> ( 4 ) A , a = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , β = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , y = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , V = <nUm> ( 7 ) A3 , and rcalcd = <nUm> g cm-3 . full - matrix least - square refinement ( based on F02 ) converged with final discreptancy index of R(F0) = <nUm> and R(F[?]2) = <nUm> . the zirconium - molybdenum separation in <nUm> of <nUm> ( 3 ) A rule out any direct metal - metal interaction . the structure of <nUm> is remarkable in that , despite the chelation of the molybdenum atom by <nUm> , the coordination sphere of both metal show very little difference from the individual mononuclear component , zirconocene dichloride and (bis(diphenylphosphino)methane)-tetracarbonylmolybdenum . the chloride atom in <nUm> can be substituted by methyl group via reaction with methylmagnesium bromide to give [(C6H5)2P(C5H4)]2Zr(CH3)2Mo(CO)4 ( 3 ) in <nUm> % yield . : reaction of tert-butyl isocyanide and cyclo-hexyl isocyanide with dihydride led to multiple insertion into the Zr-H bond and to simultaneous reductive coupling of iso-cyanides with the formation of an unusual zirconacycle : current interest in the reduction of carbon monoxide ha led to study of the reactivity of CO with various zirconocene hydride which have resulted in the observation of C-C bond formation.la , ba well a simple CO reduction by these complexes.10Examination of the reactivity of zirconocene hydride ha recently been extended to reactivity with isocyanides , which are isoelectronic with CO.12Specifically , interest ha focused on the question of whether CO insertion into a Zr-H bond is thermodynamically feasible and , by analogy , whether such a process occurs in the cp2ZrH2-isocyanide system . another aspect of this chemistry concern the role that the cp ligand play . it ha been noted that alkyl sub-stituents on the cp ring increase the ligand to metal electronic donation , thereby heightening metal basicity . reduction of dichlorobis(175-cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) ( 3 ) with <nUm> equiv of sodium amalgam ( Na / Hg ) give the dinuclear e5:e6-fulvalene complex <nUm> of composition and the <nUm> in <nUm> % yield each ; both compound represent Ti (III) specie . the chloro-bridged complex <nUm> undergoes quick oxidation upon exposure to air , thus yielding the Ti(IV) derivative ( 6 ) . reduction of <nUm> with lithium triethylhydridoboranate cleanly give “ titanocene ” <nUm> , with the latter compound representing a good starting material for the synthesis of the sulfido-bridged fulvalene complex ( 7 ) . compound <nUm> in turn undergoes a sulfur / oxygen exchange reaction when treated with molecular oxygen ; in this case , the oxo- / sulfido-bridged derivative ( 8 ) is formed . reaction of the isodicyclopentadienide anion with TiCl3in tetrahydrofuran at <nUm> ° C , with ZrCl4in dimethoxyethane at reflux for <nUm> h , and with HfCl4in dimethoxyethane ( reflux , <nUm> h ) have been performed in order to ass the x-facial stereoselectivity of complexation to group <nUm> transition metal . In all three instance , a single complex wa isolated . x-ray crystallographic analysis of the titanocene and zirconocene dichloride demonstrate both to be the result of dual coordination to the exo surface . by NMR 1H comparison , the hafnocene is shown to be closely similar and therefore of the same stereochemistry . the three - dimensional feature of the complex are discussed . thermally in situ generated (i2-1,2-di-dehydrobenzene)zirconocene reacts with M(CO)6(M = W , Mo ) to give the benzannelated five - membered metal - lacyclic zirconoxycarbene complex 4a,b . controlled hydrolysis of 4a ( m = W ) with CuS04*5H20 yield the tetranuclear Zr-O-Zr - bridged bis(carbene) complex [(C0)5W-C(Ph)0-Cp2Zr-0-ZrCp2-0C(Ph)-W(C0)5] ( 5a ) . the molecular structure of the molybdenum analogue 5b wa determined by x-ray diffraction . 5b crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2 / c with cell parameter a = <nUm> ( 5 ) A , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) A c = <nUm> ( 2 ) A , and <nUm> = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° . 5b is characterized by a completely planar c-framework ( Zr-O-Zr* = <nUm> ° ) . the most remarkable structural feature of 5b is the trans arrangement of the voluminous (CO)5Mo-carbene unit at the Zr-O-Zr bridge . this favored antiperiplanar conformation is unique among the family of early - transltion - metal Cp2M(X)-0-M(X)Cp2compounds . the ( s-cis- / s-trans-e4-butadiene)zirconocene equilibrium mixture ( <nUm> / <nUm> = <nUm> / <nUm> ) reacts with CpCo(CO)2at ambient temperature to give the metallacyclic fischer - type carbene complex Cp2Zr(C4H6)(OC = )Co - (CO)Cp , <nUm> . the (s-trans-diene)metallocene complex reacts much faster with the metal carbonyl than the more nucleophilic (S-cis-C4H6)ZrCp2isomer . the product of this nonnucleophilic carbene complex forming reaction , <nUm> , wa characterized by x-ray diffraction . it crystallizes in the space group P21 / c with cell constant a = <nUm> ( 2 ) , b = <nUm> ( 4 ) , and c = <nUm> ( 3 ) A and β = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° . complex <nUm> is characterized by a rather short Co-C(carbene) bond length of <nUm> ( 4 ) A . At ambient temperature in solution <nUm> rapidly equilibrates with the starting component Cp2Zr(butadiene) and CpCo(CO)2 . At equilibrium the carbene complex is favored by <nUm> / <nUm> . substitution of a Cl on the cp ring of the CpCo moiety shift the equilibrium ratio further to the side of the zirconoxycarbene complex : (e5-C5H5)2Zr-(C4H6)(OC = )(CO)(e5-C5H4Cl) ⇄ Cp2Zr(butadiene) + (e5-c5h4c1)co(co)2 ( > <nUm> / <nUm> ) . reaction of (butadiene)zirconocene with hexacarbonyltungsten yield the metallacyclic (tt-allyl)-zirconoxycarbene complex Cp2ZrOC[ = W(CO)5]C4H6 ( 2 ) . subsequent coupling with pinacolone give the nine - membered metallacycle irarcs-Cp2ZrOC[ = W(CO)5]CH2CH = CHCH2CMe(CMe3)0 ( 3 ) . both compound <nUm> and <nUm> show a very low fischer carbene complex reactivity . hydrolytic removal of the zirconocene moiety transforms the rather unreactive zirconoxycarbene complex into conventional heteroatom - stabilized transition - metal carbene complex . thus , treatment of <nUm> with water in tetrahydrofuran generates a hydroxycarbene tungsten complex in situ , which is efficiently trapped by added excess diazomethane to yield the enol ether CH2 = C4H6O = CHCH2CMe(CMe3)OH a the major reaction product . similarly , controlled hydrolysis of <nUm> in the presence of pyridine n-oxide give C3H4O2 = CHCH2CMe(CMe3)OH . the reaction of <nUm> with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride trihydrate in tetrahydrofuran cleaves the metallacycle to give a zirconium - free acylmetallate anion ( Bu4N+ counterion ) which is readily O - alkylated by using meerwein 's reagent to produce H5C2OC[ = W(CO)5]CH2CH = CHCH2CMe(CMe3)OH ( <nUm> , ca. <nUm> % overall yield ) . similarly , the zirconoxycarbene complex <nUm> yield H6C2OC[ = W(CO)5]CH2CH = CH2 upon treatment with Bu4NF(H20)3 followed by alkylation with (H5C2)3OBF4- . high - resolution one- and two - dimensional solid - state CP / MAS spectrum of microcrystalline bent metallocene complex of the type (e5-RCp)2ZrL2 have been obtained at various temperature ( L = Cl , r = H ( 1 ) , me ( 2 ) , et (3),tBu ( 4 ) ; L2 = s-cis-e4-C4H6 , R-H ( 5 ) ; L2 = s-cis- e4-C4H4Me2 , R-H ( 6 ) ; l2-s-cis- e4-C4H5Me , r = H ( 7 ) ; L2 = s-cis-e4-C4H6 , r = tBu ( 8 ) ; L2 = s-cis-e4-C4H6 , r = 1,1-dimethylpentyl ( 9 ) ; L2 = s-cis-e4-C4H5Me , r = tBu ( 10 ) ) . complex 1-4 posse C2 molecular symmetry , while the overall symmetry of complex <nUm> and <nUm> is close to Cs . In 7-9 there is no element of symmetry , and <nUm> yield diastereoisomers ( <nUm> : <nUm> ) . variable - temperature MAS spectrum give evidence forRCp rotation and diene topomerization a fluxional process occurring in the solid state . due to steric interaction with the methyl proton in <nUm> the rotation of the upper e5-bonded cyclopentadienyl ring wa frozen out at T = <nUm> K ( DG* ≈ <nUm> kcal / mol ) and the five13C chemical shift of this specie cover a range of more than <nUm> ppm . due to le steric interaction the activation barrier for rotation of the lower cp ring is smaller ( DG* ≈ <nUm> kcal / mol ) . upon introduction of alkyl substituents at the e5-bonded ring the rotation barrier is significantly increased : in <nUm> it is around <nUm> kcal / mol . In contrast , movement of the e4-coordinated diene is largely independent of alkyl substituents and in 5-10 the barrier for this process is around <nUm> kcal / mol . the reaction of cp <nUm> ZrMe <nUm> with the diol 2,2-dimethylpropane-1,3-diol and 1,3-benzenedimethanol proceed with evolution of methane , affording the macrocyclic zirconocene dialkoxides cp <nUm> Zr(m-OCH <nUm> C-(CH <nUm> ) <nUm> CH <nUm> O ) <nUm> ZrCp <nUm> ( 1 ) and cp <nUm> Zr(m-OCH <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> CH <nUm> O ) <nUm> ZrCp <nUm> ( 2 ) , respectively . complex <nUm> crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P4 <nUm> mnm with a = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , z = <nUm> , and V = <nUm> ( 5 ) Å <nUm> . molecule <nUm> crystallizes in the trigonal space group R3 with a = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , z = <nUm> , and V = <nUm> ( 8 ) Å <nUm> . In the case of <nUm> , a disorder in the structural data is consistent with two possible conformation of the 12-membered dimetalated ring . molecular mechanic calculation in which the geometry at Zr is fixed were performed for the two possible conformers . the pseudocrown conformation is predicted to be thermodynamically more stable than the pseudochair form . In contrast , complex <nUm> adopts a pseudochair conformation . In addition , the disposition of the alkyl substituents on the oxygen atom is endo for <nUm> and exo for <nUm> . these structural difference between <nUm> and <nUm> are considered and discussed . the nature of the Zr – O bonding in these complex is discussed in term of the extended huckel molecular orbital picture . the structural and theoretical data support the notion of significant p-bonding between Zr and oxygen . the reaction of a zirconocene acyl chloride with <nUm> equiv of trimethylaluminum result in the formation of the trinuclear Zr <nUm> Al complex [ cp <nUm> zr(e <nUm> (C,O)-OC-(CH <nUm> ) <nUm> ] <nUm> ( m-AlMe <nUm> )(m-Me) , which contains a trigonal - bipyramidal bridging methyl group . the complex crystallizes in the monoclinic system , in space group P2 <nUm> / n ( C <nUm> <nUm> h , no. <nUm> ) , with a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , V = <nUm> ( 9 ) Å <nUm> , and z = <nUm> . this is one of the few structure that contains a bridging methyl group with a near-trigonal-bipyramidal structure in which the metal occupy the axial position and the three hydrogen atom are in the equatorial plane . the effect of counterion on the kinetics and mechanism of ethylene polymerization by the zirconocene - boron catalytic system wa examined using the density functional theory approach . A comparative study of three model catalytic specie , namely , ethylzirconocene cation , Cp2ZrEt+ , and two ion pair of composition Cp2ZrEt+A- ( A- = CH3B(C6F5)3- , B(C6F5)4- ) wa carried out . it wa shown that the nature of counterion affect mainly the ratio between the most stable b-agostic and nonagostic Cp2ZrEt+A- isomer , the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristic of ethylene addition to the Cp2ZrEt+A- ion pair , and the chain propagation kinetics . the weaker the nucleophilicity of the counterion , the higher the fraction of the b-agostic isomer , the higher the exotermicity , and the lower the activation barrier to ethylene addition to Cp2ZrEt+A- , and the lower the activation energy of chain propagation . all possible pathway of the interaction between Cp2ZrEt+CH3B(C6F5) 3- and ethylene molecule were examined and compared . among all specie of composition Cp2ZrEt+CH3 B(C6F5)3- , the nonagostic isomer wa found to be the most reactive toward ethylene . the hydroxysilsesquioxanes (c-C5H9)7Si8O12(OH) ( I ) and (c-C5H9)7Si7O9 (OH)2OSiMePh2 ( II ) have been studied a model support for silica - grafted aluminum alkyl specie . treatment of AlMe3 with I gave polymeric { [(c-C5H9)7Si8O13] AlMe2}n ( 1a ) , which is readily transformed into the corresponding monomeric pyridine adduct , { [(c-C5H9)7Si8O13] AlMe2*Py ( 1b ) . when AlMe3 wa reacted with II , noticeable amount of the <nUm> : <nUm> product { [ (c-C5H9)7Si7O11- (OSiMePh2)](AlMe2)2}2 ( 2 ) and the bronsted acidic <nUm> : <nUm> product { [ (c-C5H9)7O11 (OSiMePh2)]2-Al-}{H+} ( III ) were obtained besides the main product of the reaction , { [ (c-C5H9)7Si7O11- (OSiMePh2)]AlMe}2 ( 3a-c ) . the main product is a mixture of three dimeric conformational isomer all with the aluminum methyl trans to each other . the difference of the conformers originates from the different orientation of the silsesquioxane ligand . reaction of the bronsted acid III with AlMe3 yielded the kinetic product { [ (c-C5H9)7Si7O11 (OSiMePh2)]2Al2Me2 ( 4 ) . the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of the three conformeric methyl aluminosil - sesquioxanes { [ (c-C5H9)7 Si7O11(OSiMePh2)]AlMe}2 ( 3a-c ) and their chemical isomer { [ (c-C5H9)7Si7 O11(OSiMePh2)]2Al2Me2 ( 4 ) ha been investigated . isomerization experiment showed that 3a isomerizes to 3b , which subsequently isomerizes to 3c , affording the thermodynamically most stable mixture with a 3a:3b:3c ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> after <nUm> h at <nUm> ° C . isomerization of 3a to 3b is considerably faster than from 3b to 3c . direct conversion of 3a into 3c wa not observed . complex <nUm> slowly isomerizes into 3c , which consecutively isomerizes into the thermodynamic most stable isomeric mixture ( <nUm> h at <nUm> ° C , ea = <nUm> kJ*mol-1 ) . treating Cp2ZrMe2 with the bronsted acid III gave clean transfer of a silsesquioxane ligand to zirconium , yielding [ (c-C5H9)7Si7O11 (OSiMePh2)]ZrCp2 ( 5 ) . the methyl aluminosilsesquioxanes 1a and 2-4 are not lewis acidic enough to effectively abstract a substituent x from Cp2ZrX2 ( x = me , CH2Ph , Cl ) . though , 3a-c and <nUm> definitely interact with Cp2ZrX2 . dependent on the substituent x , the zirconocene can accelerate the rate of isomerization over <nUm> order of magnitude ( 3a , <nUm> h ; <nUm> , <nUm> h at <nUm> ° C ) . surprisingly , complex <nUm> also reacts with the strongly lewis acidic BC18F15 . As soon a all <nUm> ha been converted into 3a-c , the accelerating effect stop , which demonstrates that lewis acid have no effect on the isomerization of 3a-c . complex <nUm> , 3a , 3c , <nUm> , and <nUm> have been structurally characterized . the silsesquioxane - tethered fluorene ligand ( c-C5H 9)7Si8,O12CH2-9-Flu(H) and zirconocene complex thereof , C5H3(SiMe 3)2[(c-C5H9)7Si 8O12CH2-9-Flu]ZrCl2 and [ ( c-C 5H9)7Si8O12CH 2-9-Flu]2ZrCl2 , have been used to optimize the synthetic strategy for the corresponding silica - tethered zirconocenes and to study their steric and electronic property . A series of zirconocene complex bearing 2,2-dimethyl-2-sila-4-pentenyl substituents ( and methyl-substituted olefin variant ) ( (e5-C5H5)2Zr(CH3)(CH 2SiMe2CH2CR1 = CR2R3 ) ( R1 , R2 , R3 = H , CH3 , <nUm> , 5-7 ) , (e5-C5H4CMe3)2 CH3Zr ( CH2SiMe2CH2 CH = CH2 ) ( 2 ) , { Me2Si(e5-C5 H4)2}Zr(CH3) ( CH2SiMe2 C2H3 = CH2 ) ( 3 ) , and { 1,2-(SiMe2)2(e5-C5H3 )2Zr(CH3) ( CH2SiMe2CH2CH = CH2 ) ( 4 ) ) have been prepared . methide abstraction with BC18F15 result in reversible coordination of the tethered olefin to the cationic zirconium center . the kinetics of olefin dissociation have been examined using NMR method , and the effect of ligand variation for unlinked , singly [SiMe2] - linked , and doubly [SiMe2] - linked bis(cyclopentadienyl) arrangement have been compared ( DG ‡ value for olefin dissociation vary from <nUm> to <nUm> kcal*mol-1 measured over the temperature range 223-283 K ) . for the cation derived from <nUm> the kinetics for olefin dissociation and site epimerization ( inversion at zirconium ) can be distinguished . additionally , with this ligand system competitive binding of the olefin and the [CH3B(C6F5)3] anion is observed . methide abstraction from { 1,2-(SiMe2)2(e5-C5 H3)2}Zr(CH3) ( CH2CMe2CH2CH = CH2 ) result in rapid b-allyl elimination with loss of isobutene to cleanly afford the allyl cation [ { 1,2-(SiMe2)2(e5-C5 H3)2}Zr ( e3-CH2CH = CH2)]+ . none density functional calculation on a variety of alkyl-transition metal complex R-M are reported . specifically , the following compound have been studied : zirconocene complex [Cp2Zr(H)R] , [Cp2Zr(Cl)R] , [Cp2ZrR]+ , and [Cp*2Zr(Cl)R] ; iron compound [CpFe(CO)2R] and [ CpFe(CO) {P(CH3)3} ] ; dimethylamino-dithiocyanato-palladium complex [ {(CH3)2NCS2}- Pd{P(CH3)3}R ] ; and cationic diimino palladium complex [{NN}Pd(L)R]+ ( with {NN} = HN = CH-CH = NH or N,N'-(o,o'-bis-diisopropylphenyl)diiminoacenaphthalene , and L = nothing , cl- , C2H6O , C2H6S , CH2 , or C2H3N ) . the r group considered are methyl , n-propyl , isobutyl , isopropyl , and tert-butyl , thus covering the whole range from primary group to tertiary one . it is shown that primary alkyl complex are usually more stable then secondary and tertiary one and that this is an electronic effect , due to the partial carbanionic character of the alkyl group . steric effect , which are usually invoked in the literature whenever this issue is considered , are shown to play only a minor role in many case . notable exception occur in the case of extremely bulky compound or for system in which the metal-carbon bond is le polar . stereoselective reaction of zirconium biphenolate complex of the general formula (BIP)-ZrCl2(THF)2 ( 1a-c ) , where BIP = 3,3'-iPr2-6,6'-Me2-1,1'-bi-2- phenolate ( a ) , 3,3'-tBu2-5,5'-Me2-1,1'-bi-2- phenolate ( b ) , or 3,3',5,5'-tBu4-1,1'-bi-2-phenolate ( c ) , with <nUm> equiv of the lithium or magnesium salt of various ansa - bis(indenyl) ligand give the ansa - zirconocenes rac-C2H4(Ind)2Zr(BIP) ( 2b ) , rac-Me2Si(Ind)2Zr(BIP) ( 3c ) , rac-Me2Si(2-Me-Ind)2Zr(BIP) ( 4c ) , rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2Zr(BIP) ( 5c ) , and rac-Me2Si(2-Me-Benz[e]Ind)2Zr(BIP) ( 6c ) in isolated yield of 60-75 % . reaction of C2H4(Ind)2Mg(THF)2 with 1a and 1b and of Me2Si(Ind)2Li2 with 1c give directly the pure diastereomers rac-2a , rac-2b , and rac-3c , respectively . more highly substituted indenyl ligand , on the other hand , give initially kinetically controlled mixture of the rac- and meso-zirconocene BIP derivative 4c , 5c , and 6c , from which the pure rac - derivative are obtained a thermodynamically favored product by heating the reaction mixture to <nUm> ° C for 5-7 h . the meso - to - rac isomerization of 6c is catalyzed by addition of TEMPO and is thus likely to occur by way of radical intermediate . crystal and molecular structure of 1b and 2b and of 1c and 6c indicate that formation of the racemo diastereomers is favored by repulsive interaction between biphenolate and ansa - bis(indenyl) ligand . the displacement of the MeB(C6F5)3- anion from seven different zirconocene methyl cation by neutral lewis base , such a dimethylaniline , benzyldimethylamine , and dinbutyl ether , wa investigated by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy . equilibrium constant for reaction with dinbutyl ether change by factor of le than <nUm> between the zirconocene contact ion pair studied , despite substantial steric difference . rate constant of this displacement reaction , however , change by a factor of more than <nUm> between Me2Si(C5H4)2ZrMe-MeB(C 6F5)3- , the most " open " complex , and rac-Me2Si(2-Me-BzInd)2ZrMe-MeB(C6F 5)3- , the most highly substituted specie studied . kinetic and stereochemical data indicate that lewis base - anion exchange proceeds by way of an associative mechanism , which occurs without side change of the zirconium - bound methyl group . DFT calculation support an associative substitution mechanism and propose five - coordinated reaction intermediate with the lewis base coordinated to the central coordination site . the reaction of zirconocene - alkyne complex Cp'2Zr(L)(e2-Me3SiC2 SiMe3 ) { cp'2 = ( e5 -C5H5)2 : L = THF , <nUm> ; L = pyridine , <nUm> ; cp'2 = rac - ebthi , <nUm> , [ ebthi = 1,2-ethylene1,1'-bis(e 5-tetrahydroindenyl ) ] } with <nUm> equiv(or excess ) of bicyclo[2.2.1] hepta-2,5-diene ( NBD ) in THF at <nUm> ° C result in five - membered zirconacyclopentane complex Cp2Zr(C14H16) ( 4 ) and rac(ebthi)Zr(C14H16) ( 5 ) ( C7H8 mean two coupled NBDs ) in good yield . NMR spectrum of complex <nUm> and <nUm> show the C2 symmetry of the molecule , indicating that the two NBD component in the complex are in exo-trans-exo conformation . an x-ray crystallographic structure determination of <nUm> confirms that the two NBD fragment are exo-trans-exo linked to form a racemate . both optical isomer are present in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio in the crystal . reaction of <nUm> and <nUm> with <nUm> equiv of NBD have also been investigated , and only zirconacyclopentane complex <nUm> wa isolated from the reaction . the analogous zirconacyclopentane complex Cp2Zr(C22H20) ( 6 ) and rac-(ebthi)Zr(C2H20) ( 7 ) ( C22 H20 mean two coupled BNBDs ) are obtained from the reaction of <nUm> ( or <nUm> ) and <nUm> with an excess of 1,4-dihydro-1,4-methano-naphthalene ( BNBD ) , respectively . the x-ray structure of the orange complex <nUm> show that the geometry of the Zr coordination sphere can be described a a distorted tetrahedron and similar to that of <nUm> . the zirconacyclopentane complex rac-(ebthi)Zr(C14H15N) ( 9 ) , bearing a free N coordinating site and a double bond , is formed from the coupling reaction of rac - ( ebthi ) C7H7NZr ( 8 ) with NBD . all these reaction are stereospecific , and all new complex are characterized by NMR , MS , and elemental analysis . density functional theory ( DFT ) study of the energetics of the isomer of C <nUm> H <nUm> -cyclocumulene ( 1 ) , ethynylcyclopropene ( 2 ) , diethynylmethane ( 3 ) , and their organometallic analogue obtained by replacing the CH <nUm> group by cp <nUm> Ti and cp <nUm> Zr ( 4-6 ) - show that the relative energy of the hydrocarbon are dramatically altered in the transition - metal analogue . the metallacyclocumulenes are comparable in energy to <nUm> and <nUm> . the relative energy also explain the experimental observation that the metallacyclopropene ( 5 ) is more favorable for the Ti complex . substituents on the carbon skeleton help to fine - tune the energetics . the bonding situation in <nUm> and the recently characterized five - membered zirconacyclopentyne complex <nUm> are very similar and are in tune with their structure . methyl-versus-cloride exchange equilibrium between different zirconocene complex provide a sensitive measure of relative electron density at the Zr center of these complex . As expected , methyl and trimethyl silyl substituents increase the electron density at the Zr center of a bis(cyclopentadienyl) Zr(IV) complex ; the same hold for a dimethyl silyl bridge . In bis(indenyl) complex , on the other hand , electron density at the metal center is reduced and substituent and bridge effect are different from those observed in bis(cyclopentadienyl) Zr(IV) complex . possible structural candidate for the active ( III ) and dormant ( IV ) specie in dimethyl-zirconocene - catalyzed , MAO (methylaluminoxane)-activated olefin polymerization have been studied via density functional theory ( DFT ) . these specie are [Cp2ZrMeAlMe3]+[MeMAO] - ( III ) and [Cp2ZrMe]+[MeMAO]- ( IV ) , respectively , where me = CH3 and cp = n5-C 5H5 . relative energy in gas phase and toluene solution a well a 1H and 13C NMR chemical shift have been calculated . these chemical shift have been compared with 1H and 13C NMR data from new experimental investigation studying the interaction between Cp2ZrMe2 and MAO in toluene solution.1 by combining experimental and theoretical result , we have been able to identify the most likely candidate for both the dormant and active specie . moreover , we are able to predict that an Al / Zr ratio of ~ <nUm> : <nUm> at <nUm> K is necessary in order for all of the Cp2ZrMe2 to bind to MAO a the structure we propose for III and IV . this ratio corresponds to the disappearance of the following specie from solution : free Cp2ZrMe2 , the weak complex of Cp2ZrMe <nUm> and MAO ( I ) , and [ Cp2ZrMe(m-Me) cp 2ZrMe]+-[MeMAO]- ( II ) . such a mixture would have a IV / III ratio of ~ <nUm> : <nUm> . an ansa - zirconocene compound , [2,2'-meth-ylenebis(1,3-dimethylcyclopentadienyl)]zirconium dichloride ( 5 ) , bearing methyl substituents on the carbon adjacent to a bridgehead carbon , wa synthesized by key step of the catalytic pauson - khand reaction and the retro-Diels-Aider reaction . the crystal structure of <nUm> wa determined . the small angle ( <nUm> ° ) between the two centroid of the cyclopentadienyls and a zirconium atom and the absence of any substituents on the position β with respect to the bridgehead carbon indicate that the coordination site for catalysis is widely opened . compound <nUm> , when activated with MAO , showed good performance for copolymerization of ethylene with a bulky monomer such a norbornene . the activity and norbornene incorporation ability are much better than those of [Ph2C(Fluo)(Cp)]ZrCl2 . A remarkably stable diborate anion a the metallocene polymerization catalyst wa investigated . the multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonding wa obtained in the molecular structure of the amidodiborate anion . In regard with it , the treatment of zirconocene dimethyls that resulted in the obtaining of highly active alkene polymerization catalyst wa reported . the reaction of [ cp ° 2ZrMe2 ] ( cp ° = C5EtMe4 ) with the thioglycolic acid HOOC(CH2-SCH2)nCOOH ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) resulted in evolution of methane and formation of the macrocyclic , dimeric zirconocene complex [ cp ° 2Zr(OOCCH2SCH2COO)2ZrCp ° <nUm> ] ( 1 ) and [ cp ° 2Zr(OOCCH2SCH2CH2SCH2 COO)2ZrCp ° <nUm> ] ( 2 ) , which can act a metalloligands toward complex fragment of a second metal . both complex were characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy , ESI mass spectrometry , and x-ray diffraction analysis . In solution at room temperature both complex are dynamic , and the carboxylato group alternate between mono- and bidentate bonding mode . for complex <nUm> the free energy of activation for this process wa determined to be DG ‡ = <nUm> ± <nUm> kJ / mol by variable - temperature NMR experiment . compound <nUm> reacts with [Mo(CO)4(NBD)] ( NBD = norbornadiene ) to give the tetranuclear Zr / Mo complex <nUm> , the crystal structure of which showed that an C4MoO4 fragment is coordinated to one S and one O donor center of each bridging ligand of <nUm> . this heterobimetallic complex <nUm> wa also characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy , and in contrast to <nUm> , it is not dynamic in solution at room temperature , owing to the coordination of the C4MoO4 fragment . compound <nUm> and <nUm> also react with [PdCl2(CH3CN)2] to give the trinuclear Zr / Pd complex <nUm> and the tetranuclear Zr / Pd complex <nUm> . both complex were characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy and by elemental analysis . the synthesis and use of the ansa - zirconocene complex [ Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5 -C5H3R)]-ZrCl2 ( r = H ( 5 ) , me ( 6 ) , et ( 7 ) , iPr ( 8 ) , tBu ( 9 ) , SiMe3 ( 10 ) ) a catalyst in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene ha been studied . the alkyl complex [ Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5 -C5H3R)]-ZrMe2 ( r = H ( 11 ) , me ( 12 ) , et ( 13 ) , iPr ( 14 ) , tBu ( 15 ) , SiMe3 ( 16 ) ) have also been prepared . the reaction of 11-16 with BC18F15 gave the cationic specie [ { Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5 -C5H3R)}-ZrMe]+ ( r = H ( 17 ) , me ( 18 ) , et ( 19 ) , iPr ( 20 ) , tBu ( 21 ) , SiMe3 ( 22 ) ) . In the absence of cocatalyst , 17-22 have been shown to act a catalyst in the polymerization of ethylene . the molecular structure of <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction study . preparation of zirconocene hydrido chloride complex ha been accomplished via addition of <nUm> equiv of tert-butyllithium to the corresponding zirconocene dichloride . In this manner , both Cp*Cp''Zr(H)Cl and Cp''2Zr(H)Cl ( cp* = C5Me5 , cp'' = 1,3-(SiMe3)2C5H3 ) were prepared in high yield . further addition of tBuLi to Cp*Cp''Zr(H)Cl affords the isobutyl hydride complex Cp*Cp''Zr(CH2CHMe2)(H) , which upon addition of <nUm> atm of dihydrogen undergoes rapid hydrogenolysis yielding the monomeric dihydride Cp*Cp''ZrH2 . In the absence of dihydrogen , the zirconocene dihydride undergoes reversible C-H activation of a cyclopentadienyl trimethylsilyl group , affording the " tuck-in " derivative Cp*(e5-1-SiMe3C5H3-3-( e1-SiMe2-CH2))ZrH . addition of <nUm> equiv of tBuLi to the ansa - zirconocene tPr2Si(e5-3-SiMe3C5H 3)(e5-3,4-(SiMe3)2C5H 2)ZrCl2 result in the corresponding zirconocene isobutyl hydride complex , which upon exposure to H affords the dimeric dihydride [ iPr2Si(e5-3-SiMe3C5H 3)(e5-3,4-(SiMe3)2C5H 2)ZrH2]2 . In a similar procedure the substituted indenyl complex rac-(1-CMe3-C9H6)Zr(H)Cl and rac-(1-CMe3-C9H6)Zr(CH2CHMe2 )(H) have been prepared . this synthetic methodology allows for the preparation of metallocene alkyl hydride and dihydrides inaccessible by more traditional route . formal [2+2] and [2+1] cycloaddition reaction between the azazirconaindenes 1a,b and aldehyde RCHO ( r = ph , -CH = CHMe - ( e ) , fc ) , heterocumulenes [ R-N = C = O ( r = ph , 1-naphthyl ) , Me-N = C = S , Cy-N = C = N-Cy ] , and the azide (PhO)2P(O)N3 afford stable pentavalent zirconocene compound 2-8 , respectively . the single - crystal x-ray structure of <nUm> is reported . Zr-X ( x = C , O , N ) distance in <nUm> are in the range of Cp2Zr-X s-bonds in pentavalent zirconium complex and not in that of p-X-coordination . this is in accord with a formal description for these compound a iminium zirconate complex . treatment of [Cp2TiCH3(thf)+] ( <nUm> , with [BPh4-] anion ) with 1,3-diisopropylimidazol-2-ylidene ( 4 ) at ambient temperature resulted in a rapid displacement of the thf ligand by the stable heterocyclic carbene to yield the arduengo carbene methyltitanocene cation complex 6a ( > <nUm> % isolated ) . the x-ray crystal structure analysis of 6a showed that the heteroatom - stabilized carbene ligand [ d(Ti-C(carbene) = <nUm> Å , d(Ti-CH3) = <nUm> Å ] wa bonded to titanium in an orientation where the imidazol-2-ylidene ring lie in the major s-ligand plane of the bent metallocene moiety . A DFT calculation of 6a and a series of related model compound ha revealed that the arduengo carbene serf a a pure s-donor ligand to the titanocene moiety . the observed favored " in-plane " orientation of the ligand is steric in origin . consequently , complex 6a attains an analogous Cs - symmetric structure in solution , featuring symmetry - equivalent cp ring and a pair of diastereotopic isopropyl substituents a well a chemically differentiated imidazol-2-ylidene C4H = C5H group . the reaction of the ion pair [(Cp2ZrCH3)+CH3B(C6F5] 3- ] ( 7 ) with <nUm> gave the analogous arduengo carbene zirconocene cation complex 6b ( > <nUm> % isolated , with [CH3B(C6F5)3-] anion ) . the reaction of BrC5Cl2H5Zr with <nUm> equiv of K(2,4-C7H11) and <nUm> equiv of dmpe wa found to lead to the 18-electron half - open zirconocene Zr(C5H5)(2,4-C7H11)(dmpe) ( C7H11 = dimethylpentadienyl ; dmpe = Me2PC2H4PMe2 ) , which ha been fully characterized . A structural study ha revealed that the Zr-C bond distance for the open dienyl ligand are significantly shorter than those for the CH ligand . alternatively , through a similar reaction involving the use of only <nUm> equiv of a more selective (pentadienyl)magnesium reagent , the two dienyl anion serve a one - electron reducing agent , and the Zr (II) complex Zr(C5H5)(Br)(dmpe)2 is obtained , which ha also been fully characterized . In the absence of dmpe , the reaction between BrC5Cl2H5Zr and <nUm> equiv of the magnesium reagent lead to an unusual C19H26Zr complex . the C2H3 ligand wa formed from the coupling of two 2,4-C7H11 ligand , followed by the loss of one hydrogen atom , presumably abstracted by the third 2,4-C7H11 ligand . the C2H3 ligand bond to the zirconium center through both e5-dienyl and e4- " diene " coordination , leading to an 18-electron complex . the structural parameter indicate that the diene coordination can be more appropriately described a enediyl coordination , leading to a formal Zr(IV) instead of Zr (II) complex . the presence of a high formal metal oxidation state would seem to explain the fact that in this complex , a opposed to Zr(C5H5)(2,4-C7H11)(dmpe) and many other related complex , the M-C bond distance for the CH ligand are much shorter than those for the open dienyl ligand . the zirconocene - alkyne complex Cp2Zr(py)(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3 ) reacts with methyl vinyl ketone to yield the zirconadihydrofuran Cp2ZrOCMe = C2H3 ( 1 ) . In contrast , rac-(ebthi)Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) ( ebthi = 1,2-ethylene-1,1'-bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl) reacts with methyl vinyl ketone giving , for the first time , the 1,4-conjugated insertion product rac - (ebthi)ZrOCMe = CHCH2C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3) ( 2 ) in good yield . an x-ray crystallographic structure determination of <nUm> show that the seven - membered ring is twisted in such a way to fit the steric demand of the " ebthi " and SiMe3 group . treating rac-(ebthi)Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) with tert-butyl acrylate give the zirconadihydrofuran rac - (ebthi)ZrOC(OtBu) = C2H3 ( 3 ) . the monomeric structure of <nUm> ha been established by x-ray crystallography . A different type of zirconadihydrofuran , rac - (ebthi)ZrOCMe(CH = CH2 ) - C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3) ( 4 ) , result from the reaction with mesityl oxide . complex analogous to <nUm> and <nUm> were observed consecutively by NMR in the reaction of Thi2Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3 ) ( thi = e5-tetrahydroindenyl ) with methyl vinyl ketone . this let one conclude that the carbonyl insertion product ( e.g. <nUm> ) are formed first a intermediate . finally , rac-(ebthi)ZrCH2CHMe = C2H3 ( 5 ) , a zirconacyclopentene , is obtained from rac-(ebthi)Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) and isoprene . the Et3N - assisted condensation of the ferriomethyl-silanol Cp(OC)2Fe-CH2-SiMe2OH ( 1 ) with <nUm> equiv of Cp2MCl2 ( m = Ti ( 2a ) , Zr ( 2b ) ) lead to the formation of the iron fragment substituted heterosiloxanes Cp(OC)2Fe-CH2-SiMe2O-M(Cl)Cp2 ( m = Ti ( 3a ) , Zr ( 3b ) ) . the bis(siloxy) zirconium complex [Cp(OC)2Fe-CH2-SiMe2O]2-ZrCp2 ( 4 ) is obtained by further condensation of the M-Cl functionality of 3b with <nUm> . the new compound have been identified spectroscopically , and in addition , 3b and <nUm> have been structurally characterized by single - crystal x-ray diffraction method . the reaction of Cl4Ti with (chlorodimethylsilyl)(trimethylsilyl)cyclopentadiene result in the chemoselective elimination of Me3SiCl and cleanly affords ((chlorodimethylsilyl)cyclopentadienyl)titanium trichloride ( 2 ) . likewise , the reaction of Cl4Ti with (chlorodimethylsilyl)(trimethylsilyl)tetramethylcyclopentadiene ( 6 ) also result in the chemoselective elimination of Me3SiCl and cleanly affords ((chlorodimethylsilyl)tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)titanium trichloride ( 7 ) . this observation is in sharp contrast to the reaction of <nUm> with Cl4Zr , which result in the chemoselective elimination of Me3SiCl but affords a mixture of half - sandwich and zirconocene complex . support of complex <nUm> or <nUm> on (aminomethyl)polystyrene ( AMPS , <nUm> % cross-linking , <nUm> wt % N , <nUm> mmol of N / g of support ) , where the mole ratio of amine content of the support to precursor catalyst wa selected to be <nUm> : <nUm> , lead to the assembly of the constrained - geometry catalyst ( CGCs ) <nUm> or <nUm> , respectively . from the 29Si NMR , the presence of a single silicon specie wa observed in complex <nUm> , which ha been attributed to the CGC form . however , for <nUm> two silicon resonance were observed , one of which ha been attributed to the CGC form and the other to a titanium amide moiety . the Ti : Si : Cl ratio for both <nUm> and <nUm> wa found to be <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> through elemental analysis . complex <nUm> and <nUm> , in conjunction with MAO a the cocatalyst , were tested for ethylene homopolymerization and ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization . the thermal property and the molecular weight of the resulting polymer were determined . the observation of ethylene-co-1-octene provides independent evidence for the formation of supported CGC from the synthetic protocol . binuclear siloxyaluminum methyl complex of the type Me2Al(m-OSiR3)2AlMe2 react with protonated N,N-dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate , with release of CH4 , to form the dimethylaniline (DMA)-stabilized siloxyaluminum methyl cation Me2Al(m-OSiR3)2AlMe(NMe2 (C6H5)+ . these cation abstract a cl- ligand from CH Cl2Zr , to give the dinuclear cation {(C5H5)2ZrCl}2(m-Cl)+ , and a CH3- ligand from C12H16Zr , to give by way of the DMA - stabilized cation (C5H5)2Zr(CH3)NMe2(C 6H5)+ the CH - activation product (C5H5)2ZrCH2NMe(C6 H5)+ ; reaction with Me2Si(ind)2 ZrMe2 in toluene solution yield a moderately active catalyst for ethene polymerization . this reactivity of siloxyaluminum methyl cation is qualitatively similar to , although substantially lower than , that of a silica gel surface treated with trimethylaluminum and a cationizing agent . treatment of 6-(dimethylamino)-6-methylpentafulvene ( 2a ) with methyllithium in ether at <nUm> ° C lead to CH3 addition to the C6 - fulvene carbon atom to yield the [C5H4-CMe2N-Me2]Li reagent 3a , whereas treatment of 2a with MeLi in THF at <nUm> ° C result in deprotonation with formation of [ C5H4-C( = CH2 ) - NMe2]Li ( 4a ) . In contrast , treatment of 6-diethylamino-6-methylfulvene ( 2b ) with methyllithium under any of these condition lead only to H+ - abstraction to give [ C5H4-C( = CH2 ) - NEt2]Li ( 4b ) . treatment of the reagent <nUm> with CpZrCl3 yield the enamino-Cp - substituted bent metallocenes [ e5-C5H4-C( = CH2 ) - NR2 ] CpZrCl2 5a ( r = CH3 ) and 5b ( r = C2H5 ) , respectively . analogous treatment of 4b with zirconium tetrachloride gave the doubly functionalized zirconocene complex [ e5-C5H4-C( = CH2)-NEt2]2ZrCl2 ( 6b ) . the complex 5a , 5b , and 6b were characterized by x-ray diffraction . treatment of 3a with CpZrCl3 gave [e5-C5H4-CMe2-NMe2]Cp Cl2Zr ( 8a ) ; the analogous reaction with Cl4Zr gave [e5-C5H4-CMe2-NMe2] 2ZrCl2 ( 8b ) . both complex <nUm> reacted with (butadiene)magnesium with replacement of both chloride ligand at zirconium . the probably generated (e4-butadiene)zirconocene complex were , however , not stable under the applied reaction condition , but reacted further by C-H activation at the N-CH3 group with intramolecular hydrogen transfer to the butadiene ligand to yield the cyclometalated product [ e5-C5H4-CMe2- N(CH3)-CH2-]Zr(L)(CH2CHCHCH3) 13a ( L = cp ) and 13b ( L = [e5-C5H4CMe2-NMe2] ) , respectively . complex 5a reacts analogously with (butadiene)magnesium to yield the C-H activation product [ e5-C5H4-C( = = CH2)-N(CH3 )-CH2-]ZrCp(CH2CHCHCH3) <nUm> . the 1-diethylaminoethenyl-Cp - substituted system 5b and 6b react differently with (butadiene)magnesium . they form the stable e4-butadiene complex s-trans-15 and s-cis15A / B ( from 5b ) and s-trans-17 and s-cis-17 ( from 6b ) , respectively . [N]CH activation wa not observed in these case . treatment of the cyclometalated product 13a , <nUm> , and <nUm> with BC18F15 gave active homogeneous ziegler - natta catalyst for ethene polymerization , whereas the system 13b / BC18F15 and <nUm> / BC18F15 were close to inactive under comparable condition . Cp2Zr(e2-benzocyclobutadiene)(PMe3) , a rare e2-cyclobutadiene complex , wa investigated . the stabilization of a cyclobutadiene by a rare e2 coordination mode wa described . the coupling reaction of the complex with alkyne , nitrile , and isocyanides yielded zirconocene cyclobutene derivative , including a unique dewar-naphthalene structure . reduction of [ ZrCl2{e5-C5Me4(SiMe3 )}2 ] ( 1 ) with excess magnesium in tetrahydrofuran affords a mixture of the monomeric zirconocene hydride [ ZrH{e1:e5-C5Me4- (SiMe2CH2)}{e5-C5Me4( SiMe3 ) } ] ( 2 ) and the dimeric , tetranuclear Zr(III)- and Zr(IV) - magnesium hydride complex <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . In the presence of bis(trimethylsilyl)ethyne ( btmse ) , a similar reduction yield the e2-alkyne complex [ Zr{e5-C5Me4(SiMe3)}2 - ( e2-btmse ) ] ( 5 ) a the major product and compound 2-4 a minor impurity . upon thermolysis under vacuum , <nUm> undergoes a 2-fold hydrogen transfer from trimethylsilyl group in the zirconocene intermediate to leaving btmse to afford [ Zr{e5:e1-C5Me4 (SiMe2CH2)}- <nUm> ] ( 6 ) and a mixture of alkene (E)- and (Z)-Me3SiCH = CHSiMe3 ( e ≫ z ) . crystal structure of compound <nUm> and 4-6 were determined by x-ray crystallography . the rate of reductive elimination a a function of alkyl ligand ha been measured for a series of zirconocene alkyl hydride complex , Cp*Cp''Zr(R)H ( cp* = e5-C5Me5 , cp'' = e5-C5H3-1,3-(SiMe3)2 , r = CH3 , C4H9 , C8H17 , CH2cC6H11 , CH2CHMe2 , CH2 - CMe3 ) , where the steric disposition of the alkyl ligand ha been systematically varied . the rate of reductive elimination increase modestly a the steric bulk of the alkyl ligand is increased . this trend is attributed to ground state destabilization arising from unfavorable steric interaction between the alkyl ligand and the cyclopentadienyl substituents . the effect is magnified when more voluminous cyclopentadienyl ligand are incorporated into the metallocene framework . thus , the Cp*Cp'''Zr(R)H ( cp''' = e5-C5H2-1,2,4- (SiMe3)3 , r = CH3 , CH2 C3H7 , C8H17 ) series of alkyl hydride complex lose alkane more readily than the corresponding Cp*Cp''Zr(R)H complex . In addition , the rate of reductive elimination ha also been examined for Cp*Cp''Zr(Ph)(H) and Cp*Cp''Zr(CH2Ph)H ( ph = C6H5 ) and is slower than the alkyl hydride series . the sluggish rate of reductive elimination are a result of ground state stabilization imparted by a strong zirconium-phenyl bond and by e2 coordination of the benzyl ligand , respectively . this interaction , along with the solid state structure of Cp*Cp''Zr(CH3)H , ha been characterized by x-ray diffraction . the kinetic data led to the synthesis of Cp*2Zr(CH2CMe3)H , which undergoes reductive elimination of alkane and coordination of dinitrogen . the reaction of bridged tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl fragment with <nUm> molar equiv of potassium tert-butoxide allow the generation of a,o-oligosilyl dianions ( 1a , 2a , 3a , 4a ) . depending on the nature of the spacer between the oligosilyl unit , these compound can be used to generate either linear or cyclic derivative . they are especially attractive for the formation of homo- and heterocyclosilanes , a exemplified by the synthesis of sila- , stanna- , and zirconocena-cyclosilanes . A linear bis(potassiumsilyl)acetylene ( 4a ) wa used to bridge two zirconocene unit , ( Cp2Zr(Cl)Si(SiMe3)2CCSi(SiMe3) 2Zr(Cl)Cp2 ) ( 11 ) . density functional theory calculation at the B3LYP level were performed to study the electronic structure of a recently synthesized zirconocene complex , Cp2ZrCHRCCCHR ( r = SiMe3 ) . through detailed bonding analysis and stability study , we conclude that the originally proposed metallacyclopentyne form can not adequately describe the complex . instead , a resonance hybrid between a cumulene complex form and a metallacyclopentyne lewis structure is required to account for the structure and stability of the complex . the sequential reaction of 9-fluorenyllithium and CpNa with ( iPr ) 2NBCl <nUm> followed by the sequential treatment with LDA and ClZr <nUm> afforded [ ( η 5-C 13H 8)BN( i-Pr ) <nUm> ( η 5-C 5H 5H 4)ZrCl <nUm> ( 2e ) . the structure of 2e wa determined by x-ray diffraction , which show that the molecule ha C s symmetry . on activation by excess methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) 2e wa converted to an active catalyst for polymerization of ethylene and propylene . the polypropylene is syndiotactic ( <nUm> % rr triad ) . reaction of a particularly bulky silanol , (2,4,6-Me3C6H2)3SiOH , with Al2Me6 give , instead of the otherwise preferred unreactive binuclear siloxalanes with two siloxy bridge , a binuclear siloxalane with one siloxy and one methyl bridge , Me2Al(m-OSi(2,4,6-Me3C6 H2)3)(m-Me)AlMe2 . this specie reacts with zirconocene dichloride under chloride / methyl exchange ; with the cationizing reagent PhMe2NH+B(C6 F5)4- it form the B(C6 F5)4- salt of the mononuclear cation AlMe2(NPhMe2)2+ . A superphane consisting of one thiophene ring and one CpCo - stabilized cyclobutadiene ring , <nUm> , wa prepared in an eight - step synthesis from 5-cyclodecynol protected with tert-butyldimethylsilyl , <nUm> . the first key step in this sequence wa the reaction of <nUm> with zirconocene and subsequently with ClS to yield the tricyclic thiophene derivative <nUm> . the second key step wa the ring closure of <nUm> with CpCo(COD) to give <nUm> . x-ray structural investigation of <nUm> and <nUm> confirmed the structural assignment . evidence for the close proximity of the CpCo - stabilized cyclobutadiene and the thiophene ring is also given by the electronic absorption spectrum of <nUm> and the oxidation potential ( <nUm> V ) . hydride abstraction reaction of the zirconocene cyclic organohydroborate complex cp 2ZrH{(mH) 2BR <nUm> } ( r <nUm> = C 4H <nUm> ; C 3H <nUm> , <nUm> ) with B(C 8F <nUm> ) <nUm> were observed a a function of solvent . the reaction in poorly coordinating solvent , benzene and toluene , form [ HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - salt of Zr-H-Zr hydrogen - bridged cation [ (m-H){Cp 2Zr(m-H) 2BR <nUm> } <nUm> ] + ( r <nUm> = C 4H <nUm> , <nUm> ; C 8H <nUm> , <nUm> ) , in which there is no direct metal - metal bonding between the bridged metal . the unsupported hydrogen - bridged bond in complex <nUm> wa cleaved when it wa dissolved in the coordinating solvent THF to produce the neutral complex <nUm> and the ionic complex [ cp 2Zr(THF){(m-H) 2BC 6H 14}][HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] . In the coordinating solvent , diethyl ether , the salt of [ cp 2Zr(OEt 2)X ] +[HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - ( x = OEt , <nUm> ; { ( -H ) 2BC 8H <nUm> } , <nUm> ) consisting of zirconocene cation with coordinated solvent ligand were isolated . the formation of <nUm> involves hydride insertion from zirconium into the carbon oxygen bond of one the coordinated ether , resulting in the liberation of ethane and the formation of an ethoxyl group coordinated to zirconium . the diethyl ether molecule in the cation <nUm> and <nUm> are weakly coordinated to Zr and are displaced in THF solution . single - crystal x-ray structure of <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were determined . standard ligand - substitution reaction afforded moderate yield of ( PhC 5H <nUm> ) 2ZrCl <nUm> ( 1 ) , ( 1,3-Ph 2C 5H 3)CpZrCl <nUm> ( 2 ) , [ 1,3,-(C 6F <nUm> ) 2C 5H 3]CpZrCl <nUm> ( 5 ) , and [ 1,2,4-(C 6F <nUm> ) 2C 5H 3]CpZrCl <nUm> ( 6 ) . crystal structure of <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and [ ( C 6F 5C 5H <nUm> ] 2HfMe <nUm> ( 7 ) were obtained . physicochemical study ( CV , IR ) show that C 6F <nUm> group are strongly electron - withdrawing compared to phenyl group . In ethylene-1-hexene copolymerization reaction using <nUm> , <nUm> , ( C 6F 5C 5H 4)CpZrCl <nUm> ( 3 ) , ( C 6F 5C 5H <nUm> ) 2ZrCl <nUm> ( 4 ) , and <nUm> ( toluene solution , methylalumoxane cocatalyst ) , C 6F <nUm> substituents decrease catalytic activity but increase comonomer incorporation compared to phenyl substituents . the alternating copolymerization of CO and ethene at the zirconocene center Cp2Zr , Me2-SiCp2Zr , and rac-Me2SiInd2Zr wa investigated by DFT method . CO coordinate much more strongly than ethene but ha a rather high insertion barrier . thus , propagation is slowed dramatically but the growing chain will not necessarily all incorporate CO . secondary alkyl insert CO more efficiently than primary alkyl . after the first CO insertion , subsequent olefin and CO insertion will alternate . olefin insertion will be very slow at high CO pressure , but at low [CO] the olefin and CO insertion barrier are comparable and are lower than that of the first CO insertion . use of CO a a quenching and chain - counting method appears to be safe , provided a high pressure of CO is employed and the quenched reaction is not worked up at low temperature . the dual - site zirconocene dichloride rac - and meso-SiMe2(3- benzylindenyl)(indenyl)ZrCl2 have been synthesized and used , after a methylaluminoxane activation , in propene polymerization . these diastereomers produce isotactic polypropene with similar microstructures and molar mass under equivalent polymerization condition . the complex [ Zr(e2-Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe 3)(e5-C5Me4R)2 ] ( r = me ( 5 ) , H ( 6 ) , SiMe3 ( 7 ) ) reacted smoothly with terminal alkyne HC ≡ CR ( ŕ = CMe3 , SiMe3 , ferrocenyl ( fc ) , ph ) to give the agostic alkenyl-alkynyl complex [ zr(e1- C ≡ CR){e3-C(SiMe3) = CH(SiMe 3)}(e5-C5Me4R)2 ] ( r / ŕ = me / CMe3 ( 5a ) , me / SiMe3 ( 5b ) , H / CMe <nUm> ( 6a ) , H / SiMe3 ( 6b ) , H / fc ( 6c ) , H / ph ( 6d ) , SiMe <nUm> / CMe3 ( 7a ) , SiMe3 / fc ( 7c ) ) . complex 7a , formed in situ from <nUm> and HC ≡ CCMe3 , dimerized tert-butylethyne exclusively to give the head - to - tail dimer Me3CC ≡ CC(CMe <nUm> ) = CH2 , and when all the terminal alkyne wa consumed , <nUm> wa restored . complex <nUm> reacted similarly with 1-hexyne , phenylethyne , and (trimethylsilyl)ethyne , affording the respective alkenyl-alkynyl complex , which also changed back to <nUm> on evaporation of the reaction solution ; none of these terminal alkyne wa dimerized with 5-7 . heating of complex <nUm> with CLi ≡ CSiMe3 in toluene or THF yielded the diamagnetic zirconate complex Li[Zr(e1-C ≡ CSiMe3)(e2- Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3)(e5-C 5HMe4)2 ] ( 6e ) and it solvatomorph Li[Zr(e1-C ≡ CSiMe3)(e2-Me 3SiC ≡ CSiMe3)(e5-C5HMe 4)2]*C4H8O ( 6f ) , respectively . the lithium cation in 6e and 6f is placed in a position at the side of the alkynyl triple bond and close to C3 of the e2-Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ligand , apparently interacting with both moiety . all presented complex were characterized by the standard spectral method , and the structure of 5a , 6a , 6c , 6d , and 6e were determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . A series of metallocene - containing silsesquioxanes with alkenylsilyl and trimethylsilyl group , cp' <nUm> M[(c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Si <nUm> O <nUm> ](OSiMe <nUm> r ) ( 2b-d , 3b-d , 4d , 5d : cp' = cp ( cyclopentadienyl ) , cp* ( pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ) ; m = Ti , Zr , Hf , r = methyl , vinyl , allyl ) , have been synthesized . the structure of the complex cp <nUm> M[(c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Si <nUm> O <nUm> ](OSiMe <nUm> CH <nUm> CH = CH <nUm> ) ( m = Zr ( 3d ) , Hf ( 5d ) ) have been unambiguously established by single - crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . silylation or germylation of the zirconocene - containing silsesquioxane monosilanol cp <nUm> Zr[(c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Si <nUm> O <nUm> ](OH) ( 3a ) or it hafnocene derivative cp <nUm> Hf[(c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> -Si <nUm> O <nUm> ](OH) ( 5a ) , which can be prepared by the careful reaction of the silsesquioxane trisilanol ( c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Si <nUm> O <nUm> ( OH ) <nUm> ( 1a ) with zirconocene dichloride or hafnocene dichloride , yield the new series of metallocene - containing silsesquioxanes cp <nUm> Zr[(c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Si <nUm> O <nUm> ](OSiMe <nUm> H ) ( 3e ) , cp <nUm> -Zr[(c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Si <nUm> O <nUm> ](OGeMe <nUm> ) ( 3f ) , and cp <nUm> Hf[(c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Si <nUm> O <nUm> ](OSiMe <nUm> H ) ( 5e ) . the reaction of 3e with <nUm> equiv of hydrogen chloride result in the formation of the dimethylsilyl-containing silsesquioxane disilanol ( c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Si <nUm> O <nUm> ( OH ) <nUm> ( OSiMe <nUm> H ) ( 1e ) , indicating the applicability of metallocene moiety a protecting group of two adjacent silanol group . silsesquioxanes bearing alkenylsilyl group can be easily converted to derivative with ethoxysilyl group , cp <nUm> M[(c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Si <nUm> O <nUm> ] [ OSiMe <nUm> ( CH <nUm> ) <nUm> SiMe <nUm> ( OEt ) ] ( m = Ti ( <nUm> g ) , Zr ( <nUm> g ) ) , by the hydrosilylative reaction . the preliminary examination of the catalytic activity of these metallocene - containing silsesquioxanes toward the epoxidation of cyclohexene by tert-butyl hydroperoxide revealed that titanocene - containing silsesquioxanes ( 2b-d ) show modest catalytic activity . the presence of alkenylsilyl group ha been found to accelerate the reaction , especially in the case of titanium - bridged silsesquioxanes . the zirconocene methyl cation [ ( C 5R 5)ZrMe(ClC 6D <nUm> ) ] [ B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( C 5R <nUm> = C 5H <nUm> ( 1a ) , C 5H 4Me ( 1b ) ) react with PhSiH <nUm> in the dark to yield [ { ( C 5R <nUm> ) 2Zr(m-H) } 2][B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] <nUm> ( 5a , b ) and a mixture of ph xMe yH zSi product . the reaction proceeds by initial Zr-C / Si-H s-bond metathesis via a four - center transition state in which Si is β to Zr . In the presence of light , significant amount of [ { ( C 5R <nUm> ) 2Zr(m-Cl) } <nUm> ] [ B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] <nUm> ( 4a,b ) are formed by photochemical reaction of ( C 5R <nUm> ) 2ZrH + specie with the chlorobenzene solvent . the azazirconacycle [ rac-(EBI)Zr{e 2(C,N)-CH 2CHMe(6-phenyl-2-pyridyl) } ] [ B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( <nUm> , EBI = 1,2-ethylene-bis-indenyl ) doe not react with PhSiH <nUm> at <nUm> ° C . however at <nUm> ° C , <nUm> deinserts propene to afford the η 2-pyridyl complex [ rac-(EBI)Zr{e 2(C,N)-(6-phenyl-2-pyridyl)}][B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 6 ) , which is catalytically isomerized to [ rac-(EBI)Zr{e 2(C,N)-2-(2-pyridyl)phenyl}][B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 7 ) by PhSiH <nUm> . the key step in this process is Zr-G / Si-H s-bond metathesis of <nUm> with PhSiH <nUm> via a transition state in which Si is α to Zr . the le crowded azazirconacycle [ cp 2Zr{e 2(C,N)-CH 2CHMe-(6-methyl-2-pyridyl) }][B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 3 ) reacts with PhSiH <nUm> directly to afford [ { cp 2Zr(SiPhH <nUm> ) } <nUm> ] - [ B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] <nUm> ( 8 ) via a transition state in which Si is α to Zr . steric factor may play a role in determining the selectivity of these reaction . the sterically shielded cation rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-t-Bu-C 5H2)2ZrMe+ , generated by reaction of rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-t-Bu-C5H2) 2ZrMe2 with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) or with dimethyl-anilinium or trityl perfluorotetraphenylborate , differs from other , more open zirconocene methyl cation in that it doe not form the symmetric AlMe3 adduct rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-t-Bu-C5H 2)2Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2+ . instead , the unsymmetric ternary adduct rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C 5H2)2ZrMe(m-Me)AlMe3-NMe 2Ph+ is formed in the presence of dimethylaniline and trimethylaluminum . UV / vi and 1H NMR characteristic of hydrocarbon solution containing rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-t-Bu-C5H 2)2ZrMe+ ⋯ B(C6F 5)4- or rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-t-Bu-C 5H2)2ZrMe+ ⋯ MAOMe- indicate that cation - anion association in these ion pair is unusually weak . the rather exotic and uncommon five - membered metallacyclocumulenes ( 1-metallacyclopenta-2,3,4-trienes ) Cp'2M(e4- RC4R ) ( cp' = substituted e5-cyclopentadienyl ) are formed by " ci " complexation of titanocene or zirconocene fragment with 1,3-butadiynes or by coupling of two s-acetylide group in the coordination sphere of the metal . example of these complex , cp 2M(e4-RC4R) ( m = Zr , r = t-Bu ; m = Ti , r = t-Bu , r = ph ) , Cp*2M(e4-RC4R') ( m = Zr , r = R' = Me3Si , me , ph , t-BuMe2Si ; r = t-Bu , R' = C = C-t-Bu ) , ( e6-C5H 5BX)2Zr-(e4-RC4R) ( x = i-Pr-2N , r = ph ; x = ph , r = ph , et ) , ( e5 : n 1-C5Me4SiMe2N-t-Bu ) Ti(e4-RC4R) ( r = t-Bu , SiMe3 ) , and [ cp 2Zr]3[1,3,5-(e4-t-BuC4) 3C6H3 ] , are discussed with regard to their genesis , synthesis , dynamic , structure , and bonding . these compound are compared with the also uncommon and very similar five - membered metallacyclopentynes ( 1-metallacyclopent-3-ynes ) Cp'2M(e 4-R2C4R2 ) ( m = Zr : cp' = cp , R2 = t-Bu / H , Me3Si / H , H ; cp' = t-BuC5H4 , R2 = H ; m = Ti : cp' = cp , R2 = H ) formed by analogous " ci " complexation of 1,2,3-butatrienes , in term of their chemistry , structure , and bonding . furthermore , reaction in which metallacyclocumulenes were assumed to be intermediate are described , together with the reactivity of metallacyclocumulenes toward different complex and substrate : e.g. metal complex , carbon dioxide , diisobutylaluminum hydride , and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane . upon complexation with a second transition - metal complex fragment either bridging formal m- " ci " or m-mtrans " complex of 1,3-butadiynes and 1,2,3-butatrienes were formed . the zirconocene-ethylene complex and (Z)-1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)-1,2,3- butatriene reacted to give a mixture of 1-zirconacyclopent-3-yne and 1-zirconacyclohept-3-yne . A zirconocene - alkyne complex gave , on the other hand , 1-zirconacyclohept-2-en-5-yne , which wa structurally characterized a the major product along with a lesser amount of 1-zirconacyclopent-3-yne . A series of chiral ansa zirconocene compound that feature ( i ) [ me 2Si ] and [ me 4Si <nUm> ] bridge and ( ii ) two tert-butyl substituents on each cyclopentadienyl ring , namely , rac- [ me 2Si(CpBu <nUm> t ) <nUm> ] - ClZr <nUm> , rac - [ me 2Si(CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]Zr(Ph)Cl , rac - [ me 2Si(CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]ZrMe <nUm> , rac - [ me 2Si(CpBu <nUm> t ) 2],Zr(CO) <nUm> rac - [ me 4Si <nUm> ( CpBu <nUm> <nUm> ) 2]ZrCl <nUm> , and rac - [ me 4Si <nUm> ( CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]Zr(CO) <nUm> , ha been synthesized . In each case , the complex exists a the racemo isomer due to inter-ring steric interaction between the bu t substituents proximal to the ansa bridge that destabilize the meso isomer . rac - [ me 4Si 2-(CpBu <nUm> t ) 2ZrCl <nUm> is the first structurally characterized ansa zirconocene complex with a [ me 4-Si <nUm> ] bridge that adopts a racemo geometry . IR spectroscopic study on the dicarbonyl complex ( cp 1,3-Bu <nUm> t ) 2Zr(CO) <nUm> rac - [ me 2Si(CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]Zr(CO) <nUm> , and rac - [ me 4Si <nUm> ( CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]Zr(CO) <nUm> demonstrate that the [ me 2Si ] and [ me 4Si <nUm> ] ansa bridge have opposite electronic influence in this system , with the [ me 2Si ] bridge exerting an electron - withdrawing effect and the [ me 4-Si <nUm> ] bridge exerting an electron - donating effect . the [ me 2Si ] and [ me 4Si <nUm> ] bridge also exert a different influence with respect to olefin polymerization , with { rac - [ me 2Si(CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]ZrCl <nUm> / MAO } being a more active catalyst system for polymerization of ethylene than is either { ( cp 1,3-Bu <nUm> t ) 2ZrCl <nUm> / MAO } or { rac - [ me 4Si <nUm> ( CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]ZrCl <nUm> / MAO } . A 1-zirconacyclopent-3-yne complex ( 1 ) reacted with " zirconocene " to give a symmetrical , bimetallic 1,2,3-butatriene complex ( 6 ) in which butatriene coordinate to two equivalent zirconocene unit . treatment of <nUm> with trimethylphosphine gave the phosphine - stabilized zirconocene-1 complex ( 2 ) , which wa transformed into <nUm> by addition of triethylborane . the catalytic system of Cp2ZrCl2 and n-BuLi ( <nUm> equiv with respect to Zr ) promotes hydrosilation of styrene derivative in the markovnikov addition manner , which is the reverse regioselectivity compared to that for Zr - catalyzed olefin hydrosilation with the standard protocol ( Zr / n-BuLi = <nUm> / <nUm> ) . the reaction of sodium metal with cp 2ZrCl <nUm> and RGaCl <nUm> in hexane affords cp 2Zr(GaR) <nUm> ( r = -C 6H 3-2,6-(2,4,6-i-Pr 3C 6H <nUm> ) <nUm> ) a deep green - black air - sensitive crystal . essentially , cp 2Zr(GaR) <nUm> is isoelectronic with the well - known 18-electron zirconocene dicarbonyl , cp 2-Zr(CO) <nUm> , complex . the title compound is the first example of an organometallic compound containing Ga-Zr bond ( Ga-Zr = <nUm> Å ) . the synthesis ( 4a-d ) and structure ( 4a,c ) of the four crystalline , water - stable , hydrocarbon- and perfluorocarbon (PFC)-soluble fluorous zirconocene(IV) dichloride precatalysts [ Zr-{n5-C 5H4SiMe3-n(RF)n } 2Cl2 ] ( n = <nUm> , RF = C2H3 2C6F13 ( 4a ) , C8F17 ( 4b ) , C7F5H2 ( 4c ) ; n = <nUm> , RF = CH 2C6F5 ( 4d ) ) , possessing one to three fluorous alkyl or aryl group attached to the cyclopentadienyl ligand through a silicon atom and an additional methylene ( 4c,d ) or ethylene ( 4a ) spacer or no spacer at all ( 4b ) , are reported . A nonfluorous analogue of 4a , [ zr{n5- C5H4-SiMe2C8H17 } 2Cl2 ] ( 4e ) , wa prepared for comparison , and 4a wa easily converted to it dimethyl derivative [ Zr{n5-C5H 4SiMe2CH2CH2C6F 13}2Me2 ] ( 5a ) . the ethylene polymerization activity of the zirconocene dichloride were compared to those of the known bis-{(trimethylsilyl)cyclopentadienyl}zirconium dichloride [ zr{n5- C5 H4SiMe3}2Cl2 ] ( 4f ) , in both toluene and fluorous biphasic solvent ( FBS ) system . In the case of 4b a PE with a bimodal molecular weight distribution and a significantly lower molecular weight wa obtained . polymerization data and polymer property for 4a-d , compared to data for 4f , show a marked influence of the fluorous group and the alkyl spacer ( e.g. methylene in 4c or ethylene in 4a ) . FBS condition result in PE with a higher average molecular weight . evidence on the nature of the active specie formed when these precatalysts were treated with an excess of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) is presented . treatment of bis(propynyl)zirconocene with BC6F 5)3 result in a linear C-C coupling of the alkynyl ligand to form the zwitterionic complex <nUm> . it treatment with excess RC ≡ N yield an organometallic methylenecyclopropene derivative ( 6 ) . this reaction topologically requires a very endothermic substituted butenyne to methylenecyclopropene cyclization to become energetically feasible by suitable stabilization effect . A DFT study ha revealed that the <nUm> → <nUm> conversion is probably triggered by nitrile addition to the metal with formation of a planar-tetracoordinate carbon intermediate , featuring coordination of the three - membered carbocycle through one of it carbon-carbon σ bond . evaluation of the steric and electronic influence of a family of silyl-and alkyl-substituted indenyl liganda on zirconium and iron center ha been accomplished by a combination of x-ray diffraction , IR spectroscopy , solution NMR dynamic , and electrochemical measurement . three tetrasubstituted , bis-indenyl zirconocene dichloride complex have been characterized by x-ray diffraction and adopt a gauche ligand conformation such that the interaction between tertiary substituents on adjacent ring are minimized . similar solid state conformation were also observed in two of the corresponding iron compound . evaluation of the electronic environment about each zirconium center wa achieved by measurement of the CO stretching frequency of the dicarbonyl derivative . simple inductive effect govern the electronic property of each zirconocene where silyl group are relatively electron withdrawing and alkyl group electron donating . for the most hindered zirconocene dicarbonyl derivative , population of three vibrationally distinct rotamers ha been detected by IR spectroscopy . independent assessment of these stereoelectronic parameter by variable - temperature NMR spectroscopy and electrochemistry with the analogous series of iron complex provided the same relative ordering of the indenyl ligand . the structure and relative energy of onsa - zirconocene bis-amide complex were studied by DFT computation . x-ray crystal structure and experimental trend in DE rac - meso value for a series of zirconocenes with terminal and chelated bis-amide ligand were reproduced with reasonable accuracy by B3LYP / LANL2DZ / / B3LYP / LANL2MB . In the absence of overriding steric interaction , the most stable conformation of Zr{PhN(CH <nUm> ) 3NPh } ring in zirconocenes is the twist conformation . for ( C 5H <nUm> ) 2Zr{PhN(CH <nUm> ) 3NPh } ( 5 ) , the twist conformer is <nUm> kcal / mol more stable than the chair and <nUm> kcal / mol more stable than the boat . rac - (MBSBI)Zr{PhN(CH <nUm> ) 3NPh } ( rac-3 ; MBSBI = me 2Si(2-Me-4,5- benzindenyl ) <nUm> ) is <nUm> kcal / mol more stable than the meso isomer because the latter specie must undergo a combination of distortion to accommodate the favored twist conformation of the Zr{PhN - ( CH <nUm> ) 3NPh } ring . these distortion include a significant η 3-slip and an exaggerated angle between the C6 and C5 ring plane for one benzindenyl ligand and a subtle flattening of the Zr{PhN(CH <nUm> ) 3NPh } ring . In contrast , rac - (MBSBI)Zr{PhN(CH <nUm> ) 2NPh } ( rac-7 ) is only <nUm> kcal / mol more stable than the meso isomer . In this case , the Zr{PhN(CH <nUm> ) 2NPh } ring adopts an envelope conformation in which one N-P / i ring lie in the N-Zr-N plane and steric interaction on the crowded side of the meso metallocene unit are minimized . these result provide insight into the origin of rac / meso selectivity in chelate - controlled synthesis of ansazirconocenes based on the reaction of Zr bis-amide compound with lithium arcsa-bis-indenyl and cyclopentadienyl reagent . summary : In reaction of the zirconocene 2-vinylpyridine complex cp 2Zr(2-vipy) ( 1 ) with iBu2AlH and iBu2AlF the isostructural complex [ cp 2Zr(m-e1:e2-2-CH2CH- C5H4N)-(m-W][iBu2Al] ( 3 ) and [ Cp2Zr(m-e1:e2-2-CH 2CH-C5H4N)(m-F)][iBu 2Al ] ( 5 ) were formed . these complex can serve a model for the transfer of fluorine from zirconium to aluminum ( Zr-F with Al-H to Zr-H and Al-F ) found in the reaction of rac - (ebthi)ZrF2 with iBu2AlH to form the dimeric complex [ rac-(ebthi)ZrH(m- H)]2 ( 6 ) . the compound are important in obtaining an understanding of the activation of zirconocene fluoro complex by ' BusAl and of the role of iBu2AlH in activation process for the catalytic polymerization of olefin . C1 - bridged and Me2Si - bridged 2,5-dimethylcylcopentadienyl ansa - zirconocene complex , [ Me(H)C(C5H4)(2,5-Me 2C5H2)]ZrCl2 ( 6 ) , [ ( CH 3CH2CH2)(H)C(C5H4)(2,5- Me2C5H2)]ZrCl2 ( 9 ) , [(Me)(H)C(2,5-Me2C5H2)2]ZrCl <nUm> ( 13 ) , and [ Me2Si(2,5-Me2C5H2) 2]ZrCl2 ( 15 ) , are prepared by using 2-bromo-3-methoxy-2,5- dimethylcyclopentene ( 7 ) a a starting material . solid structure of <nUm> and <nUm> were determined by x-ray crystallography . the C1 - bridged zirconocene complex <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> are highly active for ethylene / norbornene copolymerization with high incorporation of norbornene , while the Me2Si - bridged complex <nUm> show relatively low activity . complex <nUm> show the highest activity and the highest incorporation of norbornene among the complex , but the molecular weight of the obtained polymer is relatively low . density functional theory calculation at the B3LYP level have been performed to investigate the mechanism of the zirconocene - catalyzed addition of the ortho C-H bond of a-picoline to propene to produce 2-Me-6- iPr-pyridine . the computational result support the proposed mechanism , which involves ( i ) 2-Me-pyridine dissociation from [ cp 2Zr(2-Me-6-pyridyl)(2-Me-pyridine) ] + followed by the insertion of propene into the Zr-C bond of the η 2-pyridyl complex cp 2Zr(e 2-2-Me-6-pyridyl ) + ( 1 ) to yield the azametallacycle cp 2Zr{e 2-C,N-CH 2CHMe-(2- me-6-pyridyl ) } + ( 2 ) , ( ii ) hydrogenolysis of <nUm> to produce cp 2Zr(H)(2-Me-6- iPr-pyridine)+ ( 3 ) , ( iii ) ligand substitution of <nUm> by a-picoline to release 2-Me-6- iPr-pyridine and form cp 2Zr(H)(2-Me-pyridine) + ( 4 ) , and ( iv ) C-H activation of <nUm> to release H <nUm> and regenerate <nUm> . consistent with the experimental result , the 2-Me-pyridine dissociation from [ cp 2Zr(2-Me-6-pyridyl)(2-Me-pyridine) ] + followed by the propene insertion of <nUm> and the hydrogenolysis of <nUm> are calculated to be the rate - determining step . the calculation provide new insight into the role of the cocatalyst H <nUm> , the origin of the regioselectivity of the C-H activation and insertion step , and the preference for a-picoline / propene coupling over propene hydrogenation . starting from zirconocene bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complex Cp'2Zr(L)(e2btmsa) via the 2-vinylpyridine complex Cp'2Zr(2-vipy) a novel synthetic method for zirconocene difluoride and alkyl monofluoride complex wa elaborated . example with selected different ligand system cp'2 [ cp2 = bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl) ; ebthi = 1,2-ethylene-1,1'- bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl) ; (thi)2 = bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl) ; Me2Si(e5- C5H4)2 = dimethylsilylbis-(e5- cyclopentadienyl ) ; (i)2 = bis(e5-indenyl) ; ebi = 1,2-ethylene-1,1'-bis(e5-indenyl) ; and me 2Si(e5-C9H10)2 = dimethylsilyl-1,1'-bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl) ] were synthesized . In the series of these investigation new complex ( i ) 2Zr(THF)(e2-btmsa) ( 1 ) , rac - (ebi)Zr(THF) ( e2-btmsa ) ( 2 ) , (thi)2Zr(2-vipy) ( 3 ) , me 2Si(e5-C5H4)2Zr(2- vipy ) ( 4 ) , (i)2Zr(2-vipy) ( 5 ) , and rac-(ebthi)-Zr(2-Ph-vipy) ( 6 ) were prepared a starting material . different method for preparation of the zirconocene difluorides rac - (ebthi)ZrF2 ( 7 ) , ( thi ) 2ZrF2 ( 8 ) , Me4C2(e5- C5H4)2ZrF2 ( 9 ) , and me 2Si(e5-C9H10) 2ZrF2 ( 10 ) and the monofluorides Cp2Zr(F) ( CH2CH2-2-Py ) ( 11 ) , rac-(ebthi)-Zr(F)(CH 2CH2-2-Py ) ( 12 ) , (thi)2Zr(F)(CH 2CH2-2-py ) ( 13 ) , Me2Si(e5-C 5H4)2Zr(F)(CH2CH2-2-py) ( 14 ) , and Me2Si(e5-C9H10) 2ZrF(Me) ( 15 ) are reported and compared . the molecular structure of the bis-e5-tetrahydroindenyl complex <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were confirmed by x-ray crystal structure analysis . enolizable ketone and thiols have been investigated a potential transfer agent for methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) polymerization mediated by the cp <nUm> ZrMe <nUm> / B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> system . addition of 1-10 equiv of acetophenone , acetone , or thiophenols inhibits polymerization , while the system tolerates the presence of tert-butylthiol ( tBuSH ) . In this case , a moderate decrease in the molecular weight of the PMMAs is observed . the stoichiometric reactivity of these organic acid toward the cationic ester enolate complex [ cp <nUm> Zr(THF)(O(tBuO)C = CMe <nUm> ) ] + [ MeB-(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - ( 1 ) , which model the active specie for MMA polymerization , ha been investigated . ketone undergo aldolization reaction with <nUm> to generate specie that are inactive in MMA polymerization . thiols readily cleave the Zr-O bond of <nUm> to give [ cp <nUm> Zr(SR)(THF) ] + cation ( r = tBu , <nUm> ; SC <nUm> H <nUm> -p-Cl , <nUm> ; SC <nUm> H <nUm> -o-OMe , <nUm> ) . the crystal structure of <nUm> ha been determined . In the presence of a tert-butyl ester R'CO <nUm> tBu , thiolato complex <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> smoothly decompose into the corresponding cationic carboxylato complex [ cp <nUm> Zr(THF)(O <nUm> CR' ) ] + ( R' = iPr , <nUm> ; CH <nUm> , <nUm> ) and thiol RSH , with release of isobutene . tert-Butylthiolato complex <nUm> and the in situ combination cp <nUm> Zr(StBu)Me / B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> polymerized quantitatively MMA in toluene to yield PMMAs with narrow dispersity ( m n / m w = <nUm> - <nUm> ) , but with molecular weight much higher than the expected m n value , consistent with poor initiation efficiency and / or instability . A series of 2-R 2P - substituted indene , where r 2P = ph 2P , cy 2P , iPr 2P , and tBu(H)P , were obtained via Pd - catalyzed reaction of 2-bromo-1H-indene ( or 1H-inden-2-yl trifluoromethane sulfonate ) with r 2PH / et <nUm> N . analogous indene bearing me 2P , tBu(Cl)P , and tBu 2P substituants at position <nUm> were obtained through the reaction of 1H-inden-2-ylphosphonous dichloride with MeLi , tBuMgCl , and tBuMgCl / tBuLi - CCuN , respectively . diethyl 1H-inden-2-ylphosphonate , prepared via the Ni - catalyzed arbuzov reaction of 2-bromo-1H-indene with P(OEt) <nUm> , wa found to be a convenient starting material for the synthesis of 2-H 2P - substituted indene . 1H-Inden-2-yl(phenyl)phosphine , prepared via the Pd - catalyzed arylation of 2-H 2P - substituted indene by PhI , turned out to react with 2-bromo-1H-indene in the presence of Pd(PPh <nUm> ) <nUm> and et <nUm> N to form di(1H-inden-2-yl)(phenyl)phosphine in almost quantitative yield . analogously , di(1H-inden-2-yl)(tert-butyl)phosphine wa prepared via catalytic reaction of tBuPH <nUm> with <nUm> equiv of 2-bromo-1H-indene . triethylamine - promoted condensation of indene bearing P(H) tBu and ClP tBu fragment gave a mixture of cis- and trans-bis-indenyldiphosphines . zirconium complex ( 2-R 2P-indenyl ) 2ZrCl <nUm> ( r 2P = ph 2P , me 2P , cy 2P , iPr 2P , tBu 2P ) , a well a ansa - zirconocenes RP(2-indenyl) 2ZrCl <nUm> ( r = ph , tBu ) , were obtained in good yield from ClZr 4(THF) <nUm> and lithium salt of the respective 2-P - substituted indene . ansa - zirconocene ( tBuP ) 2(2-indenyl) 2ZrCl <nUm> including a P 2R <nUm> bridge wa synthesized in a similar manner and isolated a the pure rac - isomer . reaction of alkyllithium compound RLi ( r = me , et , i-Pr , Np ) with BC18F15 result in the formation of the alkylborate salt Li[RB(C6F5)3] . metathesis reaction of these with ph3 - CCl and chloride salt of ( ph 3P)2N+ , PMePh3+ , and HNMe2Ph+ proceed with varying degree of success , a shown by NMR spectroscopy and electrospray mass spectrometry , and the compound [PPN][EtB(C6F5)3] , [PMePh3] [NpB(C6F5)3]3 , and [ HNMe 2Ph][NpB(C6F5)3] have been characterized crystallographically . all three anion assume the expected pseudotetrahedral structure with normal B - aryl bond length and R-B-aryl and aryl - B - aryl bond angle . the compound [HNMe2Ph] [ NpB(C 6F5)3 ] reacts with Cp2ZrMe <nUm> , (Indenyl)2ZrMe2 , and SBIZrMe2 to give propylene polymerization catalyst that are significantly more active and give higher molecular weight polypropylene than do the catalyst obtained using BC18F15 . thus the [ NpB(C6F 5]- anion is for steric reason more weakly coordinating than is [MeB(C6F5)3]- . A kinetics study of b-methyl elimination reaction of the compound Cp2ZrNp(m-Me)B-(C6F5)3 ( in various solvent ) and Cp*2ZrNp(m-Me)B(C6F 5)3 ( in CD2Cl2 ) show that the reaction are accelerated by polar solvent and by steric crowding in the cp* system , result consistent with previous finding and conclusion that the methyl migration are accompanied in a concerted process by borate anion departure from the inner coordination sphere of the metal ion . surprisingly , however , the isobutyl compound Cp*2Zr(i-Bu)(m-Me)B(C 6F5)3 , which is expected to undergo / ? -methyl elimination by analogy with an extensive literature on chain transfer process during propylene polymerization , undergoes very rapid b-hydrogen elimination only . the synthesis of mono- and 1,1'-diphosphaferrocenes bearing thienyl or phenyl substituents at the PCa carbon is described . monophosphaferrocenes can be obtained using a " one - pot " procedure involving the oxidative coupling of phenyl- or thienyl-capped octa-1,7-diynes with zirconocene . this route implies a cp transfer from a Zr specie to the iron center . these novel compound have been characterized by x-ray diffraction study , and their optical and electrochemical behavior have been elucidated . these data revealed that the optical gap vary with the substitution pattern and the nature of the metallocene ( mono v diphosphaferrocenes ) , whereas their electrochemistry is mainly controlled by the structure of the metallocene . the lowest gap are obtained with thienyl-substituted mono- and diphosphaferrocenes . compared to the corresponding oligomers featuring phosphole unit , these phosphaferrocene - based compound exhibit higher thermal stability and higher HOMO-LUMO separation . cationic methyl- and phenylzirconocene specie readily undergo insertion of CO2 into the zirconium-carbon bond , giving the corresponding dimeric carboxylato complex <nUm> and <nUm> in quantitative yield . <nUm> wa structurally characterized , displaying a bridging acetate ligand . In the reaction of the decamethylzirconocene-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complex Cp*2Zr(e2-Me3-SiC 2SiMe3 ) ( 1 ) with i-Bu2AlH , CH bond activation , an electrophilic substitution , and alumination of the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand resulted in formation of the e5-C5Me4CH2-Al(i-Bu) 2H ligand . the final product contains an alkenyl complex that show an agostic C-H ⋯ Zr interaction , Cp*Zr[ - C(SiMe3) = CH(SiMe3)](m-H)[e5-C5Me 4CH2-Al(i-Bu)2 ] ( 2 ) . heating complex <nUm> give the heterobimetallic complex Cp*Zr[ - C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe 3)Al(i-Bu)(m-H)(CH2-e5-C 5Me4 ) ] ( 3 ) , which is formed by an intramolecular reaction , analogous to intermolecular reaction of titanocene- and zirconocene - alkyne complex with i-Bu2AlH , which yield the well - known heterobimetallic complex with tetracoordinated planar carbon atom . both complex were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystal structure analysis . complex <nUm> catalyzes the ethene polymerization and the ring - opening polymerization of e-caprolactone . thermolysis of the cyclometalated zirconocene hydride ( η 5- C 5H 3-1,3-(SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> ) ( η 5-C 5H 3-3-SiMe3-1-e 1- SiMe 2CH 2)ZrH , at <nUm> ° C in benzene-d <nUm> or toluene-d <nUm> , resulted in H / d exchange arising from reversible C-H activation of sp 2-hybridized bond . more careful inspection of the isotopic exchange reaction by NMR spectroscopy revealed formation of zirconocene aryl hydride complex in equilibrium with the cyclometalated hydride compound . In contrast , activation of (dimethylamino)pyridine ( DMAP ) wa complete at <nUm> ° C and afforded the ortho-metalated (dimethylamino)pyridyl hydride . performing the thermolysis of the cyclometalated zirconocene hydride in alkane solvent resulted in activation of a second [SiMe3] group on the opposite cyclopentadienyl ring , forming the C 2-symmetric double-cyclometalated complex ( η 5-C 5H 3-1,3-(SiMe <nUm> ) 2)(e 5-C 5H 3-3-SiMe3-1-e 1-SiMe 2CH <nUm> ) 2Zr . isotopic labeling study demonstrated that neopentane reductive elimination to yield the cyclometalated hydride proceeds through a cyclometalated assisted pathway , while the analogous extrusion of benzene occurs by direct C-H bond reductive coupling , possibly a consequence of the lower orbital reorganization energy associated with the sp2 - hybridized carbon . activation of DMAP follows a different course , where the nucleophilicity of the heterocycle induces reductive elimination and subsequent ortho metalation . In contrast , conversion of the cyclometalated zirconocene hydride to the double-cyclometalated derivative most likely occurs by a-bond metathesis , highlighting the various pathway available for carbon-hydrogen bond activation . combined car - parrinello and QM / MM dynamic simulation have been carried out in order to investigate the polymer chain propagation and termination process in ethylene polymerization catalyzed by zirconocene with the counteranion [CH3B(C6F5)3]- included . A complete account is given not only of the potential energy profile ( PEP ) but also of the free energy profile ( FEP ) for the first and second step of ethylene insertion , a well a of the chain termination . solvation effect were included on the basis of a continuum model . special attention wa given to the counteranion mobility in the catalytic process and the possible difference between PEP and FEP . two different mode of attack by ethylene , ci and trans to the counteranion [CH3B(C6F5)3] - , were considered . In general , the FEPs differ from the PEPs in the barrier height and the shape . the FEP give a higher barrier over PEP due to entropic contribution . the transition state of ethylene uptake by the metal center , the ethylene p-complex , and the ethylene insertion transition state are all clearly present on the FEPs . this is not always the case for the PEPs , especially for the trans pathway . the calculated FEPs for the chain propagation indicate that the ci pathway is preferred over the trans pathway for both the first and second insertion . for the energetically favorable ci pathway , the ethylene insertion into the Zr-Ca bond rather than the ethylene uptake by the metal center is the rate - determining step for both PEP and FEP ( with / without solvation effect included ) . free dynamic simulation without any constraint on the process after ethylene insertion show that the counteranion can recoordinate to the metal center again in a period of le than <nUm> p . In comparison with the estimated time scale of the chain propagation , the counteranion which wa displaced by ethylene in the ethylene uptake process ha sufficient time to recombine with [Cp2ZrR]+ again before a new monomer approach to the metal center . this is in good agreement with very recent experiment . the energetically most favorable pathway for the chain termination corresponds to the ci approach , with a free energy barrier of <nUm> kcal / mol . reduction of the hafnocene diiodide ( η 5-C 5Me 4H ) 2HfI <nUm> with excess sodium amalgam under <nUm> atm of dinitrogen yielded the hafnocene dinitrogen complex [ ( η 5- C 5Me 4H ) 2Hf ] <nUm> ( μ <nUm> , η <nUm> : η 2-N <nUm> ) . x-ray diffraction ha established a strongly activated , side-on bound , bridging N <nUm> ligand with an N-N bond length of <nUm> Å . exposure of the dinitrogen compound to <nUm> atm of dihydrogen at <nUm> ° C resulted in rapid hydrogenation of the N <nUm> ligand , affording the hydrido hafnocene diazenido complex [ ( η 5-C 5Me 4H ) 2-HfH ] <nUm> ( μ 2,e <nUm> : η 2-N 2H <nUm> ) . confirmation of N <nUm> hydrogenation ha been provided by NMR and IR spectroscopic study and x-ray diffraction . pseudo-first-order observed rate constant for H <nUm> addition have been measured by monitoring the disappearance of a principally LMCT band centered at <nUm> nm [ ( η 5-C 5Me 4H ) 2Hf ] 2-(m 2,e <nUm> : η 2-N <nUm> ) a a function of time . the hafnocene complex hydrogenates dinitrogen approximately <nUm> time faster than the corresponding zirconocene compound . divergent chemistry from zirconium is observed upon thermolysis of [ ( η 5-C 5Me 4H ) 2HfH ] <nUm> ( μ 2,e <nUm> : η 2-N 2H <nUm> ) , which result in cyclopentadienyl methyl group cyclometalation rather than N-N bond scission . the reaction of dimethylzirconocene with nitrosobenzene gave the hydroxylaminatozirconium complex <nUm> . it structure in the solid state wa characterized a the n-inside isomer [ e2(O,N)-ON(CH 3)Ph](CH3) - ZrCp2 ( 6a ) by x-ray diffraction . dynamic 1H NMR spectroscopy indicated a rapid enantiomerization process of the chiral system 6a in solution , probably taking place via a rapid equilibration with a reactive e1(O) isomer . the reaction of the zirconocene compound [ ( e5-C 5H5)e5-C5H5SiMe 5C6H5)ZrMe2 ] ( 1 ) and [ e5C5H4SiMe2C6H 4Me)2ZrMe2 ] ( 2 ) with either B(C 6F5)3 or the trityl salt [Ph3C] +[B(C6F5)5]- in CD 2C12 were monitored by NMR spectroscopy . In the case of the cationic product [ ( e5-C5H4SiMe 2C6H5)ZrMe]+[MeB(C6F 5)3]- ( 4a ) and [ ( e5-C <nUm> H4SiMe2C6H4Me ) 2ZrMe]+ X- ( 4a ) and [ ( e5-C 5H4SiMe2C6H4Me ) 2ZrMe)2ZrMe]+ X- ( 5x , x = [MeB(C6F5)3]- ; 5b , x = [ B(C 6F5)4]- ) , coordination of the arene , bonded through Si to the cyclopentadienyl ring , to the cationic zirconium wa observed . however , this coordination is rather weak , and stronger lewis donor such a the anion or the starting material replace the coordinated arene moiety . the solid - state structure of <nUm> and <nUm> were determined by x-ray crystallography . density functional computation ( B3LYP / ECP1 and B3LYP / II level ) have revealed that the phenyl group in [ e5-C5H5)(e- C5H4SiMe2C6H5)ZrMe + ( 10 ) , [ ( e5-C5H4SiMe 2C6H4Me)2Zr]2+ ( 11 ) , and [ ( e5-C5H4SiMe2C 6H5Zr]2+ ( 12 ) are coordinated via one of the arene carbon atom . the structural assignment are supported by the good agreement between the experimental NMR shift and the computed ( GIAO-B3LYP / II level ) shift in the case of the cationic compound ( 10 ) . the structure of the dicationic compound <nUm> differs significantly from that of <nUm> , indicating a strong influence of the para substituent of the arene ring . compound <nUm> and <nUm> validate previously suggested model for solvent ( arene ) adduct in kaminsky - type polymerization . we present a DFT study of the monometallic group transfer polymerization ( GTP ) of methyl acrylate ( MA ) catalyzed by Sm - based and Zr - based metallocenes . the process examined are the generation of the catalytically active specie , the subsequent C-C coupling reaction , and the ring opening of a metallacyclic stable intermediate , resting state of the polymerization process , obtained from the C-C coupling . the mechanism for a neutral zirconocene , a cationic zirconocene , and a neutral samarocene are compared . the isoelectronic neutral samarocene and cationic zirconocene system share many feature , which explains their similar behavior in both the C-C coupling ( no energy barrier on the potential energy surface ) and the MA - assisted opening of the metallacycle . an analysis of the factor driving polymer stereoregularity in the process catalyzed by the neutral samarocene and the cationic zirconocene ha led to identifying a relationship between stereoregularity and the relative disposition of the acrylate and enolate ligand , a well a the direction of the incoming MA molecule in the opening of the metallacycle resting state . on the basis of these discovery a kinetic model ha been developed , which ha proved successful in qualitatively predicting stereoregularity . the well - known zirconafuranone , obtained by the reaction of the decamethylzirconocene bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complex cp* 2Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) with carbon dioxide , rearranges upon thermolysis to a complex with the [ C 5Me4-CH2-CH(Me3Si)C( = C = O ) ] 2- ligand resulting from an electrophilic substitution of a hydrogen atom at one of the methyl group of a cp* ligand , a cleavage of the CO bond in the starting zirconafuranone , and a movement of the Me3Si group from b-carbon to oxygen . another example of the functionalization of a pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand by carbon dioxide wa found with a complex obtained by the reaction of Cp*2ZrCl2 with magnesium in the presence of the butadiyne t-BuC ≡ CC ≡ Ct-Bu . this complex reacts by formally inserting <nUm> equiv of carbon dioxide into each of two CZr bond , but yield a dinuclear complex with twofold functionalized cp* ligand acting a bridging dicarboxylato ligand , [ O2C-CH 2-C5Me3-CH2-CH(t-Bu)C( = C = CH-t-Bu)- CO2]3- . both complex result from a simple method of functionalization of cp* ligand of zirconocene complex and were characterized by NMR and x-ray crystal structure analysis . isotopically labeled zirconocene methyl neopentyl complex of the formula ( CpR n ) 2Zr-(CH 3)(CH 2C(CH <nUm> ) 2CD <nUm> ) are obtained via reaction of CHLi 2C(CH <nUm> ) 2CD <nUm> with ( CpR n ) 2Zr(CH <nUm> ) - ( Cl ) . addition of B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> to ( CpR n ) 2Zr(CH 3)(CH 2C(CH <nUm> ) 2CD <nUm> ) result in b-methyl elimination , forming the ion - paired specie [ ( CpR n ) 2Zr(CH <nUm> ) ] [ CH 3B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] along with isotopologs of isobutene . the relative amount of d 3- and d 0-isobutene afford the isotope effect for b-methyl elimination . for cp 2Zr(CH 3)(CH 2C(CH <nUm> ) 2CD <nUm> ) ( cp = ( n 5-C 5H <nUm> ) ) , a kinetic deuterium isotope effect of <nUm> ha been measured at <nUm> ° C . comparable deuterium kinetic isotope effect have been observed for four other zirconocene methyl neopentyl compound : [ Cp*(C 5Me 4H)-Zr ] ( cp* = ( n 5-C 5Me <nUm> ) ) , [ cp* 2Zr ] , [rac-(EBI)Zr] ( EBI - ethylenebis(indenyl) ) , and [(THP)Zr] ( THP = 1,2-(SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> ( n 5-3,5-C 5H(CHMe <nUm> ) 2)(n 5-C 5H <nUm> ) ) . the direction and magnitude of these effect are consistent with g-agostic assistance in the transition state for b-methyl elimination , the microscopic reverse of a-agostic assistance in the transition state for olefin insertion into the zr-methyl bond . reaction of group <nUm> metallocene dihydrides , ( r nCp ) 2MH <nUm> ( r nCp = alkyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl ; m = Zr , Hf ) , with olefin afford stable metallocene alkyl hydride complex of the general formula ( r nCp ) 2M(CH 2CHR' 2)(H) ( R' = H , alkyl ) . for sterically crowded , monomeric dihydrides , cp* 2ZrH <nUm> ( cp* = η 5-C 5Me <nUm> ) , cp*(e 5- C 5Me 4H)ZrH <nUm> , cp*(e 5-C 5Me 4Et)-ZrH <nUm> , cp* 2HfH <nUm> , and cp*(e 5-C 5H 3-1,3- ( CMe <nUm> ) 2)HfH <nUm> , second - order rate constant for olefin insertion have been measured . for cp* 2HfH <nUm> , the relative rate of olefin insertion have been found to be 1-pentene > styrene ≫ cis-2-butene > cyclopentene > trans-2-butene > isobutene . the rate of isobutene insertion into cp*(e 5-C 5Me 4H)ZrH <nUm> is <nUm> × 1Q <nUm> time greater than that for cp* 2ZrH <nUm> at <nUm> ° C , demonstrating the striking steric effect for isobutene insertion imposed by a tenth methyl substituent on the two cyclopentadienyl ligand . A primary k H / k d of <nUm> at <nUm> ° C and a linear free energy correlation to σ ( ρ = <nUm> ) for para-substituted styrene insertion indicate that insertion into a Zr-H bond proceeds via rate - determining hydride transfer to coordinated olefin , with small positive charge buildup at the b-carbon of the inserting styrene . the rate of b-H elimination for the series ( r n-Cp ) 2Zr(CH 2CHR')(H) have been measured via rapid trapping of the intermediate zirconocene dihydride with 4,4-dimethyl-2-pentyne . key observation for b-H elimination are ( a ) primary kinetic deuterium isotope effect ( k H / k d = <nUm> - <nUm> ) and ( b ) a linear free relationship for the phenethyl hydride series cp*(e 5-C 5Me 4H)Zr(CH 2CH 2-p-C 6H 4-X)(H) ( x = H , CH <nUm> , CF <nUm> , OCH <nUm> ) , which correlate better to o than σ + ; p = <nUm> . the rate of b-H elimination slows with more substituted , hence more sterically crowded , cyclopentadienyl ligand . equilibration of a series of Cp*(CpR n)Zr(CH 2CHMe 2)(H) and Cp*(CpR n)Zr(CH 2CH 2CH 2CH 3)(H) with free isobutene and 1-butene ha established the relative ground - state energy of isobutyl and n-butyl complex . these data , in combination with the free energy of activation for b-H elimination , allow free energy profile to be constructed for insertion and b-H elimination for each olefin . the second - order rate constant for the insertion of cyclohexene into substituted bis(indenyl)zirconocene dihydrides , ( η 5-C 9H 5-1,3-R <nUm> ) 2ZrH <nUm> ( r = SiMe <nUm> , CHMe <nUm> ) , to yield the cyclohexyl hydride complex have been measured . comparison of these value to the corresponding tetrahydroindenyl derivative ( η 5-C 9H 9-1,3-R <nUm> ) 2ZrH <nUm> reveals significantly faster insertion reaction for the bis(indenyl) compound . accordingly , primarily s-donating ligand such a PMe <nUm> , PEt <nUm> , and tetrahydrothiophene coordinate to ( η 5-C 9H 5-1,3-(CHMe <nUm> ) <nUm> ) 2ZrH <nUm> to form ( η 5-C 9H 5-1,3-(CHMe <nUm> ) <nUm> ) 2ZrH 2(L) compound , one of which ( L = PMe <nUm> ) ha been structurally characterized . In contrast , the more electron - rich zirconocene tetrahydroindenyl dihydrides exhibit weaker binding in solution . taken together , these result establish an " indenyl effect " in zirconocene hydride chemistry likely arising from increased electrophilicity of the metal center , rather than a change in hapticity along the reaction coordinate . zirconocene precatalysts with sterically bulky alkyl group were designed a model system for the propagating specie in zirconocene - catalyzed alkene polymerization . specialty alkyllithium reagent Li(CH2CEt <nUm> ) and Li(CH2CMe2CH2Ph) were prepared and utilized in the synthesis of dialkyl and methyl-alkyl zirconocenes of the form CpCp*ZrR2 , Cp2Zr(CH3) ( r ) , and CpCp*Zr(CH3) ( r ) ( cp = ( e5-C5H <nUm> ) ; cp* = ( e5-C5Me5 ) ; r = CH2CMe3 , CH2SiMe3 , CH 2CEt3 , CH2CMe2CH2Ph ) . these new zirconocene alkyl were isolated and fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy and in some case by x-ray diffraction . the molecular structure determined display the bent - sandwich coordination mode common for zirconocenes . the steric influence of the alkyl group on the observed structural parameter is reflected in slightly expanded C-Zr-C or C-Zr-Cl angle in the equatorial plane and long zirconium - alkyl bond distance . the cyclobutylene-bis(2-indenyl)zirconium dichloride complex ( 4 ) , derived from an intramolecular photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of bis[2-(methylethenyl)indenyl]zirconium dichloride ( 3 ) , wa reacted with methyllithium or phenyllithium to yield the corresponding cyclobutylene-bis(2- indenyl ) - zirconium dimethyl ( 12 ) or diphenyl ( 13 ) complex , respectively . insertion of carbon monoxide into the zr-phenyl linkage of <nUm> yielded the " o-inside " e2-benzoyl ansa - zirconocene complex 18-syn / anti , which were characterized by x-ray diffraction . tert-Butyl isocyanide insertion into the Zr - CH3 bond of <nUm> gave the " n-inside " e2-iminoacyl metallocene isomer 17-syn and 17-anti ; the latter wa characterized by x-ray diffraction . under kinetic control tert-butyl isonitrile insertion into <nUm> gave the " n-outside " e2-iminoacyl metallocene isomer 25-syn / 25-anti , which rearranged to 17-syn / anti at <nUm> K with gibbs activation energy of DG rearr = <nUm> / <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal*mol-1 , respectively . the analogous rearrangement of the " n-outside " to " n-inside " isomer of the corresponding cyclobutylene- bis(cyclopentadienyl)Zr-(e2-iminoacyl) reference system ( 23-syn / anti to 24-syn / anti ) is much faster ( <nUm> K : DGrearr = <nUm> / <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal*mol-1 ) . similar difference in the kinetic " n-outside " to thermodynamic " n-inside " e2-iminobenzoyl metallocene isomerization were observed for the tert-butyl isonitrile insertion product of the cyclobutylene-bis(2-indenyl) ZrPh2 ( 13 ) and cyclobutylene-bis(C5H4)ZrPh <nUm> ( 15 ) system , which indicates a pronounced influence of the covering phenylene group on the s-ligand chemistry in these rigid ansa - metallocene system . ethylene polymerization using catalyst derived from activation of zirconocene aluminohydride complex with either methyl aluminoxane or B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> is reported . variable - temperature NMR spectrum of mixture of cp* 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> or cp' 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> and excess B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> reveal the formation of di- or polynuclear metallocenium ion - pair featuring terminal or both terminal and bridging borohydride counteranions HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> arising from hydride abstraction . At higher T , ion - pair featuring the terminal HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> counterion decompose , and the AlH <nUm> that is liberated degrades B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> to furnish mixture of ( C 6F <nUm> ) nAlH 3-n and , in the case of cp* 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> , a new ion - pair partnered with the diborohydride counteranion [ cp* 2ZrH][(m-H) 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] . the latter compound wa independently prepared from cp* 2-ZrH <nUm> and HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> and is active in ethylene polymerization ; however it is <nUm> time le active than the catalyst formed from cp* 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> and B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> and so can not account for the multisite behavior of the latter combination . there is evidence of chemical exchange between " free " or terminal HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> and excess B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> in these mixture , and on the basis of model study with [ nBu 4N][HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] and B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> , this involves reversible formation of [ nBu 4N][(C 6F <nUm> ) 3B)(m-H)B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , which can be detected by 19F NMR spectroscopy in solution at low T . the reaction of the zirconocene compound [ ( e5-C 5H5)2-Zr(CH2C6H 4R)2 ] ( r = F ( 1 ) , CMe3 ( 2 ) , me ( 3 ) ) with either BC18F15 or the trityl salt [ ph 3C]+[B(C6F5)4] - in CD2Cl2 were monitored by NMR spectroscopy . In all case , the cationic compound [ ( e5-C5H 5)2-Zr(e2-CH2C6H 4R)]+ wa obtained , irrespective of the activator used ( BC18F15 or the trityl salt ) . whereas NMR study suggest a e2-coordination of the benzyl ligand to the cationic zirconium metal , detailed DFT study revealed that in CD 2Cl2 this is only the case if one solvent molecule is coordinated via the lone pair of one chlorine to the metal . without this coordination , a e3-coordination is more likely to occur . computed NMR shift at the B3LYP / IGLO II level corroborate this observation , which is in concert with a detailed NBO analysis of the cationic zirconocene compound . the molecule Cp(3-Me3Si-6,6-dmch)ZrI2 ( cp = e5-cyclopentadienyl ; 3-Me3Si-6,6-dmch = e5-3-trimethylsilyl-6,6-dimethylcyclohexadienyl ) ha been synthesized , and the molecular and electronic structure have been investigated . photoelectron spectroscopy show that substitution of a trimethylsilyl group in place of a hydrogen atom on the 6,6-dmch ligand destabilizes all of the ionization of Cp(3-Me3Si-6,6-dmch)ZrI2 by ca. <nUm> - <nUm> eV compared to those of Cp(6,6-dmch)ZrI2 . density functional calculation accurately reproduce the experimental structure of the molecule and agree with the observed shift of all ionization to lower energy . interestingly , the ionization are calculated to shift to lower energy without the expected increase in electron density at the metal center . this apparent contradiction is understood from analysis of one - center and two - center charge effect in the molecule . As a consequence of these charge effect , the silyl substitution make the 3-Me3Si-6,6-dmch ligand a slightly better donor and , surprisingly , also a better acceptor ligand than the 6,6-dmch ligand . gently warming the e6,e5-bis(indenyl) zirconium dimethoxyethane compound ( e6-C9H 5-1,3-(SiMe3)2)-(e5-C 9H5-1,3-(SiMe3)2)Zr(DME) ( 1-DME ) to <nUm> ° C resulted in C-O bond scission to yield an equimolar mixture of the zirconocene ethylene compound ( e5-C9H 5-1,3-(SiMe3)2)2Zr(e 2-CH2 = CH2 ) and the corresponding zirconium bis(methoxide) complex ( e5-C9H5-1,3- (SiMe3)2)2Zr(OMe)2 . monitoring the relative rate of 1-DME versus 1-DME-d10 cleavage by 1H NMR spectroscopy established no kinetic isotope effect ( kH / k d = <nUm> ) , eliminating the possibility of C-H activation in or prior to the rate - determining step . computational study support a pathway involving rate - determining DME dissociation from the e6 , e5-bis(indenyl)zirconium complex followed by facile e6 to e5 indenyl haptotropic rearrangement and C-O bond scission . corresponding C-S bond cleavage chemistry ha been investigated for three thioethers and the mechanism of bond activation compared to the oxygen congener . the cp - alkenyl and cp - dienyl ligand system <nUm> and <nUm> were prepared by fulvene route . subsequent transmetalation gave the respective (Cp-propenyl)2- , (Cp-butenyl)2- , ( cp - pentadienyl ) 2- , and Cphexadienyl)2ZrCl2 and - ClHf <nUm> complex <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> . In the crystal these complex favor metallocene conformation that feature the alkenyl and dienyl substituents far separated from each other at the open front side of the bent metallocene wedge . photolysis in the solid state consequently did not result in an intramolecular C-C coupling reaction but led to e / z isomerization of the alkenyl unit . In solution rapid conformational metallocene equilibration take place . photolysis of the (Cp-alkenyl)2ZrCl2 complex <nUm> in solution very efficiently resulted in the formation of the cyclobutylene-bridged ansa - zirconocene isomer <nUm> by rapid intramolecular [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition reaction by mean of a dynamic topochemical reaction control . photolysis of the (Cp-dienyl)2ZrCl2 and - Cl2Hf complex ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) in solution proceeded analogously to efficiently yield the cyclooctadienylene bridged ansa - metallocenes ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) by formal dynamic topochemical [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition reaction control . the effect of the metal on elementary chain propagation and termination reaction in hafnocene- and zirconocene - catalyzed olefin copolymerization process ha been systematically studied by quantum chemical method . two consecutive monomer insertion , parallel with the competing chain termination reaction , were studied for copolymerization of ethene with propene , 1-butene , and 1-hexene . for the purpose of a comparative study , analogous specie along the reaction pathway were studied for each metallocene / monomer combination . effect due to incorporation of a comonomer were analyzed a a function of both the central metal and the comonomer size . In accordance with the general experimental observation of zirconocenes producing lower molecular weight polymer than the hafnocenes , difference in activation energy for chain propagation and termination are smaller for the zirconocene . for the zirconocene , the activation energy is particularly low for b-hydrogen elimination after secondary comonomer insertion . reaction of (phenylethynyl)lithium with substituted cyclopentenones gave the corresponding phenylethynyl-substituted cyclopentadienes 1,2-R 2-4-(PhC ≡ C)C5H2 ( r = me ( 1a ) , ph ( 1b ) ) , which underwent subsequent deprotonation and transmetalation with ClZr <nUm> to yield the corresponding alkyne - functionalized zirconocene complex { e5-[1,2-R2-4-(PhC ≡ C)C 5H2]}2ZrCl2 ( r = me ( 2a ) , ph ( 2b ) ) . thermal treatment of 2a,b with C4O4Ru in refluxing benzene afforded the trinuclear complex ( 3,4-R2C5H 2)2(m3-C4Ph2)Ru 3(CO)6(m-CO)2 ( r = me ( 3a ) , ph ( 3b ) ) and the dinuclear complex ( 3,4-Ph2C5H2 ) 2(m-C4Ph2)Ru2(CO) 5(m-CO) ( 3c ) , via the unexpected cleavage of the two Cp'-Zr bond . the crystal structure of 2b and 3a,c were determined by x-ray diffraction . bis(cyclopentadienyl)aluminum and -gallium specie of the type (Pytsi)ECp2 [ e = Al ( 2a ) , Ga ( 2b ) ; pytsi = C(SiMe3) 2SiMe2(2-C5H4N) ] have been prepared from NaCp and respective dichloride (Pytsi)ECl2 in isolated yield of <nUm> % ( 2a ) and <nUm> % ( 2b ) . In addition to applying standard method of characterization ( NMR spectroscopy , CHN analysis , and MS ) , the molecular structure of both compound were solved by single - crystal x-ray crystallography . reaction between 2a or 2b with Zr(NMe2)4 in benzene , followed by addition of an excess of ClSiMe3 , gave the first ansa - zirconocene dichloride with aluminum ( 4a ) or gallium ( 4b ) in bridging position . the gallium compound 4b wa isolated in a yield of <nUm> % and characterized by NMR spectroscopy , CHN analysis , and mass spectrometry . the aluminum specie 4a could not be obtained in an analytically pure form ; it wa characterized by NMR spectroscopy , and it molecular structure wa determined by single - crystal x-ray analysis . the angle between the two plane of the cp ligand in 4a wa found to be <nUm> ° , which is larger than in cp 2ZrCl2 ( α = <nUm> ° ) and smaller than in silicon - bridged ansa - zirconocene dichloride ( e.g. , Me2Si(C 5H4)2ZrCl2 : α = <nUm> ° ) . crystallization attempt of 4a from DCCl3 solution gave crystal of the new specie (Pytsi)AlCl[(C5H4)ZrCp] ( 7 ) , which wa characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single - crystal x-ray analysis . In comparison to the pytsi - containing specie 2a and 2b , the le sterically protected compound [ 2-(Me2NCH2)C6H 4]AlCp2 ( 6 ) , which wa prepared from NaCp and [ 2-(Me 2NCH2)C6H4]AlCl2 in yield of <nUm> % and characterized by standard method ( NMR , CHN , and MS ) , reacted with Zr(NMe2)4 to give the known Cp2Zr(NMe 2)2 . the targeted ansa - specie wa not formed , a judged by 1H NMR spectroscopy . the gallium - bridged compound 4b and cp 2ZrCl2 , respectively , had been tested for polymerization of ethylene utilizing MAO a an activator ( <nUm> equiv of MAO ; <nUm> or <nUm> mmol of precatalyst ; <nUm> or <nUm> psi ) , resulting in activity of <nUm> to <nUm> for 4b and of <nUm> to <nUm> kg PE ( mol zr)-1h-1atm-1 for Cp2ZrCl2 . reaction of the five - membered metallacyclocumulenes Cp2M(e 4-t-Bu-C4-t-Bu ) ( m = Ti , Zr ) with the lewis acid i-Bu 2AlH were studied . Cp2Ti(e4-t-Bu-C 4-t-Bu ) ( 1 ) reacts with i-Bu2AlH to give a heterobimetallic complex which wa isolated a the THF adduct cp 2Ti[m-e1:e2-t-BuCC-CHC-t-Bu)(m-H) (i-BuAl)(THF) ] ( 4 ) . the reaction of the corresponding zirconocene compound Cp2Zr(e4-t-Bu-C4-t-Bu) ( 2 ) with i-Bu 2AlH result in a cleavage of the central C = C bond of the metallacyclocumulene C4 chain and formation of the dinuclear complex <nUm> and the dinuclear acetylide [ (Cp2Zr)2(m-C ≡ c-t- bu)2 ] . In addition to the formation of <nUm> and the acetylide specie an elimination of the butadiyne take place , which give in the subsequent interaction with i-Bu2AlH the zwitterionic aluminum cluster <nUm> . alternatively , complex <nUm> is also formed in the direct reaction of the butadiyne with a 3-fold excess of i-Bu2AlH . the molecular structure of <nUm> and <nUm> were confirmed by x-ray analysis . we have used QM / MM molecular dynamic simulation of the olefin - bound borate ion pair of the mainstay zirconocene catalyst ( [ Cp2Zr(C 2H5)(C2H4)]+[CH 3B(C6F5)3]- ) to examine the effect of the counteranion on the active catalyst . free energy perturbation / molecular dynamic calculation show that the a-agostic configuration is stabilized by <nUm> kcal mol-1 when the counteranion is present , which we attribute to the larger counteranion - dipole interaction of the more polar a-agostic structure . In this paper , we compare the electronic structure of the hafnacycloallene complex Cp2HfC4RR'2R'' ( 5Hf ) , which wa previously described by erker et al. , with those of the titanium , zirconium , and hafnium complex Cp2M(e4-RHC 4HR ) ( <nUm> m ; i.e. metallacyclopent-2,3,4-trienes , metallacyclocumulenes ) and Cp2M(e4-R2C4R2) ( <nUm> m ; i.e. 1-metallacyclopent-3-ynes ) using density functional theory ( BP86 / LANL2DZ ) calculation . moreover , the e3-phenylallenyl zirconocene complex 7Zr , which wa synthesized by wojcicki et al. , is included for the comparison . these calculation and extended huckel calculation show that the bonding in complex 5Hf is remarkably similar to that of complex <nUm> m and 7Zr . an analysis of the structural parameter and bonding reveals that the unique interaction of the internal carbon atom along with the terminal carbon atom with the bent - metallocene moiety is the reason for the unusual stability of these metallacycles . the molecular orbital analysis further suggests that complex 5Hf can react with another metal fragment to give the bimetallic complex <nUm> and <nUm> . the electronic structure of complex <nUm> m , <nUm> m , 5Hf , and 7Zr have been comparatively studied to get a general understanding of the bonding in these metallacycles . the e isomer of a [5]cumulene derivative , 2,2,9,9-tetramethyl-3,8- diphenyldeca-3,4,5,6,7-pentaene ( 1 ) , which wa previously believed to be unisolable owing to very fast e / z isomerization , wa isolated and structurally characterized . the z isomer wa trapped a the transition - metal complex <nUm> , and the molecular structure wa determined . DFT calculation and an electrochemical study on <nUm> are also described . ansa - zirconocene amide incorporating a Me2C - linked cyclopentadienyl-dicarbollyl or indenyl-dicarbollyl ligand were conveniently prepared from direct deboration of the corresponding carboranyl metal complex using diamine a deboration agent . this represents a new methodology for the preparation of metal dicarbollides . the first well - defined zirconocene complex processing vinyl-imine and keteniminate specie have been achieved from zirconacyclopentenes or zirconacyclopentadienes and <nUm> equiv of Ph2CHCN . multifunctional effect of Ph2CHCN is observed for the first time in one system . this process proceeds via the azazirconacyclopentadiene intermediate and it intramolecular proton transfer . moreover , b,b'-C-C bond cleavage of tetra-alkyl-substituted zirconacyclopentadienes is observed for the first time under the appropriate condition . the potassium salt of <nUm> wa transmetalated by reaction with (Cp-allyl)ZrCl3(dme) , yielding the complex (NC-nacnac)Cp- allylZrCl2 ( 2 ) . addition of <nUm> molar equiv of B(C6F 5)3 gave [ (C6F5)3B-NC- nacnac]Cp - allylZrCl2 ( 3 ) , and the subsequent addition of <nUm> molar equiv of BC12F10H to <nUm> gave the hydroborated specie [ ((C6F5)3B-NC-nacnac)Cp-(CH 2)3-B(C6F5)2]ZrCl <nUm> ( 4 ) . the hydroboration of <nUm> with <nUm> molar equiv of HB(C 6F5)2 gave an insoluble product . this product wa fully characterized by 11B and 13C solid - state NMR and IR , which showed that the hydroboration followed by intermolecular adduct formation ( R-B(C6F5)2- - -NC- - -R' ) occurs , resulting in an organometallic polymer ( 5 ) . In addition to the CN - free [nacnac]Cp - allylZrCl2 ( 6 ) , the hydroborated derivative [ (nacnac)Cp-(CH2)3-B(C6F5) <nUm> ] ( 7 ) wa also prepared . complex 2-7 were activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and gave active catalyst for ethylene polymerization . the polymer produced were linear and had high molecular weight , with polydispersities ( PDI ) of le than <nUm> , indicating that the catalyst are single site . the presence of the allyl group on the cp ring wa found to increase the molecular weight of the material produced . In addition to discrete complex , an organometallic polymer ( 5 ) wa formed . this compound is air stable and , while not very soluble , polymerizes ethylene with good activity . reaction ofCp2Zr(m-Cl)(m-C 2B 10H 10)Li(OEt 2)2 ( 1 ) with various n-heterocycles derived from pyridine were studied . treatment of <nUm> with pyridine , 2-bromopyridine , <nUm> , 4-lutidine , quinoline , and 2-(1-hexynyl)pyridine generated a-C-H activation ( s-bond metathesis ) product Cp2Zr(e2-C , N-C5H4N)(s-C2B10H11) ( 2 ) , Cp2Zr[e2-C,N-(6-Br-C 5H 3NN)](s- B10C2H11 ) ( 3 ) , Cp2Zr[e2-C,N-(4,6-Me2-C5H2N)] ( s-C2B10H11 ) ( 4 ) , Cp2Zr(e2-C,N-C9H6N)(s-C2B10H11) ( 5 ) , and Cp2Zr- { e2-C,N-[6-(nBuCtC)-C 5H 3NN]}(s-C2B10H11) ( 7 ) , respectively . on the other hand , reaction of <nUm> with acridine gave the addition product 1,2-[Cp2Zr(10,9-C13H9N)]-1,2-C 2B 10H <nUm> ( 6 ) in <nUm> % isolated yield . complex <nUm> reacted with 3-(1-hexynyl)pyridine to afford a-C-H activation specie Cp2Zr{e2-C,N-[5-(nBuCtC)C 5H 3NN]}(s-C2B10H11) ( 8a ) andCp2Zr{e2-C,N-[3-(nBuCtC)C 5H 3NN]}-(s- B10C2H11 ) ( 8b ) in a molar ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> , a determined by the 1H NMR spectrum . In the presence of CuI , however , the CtC insertion product zirconacyclopentenes 1,2-[Cp2ZrC(2-C5H4N)dCR]-1,2-C 2B 10H <nUm> [ r = bun ( 9 ) , ph ( 10 ) ] were obtained in 74-77 % yield . it is suggested that the coordination of pyridine to the Zr atom is crucial for a-C-H activation ( s-bond metathesis ) . the presence of CuI can alter the reaction path by preventing the coordination of pyridine to the Zr atom , which block the a-C-H activation path , leading to the alkyne insertion reaction . all complex were characterized by 1H , 13C , and 11B NMR spectrum a well a elemental analysis . their structure were further confirmed by single - crystal x-ray analysis . we have applied 3D-QSAR chemometric tool to analyze the polymerization activity of a series of analogous zirconocene catalyst with different substitution pattern in the cyclopentadienyl ring . the selection of the most stable conformers wa performed by mean of a conformational analysis of the different catalyst in a step previous to the QSAR study . the calculated QSAR model ha been assessed in robustness following a progressive scrambling protocol that help to check redundancy in the descriptor space . this model present a good predictive ability a tested with a set of four catalyst . the final model is controlled mostly by steric contribution , which can be related to the weakness of the catalyst - cocatalyst interaction . A highly efficient and convenient method for the monozirconation of silyl- or tert-butyl-substituted 1,3-butadiynes using the negishi reagent ha been developed . the resulting zirconium butadiyne complex undergo two syn-SE2 reaction with various aldehyde to yield the cis-[3]cumulenic diol with moderate to high diastereoselectivities . the silyl substituents at the butadiyne terminus show remarkable influence on the diastereoselectivity . the new 1,3-disiloxo-bridged dichloro zirconocene [ { ( η 5- C 5H <nUm> ) 2-m,m-1,3-(Me 2SiOSiMe <nUm> ) 2}ZrCl <nUm> ] ( 2 ) ha been synthesized and fully characterized . complex <nUm> , combined with MAO , polymerizes propene and 1-hexene with high 1,2-regioselectivity , yielding oligomers containing vinylidene end group produced via a b-hydrogen elimination reaction . kinetics associated with the [ (SBI)Zr(CH 2SiMe <nUm> ( C 6H 4)NMe 2)][MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] (1a)-catalyzed polymerization of 1-hexene in a mixed toluene-d <nUm> / chlorobenzene-d <nUm> solvent at <nUm> ° C were investigated via 1H NMR and compared to the kinetics associated with the (SBI)ZrMe(MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ) (1c)-catalyzed polymerization of 1-hexene under identical condition . In the presence of 1-hexene , both catalyst form an identical propagating specie , (SBI)Zr(poly-1-hexyl)(MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ) ( 1b ) , but the concentration of 1b during 1a - catalyzed polymerization is only ca. <nUm> % of the anticipated value . under reaction condition , 1b reacts reversibly with the model complex p-TMS-C 6H 4-NMe <nUm> ( 2 ) to yield the outer - sphere ion pair tentatively identified a [(SBI)Zr(poly-1-hexyl)(2)] [ MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 1e ) , which act a an essentially dormant site during 1-hexene polymerization . warming of 1b in the absence of additive generates the well - defined hydridoborate complex (SBI)ZrMe(HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ) ( 1d ) , which doe not reinitiate in the presence of 1-hexene . b-Hydride elimination of 1b in the presence of additive such a 1,2-dichloroethane and <nUm> result in catalyst decomposition . A number of 2-methyl-4-aryl-5-methoxy-6-alkylindenes and C 2-symmetric me 2Si - bridged ansa - zirconocenes based on them were synthesized . zirconocenes were obtained by mean of highly effective and scalable racemo - selective synthetic approach based on the use of a Zr tert-butyl amide complex . the structure of m-(bis-[e 5-6-tert-butyl-5- methoxy-2-methyl-4-tert-butylphenyl-1H-inden-1-yl]dimethylsilanediyl ) dichlorozirconium(IV) ( 14 ) ha been established with x-ray analysis . the introduction of a methoxy group into the indenyl fragment of zirconocene significantly improved it catalytic performance ( i.e. , it activity , stereoselectivity , molecular mass potential , and thermal stability ) in the polymerization and copolymerization of propylene in comparison with the benchmark spaleck - zirconocene . the role of the methoxy group is proposed to stabilize the cationic catalytic intermediate , which wa confirmed using DFT calculation . reaction of zirconocene-carboryne in situ generated from cp 2Zr(m-Cl)(m-C 2B 10H <nUm> ) Li(OEt <nUm> ) <nUm> with various alkene RCH = CH <nUm> in refluxing toluene gave the monoinsertion product 1,2-[Cp 2ZrCH ( r ) CH 2]-1,2-C 2B 10H <nUm> ( r = aryl ) or 1,2-[Cp 2ZrCH 2CH(R)]-1,2-C 2B 10H <nUm> ( r = alkyl ) in good to high isolated yield with very high regioselectivity , depending on the polarity of the alkene . this reaction offered an efficient route to zirconacyclopentanes with a carborane auxiliary , which can be viewed a a carborane version of zirconacyclopentanes . they are thermally very stable and chemically inert toward unsaturated organic molecule such a alkene , alkyne , nitrile , CO , and CO <nUm> . all complex have been fully characterized by various spectroscopic technique . some have been further confirmed by single - crystal x-ray analysis . A new zirconocene bis(arsenide) derivative , cp 2Zr(AsMes <nUm> ) <nUm> ( <nUm> ; cp = cyclopentadienyl , me = 2,4,6- trimethylphenyl ) , ha been prepared by the metathetical reaction of <nUm> equiv of LiAsMes <nUm> with cp 2ZrCl <nUm> and structurally characterized . effort to prepare cp 2ZrCl(AsMes <nUm> ) ( 2 ) by reaction of <nUm> equiv of LiAsMes <nUm> with cp 2ZrCl <nUm> yielded a mixture of product that could not be separated , including <nUm> and <nUm> , a identified by 1H NMR spectroscopy . compound <nUm> thermally decomposes with formation of As 2Mes <nUm> , suggestive of reductive elimination to form an As-As bond . further evidence for reductive elimination come from effective interception of a putative zirconium (II) intermediate with diphenylacetylene to give cp 2Zr(C 4Ph <nUm> ) . the C1 - symmetric metallocenes rac-[1-(9-e5- fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl)ethane ] zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) and rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6- cyclopenta-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl)ethane]hafnium dichloride ( 2 ) are known to produce elastic polypropylene . they were investigated concerning their temperature stability during the polymerization of propene . after activation of these complex with triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) / [ CPh 3][B(C6F5)4] , first polymerization experiment ( 80-100 C ) afforded moderate to high activity . however , at these polymerization temperature , the molecular weight of the produced polymer are significantly decreased , resulting in a waxy appearance and , therefore , a loss of the elastic behavior . the main reason for this behavior , especially for the more significant decrease of the molecular weight in the case of hafnocene <nUm> compared with zirconocene <nUm> , wa revealed to occur due to a fast b-methyl transfer reaction . hence , hafnocene <nUm> can form polymer chain with a high selectivity toward allylic chain end . these macromonomers can be used in the catalytic insertion polymerization for the formation of new grafted copolymer . initial copolymerization experiment with ethene were conducted . the reaction of the seven - membered azazirconacycloallene <nUm> with ph 2CHCN wa carried out to yield a zirconocene complex with three fused ring and a keteniminate ligand . further reactivity toward propargyl bromide or propionyl chloride show that the keteniminate ligand can be replaced by halogen atom ( Br or Cl ) . In addition , the reaction of the strained four - membered zirconacycle <nUm> with Ph2CHCN give zirconocenes possessing vinyl-imine and keteniminate specie . A series of group VI metal complex bearing a group IV metallocenyldiphosphine moiety and a pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand have been prepared and structurally characterized . reaction of trinuclear complex with C8K give the corresponding neutral chloride - bridged complex . further reaction of the resulting chloride - bridged complex with ArBNa F4 give the corresponding monocationic chloride - bridged complex . on the other hand , reaction of the neutral chloride - bridged complex with n-BuLi give the corresponding chloride - bridged alkyl complex , where the group IV metallocene(III) moiety and the coordinatively unsaturated group VI metal(II) center are in close proximity . spectroscopic and crystallographic study of the reaction of a chloride - bridged alkyl complex with CO or a protic acid indicate that further disproportionation take place at the alkyl zirconocene(III) moiety . the electro- and spectroelectrochemical behavior of diverse (multi)ferrocenyl five - membered heterocyclic compound , including furan , thiophene , pyrroles , phospholes , etc. is discussed , giving a close insight into the electron transfer process of these organometallic compound in their mixed - valence state , whereby electronic and structural modification of the heterocyclic connecting unit and / or of the redox - active ferrocenyl terminus directly influence the electron transfer property . In addition , the structural feature of these compound can be correlated with their electrochemical behavior , allowing calculation of the effective electron transfer distance within a specific series of molecule . tendency in molecular wire molecule based on bi- , ter- , quarter- , quinque- , and sexithiophene connecting building block and the appropriate pyrrole derivative are discussed a well . the consequence of introducing an additional redox - active transition - metal building block , such a a titanocene or a zirconocene moiety , respectively , into the heterocyclic ring , on the electrochemical behavior of the resulting five - membered heterocycle are also highlighted . the title complex Cp2ZrCl(CH2PPh2) reacts with BC18F15 under specific condition by phosphinomethyl transfer to give the phosphane - stabilized salt [ cp 2ZrCl+][Ph2PCH2B(C6F 5)3- ] . x-ray crystal structure analysis showed the P-Zr coordination . this salt is trapped by phenyl isocyanate in an in situ three - component reaction to yield the respective P / zr+ frustrated lewis pair ( FLP ) addition product . In contrast , a mixture of cp 2ZrCl(CH2PPh2) / B(C6F 5)3 and benzaldehyde under similar condition give the P / B FLP addition product . the Cp2ZrCl(CH2PPh <nUm> ) / BC18F15 system may form a P / B adduct [ Cp2ZrCl(CH2PPh2)*B(C 6F5)3 ] or a P / zr+ adduct [ cp 2ZrCl*PPh2CH2B(C6F 5)3 ] . from the former it seems to show P / B FLP reaction and from the latter P / zr+ FLP behavior ; the outcome is dependent on the specific reagent and reaction condition chosen . A DFT study on the carboxylation of hafnocene and ansa - zirconocene dinitrogen complex with CO2 indicates that the most favorable initial CO2 insertion into M-N ( m = Hf , Zr ) proceeds by a stepwise path rather than a concerted [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] path . the calculated result explain the regioselectivity of the N-C formation in experiment . In addition , a comparative analysis of ring tension and charge distribution unveils the different activity of N-N bond cleavage in the CO and CO2 direct N-C bond formation reaction . the chemoselective C-O bond functionalization of benzofuran with an aluminum dihydride may be catalyzed by zirconocene dichloride . the reaction proceeds with the formal addition of a C-O bond to , and elimination of dihydrogen from , aluminum . the product of C-O bond alumination reacts with benzaldehyde via insertion of the carbonyl into the newly formed Al-C bond . zirconium - mediated multicomponent reaction of silyl-butadiynes with two molecule of aryl nitrile are described , which provide rapid access to polysubstituted pyrimidine in a regioselective manner and in one pot . employing aliphatic nitrile result in coupling of only one nitrile , leading to the formation of enynyl ketone after hydrolysis . A zirconocene monoyne complex undergoes similar reaction with nitrile to form highly substituted pyrimidine . the reaction of [Cp2ZrMe][MeB(C6F5) <nUm> ] ( 1 ) with 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene and 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene , respectively , in C6D5Cl at <nUm> ° C result in irreversible formation of the cationic Cp2Zr+-allyl complex [ Cp2Zr(e3-CH2C(CH 2R)CH2)]+ ( 2a , 3a ) and [ Cp2Zr(e 3-CH2C(Me)CHR)]+ ( 2b , 3b ) ( 2a,b , r = CH(CH 3)2 ; 3a,b , r = C4H7 2CH3 ) and release of methane . the Cp2Zr +-allyl complex were characterized with regard to their structure and rearrangement dynamic of their allyl ligand by NMR spectroscopy . variable - temperature 1H NMR experiment show that the allyl ligand of complex 2a,b and 3a,b are fluxional . the fluxional behavior in these complex is mainly due to a mechanism that involves e3 to e1 isomerization , rotation of the allyl carbon-carbon π unit about the carbon-carbon σ bond , and reversion to the e3- allyl coordination mode , when both the allyl syn / anti hydrogen exchange and apparent cp ligand exchange occur . the rotation of the C-C unit about the allyl carbon-carbon σ bond also result in a reversal of the e3-allyl coordination face relative to the Cp2Zr + moiety . A second mechanism which may account for the apparent cp ligand exchange in the Cp2Zr+-allyl complex under investigation consists of rotation of the e3-coordinated allyl ligand about the metal - allyl bond . the free energy of activation for the exchange process , a estimated from the coalescence temperature of the two cp ligand , is between <nUm> and <nUm> kJ / mol . aside from the intramolecular allyl exchange process described above , this study also show that the e1- and e3-coordinated allyl form of a particular Zr - allyl complex coexist in solution and that the equilibrium composition of these specie is temperature dependent . the Cp2Zr+-allyl complex described in this paper serve a model for similar cationic cp 2Zr+-allyl intermediate implicated in zirconocene - catalyzed alkene polymerization reaction . A general method for the synthesis of multiply substituted pyrroles through zirconocene - mediated coupling of two alkyne and an azide in the presence of ClCu ha been achieved . (m-Ethylene)bis(zirconocene chloride ) ( la ) is formed rapidly in nearly quantitative yield upon hydrozirconation of vinylzirconocene chloride , 5a . In contrast , the slow reaction of (b-styryl)zirconocene chloride ( 5d ) with oligomeric hydridozirconocene chloride ( 4 ) give an equimolar mixture of Cp2ZrCl2 ( 6 ) , Cp2ZrCl(CH2CH2Ph) ( 7 ) , and the novel binuclear (olefin)zirconocene complex Cp2ZrCl(CH = CHPh)ZrCp2 ( 8 ) . the latter crystallizes in space group P21 / n with cell constant a = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 9 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 6 ) Å , and β = <nUm> ( 3 ) ° . the molecular structure of <nUm> is characterized by an almost planar bridging olefinic ligand . the Zr(l)-C ( l ) σ bond is short ( <nUm> ( 7 ) Å ) . Zr-C bond distance of <nUm> ( 7 ) and <nUm> ( 7 ) Å are found for the zr(2)-(e2-alkenyl) moiety . the chemistry of <nUm> is dominated by the reactive Zr-C σ bond . carbon monoxide is rapidly inserted with preservation of a binuclear structure to form <nUm> . reaction with protic reagent point to the formation of mononuclear ( η 2styrene)zirconocene a a reactive intermediate . the reaction of dipiperidinoacetylene ( pipC ≡ cpip , pip = NC 5H10 , 1a ) with [Cp2Ti(e2-btmsa)] ( 2 ) or with [Cp2Zr(e2-btmsa)(py)] ( 4 ) ( btmsa = bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene , py = pyridine ) afforded the metallacyclopentadienes [Cp2M(C4pip4)] ( <nUm> , m = Ti ; <nUm> , m = Zr ) , which in the solid state exhibit twisted five - membered metallacycles with an unusual half - chair conformation . In contrast , the sterically more demanding decamethyltitanocene ( Cp*2Ti ) and -zirconocene ( Cp*2Zr ) complex fragment can only accommodate one alkyne ligand . thus , the titanacyclopropene [ Cp*2Ti(C 2pip2 ) ] ( 7 ) wa isolated from the reaction of 1a with [Cp*2Ti(e2-btmsa)] ( 6 ) or with [Cp*2TiCl] in the presence of magnesium , whereas the zirconacyclopropenes [Cp*2Zr(C2X2)] ( 8a , x = pip ; 8b , x = NC5H9-4-Me ; 8c , x = NEt2 ) were prepared by the reduction of [Cp*2ZrCl2] with magnesium in the presence of 1a , bis(4-methylpiperidino)acetylene ( 1b ) , and bis(diethylamino)acetylene ( 1c ) , respectively . NMR study showed that complex <nUm> are in equilibrium with their tucked-in tetramethylpentafulvene-diaminovinyl isomer [ Cp*(e6-C5Me4CH 2)Zr(CX = CHX ) ] ( 9 ) in solution , which are formed by intramolecular C-H - bond activation and hydrogen transfer from one cp* methyl group to the alkyne ligand . thermodynamic and kinetic parameter were derived by variable - temperature NMR spectroscopy and DFT experiment . the molecular structure of <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , 8a , [8a*MgCl2]2 , 8b , and 8c were established by x-ray diffraction analysis . hydrozirconation of phenylacetylene followed by a reaction with ((trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)lithium gave the respective (s-alkenyl)(s- alkynyl)zirconocene complex 6a . it treatment with a catalytic amount of BC18F15 ( <nUm> mol % ) at room temperature resulted in efficient s-ligand coupling with the formation of the isomeric five - membered zirconacycloallenoid complex 9a . two similar example with different substituents R1 ( SiMe3 , tBu ) were also investigated . all three new zirconacycloallenoids ( 9a-c ) were characterized by x-ray diffraction . the addition reaction of carbon dioxide to the zirconacycloallenoid complex 9c and two related example from the literature were studied . the carbon dioxide addition product were also characterized by x-ray crystal structure analysis . cationic (C5H4R)2ZrAr+ aryl specie ( 2a-d : r = H ; Ar = o-tolyl ( a ) , 2-Me-4-F-C6H3 ( b ) , 3-F-C6H4 ( c ) , ph ( d ) ; 2e : r = me , Ar = ph ) are generated by the reaction of a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of ( C5H4R ) 2ZrAr2 and ( C5H4R ) 2ZrMe2 with <nUm> equiv of [CPh3][B(C 6F5)4 ] via methide abstraction and ligand exchange step . complex 2d and the Cp2HfAr+ analogue ( 2f,g : Ar = o-tolyl ( f ) , ph ( g ) ) are generated by the reaction of cp 2MAr2 with [C6Me6H] [ B ( C 6F5)4 ] . NMR study suggest that these metallocene aryl cation exist a ( C5H4R ) 2M(Ar)(RCl)+ solvent adduct in chlorocarbon solution . NMR and DFT study show that the (C5H4R)2Zr(Ar) (RCl)+ specie contain b-C-H-Zr agostic interaction involving an ortho-aryl hydrogen . the " endo " isomer , in which the b-agostic interaction occupies the central coordination site , are ca. <nUm> kcal / mol more stable than the " exo " isomer , in which the b-agostic interaction occupies a lateral site . the aryl agostic interaction are weaker for Hf than Zr , and Cp2Hf(Ph)(C 6D5Cl)+ ( 2g*C6D 5Cl ) doe not contain an agostic interaction . the synthesis and structure of novel 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl substituted cyclopentadienes ( <nUm> / <nUm> ) and of their zirconocene dichloride derivative [ Zr(e5-C5H4C2H 4CF3)2Cl2 ] ( 6 ) and [ Zr(e-C 5H3-1,2-(C2H4CF3) 2}2Cl2 ] ( 7 ) is reported . these precatalysts have been investigated toward their property in the methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) assisted polymerization of ethylene . the result can be compared to the polymerization property of the non-fluorinated analogue [ Zr(Eta ; -C 5H4C2H4CH3 ) 2Cl2 ] ( 11 ) . complex <nUm> and <nUm> produce high - density polyethylene ( HDPE ) and are among the most active precatalysts for donor functionalized nonbridged metallocenes . an unprecedented temperature independence of the molar mass distribution is observed for the polymerization with <nUm> . the Cp2ZrCl(m-1,4-diphenylbutenyne)PX2 complex 7a [-P(C6H5)2] and <nUm> [ -P(C6F 5)2 ] insert tert-butylisonitrile into the Zr - c(sp <nUm> ) σ bond to yield the n-inside e2-iminoacyl zirconocene complex 13a and 13b . x-ray crystal structure analysis of complex 13a and 13b revealed the presence of a chiral atropisomeric structure with a torsion angle of <nUm> ° ( 13a ) and <nUm> ° ( 13b ) , respectively , around the central iminoacyl / alkenyl c(sp2) - c(sp2) σ bond . In solution an analogous chiral structure is observed . the barrier of interconversion of the enantiomeric atropisomers of 13a and 13b wa determined at DG ‡ ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( 13a ) and DG ‡ ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( 13b ) by temperature - dependent dynamic NMR spectroscopy . reaction of 7a and <nUm> with methyllithium followed by treatment with BC6F5 <nUm> gave the corresponding cationic zirconocene complex 12a and 12b . these complex took up <nUm> mol equiv of tert-butylisonitrile to yield the cationic n-inside e2-iminoacyl zirconocene system 14a and 14b a isonitrile adduct . the cationic complex 14a and 14b are also axially chiral . the barrier of enantiomerization ( DG ‡ ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( 14a ) , DG ‡ ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( 14b ) ) were also determined by dynamic NMR spectroscopy . 2,5-Bis(alkynylsilyl)-l-zirconacyclopentadienes <nUm> were formed highly regio- and chemoselectively in excellent yield by the homocoupling reaction of <nUm> equiv of bis(alkynyl)silanes <nUm> mediated by a low - valent zirconocene specie ( negishi reagent ) generated in situ from Cp2ZrBu2 . single - crystal x-ray structural analysis of 2,5-bis(phenylalkynyldimethylsilyl)- 1-zirconacyclopentadiene ( 3a ) revealed a sandwich - type conformation . hydrolysis or halogenation of these zirconacyclopentadienes <nUm> afforded multisubstituted stereodefined Si - bridged conjugated system . skeletal rearrangement of these 2,5-bis(alkynylsilyl)-1-zirconacyclopentadienes with aromatic substituents afforded zirconacyclohexadienesilacyclobutene fused ring compound <nUm> . using these zirconacyclopentadienes <nUm> a starting reactive organometallic reagent , interesting cyclic compound such a bis(alkynylsilyl)benzene derivative and bis(alkynylsilyl)thiophene derivative could be prepared in high yield . further application of these alkynylsilyl-substituted compound for more complicated product and functional material can be expected . exposure of a series of zirconocene amido and hydrazido hydride complex , (e5-C5Me4)2Zr(NHR)H ( r = 1Bu , NMe2 , me , H ) , to <nUm> atm of D2 gas at <nUm> ° C produced isotopic exchange in both the N-H and Zr-H position . In general , the relative rate of 1,2-elimination can be rationalized on the basis of groundstate effect , whereby amido compound with the strongest N-H bond , a judged by the corresponding free amine , undergo the slowest isotopic exchange . for the compound with the strongest N-H bond in the series , ( e5- C5Me4H)2Zr(NH2)H , the barrier for 1,2-elimination is sufficiently high such that s-bond metathesis becomes the dominant intermolecular exchange pathway . for the other amido zirconocene hydride , the rate constant for deuterium exchange into the N-H position are faster than for the Zr-H position . this behavior is a result of a faster intramolecular isomerization process driven by an equilibrium isotope effect favoring N-D over Zr-D bond formation . computational study on a related model compound , (e5-C5H5)2Zr(NH tBu)H , successfully reproduce these observation and support a pathway involving the formation of rare d0 dihydrogen complex . the lithium salt of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octamethylfluorenyl ( flu'' ) and 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9-nonamethylfluorenyl ( flu* ) were reacted with Zr and Hf half - sandwich complex to generate mixed-ligand-metallocenes Cp''Flu''ZrCl2 ( 1 ) , Cp''Flu*ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , and Cp*Flu*HfCl2 ( 3 ) ( cp'' = 1,3-(SiMe 3)2C5H3 , cp* = C 5Me5 ) . reaction of the metallocene dichloride with MeLi yielded the dimethyl derivative Cp''Flu*ZrMe2 ( 4 ) and Cp''Flu*HfMe2 ( 5 ) . reduction of the zirconocene dichloride in the presence of CO gas yielded the dicarbonyl derivative Cp''Flu''Zr(CO)2 ( 6 ) and Cp''Flu*Zr(CO) <nUm> ( 7 ) , which represent the first example of zirconocene dicarbonyls containing a fluorenyl ligand derivative . structural characterization of the zirconocene dichloride <nUm> and the dicarbonyls <nUm> and <nUm> revealed that the methylated fluorenyl ligand adopt an e5-coordination and display a twisted tricyclic core in each case . A spectroscopic study of a small series of zirconocene dicarbonyl analogue indicates that the methylated fluorenyl ligand are strong electron donor and similar in this regard to heptamethylindenyl ( ind* ) and cp* . zirconocene - alkene complex Cp2Zr(PMe3)(CH <nUm> = CHR ) reacted with chlorodiphenylphosphine to form zircono-ethylphosphine derivative with high regioselectivity , which could be converted into various b-functionalized alkyldiphenylphosphine oxide in the presence of ClCu . oligosilyl-substituted alkyne complex of group <nUm> metallocenes have been prepared by reaction of group <nUm> metallocene dichloride with magnesium in the presence of the respective alkyne . depending on the alkyne substitution pattern , either metallacyclopentadienes or metallocene alkyne complex were formed . In order to suppress the oxidative coupling process , PMe3 wa added to obtain the metallocene alkyne complex base adduct . the reaction of 1,4-bis[tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl]butadiyne with zirconocene caused the formation of a 1,4-bis[tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl] - substituted zirconacyclocumulene . reaction of zirconacyclopentadienes with iodine proceeded to the expected 1,4-diiodobuta-1,3-dienes . systematic exploration of zirconocene ( Cp2ZrII ) chemistry since the 1980s ha offered a wide range of useful method for organic synthesis . many of these reaction are stoichiometric in zirconium , and even if several catalytic reaction are known , the development of catalytic zirconocene chemistry is of continuing interest . In this paper , the study of reaction catalytic in zirconium , i.e. alkyne dimerization and cyclotrimerization , is presented . these reaction are carried out by employing the recently introduced lanthanide - originated zirconocene equivalent . the use of <nUm> mol % of cp 2ZrCl2 , together with La metal or mischmetall a reductant and AlCl3 a transmetalating agent , lead to an efficient formation of dienes from disubstituted alkyne . under the same condition , monosubstituted alkyne underwent cyclotrimerization reaction to afford benzene derivative . this reaction also occurs efficiently in the absence of AlCl3 . it wa postulated that the catalytic cyclotrimerization did not proceed through a typical insertion of the alkyne into the zirconacyclopentadiene intermediate . this unprecedented reaction take place in the presence of zirconocene and lanthanide specie , possibly involving a bimetallic polarization process . we have carried out a combined QM / MM study to rationalize the factor that can affect the performance of C1 - symmetric ansa - zirconocene catalyst that contain bridged cyclopentadienyl ( cp ) and fluorenyl ( flu ) ligand in olefin homo- and copolymerization . two growing chain with different b-C ( tertiary or secondary ) and two olefin ( propene and ethylene ) have been used for this purpose . our calculation indicate that chain transfer ha a higher barrier than chain propagation in EE ( ethylene homopolymerization ) , PP ( propylene homopolymerization ) , and PE ( propylene complexation to a metal with a propyl chain ) system . however , the two process are competitive in EP ( ethylene complexation to a metal with a 2-methylpropyl chain ) system . substituents on the carbon in a C-H link weaken the C-H bond . this in turn determines the order EP < EE < PP < PE for the heat of reaction of the b-hydrogen transfer process , giving rise to the chain termination , where the process with the most negative reaction heat is the more thermodynamically favorable . it is further argued that the barrier for the termination process must follow the same order of EP < EE < PP < PE . for the insertion process the barrier increase with the number of substituents on the olefin and the cb atom of the growing chain a PP > PE ∼ EP > EE . the different propensity of the four system for termination and propagation result in the higher barrier of termination for EE , PP , and PE , whereas the barrier are similar for EP . our analysis explains why ethylene / propylene homopolymerization affords high molecular weight polymer , whereas ethylene / propylene copolymerization affords low molecular weight polymer . thermal decomposition of Cp2ZrPh2 in the presence of the buta-1,3-diynes RC = CC = CR ( r = ph , SiMe3 ) can lead to seven- or five - membered metallacycles . In both case a stable benzo - fused seven - membered zirconacyclocumulene arising from a 2-fold insertion of the triple bond of the dialkyne in the in situ generated zirconocene benzyne is formed . In the case of Me3SiC = CC = CSiMe3 a second minor complex is isolated : a 3-alkynyl-substituted zirconaindene arising from a β monoinsertion of one acetylenic function of the conjugated diyne in the zirconocene benzyne . No stable 2-alkynyl-substituted zirconacycle wa isolated . this a monoinsertion complex is an intermediate in the exchange of the metalated moiety with a main - group atom ( e.g. , antimony ) in a zirconacyclocumulene , explaining the formation of a 2-alkynyl-substituted stibaindene . In the thermal decomposition of Cp2Zr(Me)SCH2R4 ( R4 = ph , p-MeOC6H4 ) in the presence of PhC = CC = CPh , only the α monoinsertion of one triple bond of the diacetylenic reagent in the transient zirconathiirane is observed . the 2-alkynyl-substituted five - membered zirconathiolane is isolated a a bis-sulfonium zirconocene - ate dimer . x-ray diffraction study corroborate the molecular structure of all these zirconacyclic complex and stibacycle . four neutral zirconocene bis(ester enolate ) and non-zirconocene bis(alkoxy) complex have been employed for ring - opening polymerization and chain transfer polymerization of l-lactide ( L-LA ) and e-caprolactone ( e-CL ) . all c2v- , C2- , and Cs - ligated neutral zirconocene bis(ester enolate ) complex effectively polymerize e-CL at <nUm> ° C with high ( > <nUm> % ) initiator efficiency . the Cs - ligated complex ph 2C(Cp)(Flu)Zr[OC(OiPr) = CMe2]2 ( 1 ) also promotes highly efficient polymerization of L-LA and is at least <nUm> time more reactive than the c2v.,- and C2 - ligated analogue . the L-LA polymerization by <nUm> exhibit living characteristic , producing PLA with quantitative isotacticity ( no sign of monomer epimerization ) and controlled molecular weight . this polymerization follows firstorder kinetics with respect to both [L-LA] and [1] , consistent with a monometallic , coordinationanionic propagation mechanism . the structurally characterized non-zirconocene bis(alkoxy) complex [ ( 2,6-iPr2C6H 4)N(CH2)3N(2,6-iPr2C 6H4)]Zr(OiPr)2[O = C(NMe 2)CHMe2 ] ( 2 ) ha been synthesized in quantitative yield from the reaction of the zirconium bis(amido) precursor with isopropyl isobutyrate . complex <nUm> behaves a a single - site catalyst for polymerization of both e-CL and L-LA , unlike the comparative homoleptic zirconium tetraisopropoxy complex , which show multisite behavior for the same process . both the zirconocene <nUm> and the non-zirconocene <nUm> catalyze efficient chain transfer polymerization in the presence of iPrOH a a chain transfer reagent ( CTR ) for the catalytic production of PLA and PCL , respectively ; however , the metallocene system is more robust ( in term of ligand stability and maintaining the polymerization rate ) toward an excess of a protic CTR than the present non-metallocene system . menthyl-substituted group <nUm> metallocene dihalides of type Cp'2MX2 ( cp' = e5-menthyl- C5H4 ) have been known so far for m = Ti , Zr , and x = Cl ( 1-Ti , 1-Zr ) . A gap in knowledge is closed now by the expansion to hafnium ( 1-Hf ) and the preparation of complex with x = F ( 4-Ti , 4-Zr , 4-Hf ) . In a first catalytic application 1-Ti is used in the enantioselective buchwald hydrosilylation of imines and compared to (S,S)-(ebthi)TiF2 . also the variation of the ligand to ( e5-8-phenylmenthyl-C 5H4 is realized with a zirconocene dichloride ( 3-Zr ) . the reduction of 1-Ti afforded compound <nUm> , a dimeric titanium (III) complex , [Cp'2Ti(m-Cl)2TiCp'2] . such a specie is assumed to be an intermediate in the ring - opening reaction of epoxides with titanocene dichloride a precatalysts . we report the first crystallographically characterized dimethylaniline complex of a group <nUm> metallocene . [(IPCF)ZrMe(NMe2Ph)][B(C 6F5)4 ] show strongly coordinated NMe 2Ph which doe not interchange in solution . DFT calculation suggest that the Zr-N bond is <nUm> kJ mol-1 stronger than the Zr-Me-Zr bond in [[(IPCF)ZrMe]2(m-Me)][MeB(C6F5) <nUm> ] , the structure of which is also reported ( IPCF = me 2C(C5H4)(fluorenyl) ) . attempt to synthesize zirconocene hydrido alkoxide specie , cp 2Zr(H)OR , via several synthetic pathway consistently failed to yield the targeted complex , which seem prone to undergo disproportionation into Cp2ZrH2 and a bisalkoxide complex . reaction of cp 2ZrH2 with HOR , Me3SiOR , or Ph2CO yielded the corresponding bisalkoxide complex Cp2Zr(OR) <nUm> , of which Cp2Zr{OC(H)Ph2}2 wa characterized by an x-ray diffraction study . insertion of vinyl ether into Cp2ZrH2 yielded Cp2Zr(OR)2 and Cp2Zr(Et)OR . attempted hydrogenation of Cp2Zr(Me)OR or reaction of Cp2Zr(BH4)OR with NEt3 did not yield the targeted complex . Cp2Zr(H)OC6H5 and Cp2Zr(H)OC6F5 could be obtained , however , a transient specie by b-H elimination from Cp2Zr(tBu)OR , ligand exchange between Cp2ZrH2 and Cp2Zr(OC 6F5)2 , or protonation in the presence of olefin to yield the corresponding hydrozirconation product . In hydrozirconation reaction of styrene both specie are highly regioselective . the alkoxide substituent failed to inhibit b-H elimination in hydrozirconations of trans-3-hexene or b-OR elimination in reaction with vinyl ether . on the other hand , it imparted a vastly increased thermal stability to the tert-butyl complex Cp2Zr(tBu)OR , which were stable for up to several month in solution , before they isomerize to the respective isobutyl complex . cp 2Zr(iBu)OC6H5 wa characterized by x-ray crystallography . summary : the reaction dynamic of b-hydrogen transfer in the zirconocene olefin polymerization catalyst wa modeled using DFT path sampling . trajectory were found to cross the reaction barrier at a broad range and showed that Zr-H bonding increase during the reaction due to dynamic effect and a Zr-(e2-C2H4) fluctuation is critical to inducing the transfer . the reaction of a C,N - chelated ( (LCN)2M , where LCN is 2-((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl and m is Sn ( I ) or Pb ( 2 ) ) stannylene and plumbylene with di-n-butylbis(rf-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium ( h ) were studied . In the case of the stannylene , the trinuclear carbene - like complex [ ( lcn ; )2Sn]2Cp2Zr ( 4 ) wa isolated a the major product . the second product isolated resulted from transmetalation of the C,N - chelating ligand from tin to zirconium , followed by 1-butene coupling to the coordinated aryne ( C,N - chelating ligand ) ( 5 ) . In the lead case , the major product wa the complex S . byproduct were elemental lead , the free ligand ( LCNH ) , butane , and 1-butene . the oxidation of <nUm> by oxygen gave the six - membered trioxa trizircona cyclic complex ( 6 ) and an eight - membered tetraoxa tetrastanna cyclic complex ( 1 ) . s-Symmetric propylene polymerization catalyst <nUm> with a bridged cyclopentadienyl and fluorenyl architecture are known to produce syndiotactic polymer . on the other hand , related C1 - symmetric catalyst , such a <nUm> , that are obtained from <nUm> by the introduction of a bulky substituent ( tert-butyl ) on the cyclopentadienyl ring afford isotactic polymer . In this study we employ DFT calculation in order to analyze several aspect of olefin polymerization catalyzed by the fluorenyl-based C1 - symmetric zirconocene <nUm> . modeling of the propagation in naked cationic system , disregarding the noncoordinating counterion , yield information on the factor that affect streoselectivity ( and ultimately stereoregularity ) , regioselectivity , and reactivity of the " crowded " site of the zirconocene relative to the " open " one . several hypothesis are investigated , with the aim to rationalize the experimental observation that <nUm> affords isotactic polymer whereas <nUm> give rise to syndiotactic polymer . we provide in addition an analysis of the stability of dormant specie <nUm> produced from <nUm> propylene mi - insertion . for this task , the need to include explicitly the counterion in the modeling seems to be inevitable . comparative study of the energetics of b-H elimination to the metal or b-H transfer to the monomer , relative to insertion into a Zr - secondary C bond , indicate that dormant specie <nUm> are prone to b-H elimination . chemistry of reduced bis(indenyl)hafnium compound ha been explored . sodium amalgam reduction of 075-C9H5-1,3-(SiMe3)2)2HfCl2 wa studied in several different solvent . while reduction in toluene resulted in decomposition , performing the reaction in the presence of THF or 1,2-dimethoxyethane ( DME ) yielded n 6,n 5-bis(indenyl)hafnium solvent ( THF or DME ) complex arising from ligand - in - duced haptotropic rearrangement . using le coordinating solvent such a diethyl ether or 2,5-dimethyl THF furnished a rare example of a structurally characterized hafnocene(III) complex , ( n 5-C9H5-1,3- (SiMe3)2)2HfCl . an unusual sodium chloride complex of n 6,n 5-bis(indenyl)hafnium , [ ( n 6-C9H5-1,3- (SiMe3)2)( ? 5-C9H5-1,3,-(SiMe3)2)HfCl]2Na[Na(DME)3] , wa also isolated and crystallographically characterized a a byproduct from synthesis of the DME compound . the reactivity of the t]6,t]5- bis(indenyl)hafnium THF compound a an isolable source of Hf (II) wa also evaluated . addition of H or N,N-dimethylaminopyridine ( DMAP ) resulted in facile oxidative addition , while C-O cleavage of THF wa observed upon mild heating . preparation of the corresponding hafnocene dicarbonyl derivative allowed comparison of the electronic property of the new complex a compared to their zirconocene congener . reaction of the zirconocene dichloride cp flu * ClZr <nUm> ( cp = 1,3-(SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> , flu = C <nUm> me <nUm> ) with i BuLi ( i BuLi = CHLi <nUm> CHMe <nUm> ) resulted in elimination of isobutylene and formation of cp ( η <nUm> η <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> H)ZrH ( 1-syn-1,2-DH * FD ) , possessing an η <nUm> : η <nUm> -dihydrofluorenediyl ligand derived from ametal - to - benzo ring hydride transfer . this specie undergoes reversible hydride transfer and exists in equilibrium with only one of it three other possible isomer ( 1-syn-3,4-DHFD ) . compound l-syn-l,2-DHFD catalyzes the cyclization of 1,5-hexadiene to methylenecyclopentane , and it reaction with excess isobutylene lead to the elimination of isobutane and formation of the cyclometalated zirconocene isobutyl specie ( η <nUm> : η <nUm> -C s H <nUm> -l-SiMe <nUm> CH <nUm> -3-SiMe <nUm> )(e <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> )Zr i bu ( 2 ) . reaction of cp flu ClZr <nUm> with i BuLi directly generated the cyclometalated zirconocene specie ( η <nUm> : η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> -l-SiMe <nUm> CH <nUm> -3-SiMe <nUm> )(e <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> Zr i bu ( 3 ) ; however , reaction of the dichloride cp flu ClZr <nUm> with i BuLi in the presence of hydrogen generated the dihydrofluorenediyl monohydride derivative cp ( η <nUm> : η <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> H <nUm> )ZrH ( 4 ) . treatment of the cyclometalated isobutyl specie <nUm> with H <nUm> led to partial hydrogenation of the flu ligand and formation of the monohydride cp ( η <nUm> : η <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> H <nUm> )ZrH ( 5 ) , which contains a hexahydrof-luorenediyl ligand . partial hydrogenation of the flu ligand proceeded exclusively via an intramolecular pathway , a evidenced by the all - exo configuration of the methyl group on the saturated benzo ring . structural characterization of l-syn-l,2-DHFD , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> revealed a highly strained η <nUm> : η <nUm> -coordination mode for the dihydro- and hexahydrofluorenediyl ligand . zirconocene-l-aza-l,3-diene complex , [ me 2Si(C 5H <nUm> ) 2]Zr[N(Ar)CH = CHCH(Ph) ] ( Ar = ph , 2a ; Ar = / J-MeOC 5H <nUm> , 2b ) and cp 2Zr[N(Ar)CH = CHCH(Ph) ] ( Ar = ph , 3a ; Ar = p-MeOC 6H <nUm> , 3b ) , have been synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy . x-ray crystal structure determination of compound 2a and 3a,b reveal folded five - membered - ring moiety for the zirconacycles . DFT calculation and variable - temperature NMR experiment for complex 2a establish a rapid ring - flipping process at room temperature , with the conformation bearing a pseudoequatorial ph group more stable by <nUm> kcal / mol . kinetic study on ketone insertion into these zirconocene complex show second - order reaction , and the insertion is more favorable in the presence of a [ me 2Si ] ansa bridge , a le electron - rich substituent on the nitrogen , and a more basic ketone . one of the insertion product , namely cp 2Zr[N(Ph)CH = CHCH(Ph)CPh 2O ] ( 5a ) , ha also been characterized by x-ray crystallography . In this work , the reversible chain transfer to Al in ethene polymerization catalyzed by Cp*2ZrCl2 / MAO wa studied via comparison of the polymerization in the presence and absence of trimethyl-aluminum ( TMA ) contained in commercial MAO . it wa found that the weight distribution of the product were narrower , in the presence of TMA , at low Al / Zr ratio taken in these experiment . PDIs of about <nUm> or lower were attainable at temperature up to <nUm> ° C . we propose that a fast to moderate reversible chain transfer between Cp*2ZrR+ and TMA ( similar to a catalyzed chain growth mechanism ) is the origin of the low polydispersity . simulation of the polymerization with the proposed mechanism confirmed this hypothesis ; the qualitative result are consistent with the experimental trend . reaction of zirconocene-carboryne precursor Cp2Zr(m-Cl)(m- C2B10H10)Li(OEt2)2 with various kind of alkyne R1C = CR2 in refluxing toluene give the monoinsertion product 1,2-[Cp2ZrC(R1) = C(R 2)]-1,2-C2B10H10 in good to very high isolated yield with very good chemo- and regioselectivity . this reaction offer an efficient route to zirconacyclopentenes incorporating a carboranyl unit , a carborane version of zirconacyclopentadienes . all complex have been fully characterized by various spectroscopic technique and single - crystal x-ray analysis . deprotonation of 6-dimethylamino-6-methylpentafulvene ( 3a ) with methyl lithium yielded the (l-dimethylaminoethenyl)Cp lithium reagent 4a . it treatment with zirconium tetrachloride under carefully controlled reaction condition gave the corresponding bis(enamino-Cp)ZrCl2 complex 5a . the product 5a is very sensitive to acid - catalyzed mannich condensation . photolysis of 5a ( HPK <nUm> , pyrex filter ) resulted in a rapid intramolecular [2+2]cycloaddition reaction to yield the cis-bis-(dimethylamino)cyclobutylene-bridged ansa - zirconocene complex 7a in a photostationary equilib - rium ( 5a:7a ≈ <nUm> : <nUm> ) . after acid - catalyzed mannich conversion of the minor component ( 5a to 6a ) the new photoproduct 7a wa isolated pure by fractional crystallization . the complex 5a and 7a were both characterized by x-ray diffraction . reaction of [(2-phosphino)ethenyl]zirconocene chloride ( 1 ) with CpM(CO)3Cl ( m = Mo , W ) in THF yielded the[(3-phosphino)propenoyl] dicarbonyl(cyclopentadienyl)metals { CpM(CO)2[(CO)CR = CRPPh <nUm> ] } ( 2 ) . when the reaction between [(2-phosphino)ethenyl]zirconocene chloride ( 1 ) and CpMo(CO)3Cl wa carried out in the presence of a catalytic amount of C4Cl2H6N2Pd , [(3-phosphino)propenoyl]dicarbonyl(cyclopentadienyl)molybdenum , { CpMo(CO) 2[(CO)-CR = CRPPh2 ] } , wa exclusively observed . when [(2-phosphino)ethenyl]zirconocene chloride ( 1 ) and MeCpW(CO)3Cl were reacted in the presence of a catalytic amount of ClCu , [(3-phosphino)propenoyl] dicarbonyl(methylcyclopentadienyl)tungsten , [ MeCpW(CO)2[(CO)CR = CRPPh2 ] ] , wa formed . their structure are determined by x-ray diffraction analysis . A comparative quantum chemical study ha been performed to shed light on the fundamental difference between hafnocenes and zirconocenes concerning reaction between the metal and a-olefin monomer , namely , ethene , propene , 1-butene , and 1-hexene . analogous specie along the a-olefin polymerization pathway were studied for bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconocene and hafnocene , taking into account the structural variation of the first two monomer insertion step and of the competitive chain - termination reaction . the result were analyzed a a function of both the metal and the monomer , the metal showing more distinct difference . the most notable difference in the reaction of the zirconocene and hafnocene can be seen in b-hydrogen transfer to metal , activation energy for which are significantly higher for the hafnocene . Bis(vinyl-Cp)zirconium dichloride ( 6 ) undergoes a clean intramolecular photochemically induced [2+2] cycloaddition reaction to yield the cyclobutylene-bridged ansa - zirconocene isomer ( 7 ) when irradiated with UV light ( HPK <nUm> , pyrex filter ) at ambient condition . both the open and the ansabridged isomer ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) were characterized by x-ray diffraction . the corresponding bis(2-vinylindenyl)ZrCl2 complex ( 12 ) also close rapidly and completely to the ansa - metallocene ( 13 ) upon photolysis . the bis(2-butadienylindenyl)ZrCl2 complex ( 20 ) undergoes a formal [4+4] cycloaddition reaction upon photolysis to yield it ansa - metallocene isomer <nUm> , exhibiting an eight - membered carbocyclic bridging unit . the metallocene complex prepared and characterized in this study give very active ethene polymerization catalyst upon activation with excess methylalumoxane . frustrated lewis pair , highly active in heterolytic dihydrogen splitting , were used a active and very selective hydrogenation catalyst for organometallic substrate . conjugated dienamines fixed at the ferrocene framework and at the zirconocene nucleus were selectively 1,4-hydrogenated under catalytic condition at ambient temperature . hydrozirconation of 1-alkynyl pinacolboronates , <nUm> , with HZrCp2Cl provides gem - borazirconocenes <nUm> . the latter when treated with BrCu give the homocoupled (1E,3E)-2,3-dibora-1,3-butadienes , <nUm> , in good yield ( 62-67 % ) . the reaction work even for hindered <nUm> ( r = t-Bu ) . structure <nUm> wa assigned on the basis of NMR . suzuki - miyaura coupling of 3a ( r = n-Bu ) with PhI in the presence of CsF lead to the replacement of both boron group by phenyl and hydrogen to give <nUm> in <nUm> % yield . zirconocene - mediated coupling of <nUm> lead to diastereomeric product : (1E,3E)-1,3-dibora-1,3-butadienes , <nUm> , in 7-26 % isolated yield and (1E,3E)-1,4-dibora-1,3-butadienes , <nUm> , in 17-34 % isolated yield . the two isomer can be separated by selective precipitation of <nUm> from the reaction mixture in pentane ( <nUm> ° C ) followed by silica gel chromatography to give pure <nUm> . the reaction doe not work when r in <nUm> is the t-Bu group . assignment of structure for <nUm> and <nUm> were done on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR experiment .

A general route ha been developed that allows a wider variety of unsaturated fragment to participate in these reaction . the use of these zirconocene complex in organic synthesis ha led to the development of novel route to a number of polyfunctionalized organic molecule . triphenylmethyl salt of the very weakly - coordinating borate anion [CN{B(C6F5)3}2]- ( 1 ) , [H2N{(C6F5)3}2] - and [ M{CNB(C6F5)3} 4]2- ( m = Ni , Pd ) have been prepared in simple one - pot reaction . mixture of (SBI)ZrMe2 / <nUm> / AlBu <nUm> i ( SBI = rac-Me2Si(Ind)2 ) are 30-40 time more active in ethylene polymerization at 60-100 ° C than BCl2ISZr / MAO . the quantification of anion effect on propene polymerization activity at <nUm> ° C give the order [CN{B(C6F5)3}2] - > [ H2N{(C6F5)3} 2]- ≈ BC6F5 <nUm> - ≫ [MeB(C6F5)3]- . the highest productivity were of the order of ca. <nUm> × <nUm> g PP ( mol zr)-1 h-1 [C3H6]-1 , about <nUm> - <nUm> time higher than with BC6F5 <nUm> - a the counter anion . the titanium system CGCTiMe <nUm> / <nUm> / AlBu <nUm> i gave activity that were very similar to the zirconocene catalyst . the concentration of active specie [C*] a determined by quenched - flow kinetic technique indicates typical value of around <nUm> % , independent of the counter anion , for both the borate and MAO system . pulsed field - gradient spin echo and nuclear overhauser effect NMR experiment on system designed to be more realistic model for active specie with longer polymeryl chain , (SBI)M(CH2SiMe3)(m-Me) BC18F15 and [ (SBI)MCH2SiMe <nUm> + ... BC6F5 <nUm> - ] ( m = Zr , Hf ) , demonstrated the influence of bulky alkyl chain on the ion pair solution structure : while the MeB(C6F 5)3 compound exists a a simple inner - sphere ion - pair , the BC6F5 <nUm> - compound is an outer - sphere ion pair ( OSIP ) , a consequence of the relegation of the anion into the second coordination sphere by the g-agostic interaction with the alkyl ligand . the OSIP aggregate to ion hextuples ( <nUm> mM ) or quadruple ( <nUm> mM ) . implication for the polymerization mechanism are discussed ; the process follows an associative interchange ( I a ) pathway . ethylene and propylene polymerization on immobilized catalyst of composition MMT-H2O / AlR3 / Zr - cene ( MMT = montmorillonite ) and on the corresponding homogeneous catalyst of composition Zr-cene-MAO ( Zr - cene = rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 , rac-Me2Si(Ind) 2ZrCl2 , rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind) 2ZrCl2 , rac-1-(9-e5-Flu)2-(5,6-Cp2-Me-1- e5-Ind)Et]ZrCl2 ) is considered . here , the activating support for the zirconocenes is montmorillonite containing methylaluminoxane or isobutylaluminoxane synthesized directly on the monmorillonite surface by the partial hydrolysis of an alkylaluminum ( AlMe3 , Al(i-Bu)3 , Al(i-Bu)2H ) with the mobile water of the support ( MMT-H 2O / AlR3 ) . the MMT-H2O / AlR3 support are demonstrated to be effective activator for ansa - zirconocenes . the catalytic property of the immobilized system ( process kinetics and efficiency , the molar mass of the resulting polymer , and the structure of the macromolecule ) depend on the activating support and the zirconocene precatalyst . the complex of the MMT-H2O / Al(i-Bu)3 support with all zirconocene precatalysts are more active in propylene polymerization than the same complex of MMT-H2O / AlMe3 . the zirconcenes immobilized on MMT-H2O / AlR3 afford polyethylene and polypropylene with a higher molar mass than the corresponding homogeneous system . furthermore , immobilization cause activesite heterogeneity . As compared to the homogeneous single - site catalyst of composition Zr-cene-MAO , the corresponding catalyst immobilized on MMT-H2O / AlR3 / Zr - cene are more stereospecific in the case of rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl <nUm> ( C <nUm> symmetry ) and are le stereospecific in the case of rac-[1-(9-e5-Flu)2-(5,6-Cp-2-Me-1-e5-Ind)Et] Cl2Zr ( C s symmetry ) . the kinetics of methyl methacrylate polymerization in the presence of benzoyl peroxide + metallocene ( ferrocene , titanocene dichloride , and zirconocene dichloride ) initiating system is considered , and the effect of the nature and amount of metallocene in the system are reported . the polymerization is assumed to be a complex - radical process . the structure of the complex - radical site of chain propagation and a scheme of their formation are deduced from quantum - chemical calculation . A new zirconocene ansa-Me2Si-(2Me-4-p-Tol-cyclopenta[b]indol-3- yl)2ZrCl2 complex ( I ) , in which the cp ligand is fused with the indole ring , ha been synthesized and studied by x-ray diffraction anal- ysis . light brown crystal are triclinic , space group P1 ; m = <nUm> , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , z = <nUm> , rcalc = <nUm> g / cm3 . the structural parameter of complex I are compared with the known bis-indenyl zirconium complex : rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( II ) and rac-Me 2Si(2Me-2Ph-1-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( III ) and analogous substituted rac-Me2Si(2,5-Me2-3Ph-6-Cp[b]Tp) 2ZrCl2 ( IV ) and rac-Me2Si(2,5-Me 2-1Ph-4-Cp[b]Py)2ZrCl2 ( V ) . complex I alkylated by the grignard reagent ( MgMe2 ) in the presence of the Al-iso-Bu3 cocatalyst is an effi- cient catalyst for the polymerization of propylene into isotactic polypropylene . density functional theory wa used to study gas - phase reaction between the Cp2*ZrMe+ cation , where cp* = C 5H5 ( 1 ) , Me5Cp = C5Me5 ( 2 ) , and flu = C13H9 ( 3 ) , and the ethylene molecule , Cp2*ZrMe+ + CH2 → Cp2*ZrPr+ → Cp2*ZrAllyl + + H . the reactivity of the cp2* ZrMe+ cation with respect to the ethylene molecule decreased in the series <nUm> > <nUm> ≈ <nUm> . substitution in the cp ring decreased the reactivity of the Cp2*ZrMe+ cation toward ethylene , in agreement with the experimental data on the comparative reactivity of complex <nUm> and <nUm> . the two main energy barrier along the reaction path ( the formation of the C-C bond leading to the primary product Cp2*ZrPr+ and hydride shift leading to the secondary product Cp2*Zr(H 2)Allyl+ ) vary in opposite direction in the series of the compound studied . for flu ( 3 ) , these barrier are close to each other , and for the other compound , the formation of the C-C bond requires the overcoming of a higher energy barrier . A comparison of the result obtained with the data on the activity of zirconocene catalyst in real catalytic system for the polymerization of ethylene led u to conclude that the property of the catalytic center changed drastically in the passage from the model reaction in the gas phase to real catalytic system . the effect of zirconocene dichloride and it indene - containing derivative on the radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate initiated by benzoyl peroxide ha been studied . the influence of the metallocenes on the kinetic parameter of the process and the average degree of polymerization ha been established . concentration and temperature dependence have been measured for the initial rate of reaction and the average degree of polymerization in relation to the content of the component in the system . the microstructure of poly(methyl methacrylate ) prepared in the presence of the used initiation system ha been determined . the copolymerization of ethylene with propylene in the liquid propylene initiated by ansa - metallocenes of the C <nUm> symmetry , rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1- e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride and rac-[1-(9- e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1-e5- indenyl)ethane]hafnium dichloride , activated by methylaluminoxane ha been studied . triisobutylaluminum ha been used a a cocatalyst . the propylene-ethylene copolymer thus prepared contain 5-60 mol % ethylene unit . the reactivity ratio have been measured . In the case of the zirconocene - based catalyst , the molecular mass of the copolymer decrease with an increase in the content of ethylene unit . the reverse situation is observed in the case of the hafnocene - based catalytic system . the copolymer are characterized by the low T g value ( down to <nUm> ° C ) . incorporation of a small amount of ethylene unit ( <nUm> mol % ) result in a rise in the elastomeric behavior of the polymer . the quantum - chemical model formerly designed is described , which explains the high reactivity of the d 0-transition metal-carbon s-bond in concerted reaction including polymerization of olefin . In this model , the energy of transition from the ground singlet state to the excited singlet or triplet state corresponding to the transfer of electron density from the metal-carbon bond to vacant d-atomic orbitals correlate with it relative elongation after which a change in the valence state of a metal begin . this change is caused by the difference in the geometry of valence s- , p- , and d-atomic orbitals having close energy ; a a result , at a certain bond elongation , partial uncoupling of electron involved in bonding take place so that one of them becomes localized on d-atomic orbital . this process facilitates formation of the reactive state of the bond of the biradical type and lead to a reduction in the energy barrier of the insertion of an olefin molecule into this bond . lower energy of this barrier correspond to lower value of DE(S <nUm> → S j ) and DE(S <nUm> → T j ). As shown at the example of zirconocenes cp 2ZrMe2 and Me2CCp2ZrMe2 , alongside with a reduction in the energy barrier of olefin insertion into the Zr-Me bond of the cationic complex being formed , the characteristic absorption band in the spectrum of the corresponding neutral derivative shift to the long - wave region . this band is attributed to the transfer of the electron density from the Zr-Me bond to the Zr atom . analysis is performed of the cause for bathochromic shift of the long - wave absorption band for adduct formation in the system including metallocene and Al - containing cocatalyst . the compositional heterogeneity of ethylene-1-hexene copolymer synthesized with various type of supported catalyst , namely , the titanium - magnesium catalyst Cl4Ti / Cl2Mg and the zirconocene catalyst OSi 2(MAO) / Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 , is studied via the method of successive self-nucleation-annealing ( SSA ) with the use of differential scanning calorimetry . on the basis of the data on the temperature of individual peak on SSA curve , the thickness of lamella composed of macromolecule with a certain degree of short - chain branching is estimated . the copolymer synthesized with the zirconocene catalyst ha a narrower range of fusion and doe not contain large lamella composed of molecule with a low degree of short - chain branching . with the use of the broadness index , it is shown that the copolymer synthesized with the zirconocene catalyst ha a more uniform distribution of the comonomer than doe the copolymer synthesized with the titanium - magnesium catalyst . for the copolymer synthesized with the titanium - magnesium catalyst , the compositional heterogeneity increase with an increase in the content of 1-hexene . the free - radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate initiated by the three - component system ferrocene - zirconocene dichloride-benzoyl peroxide ha been studied . the kinetic feature of the process , the interaction between component of the initiation system , and the molecular characteristic of the polymer have been investigated . In the case of the three - component initiation system , the content of syndiotactic fragment grows and the thermal stability of the polymer is improved compared to the product of polymerization carried out in the presence of solely a peroxide initiator . the effect of the nature of metallocene ( ferrocene , titanocene dichloride , and zirconocene dichloride ) and it content in benzoyl peroxide - metallocene initiating system on the kinetics of polymerization of methyl methacrylate have been studied . the kinetic feature of polymerization and change in the molecular characteristic of poly(methyl methacrylate ) indicate that the process occurs via the complex - radical mechanism . on the basis of quantum - chemical calculation , a scheme describing the formation of complex - radical center of chain propagation for the benzoyl peroxide - ferrocene system is proposed . anchored aluminoxanes are synthesized by the reaction of aluminum alkyl AlMe3 and Al(i-Bu)3 with water contained in the intracrystalline cavity of synthetic and natural zeolite ( NaY ( Si : Al = <nUm> ) , HZSM-5 ( Si : Al = <nUm> or <nUm> ) , NH4ZSM-5 ( Si : Al = <nUm> ) , NaZSM-5 ( Si : Al = <nUm> ) , and clinoptilolite - containing tuff ) and are used for the synthesis of heterogenized complex of ansa - zirconocenes ( rac-C2H 4(Ind)2ZrCl2 , rac-Me2Si(Ind) 2ZrCl2 , and rac-[1-(9-e5-Flu)-2-(5,6- cyclopenta-2-Me-1-e5-Ind)C2H4]ZrCl <nUm> ) active in the polymerization of propylene . the nature of the zeolite support determines the content of zeolite water and affect the formation of anchored alkylaluminoxanes and the activity of immobilized catalyst . among the studied catalytic system supported on zeolite , NaY and NaZSM-5 are the most efficient for the polymerization of propylene . PP synthesized with the supported zirconocene catalyst ha a higher molecular mass and a wider molecular - mass distribution than those in the case of the corresponding homogeneous catalyst . the index of isotacticity and the content of pentad mmmm in PP prepared with immobilized metallocenes with the C <nUm> symmetry , such a rac-C2H4(Ind) 2ZrCl2 and rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl <nUm> , are likewise higher . the stereoselectivity of supported catalyst depends on the zeolite nature . the main spectral - luminescent property of organometallic complex of Ti , Zr , and Hf with aromatic ligand are examined . this class of compound exhibit highly emissive ( phosphorescent ) ligand - to - metal charge transfer ( LMCT ) state . the linear dependence of the phosphorescent characteristic of zirconocene on parameter that describe the molecular structure of organic medium and also the nature of coordinative ( inner- and outersphere ) interaction of the phosphorescent metal complex with medium molecule is discussed . bis(e 5-cyclopentadienyl)-2,4-bis(trimethylsilylethynyl)-3,5- bis(trimethylsilyl)titanacyclopenta-2,4-diene ( 1 ) and the seven - membered zirconacyclocumulene bis(e 5-cyclopemadienyl)-2,4,7-tris(trimethylsilyl)-3- ( trimethylsilylethynyl ) zirconacyclohepta-2,4,5,6-tetraene ( 2 ) react with sulfur monochloride to yield an identical product , 2,4-bis(trimethylsilylethynyl)-3,5-bis(trimethylsilyl)thiophene ( 3 ) .

<nUm> , r = H ) , were obtained by reacting the silanol with the respective zirconocene dichloride and triethylamine in CCl2H2 in a <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio , an excess of the zirconocene dichloride being required to suppress intramolecular dehydration of TRIPOSS . the related SIPOSS complex , [{(c-C5H9)7Si8O12O}2-Zr(c5-C5H4Bu)2] ( 3 ) , wa prepared similarly at the stoichiometric ratio of [ZrCl2(c5-C5H4Bu)2] / SIPOSS / NEt3 equal to <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> . when employed in the <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> ratio , the same reagent afforded only the impure complex [{(c-C5H9)7Si8O12O}ZrCl(c5-C5H4Bu)2] ( 4 ) , contaminated with <nUm> and unreacted [ZrCl2(c5-C5H4Bu)2] . finally , the zirconocene complex with SIPOSS and DIPOSS moiety , [ {(c-C5H9)7Si8O12O} 2Zr(c5-C5H5)2 ] ( 5 ) and [(c-C5H9)7Si7O9(OSiMe3)O2}-Zr(c5-C5H5)2] ( 6 ) , respectively , were obtained by reacting [ZrMe2(c5-C5H5)2] with stoichiometric amount of the appropriate silanols . all complex were characterized by 1H , 13C , 29Si NMR and IR spectrum , and by elemental analysis from XPS spectrum . preliminary ethene polymerization experiment showed that compound <nUm> or <nUm> when combined with an excess of methylaluminoxane were nearly a active a [ZrCl2(c5-C5H5)2] whereas compound <nUm> wa by about one order of magnitude le active . complex [ Zr{e5-C5Me4(SiMe 2H)}2Cl2 ] ( 1 ) wa prepared by the reaction of lithium salt of 2,3,4,5-tetramethyl-1-(dimethylsilyl)cyclopenta-2,4-diene with [ZrCl4] in boiling THF . the reduction of <nUm> with excess magnesium in THF in the presence of excess bis(trimethylsilyl)- acetylene ( btmsa ) afforded the bivalent metal ansa-disilylene complex with p-coordinated btmsa [ Zr(e2-btmsa){e5-C5Me4(SiMe 2)}2 ] ( 2 ) . the dehydrocoupling of SiMe2H group wa accompanied by a hydrogen transfer to releasing btmsa to give a mixture of cis- and trans- 1,2-bis(trimethylsilyl)ethene . chlorination of <nUm> with ClPb <nUm> afforded ansa-[Zr{e5-C5Me4- (SiMe2)}2Cl2 ] ( 3 ) and liberated btmsa . the crystal structure of complex , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined by x-ray crystallography . chiral amino-functionalized silicon - bridged indene derivative 4a-4c were synthesized from 3-(2-(N,N-dialkylamino)ethyl)indenes 2a-2c . the C-Si coupling reaction are regioselective , leading exclusively to the formation of 1,3-disubstituted isomer in a rac / meso ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> , a indicated by NMR spectroscopy . the solid - state structure of the dimethylsilyl-bridged bisindene (R,R)-4a is described . the formation of corresponding ansa - zirconocenes via amine elimination chemistry wa monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy . this article highlight some of our recent effort and present new data on the importance of cyclopentadienyl substituent effect on group <nUm> metallocene dinitrogen chemistry . reaction such a the coordination of N to an isolated titanium sandwich complex , alkali - metal reduction of zirconocene dihalide complex , alkane reductive elimination reaction , and the hydrogenation of zirconium dinitrogen complex are all extremely sensitive to the group present on the cyclopentadienyl ring . these result are promising for the future of N fixation , a the reactivity of a specific metallocene can be dramatically altered by subtle manipulation in ligand substituents . the 15-thia-15-deoxy analogue of prostaglandin E1 methyl ester ha been prepared by the zirconocene chloride mediated conjugate addition of an n-pentyl ethynyl sulfide derived anion to an appropriately substituted cyclopentenone . similar methodology ha also been used to prepare other 3-(3'-thia-1'-octenyl)-cyclopentanones . CO insertion and C-C reductive elimination involved in the carbonylation of the metallacyclic zirconocene complex , 1,1-bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)-1- zirconaindan ( r ) , have been theoretically studied with the aid of DFT calculation at the B3LYP level . it is found that the c(sp3)- c(sp2) reductive elimination is preferred over c(sp <nUm> ) - c(sp2) , and importantly , this preference for C-C reductive elimination directs the CO insertion into the Zr - c(sp2) bond rather than the Zr - c(sp3) bond , even though the CO insertion into the former bond is kinectically le favorable than into the latter bond , a result related to that the CO insertion is found to be reversible . the synthesis and spectroscopic study of metalloporphyrin dimer having 1,3-butadiyne linker attached to the beta pyrrolic position of the linked porphyrin are reported . bromoethenyl metalloporphyrins were synthesized by zirconocene - promoted bromomethylenation of beta formyl metalloporphyrins . bromoethenyl metalloporphyrins were dehydrohalogenated by potassium tertbutoxide to give beta ethynyl or 2-ethynyl metalloporphyrins . it is the first documented example of zirconocene - promoted bromomethylenation of beta formyl metalloporphyrins . bromoethenyl metalloporphyrins were also synthesized by halo - wittig route . 2-ethynyl metalloporphyrins were self dimerized to give metalloporphyrin dimer having 1,3-butadiyne linking bridge . FTIR , raman spectroscopy , UV - visible , elemental analysis , 1H NMR and mass spectrometry were used to characterize the compound . the purpose of this paper is to summarize mode of action of cisplatin on the tumor cell , a brief outlook on the metallocene compound a antitumor drug a well a the future tendency for the use of the latter in anticancer chemotherapy . molecular mechanism of cisplatin interaction with DNA , DNA repair mechanism , and cellular protein are discussed . molecular background of the sensitivity and resistance to cisplatin , a well a it influence on the efficacy of the antitumor immune response wa evaluated . furthermore , herein are summarized some metallocenes ( titanocene , vanadocene , molybdocene , ferrocene , and zirconocene ) with high antitumor activity . ethylene polymerization wa done to form polyethylene nano-composite with nanoaluminum nitride using zirconocene catalyst . result show that the catalytic activity is maximum at a filler loading of <nUm> mg nanoaluminum nitride . differential scanning calorimeter ( DSC ) and x-ray diffraction ( XRD ) result show that percentage crystallinity wa also marginally higher at this amount of filler . thermal behavior of polyethylene nanocomposites ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> ) mg wa studied by DSC and thermal gravimetric analyzer ( TGA ) . morphology of the component with <nUm> mg aluminium nitride is more fibrous a compared to <nUm> mg aluminium nitride and higher filler loading a shown by SEM image . In order to understand combustibility behavior , test were performed on microcalorimeter . it result showed decrease in combustibility in polyethylene nanocomposites a the filler loading increase . two commercial nanoclays were used here a catalytic filler for production of polyethylene ( PE ) and linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) nanocomposites via in situ polymerization with zirconocene / MAO catalyst . it wa found that both type of nanoclays designated a clay A and clay B can improve thermal stability to the host polymer a observed from a thermal gravimetric analysis ( TGA ) . the distribution of the clay inside the polymer matrix appeared good due to the in situ polymerization system into which the clay were introduced during the polymer forming reaction . upon investigating the clay by x-ray diffractometer ( XRD ) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ) , it wa observed that the crucial difference between the two clay are the crystallite size ( A < B ) and the amount of amine group ( A < B ) . the higher amount of amine group in clay B wa supposed to be a major reason for the lower catalytic activity of the polymerization system compared to clay A resulting from it deactivating effect on zirconocene catalyst . however , for both clay , increasing their content in the polymerization system reduced the catalytic activity due to the higher steric hindrance occurring . polypropylene wa synthesized using binary metallocene catalyst , rac-ethylenebis-(1-e5-indenyl)-zirconium dichloride ( rac - Et(Ind) 2ZrCl2 : cata A ) and zirconocene dichloride ( cp 2ZrCl2 : cata B ) , in the presence of ZnEt2 . the result indicated that ZnEt2 wa an effective agent in modulating isotactivity of polypropylene . moreover , it wa found that the [mmmm] pentad value of polypropylene prepared in the presence of diethyl zinc decreased to <nUm> , and the new peak of [rmmr] and [ rmrr + mmrm ] appeared , in contrast to the peak from polyproplene obtained in the absence of diethyl zinc . therefore , the possible reason wa the occurrence of chain - shuttling polymerization in the CataA / CataB / ZnEt2 catalyst system . In our experiment , monospheres ( ball of silica , diameter 200-250 nm ) , carbon fiber ( diameter <nUm> nm , length 0.5-3 mm ) and carbon nanotube ( diameter 15-25 nm , length <nUm> mm ) were used a filler . before polymerization , the filler were separated by ultrasound and then treated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the MAO reacts partially with the OH - group of the silica and the formation of methane . catalytically active center are formed after adding the zirconocenes or other transition metal complex . the thickness of the polyolefins can be controlled by the pressure of ethene or propene and by the polymerization time . by this method , highly filled nanocomposite polypropene can be obtained with a silica content of up to <nUm> wt % . such combined material are stiff and hard . every particle is surrounded by a thin film of polyolefin with a thickness of <nUm> to <nUm> nm . carbon fiber and carbon nanotube can be covered also within isotactic or syndiotactic polypropene . because of the hydrophobic character of the carbon surface , the polymer is drawing on the fiber . this lead to a reinforced combined polymer with special property . different metallocene catalyst were used to synthesize propene / 1-hexene and ethene / styrene copolymer . for the propene / 1-hexene copolymerization , [Me2Si(2-Me-4-PhInd)2]ZrCl2 and [Me2Si(2-Me-4-NaphthylInd)2]ZrCl2 give high activity and random copolymer . In contrast for the ethene / styrene copolymerization , silyl-bridged zirconocenes produce polymer with only a low amount of styrene unit . here , isopropyl-bridged C2 and CS symmetric zirconocenes incorporate high amount of styrene up to <nUm> mol % . A comparison wa carried out in respect of the catalyst activity and it ability to incorporate styrene a well a of the property of the resulting polymer , such a molar mass , melting and glass transition temperature . metallocene complex Cp2TiCl2 , cp 2ZrCl2 , Cp2Zr(NnBu2) <nUm> , Cp2Ti(e 1-OC(O)C6H 5)2 and Cp2Zr(e 1-OC(O)C 6H5)2 were supported on ClMg <nUm> / SiCl4-n (n-C6H13O)n carrier and used for ethylene polymerization . the supported complex result in highly active catalyst when treated with different aluminum alkyl-based co-catalysts . these catalyst are able of tuning the final property of the produced polyethylene . mixed composite of metallocenes and conventional ziegler - natta catalyst supported on the same carrier were also studied . A supported zirconocene Cp2Zr(e 1-OC(O)C 6H5)2 on Cl2Mg / SiCl4-n (n-C6H13O)n resulted in a highly active catalyst that eject control on the molecular weight , crystallinity and morphology of the resultant polyethylene . background : monomeric group IVB ( Ti , Zr and Hf ) metallocenes represent a new class of antitumor compound . there is literature on the general biological activity of some organotin compound . unfortunately , there is little information with respect to the molecular level activity of these organotin compound . we recently started focusing on the anti-cancer activity of organotin polymer that we had made for other purpose and a part of our platinum anti-cancer effort . method : for this study , we synthesized a new series of metallocene - containing compound coupling the metallocene unit with dienestrol , a synthetic , nonsteroidal estrogen . this is part of our effort to couple known moiety that offer antitumor activity with biologically active unit hoping to increase the biological activity of the combination . the material were confirmed to be polymeric using light scattering photometry and the structural repeat unit wa verified employing matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy result . result : the polymer demonstrated the ability to suppress the growth of a series of tumor cell line originating from breast , colon , prostrate , and lung cancer at concentration generally lower than those required for inhibition of cell growth by the commonly used antitumor drug cisplatin . conclusion : these drug show great promise in vitro against a number of cancer cell line and due to their polymeric nature will most likely be le toxic than currently used metal - containing drug such a cisplatin . these drug also offer several addition positive aspect . first , the reactant are commercially available so that additional synthetic step are not needed . second , synthesis of the polymer is rapid , occurring within about <nUm> second . third , the interfacial synthetic system is already industrially employed in the synthesis of aromatic nylon and polycarbonates . thus , the ability to synthesize large amount of the drug is straight forward . lithium dimesitylgermanedithiolate reacted with titanocene or zirconocene dichloride to give 2,2-dimesityl-1,3-dithia-2-germa-4-titanacycle ( 3a ) and it zirconocene analogue ( 3b ) , which afforded a stable 2,3,4,5-tetrathiagermolane ( 4 ) in treatment with ClS . the reaction of 3b with Ph2GeCl2 gave unsymmetric 1,3,2,4-dithiadigermetane ( 5 ) . the bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl) derivative of cis-2,3-di-t-butyl-2,3-diphenyl-1,4-dithia-2,3-disila-5-titanacyclopentane ( 7a ) obtained from lithium 1,2-di-t-butyl-1,2-diphenyldisilane-1,2-dithiolate reacted with electrophilic reagent ( Cl2S , ClS , ClSe , R2GeCl2 ) to give the corresponding heterocycle . novel zirconium - iron dinuclear complex , [ FcSiMe <nUm> ( r <nUm> r <nUm> Cp)ZrCl <nUm> cp ] ( fc ; ferrocenyl , r <nUm> = r <nUm> = H ; 2a , r <nUm> = me , r <nUm> = H ; 2b , r <nUm> = r <nUm> = me ; 2c , r <nUm> = ph , r <nUm> = H ; 2d ) , [ FcSiMe <nUm> Cp{ZrCl <nUm> ( me <nUm> cp ) } ] ( 3a ) , hafnium - iron dinuclear complex , [ FcSiMe <nUm> Cp{HfCl <nUm> ( me <nUm> cp ) } ] ( 3b ) and zirconium - iron trinuclear complex , [ ClZr <nUm> ( FcSiMe <nUm> cp ) <nUm> ] ( 4 ) , were synthesized and complex 2d and <nUm> were characterized by an x-ray diffraction method . olefin polymerization were conducted by using these multimetallic zirconocene catalyst with the coexistence of methylaluminoxane or tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borates . the maximum catalytic activity of complex <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> were observed at low temperature ( 15-45 ° C ) in ethylene polymerization , contrary to the conventional zirconocene catalyst ( [ ClZr <nUm> cp <nUm> ] ) , showing the maximum activity at between 70-80 ° C . A detailed investigation of ethylene polymerization and NMR measurement of the active specie suggested that the interesting behavior of these complex arose from an electronic cooperative effect between the zirconium and iron atom . it wa also revealed that complex <nUm> were highly reactive toward propylene or diene in the copolymerization of ethylene and propylene or terpolymerization of ethylene , propylene and diene . dialkylzirconocenes in situ generated such a Cp2Zr(n-Bu)2 , Cp2ZrEt2 , and Cp2Zr(t-Bu)(i-Bu) are thermolyzed to afford zirconocene - alkene complex . In the case of Cp2Zr(n-Bu)2 and Cp2Zr(t-Bu)(i-Bu) , Cp2Zr-alkene complex generated from them tend to act a a " Cp2Zr " equivalent , since the initially generated alkene is often replaced by another p-bond containing compound . In the presence of alkyne , for example , alkyne complex may be generated . on the other hand , Cp2Zr(ethylene) tends to serve a an intermediate since the ethylene moiety is often incorporated in the final organic product . ring expansion and contraction , ligand substitution , transmetallation , migratory insertion , stereoisomerization , regioisomerization , oxidative addition involving these Cp2Zr-alkene and Cp2Zr - alkyne complex a well a their structure are reviewed . this account describes recent development in carbon-carbon bond cleavage reaction and selective transformation of 5-membered zirconacycles , including zirconacyclopentanes , zirconacyclopentenes , and zirconacyclopentadienes . these zirconacycles can be prepared by coupling of unsaturated compound such a alkene and / or alkyne , but the zirconacycles also undergo b,b'-C-C bond cleavage , which ha been further applied to organic transformation reaction . combination of the b,b-C-C bond cleavage and the C-C bond formation on zirconocene provided a highly selective and novel transformation . vinylzirconation of alkyne , regioselective allylzirconation of alkyne , and coupling of alkyne with nitrile or ketone were achieved by this method . zirconacyclopentadienes prepared symmetrically or unsymmetrically were converted into naphthalene , diene , and benzene derivative . preparation of benzene derivative from three different alkyne wa performed by combination of C-C bond cleavage and C-C bond formation on zirconocene in one - pot in high yield with excellent selectivity . bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium chloride hydride ( schwartz reagent ) proved to be an efficient radical chain carrier for radical reduction of organic halide . treatment of 1-bromoadamantane with Cp2Zr(H)Cl in THF at <nUm> ° C in the presence of triethylborane furnished adamantane quantitatively . radical cyclization of 2-haloalkyl allyl ether afforded five - membered product under the same reaction condition . reduction with Cp2Zr(H)Cl generated in situ from Cp2ZrCl2 and sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminium hydride ( Red-Al ) also proceeded smoothly . moreover , the reduction could function by using a catalytic amount of cp 2ZrCl2 . A zirconocene - olefin complex also induced reductive radical cyclization of 2-haloalkyl allyl ether in THF . this complex served a a single electron transfer reagent to promote the radical cyclization . furthermore , the cyclization reaction in DME afforded 3- tetrahydrofuranylmethylzirconium efficiently . one - pot synthesis of cyclohexene derivative from two alkyne and one maleic acid derivative could be achieved . two alkyne were treated with [ cp 2ZrBu <nUm> ] to give zirconacyclopentadienes . addition of <nUm> equiv of H 2O followed by the reaction with maleic anhydride at <nUm> ° C in toluene for <nUm> h afforded the cyclohexene derivative in high yield . the corresponding titanacyclopentadiene did not give the desired product under the same condition . In the case of Hf , only <nUm> % of the product wa obtained . dienylzirconocene , which could be prepared by the addition of one equiv of EtOH or t-BuOH to the zirconacyclopentadiene , also reacted with maleic anhydride to give the cyclohexene derivative in <nUm> and <nUm> % yield , respectively . the reaction of dilithiated silylene-bridged cp - ligand , whose silylene had one or two vinyl substituents , with Cl4Zr gave racemo - rich mixture of the complex RR'Si(C5H2-2,4-Me2)2ZrCl <nUm> ( <nUm> : r = vinyl , R' = me , rac / meso = <nUm> / <nUm> , <nUm> : r = R' = vinyl , rac / meso = <nUm> / <nUm> ) . the pure racemic complex 1-rac wa isolated after several recrystallization process in a satisfactory yield ( <nUm> % , rac / meso > <nUm> / <nUm> ) and wa structurally characterized . polymerization of propylene with 1-rac / MAO gave highly isotactic polypropylene . when aromatic halide were treated with alkylmagnesium reagent ( which have b-hydrogens ) and a catalytic amount of zirconocene dichloride , dehalogenation proceeded smoothly in high yield . the stoichiometric dehalogenation using dialkylzir - conocenes also proceeded with high selectivity . A zirconocene-ethylene complex C p2Zr(CH2 = CH2 ) - ( PMe3 ) reacted with R3EX ( e = Si , Ge , Sn ; r = ph or bu ; x = Cl , OE1 , or OER3 ) to give R3EEt in high yield after hydrolysis . the reaction mixture of the ethylene complex with Bu3SnCl further reacted with phenylacetylene to give homoallyltin compound . when the reaction mixture wa treated with Ph3SnCl or Ph3GeCl instead of phenylacetylene , Ph3SnEt or Ph3GcEt wa obtained in high yield after hydrolysis via the replacement of the b-SnBu3 moiety . nonbridged zirconocene dichloride , ( 1,2-Me <nUm> -4-RC <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( r = me ( 3 ) , ph ( 4 ) , p-FC <nUm> H <nUm> ( 5 ) , 2-furyl ( 6 ) , 2-thienyl ( 7 ) , and fc ( 8 ) ) , and meso- and rac-(1-Me-3-PhC <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) , in the presence of MAO show a high catalytic activity ( <nUm> - <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> gPP / molZr · h ) in the polymerization of propylene and produce almost an atactic elastomeric polymer of high molecular weight ( m w = <nUm> - <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> ). In contrast , rac-(1-Me-3-t-BuC <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( 12 ) show very low activity and produce a rather high isotactic polymer of low molecular weight . the introduction of furyl group to the position next to the silylene bridge of an ansa - zirconocene catalyst wa found to remarkably enhance the catalytic activity and the molecular weight of PP during the isospecific polymerization of propylene . A C2 - symmetric afwa - zirconocene complex which ha a Si-Cl moiety on it bridge wa immobilized on O2Si by the reaction of the Si-Cl anchor with Si-OH on the solid surface . the prepared solid catalyst wa found to be effective for isospecific propene polymerization . it exhibited higher productivity compared to a catalyst prepared using the zirconocene without a Si-Cl anchor . the effect of pretreatment of silica surface with Me3SiCl on catalyst performance is also described . zirconocene - mediated coupling of bis(methoxyethynyl)-disilanes ( 1a and 1e-g ) led to zirconacycles ( 2a and 2e-g ) , which were converted into 3,4-dialkylidene- and 3,4-benzo-1,2-disilacyclobutanes ( 3a and 6e-g ) via protonolysis and transmetallation with tin followed by diels - alder reaction . their Si-Si bond were reactive toward palladium catalyst to give bissilylation and silyl-Heck product ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) . novel zirconocene or hafnocene - containing silsesquioxanes with a vinyl group Cp2M{[(vinyl)Me2Si](c-C5H9)7Si7O12} ( cp = cyclopentadienyl , m = Zr , Hf ) were synthesized , a well a a derivative with a trimethylsilyl group Cp2Zr[(Me3Si)(c-C5H9)7Si7O12] . A derivative containing a dimethylethoxysilyl group wa also synthesized . DFT calculation clearly show that a zirconocene-ethylene complex , cp <nUm> Zr(C <nUm> H <nUm> ) , easily reacts with hydrosilane , HSi <nUm> , to afford either cp <nUm> Zr(H)(C <nUm> H <nUm> HSi <nUm> ) or cp <nUm> Zr(SiH <nUm> )(C <nUm> H <nUm> ). In the transition state , the Si-H anti-bonding s*-orbital of HSi <nUm> overlap well with the p-back donating molecular orbital between Zr d π and C <nUm> H <nUm> p* orbitals . Cp2ZrEt2 reacted with one equiv of Cp2ZrX2 ( x = Cl or Br ) in THF to afford ethylene-bridged bimetallic zirconocene complex , (Cp2ZrX)2(CH2CH2) ( x = Cl ( 2a ) , or Br ( 2b ) ) , in high yield . the structure of 2b wa determined by x-ray analysis . reaction of 2a-b with various anion Y- gave a series of ethylene-bridged bimetallic zirconocene complex , (Cp2ZrY)2-(CH2CH2) ( Y = ph , me , bu , CH2SiMe3 ) in good to high yield . new stereorigid bridged zirconocene having an indenyl group and a fluorenyl group a ligand wa synthesized and investigated a an ethylene / 1-hydroxy-10-undecene copolymerization catalyst . this catalyst using MAO a a cocatalyst promoted polymerization to produce copolymer having high molecular weight ( mw : <nUm> ) and high polar monomer content ( <nUm> mol % ) , displaying higher polymerization activity at higher temperature . the reaction of zirconocene - alkyne complex prepared from cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> with BuLi and an alkyne with CMoO <nUm> yielded 2,3-disubstituted-5-ethylcyclopentenone derivative by incorporation of once eliminated butene with excellent regioselectivity . zirconium - mediated cyclization of an allyl-ene compound afforded organozirconium intermediate , which after alkylation ( allylation and acylation ) afforded either dienes or unsaturated ketone . these are considered to be precursor further elaboration of which should yield functionlized steroid . dimerization of aryl-substituted terminal alkyne on indenyl zirconium complex occurred in a selective way . 1,4-Aryl-1,3-diene derivative were formed exclusively after hydrolysis . it is in sharp contrast to the reaction on [Cp2Zr] complex . organometallic complex are useful tool in synthetic organic chemistry . we investigated a novel synthetic method for ring construction using organometallic complex and synthesized natural product and biologically active substance using these method . metalacycles formed from an early transition metal and diene , enyne , and diyne are stable under the reaction condition and they are easily converted into compound with functional group by the addition of various agent . we have developed a novel synthetic method of heterocycle from enyne and diene using Cp2ZrBu2 . the total synthesis of (-)-dendrobine , (+-)-mecembrane , and (+-)-mecembrine were achieved using this procedure . to synthesize these natural product a a chiral form , a novel palladium - catalyzed asymmetric allylic amination wa developed , and chiral 2-arylcyclohexenylamine derivative were synthesized . from these compound , the total synthesis of (-)-mesembrane , (-)-mesembrine , (+)-crinamine , (-)-haemanthidine , and (+)-pretazetine were achieved . by further development of this procedure , a chiral 2-siloxymethylcy-clohexenylamine derivative could be synthesized and the novel synthesis of indole derivative wa developed from this compound . from this indole derivative , (-)-tsubifoline and (-)-strychnine were synthesized . novel zirconium - mediated carbon-carbon bond - forming reaction were developed . the allylic , g-alkoxyallylic , allenyl , and g,g- dialkoxyallylic zirconium specie can be prepared from corresponding ether under mild condition through the addition of a zirconocene - butene complex to the carbon-carbon multiple bond of the ether and subsequent b-elimination of the alkoxyl group . the g,g-dialkoxyallylic zirconium specie reacts with carbonyl compound at the b-position of the zirconium atom like a ketene dialkyl acetal in the presence of stoichiometric amount of lewis acid and gave cyclopropane and / or cyclobutane derivative . intramolecular reaction of allylic zirconium specie with acetal also develops a a ring contraction reaction of carbohydrate and morpholine derivative . this method is useful for the construction of chiral highly functionalized carbocycles and pyrrolidines . the intramolecular ester transfer reaction through the zirconium - mediated coupling reaction of alkenyl carbamate gave g-aminobutyric acid derivative and pyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid . four isomer of 5,7-dodecadien-l-ol were previously proposed a being the sex pheromone of the pine moth . the isomer were stereoselectively synthesized from 1-hexyne and tetrahydropyranyl ether of 5-hexyn-l-ol . the ( 5Z , 7Z ) - isomer wa synthesized by a chodkiewic cadiot reaction followed by hydroboration , and other three isomer by novel synthetic method including the addition of zirconocene hydride [ schwarz 's reagent C10ClH11Zn ] to control the regioselective coupling reaction . the 5,8- and 5,9-dodecadien-l-ol were also synthesized by similar method for comparison of their characteristic with the endogenous sex pheromone . stability of various fluorinated BPh4 anion in ion - pair metallocene catalyst system ha been studied . XPS measurement show that the incorporation of electron - withdrawing fluorine substituents decrease the electron density of boron drastically . the anion can be classified into three type according to the reactivity associated with it lewis basisity . i.e. , the number of fluorine substituents : ( 1 ) the anion without any fluorine substituent that reacts with Cp2ZrR with phenyl group transfer , ( 2 ) those with <nUm> – <nUm> fluorine substituents that react with trialkyl aluminium , and ( 3 ) those with <nUm> and <nUm> fluorine substituents that undergo no side reaction . practically , the stability of the anion is one of the most important requirement for the application of the ion-pair(non-MAO) metallocene catalyst . we have synthesized polyethylene and polypropylene copolymer having cyclopentane unit in the main chain by copolymerization of ethylene and propylene , respectively , with cyclopentene ( CPE ) or 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) using metallocene catalyst . among the obtained copolymer , poly ( ethylene-co-HD ) , which ha 1,3-cyclopentane unit in the main chain , show isomorphism with a transition of the crystalline structure from orthorhombic to hexagonal . we used this finding for the molecular design of a liquid crystalline polyolefin . A liquid crystalline phase wa discovered in poly(methylene-1,3-cyclopentane) ( PMCP ) , which wa obtained by cyclization polymerization of HD using zirconocene catalyst . PMCPs clearly showed a birefringent texture which indicates a nematic liquid crystalline phase . A high cyclization selectivity of inserted HD unit , a high trans-content of the 1,3-cyclopentane unit , and a low molecular weight without crosslinking were necessary to induce the liquid crystalline phase . dinuclear complex attracted attention a ethylene and olefin polymerization catalyst because they frequently show different catalytic property than their mononuclear analogue . most of the known dinculear catalyst are composed of the same transition metal center . herein we synthesized novel dinuclear complex by the olefin metathesis reaction and used them a the catalyst for olefin polymerization . olefin metathesis of the zirconocenes with alkenyl group affords the dinuclear Zr complex having a bridging spacer with various length . the dinuclear complex show higher catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization than the corresponding mononuclear complex . heterodinuclear complex containing early and late transition metal were synthesized by facile cross-metathesis reaction . they promote polymerization of ethylene to afford polyethylene with various branched structure depending on the combination of the metal center . the polymerization mechanism includes formation of ethylene oligomers on the late transition metal center followed by copolymerization of ethylene with those oligomers on early transition metal center . none the reaction of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) or I2 with the living zirconium - polyolefin bond ( Zr-PO ) using zirconocene catalyst system were examined . although the reaction of MMA with the living Zr-PP doe not proceed , I2 readily reacts with the living Zr-PO , such a atactic polypropylene ( ataPP ) , iso poly(1-hexene) and syndiotactic poly(propylene) ( synPP ) , quantitatively to give the terminal iodized polyolefins ( PO-I ) . moreover , PO-poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) block copolymer could be obtained by the reaction of MMA with living Sm-PO , which wa formerly prepared by the transformation of PO-I by Cp2*Sm .

A halide or alkyl ligand present in the outer coordination sphere of active site affect considerably both the catalytic performance of active specie and the property of the resulting PE . the Cl - keeping Al - Zr heteronuclear active site give rise to high-M linear PE ; alkyl holder are highly capable of chain propagation and chain transfer to monomer . the high reactivity of the Zr - Cl bond in the latter active site manifest itself also in the high ability to incorporate alfa - olefin to yield PE chain containing branch with <nUm> - <nUm> incorporated ethylene unit . propylene / ethylene copolymer were prepared over two complex catalyst system : ( i ) an AlEt3 - activated Cl2Mg - supported titanium catalyst Cl4Ti / Cl2Mg with dibutyl phthalate and propyltrimethoxysilane used a respectively internal and external donor and ( ii ) two methylaluminoxane (MAO)-activated , unsupported zirconocene catalyst system differing in indenyl ligand structure , viz. , Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 and [Me2Si(4-Ph-2-Et-Ind)2]ZrCl2 ( rac : meso = <nUm> : <nUm> ) . the olefin were copolymerized ( table <nUm> ) in liquid propylene at <nUm> - <nUm> ° C at constant ethylene overpressure ( above C3 pressure ) varying over <nUm> to <nUm> atm corresponding to ethylene concentration of <nUm> to <nUm> mol / L in the liquid phase . the copolymer contained 1.6-18 % of C2 mers . catalyst activity ( fig. <nUm> ) and kinetics of copolymerization ( fig. <nUm> ) were studied and the microstructure , molecular weight characteristic ( table <nUm> ) and mechanical property ( table <nUm> , <nUm> ) of the resulting copolymer were determined .

A kinetic study using UV - vi spectroscopy wa carried out on the transformation . saturation kinetic behavior wa observed for the system , which is supportive of a mechanism that involves a reversible formal [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] retrocycloaddition of 4a to generate the transient imido specie Cp2Zr = N-t-Bu ( 7a ) and Me3SiN = C = NSiMe3 . trapping 7a with diphenylacetylene in an overall [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition reaction affords zirconacycle 6a . the study of cycloreversion / cycloaddition reaction between diazametallacycle complex and diphenylacetylene wa extended to other zirconocene system . detailed kinetic study were performed for the exchange reaction between the diazametallacycle complex Cp2Zr(N(2,6-Me2Ph)C = N(SiMe3)N ( SiMe3 ) ) ( 8a ) and Cp2Zr(N(2,6-Me2Ph) C = N(t-Bu)N(t-Bu) ) ( 8b ) with diphenylacetylene ( 5a ) to give the corresponding azametallacyclobutene complex Cp2Zr(N(2,6-Me2Ph)C(Ph) = C(Ph) ) ( 6c ) and extruded carbodiimides ( Me3SiN = C = NSiMe3 for 8a and (t-Bu)N = C = N(t-Bu) for 8b ) . for both system , the reaction were found to be first order in metallacycle and zero order in alkyne . treatment of the diazametallacycle complex Cp2Zr(N(2,6-ii-Pr2Ph)C = N(Cyc)N(Cyc) ) ( 9a ) and Cp2Zr(N(2,6-i-Pr2Ph)C = N(i-Pr2) N(i-Pr2) ) ( 9b ) with alkyne 5a resulted in the formation of the six - membered zirconacylces 10a,b , respectively , upon heating at <nUm> ° C . the product 10a,b are generated from the overall insertion of alkyne 5a into the nitrogen-carbon bond of the zirconium - containing diazacyclobutane . complex 10a ha been characterized by an x-ray crystallographic study . when the azacyclobutene Cp2Zr(N(2,6-i-Pr2Ph)C(Ph)) ( 6e ) wa treated with CycN = C = NCyc or (i-Pr)N = C = N(i-Pr) , the same six - membered zirconacycle complex 10a,b were obtained . kinetic analysis of the reaction of 6e and (i-Pr)N = C = N(i-Pr) to yield 10b support an associative process wherein alkyne 5a directly insert into the zirconium-carbon bond of 6e . the diazametallacycle complex 4a underwent a stoichiometric metathetical exchange with symmetrical carbodiimides RN = C = NR ( r = p = tol , m-Tok , i-Pr , cyc ) to generate new cyclic zirconocene complex and Me3SiN = C = NSiMe3 . kinetic study were carried out on the exchange reaction between 4a and (m-Tol)N = C = N(m-Tol) to form 4e and Me3SiN = C = NSiMe3 . the experimental rate data obtained are consistent with a dissociative mechanism . additionally , the saturation rate constant derived for this system from the data is the same ( within experimental error ) a the saturation rate constant obtained from the kinetic study of 4a and diphenylacetylene to form 6a and Me3SiN = C = NSiMe3 . these finding provide additional support for a dissociative mechanistic pathway in the exchange reaction , since the rate constant in the formal [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] retrocycloaddition reaction to generate imidozirconocene specie Cp2Zr = N-t-Bu ( 7a ) and Me3SiN = C-NSiMe3 should be the same for both reaction . the polymerization of ethylene using supported zirconocene catalyst with varying support composition SiO2-MAO-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 + TIBA ( catalyst I ) and MgCl2-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 + TIBA ( catalyst II ) ( MAO is methylaluminoxane , ind is indenyl , and TIBA is triisobutylaluminum ) wa studied . the examined catalytic system differ in their activity , ability to control the molecular mass of the resulting polymer , and kinetics of copolymerization with 1-hexene . the molecular structure of PE prepared with supported catalyst I and II and a homogeneous catalyst Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 + MAO wa studied by IR and 13C NMR spectroscopy . As evidenced by 13C NMR spectroscopy , PE sample synthesized with the homogeneous catalyst and catalyst I contain ethyl branch along with the end methyl group in the low-molecular-mass fraction . on the contrary , PE prepared with supported catalyst II is devoid of ethyl branch but contains vinyl group a the basic type of unsaturation . aryl enolsilanes and 2-silyloxy-1,3-dienes react with zirconocene to give alkenylzirconium , and novel 1-methylene-2-propenylzirconium compound which can be used a 2-dienylation reagent . thus , one - pot coupling of 4-phenyl-1,3-butadienyl-2-zirconocene ( 2d ) with a range of electrophiles including aryl , alkynyl , allyl halide , bromine , iodine and a michael acceptor occurs regioselectively at the C-2 position in the presence of Pd or Cu catalyst . the asymmetric ansa - ligand precursor (C5Me4H)SiMe2(C5H4R) ( r = H ( 1 ) , me ( 2 ) , SiMe3 ( 3 ) , < Pr ( 4 ) ) and their lithium derivative [Me2Si(C5Me4)(C5H3R)]Li2 ( r = H ( 5 ) , me ( 6 ) , SiMe3 . , ( 7 ) , ' Pr ( 8 ) ) have been prepared . the cmsa - niobocene imido complex [ Me2Si( ? / 5-C5Me4)( ? ; 5.C5H3R)]Nb( = N'Bu)Cl ( r = H ( 9 ) , me ( 10 ) , SiMe3 ( 11 ) , ' Pr ( 12 ) ) were synthesized by the reaction of nb( = N'Bu)Cl3(py)2 with [Me2Si(C5Me4)(C5H3R)]Li2 in THF . the tmsa-zirconocene complex [ Me2SiO;5-C5Me4)0 / 5-C5H3R)]ZrCl2 ( r = H ( 13 ) , me ( 14 ) , SiMe3 ( 15 ) , ' Pr ( 16 ) ) were prepared by the reaction of ZrCLj and the corresponding lithiated cmsa - derivative . the molecular structure of <nUm> , and <nUm> were determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction study . preliminary result for the catalytic activity of 13-16 in the polymerization of ethylene are reported . the activity and stability of zirconocene catalyst immobilized on magnesium chloride modified with an organoaluminum compound AlR3 ( r = me or et ) were studied in the polymerization of ethylene ( table <nUm> , <nUm> ) . an original method wa used to introduce a lewis internal base into the magnesium support . trace amount of water present in magnesium chloride were assumed to react with the organoaluminum compound to produce on the surface of the chloride an alkylaluminoxane [R2AlOAlR2] with the basic center functioning a a lewis internal base . the resulting support wa used to immobilize a zirconocene compound which , when activated with MAO , became a very active complex catalyzing the polymerization of ethylene at a constant rate ( <nUm> kg PE / g Zr · h ) . catalytically active center were found to occur in the solvent solution only ( and not on the solid support surface ) at a concentration found to be nearly equal to that of water in the magnesium chloride . the ethylene polymerization kinetics studied with two catalyst system prepared and the physical and mechanical property data measured for the resulting PE ( table <nUm> ) allowed to infer the highly stable zirconocene homogeneous catalyst system to have magnesium atom incorporated into the following structure [ ClMgOAlR2 / Cp2ZrCl2 ] . the modifier AlR3 wa found to affect the physical and mechanical property of the resuiting PE ( table <nUm> ) . the synthesis of a series of 1-methyl-3-aryl-substituted titanocene and zirconocene dichrorides are reported . these complex are synthesized by the reaction of 2- and 3-methyl-6 , 6-dimethylfulvenes ( <nUm> : <nUm> ) with aryllithium , followed by the reaction with TiCl4*2THF , Cl4Zr and (CpTiCl2)2O respectively , to give complex <nUm> - <nUm> . the complex [ e5-1-methyl-3-(a , a-dimethylbenzyl)cyclopentadienyl]titanium dichloride ha been studied by x-ray diffraction . the red crystal of this complex is monoclinic , space group P21 / C with unit cell parameter : a = <nUm> × 10-1 nm , b = <nUm> × 10-1 nm , c = <nUm> × 10-1 nm , α = β = γ = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> × 10-3 nm3 and z = <nUm> . refinement for <nUm> observed reflection give the final r of <nUm> . there are four independent molecule per unit cell . two supported zirconocene catalyst were prepared : ( I ) O2Si / MAO / Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( <nUm> wt. % Zr , <nUm> wt. % Al ) and ( II ) Cl2Mg / Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( <nUm> wt. % Zr , <nUm> wt. % Al ) . ethylene wa homopolymerized and copolymerized with 1-hexene ( <nUm> - <nUm> ° C , <nUm> bar , TIBA a cocatalyst ) over ( I ) and ( II ) . catalyst ( I ) incorporated the comonomer a much a did the homogeneous catalyst of the same composition . Cl2Mg used a support resulted in reduced copolymerization reactivity of the catalyst . copolymer crystallinity and catalyst activity were studied in relation to the concentration of 1-hexene . ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization over the O2Si - supported zirconocene / MMAO catalyst wa investigated . the silica support wa modified by different batch of <nUm> and <nUm> wt % Ga . it wa found that Ga wa well - dispersed all over the silica granule which can not be detected by XRD . based on the EDX measurement , it wa revealed that Ga - modification increased the adsorption ability of MMAO on the silica support after impregnation . thus , Ga - modification showed a promising way to enhance the rate of ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization . based on TGA study , lower interaction between MMAO and support caused by Ga - modification wa another reason for increase in catalytic activity . moreover , the Ga - modification increased lewis acid centre or active specie on the catalytic system . In addition , a comparative study of polymerization wa also conducted with in situ and ex situ impregnation method . it wa found that the in situ impregnation method of the MMAO onto silica exhibited remarkable ( almost <nUm> time ) activity compared to ex situ method which is attributed to lower deactivation effect of the catalyst . 13C NMR analysis , however , indicated that only random copolymer were produced in all system . these result could be related to the high degree of 1-octene insertion and thus amorphous copolymer were produced in all system . the temperature - programmed desorption ( TPD ) technique wa used to study , by mass spectrometry ( MS ) , the desorbates released from O2Si - supported MAO ( I ) and O2Si - supported Cp2ZrCl2 ( II ) surface . with II , cp group were found to be copiously released at temperature exceeding <nUm> ° C . hence , decomposition of Cp2ZrCl2 while the compound is being heterogenized , can not explain the low activity of the catalyst II in which Cp2ZrCl2 is chemically bonded to the carrier surface through OH group . the MS ( intensity vs. temperature ) curve recorded for the I desorbates exhibit maximum ( fig. <nUm> ) for m / z = <nUm> - <nUm> at about <nUm> ° C and <nUm> ° C . they represent the methyl group liberated on thermal destruction of = Al-C- bond in respectively AlO(Me)2 and AlO2Me . At about <nUm> ° C , the MAO oligomer molecule were fragmented to produce AlOMe ( m / z = <nUm> ) , Al2O ( m / z = <nUm> ) , AlOMe2 ( m / z = <nUm> ) , AlO2Me ( m / z = <nUm> ) , AlO ring ( m / z = <nUm> ) , and (Al3O3)-O- ring ( m / z = <nUm> ) . alternating adsorption ( up to <nUm> time ) of AlMe3 vapor followed by H2O vapor on O2Si surface wa tried to synthesize O2Si - supported MAO with no " free " AlMe3 . As a result , surface structure of the type ≡ Si-O-(AlMeO)n , ( n = <nUm> ) were produced . the MAO thus synthesized wa showed by TPD study to have a linear or a planar net structure . ethylene wa sequentially homopolymerized ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> - <nUm> min ) and copolymerized ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> - <nUm> min ) with 1-hexene or 1-octene over a Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO or a C2H4(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst in toluene a solvent ; a-olefin conversion were <nUm> - <nUm> mol % . the preliminary homopolymerization of ethylene wa found to affect only slightly the composition and the MW and MWD property data of the resulting ethylene-hexene ( CEH ) and ethylene-octene ( CEO ) copolymer . HDPE / CEH and HDPE / CEO reactor mixture ( RM ) were synthesized , containing various proportion of the copolymer ( table <nUm> ) . the RM component were found to cocrystallize during the polymerization process . mechanical property data were determined for pure and for modified HDPE ( table <nUm> ) . with the copolymer endowed with desired property and introduced into HDPE in an appropriate amount , high - strength and simultaneously high - MFR material can be prepared . the bonding between electron deficient zirconocene complex such a [(e5-C5Me5)2ZrR]+ and the counterions [(C6F5)3BR]- ( r = CH3 , <nUm> , r = H , <nUm> ) ha been investigated by DFT and extended huckel calculation . the molecular bonding analysis ha been carried out in the light of the structural information on the inter-ion interaction available for these and other similar electron deficient coordinatively unsaturated zirconocene complex . it ha been shown that the " anion - cation " interaction in <nUm> and <nUm> are different manifestation of the same need to provide electron density to the metal centre . In <nUm> this is achieved via the -C-H s-bonds and ha been described a a pseudo-agostic interaction , whereas in <nUm> electron donation occurs via the phenyl F - atom . the study of the covalent component of the bonding between the ionic component ha shown that the weak electron donation , though not sufficient to saturate the metal centre , stabilises the unsaturated specie and allows it to have a longer life time . it ha been inferred that in the homogenous ziegler - natta catalytic process the approach of a strongly coordinating molecule , such a an olefin in the polymerisation , destroys the weak interaction and allows the reaction to proceed whilst the ion - pairing maintains the counterion in proximity of the complex . propylene polymerization were carried out by using rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( zirconocene catalyst ) and a commercial third generation ziegler - natta catalyst in a semibatch reactor . from the polymerization reaction , the optimum reaction condition and the physical property of polymer produced from each catalyst system were investigated . the optimum reaction temperature of rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and ziegler - natta catalyst were <nUm> ° C , <nUm> ° C , respectively . on the basis of the result for the produced polymer particle size distribution and the catalytic activity of polymerization reaction , the reaction temperature should be considered a an important factor for the successful polymerization reaction . especially , the polymer wa conglomerated in the higher reaction temperature . it wa found that there wa an upper limitation to co-catalyst concentration . reaction rate and polymer yield rather decreased with increasing the concentration of co-catalyst , i.e. , MAO and TEA1 affected only polymerization activity , but the PEEB in ziegler - natta catalyst system affected isotactic index of produced polymer a well a activity . based on these observation , the production yield seems to exhibit a first order linear relationship to the partial pressure of monomer . the optical absorption spectrum of system including ansa - zirconocenes ( Me2SiCp2ZrCl2 or Me2CCp2ZrCl2 ) and a modified poly(methylaluminoxane) were studied . the alkylation of zirconocenes involves two stage - fast and slow - resulting in the formation of monoalkyl and dialkyl derivative , respectively with trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) being the main alkylating agent . A bathochromic shift wa observed for <nUm> < Al : Zr < <nUm> in the system containing Me2SiCp2ZrCl2 , and for markedly greater component ratio in the system with Me2SiCp2ZrCl2 . introduction of TMA in the mixture markedly accelerated the alkylation rate and retarded the formation of complex responsible for the bathochromic shift . A model of the complex structure is proposed and the law of complex formation in the system studied are discussed . A MgCl2(THF)2 support modified by organoaluminum chloride or MAO enabled u to obtain specially active zirconocene catalyst system for ethylene polymerization . the zirconocene system on the bimetallic support wa found to be the more active than that on the monometallic support . two kind of catalytic active site were found to exist in the supported zirconocene catalyst : unstable active site that become deactivated during the polymerization of ethylene , and very stable catalytic center created in the olefin environment . the kinetic investigation on the ethylene polymerization allowed to suggest the reason underlying the creation of the stable active site . bulk polymerization of propylene wa studied over four ansa - zirconocene catalyst , viz. , Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) , Me2Si(4-Ph-2-Et-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) ( rac : meso = <nUm> : <nUm> ) , Ph2C(CpFlu)ZrCl2 ( 3 ) , and Me2C(3-Me-CpFlu)ZrCl2 ( 4 ) , which were characterized by different symmetry ( C1 , C2 , Cs ) . the structure of the metallocene affected the structure of PP . upon reaction with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) , compound 1-4 produced very active catalytic system which catalyzed the polymerization to yield various structure of PP . catalyst <nUm> and <nUm> gave isotactic PP , catalyst <nUm> gave syndiotactic PP and catalyst <nUm> gave hemiisotactic PP . Hemiiso-PP wa similar in structure to amorphous PP and had no melting point . the catalytic activity of the system and molecular weight and stereospecificity of PP were studied in relation to the mode of preparation of the catalyst . kinetic parameteres were evaluated , viz. , time of insertion of the propylene molecule ( <nUm> - <nUm> s ) and the time of growth of a single PP macromolecule ( 3-6 s ) , and from these data the minimum degree of polymerization wa determined . activation energy were evaluated for the polymerization carried out over each catalyst system . young 's modulus , molecular weight and stereoregularity of the PP prepared were determined . methylalumination of 1-organylthio-1-alkynes RSC = CR1 ( <nUm> : r = ph , R1 = C5H11 ; <nUm> : r = me , R1 = C10H21 ) with trimethylalane Me3A1 in the presence of zirconocene dichloride Cp2ZrC12 proceeds regio- and stereoselectively and affords 1-organylthio-2-methyl-1-alkenes RSCH = C(Me)R1 ( <nUm> : r = ph , R1 = C5H11 ; <nUm> : r = me , R1 = C10H21 ) in the yield not exceeding <nUm> % . rac-[isopropylidenebis(4,5-benzindenyl)] zirconium dichloride / MAO promotes copolymerization of ethylene and styrene to form a random copolymer with a high activity . the random copolymer ha head to tail St-St sequence and isotactic stereo - regularity both of the head to tail St-St and alternating Et-St sequence . this catalytic system also promotes homo-polymerization of styrene to form isotactic polystyrene . the steric interaction of the C <nUm> symmetric ligand framework to polymer chain end and monomer phenyl group may control isotactic propagation , similarly to the isotactic polymerization of propene reported , with complex having C <nUm> symmetry . the effect of support type on the activity of zirconocene - triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) system wa studied in the polymerization of propylene , and on the property of the resulting PP . three zirconocenes were used : Me2SiInd2ZrX2 ( x = Cl or me ) and Ph2CCpFluZrCl2 ; and three support were used : ( i ) O2Si ( spec , area ssp , = <nUm> m2 / g ) ; ( ii ) SiO2-gr-PAAc [ i.e. O2Si modified with poly(acrylic acid ) by radiative grafting ] ; ( iii ) PE-gr-PAAc ( i.e. functionalized by radiative grafting , ssp = <nUm> m2 / g ) . propylene wa polymerized in , the liquid monomer . the support were made to react with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and the product wa used to immobilize a zirconocene compound to produce a supported catalyst . with TIBA a cocatalyst , the resulting PP constituted a replica of catalyst particle ; the bulk density of PP wa high , up to <nUm> g / cm3 . As the Zr content in the catalyst wa increased , the specific productivity ( g PP / g catalyst ) rose to attain a maximum , characteristic for a given support . catalyst activity and m of PP were studied in relation to TIBA concentration . the type of MAO - modified support had little effect on the PP property . modification of the O2Si / MAO / Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 catalyst with a boron compound , CPh3B(C6F5)4 / did not affect PP property but reduced the activity of the catalyst system at AlTIBAZr > <nUm> . [ ( C13 H8)Si(CH3)2(C 5H3 ) ] wa prepared with fluorenyl lithium , dimethyldichlorosilane and cyclopentadienylsodium with <nUm> % total yield . furthermore , a Si - bridged fluorenylidene cyclopen-tadienylidene zirconium complex [ (C13H8)Si(CH3)2(C 5H3)]ZrCl2 wa synthesized by reaction of [ (C13H8)Si(CH3)2(C5H <nUm> ) ] and Cl4Zn with THF a a solvent under the schlenk system . the reaction gave the target compound in <nUm> % yield . the zirconium complex wa characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR . after activated with methylaluminoxane , the metallocene complex showed a high catalytic activity for the ethylene and propylene polymerization reaction under atmosphere pressure . it wa found that the title compound ha a catalytic activity in the order of <nUm> g / h , and the molecular weight of ethylene-propylene copolymer is about <nUm> . A family of zirconocene , yttrocene , and scandocene complex have been prepared utilizing an easily modified doubly bridged ligand array , ( 1,2-SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> { η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> -4-R}{e <nUm> -C <nUm> H-3,5-(CHMe <nUm> ) <nUm> } , developed in our laboratory . variation in ligand array substitution and metal center provide complex that exhibit a range of stereoselectivities and activity in a-olefin polymerization . A series of C s -and C <nUm> -symmetric metallocenes have been utilized for the preparation of polypropylene and polypentene under various polymerization condition . analysis of the resulting polymer microstructures ha provided valuable information about the factor that dictate syndiospecificity , a well a common error forming mechanism for these system . the reduction in THF and oxidation in CCl2H2 of the bent - sandwich complex (e5-Ind)2ZrMe2 ( 1 ) ( ind = C9H7 , indenyl ) were studied by cyclic voltammetry . complex <nUm> in THF undergoes one - electron reduction to radical anion 1._ , which partially decomposes with the liberation of the ind- anion . even at <nUm> ° C the one - electron oxidation lead to the formation of an unstable 15-electron radical cation undergoing fast heterolytic decomposition to the me . radical and (e5-Ind)2ZrMe+ cation , which is the key reaction center in the catalytic polymerization of olefin . comparative analysis of electron - transfer - induced transformation of bent - sandwich dimethyl and dichloride zirconocenes of the general formula L2ZrX2 ( L = e5-Ind , e5-Cp ; x = Cl , me ) wa performed . A kinetic , active centre , and morphological analysis ha been carried out on the polymerization of ethylene and propylene in hydrocarbon , aromatic and chloroaromatic medium using selected homogeneous and silica supported metallocene catalyst activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . A number of procedure for supporting selected model zirconocene compound ( biscyclopentadienylzirconium dichloride and ethylenebisindenylzirconium dichloride ) on different type of silica have been investigated . it is established that the overall activity and kinetic behaviour of these supported catalyst are strongly affected by the procedure used for the catalyst preparation . In general supported metallocene catalyst were shown to have lower activity and also lower number of propagating active center than did the corresponding soluble catalyst system . MAO pretreated silica catalyst were shown by SEM study to produce polymer with good morphology and the result obtained indicated that silica fragmentation producing microreactor behaviour could be obtained in these polymerizing catalyst system . the oligomerization of ethylene catalyzed by Cp2ZrL2 ( L = Cl , me , OC6H4-p-Me ) / EAO ( ethylaluminoxane ) afforded not only common chain oligomers but also methylenecyclopentane . it is the first example of oligomerization and simultaneous cyclization of ethylene to a cyclic oligomer . the selectivity of methylenecyclopentane , affected by the structure and the concentration of precatalysts , solvent , aging and reaction temperature and some other factor , came up to <nUm> % when a third - component C5H5N wa added to the Cp2ZrCl2 / EAO system under optimal condition . this paper describes how benzene derivative were formed with high selectivity in one - pot from three different alkyne in excellent yield . firstly , a novel method for pair - selective coupling of an alkyne with ethylene forming zirconacyclopentenes wa developed ; then , highly selective cross - coupling of two different alkyne forming zirconacyclopentadienes wa achieved ; finally , transmetallation of Zr - C bond to Cu - C bond in the presence of a third alkyne led to the formation of benzene derivative of three different alkyne . new evidence were obtained for understanding the reaction mechanism . polymerization of 1-hexene or 1-octene under high pressure ( 100-1000 MPa ) wa investigated using permethylated ansa - metallocenes / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) a catalyst system . besides the known zirconocene complex ( <nUm> , Me2Si(e5-C5Me4) 2ZrCl2 ) , dialkylsilylene- and dimethylgermylene-bridged hafnocene dichloride , R2E(e5-C5Me4) 2HfCl2 ( <nUm> , r = me , e = Si ; <nUm> , r = et , e = Si ; <nUm> , r = vinyl , e = Si ; <nUm> , r = me , e = Ge ) , were synthesized and structurally characterized . the catalytic activity of the ansa - metallocenes wa remarkably enhanced under high pressure despite their very congested structure . poly( 1-hexene ) with unprecedented high molecular weight such a mw = <nUm> × <nUm> ( mw / Mn = <nUm> , by GPC ) wa obtained under <nUm> MPa with <nUm> . study on termination reaction revealed that the bimolecular chain - transfer process ( b-hydrogen transfer to olefin ) is much accelerated under <nUm> MPa in <nUm> , while b-hydrogen elimination to metal is still major termination process in <nUm> . this indicated that two complex that have same structure but central metal showed quite different high - pressure effect . the copolymerization of ethylene(E) and norbornene ( N ) wa examined by using various metallocene catalyst and modified - MAO(MMAO) cocatalyst . for C2 - symmetry catalyst such a rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 , Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 , me2 Si(Cp)2ZrCl2 and Cs - symmetrical iPr(FluCp)ZrCl2 a well a CGC and di-bridged zirconocene , the effect of catalyst structure and [N] / [E] feed ratio on catalyst activity , thermal property and [N] content of copolymer ( COC ) wa investigated . for rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst of a constant [N] / [E] feed ratio , the appropriate condition of [Al] / [Zr] mole ratio , polymerization temperature and cocatalyst structure were found to be <nUm> , <nUm> ° C , MMAO cocatalyst , respectively . As [N] / [E] feed ratio increased , the incorporation of norbornene to copolymer increased while the activity of catalyst decreased except for iPr(FluCp)ZrCl2 . with consideration of catalyst activity a well a N content , it wa found that rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MMAO system exhibited relatively high activity and controllable tg . monomer reactivity ratio wa determined by kelen - tudos method . copolymerizations of ethylene and a-olefin with various zirconocene compound at a high temperature were carried out to study the relationship between the ligand structure of zirconocene compound and the copolymerization behavior . all of the indenyl-based zirconocene compound in combination with dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate / triisobutylaluminum produced only low molecular weight copolymer at a high temperature , regardless of the substituents and bridged structure of the zirconocene compound . however , zirconocene compound with a fluorenyl ligand gave rise to a significant increase in the activity and molecular weight of the copolymer by the selection of a diphenylmethylene bridge structure even at a high temperature . ethylene / 1-hexene copolymer obtained with the fluorenyl-based catalyst contained inner double bond accompanied by the generation of hydrogen , presumably because of a C-H bond activation mechanism . the content of the inner double bond were significantly influenced by the polymerization condition , including the 1-hexene feed content , polymerization temperature , and ethylene pressure . the phosphonium - bridged ansa - metallocene complex { [Me2P(C5Me4)2]ZrCl 2}+ and { [Me2P(C5Me4)2]HfCl 2}+ have been prepared by the reaction of {[Me2P(C5Me4)2]Li2}I with Cl4Zr and Cl4Hf , respectively ; the isolation and structural characterization of { [Me2P-(C5Me4)2]ZrCl 2}+ complete a series of isostructural zirconocene derivative , namely , [R2P(CpR)2-ZrCl2]+ , [R2E(CpR)2ZrCl2] ( e = C , Si , Ge ) , and [R2B(CpR)2ZrCl2]- , which differ according to the charge on the complex . reaction of (ClMe2SiC5H4)2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) with K ( Na ) in liquid ammonia / toluene at - <nUm> ° C gave the ansa - zirconocene dihydride none the four new asymmetric ansa - zirconocene dichloride rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(2-phenyl- 1-e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 4c ) , rac-[(9-e5-fluorenyl)(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl) dimethylsilane]zirconium dichloride ( 4d ) , rac-[(9-e5-fluorenyl)(2-methyl-1-e5indenyl) dimethylsilane]zirconium dichloride ( 4e ) , and rac-[(9-e5-fluorenyl)(2-phenyl-1-e5-indenyl) dimethylsilane]zirconium dichloride ( 4f ) have been prepared , and their polymerization behavior wa compared to the recently published rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1-e5- indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 4a ) and rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl) ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 4b ) . the Si - bridged ligand are easily accessible by the reaction of fluorenyllithium with dimethyldichlorosilane and the subsequent addition of indenyllithium . A similar route using 1-(9-fluorenyl)-2-bromoethane wa applied for the synthesis of the ethylene-bridged ligand . the Zr(IV) complex of all ligand are highly active catalyst for the propene polymerization reaction after activation with MAO . the influence of the bridge and the particular substitution pattern of the indenyl fragment ha been studied with respect to monomer concentration and polymerization temperature . the exchange of the ethylene bridge by a dimethylsilane unit result in a strong increase of the molecular weight but also in a decreased polymerization activity deriving from a fast decomposition of the active catalyst specie . interestingly , significantly higher polymer molecular weight could be found for the complex that contain the 5,6-cyclopentyl substituent on the indenyl moiety . all catalyst showed the effect of a declining stereo - selectivity with increasing monomer concentration , leading to the formation of homopolypropene elastomer . the mechanism of stereoerror formation of these C1 - symmetric specie wa investigated by deuterium labeling study on the propene monomer and by comparison with C2 - symmetric complex . the primary silane p-TolSiH3 ( p-Tol = p-CH3C6H5 ) can be polymerized to poly(p-tolylsilane) with <nUm> mol % of both the chiral and achiral zirconocenes Cp2ZrCl2 , Cp(CpSi*)ZrCl2 , and (CpSi*)2ZrCl2 ( cp = CH , CpSi* = C5H4Si(CH3)2-(1R)-endo-(+)-OC10H17 ) in combination with <nUm> mol % of n-BuLi . generally , higher molecular weight linear polymer were obtained when using the substituted zirconocenes in comparison to the parent zirconocene , which in turn produced larger quantity of low-molecular-weight cyclic product . each polysilane sample wa analyzed by 29Si{1H} DEPT and 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy . deconvolution of selected region of the 29Si{1H} DEPT and the 1H NMR spectrum for higher molecular weight linear polymer indicated that these catenates were predominantly atactic , on the basis of a triad level bernoullian statistical model . the data suggested that , in this case , chiral substitution of the zirconocene ring had no effect on the stereogrowth of the polysilane chain . under the condition originally developed by taber and nugent , a 1,6- or a 1,7-diene will smoothly condense with zirconocene to give the intermediate metallacycle . while these zirconacycles can be isolated and characterized , they usually are carried on directly , by reaction with a suitable electrophile ( e.g. O , or CO ) , to give the organic product . As zirconium is inexpensive , the procedure is operationally simple , and the byproduct zirconium sulfate is nontoxic , intramolecular diene cyclozirconation ha become a useful tool for carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring construction . from the inception of this reaction , it wa anticipated that the central Zr could serve a a scaffold to direct the formation of two , three or even four new stereogenic carbon center . subsequent work ha shown that the cyclometallations are reversible , and that the reaction can be carried out under either kinetic or thermodynamic control . it is particularly exciting that the semiempirical computational package ZINDO can serve effectively to predict the relative stability of the intermediate diastereomeric zirconacycles . this ha allowed ZINDO to be used in a predictive sense , to guide the design of dienes that cyclize with high diastereoselectivity . the use of this approach in conjunction with total synthesis of the natural product elemol , dendrobine , haliclonadiamine and androstenedione is described in this article . the organometallic lewis acid BC18F15 add to the terminal = CH2 group of the (butadiene)-metallocene complex 5a and 5b to give the ansa - metallocene betaine system [Me2Si-(C5H4)2]Zr[C 4H6-B(C6F5)3 ] ( 6a ) and [ Me2Si(3-MeC5H3) 2]Zr[C4H6-B(C6F5) <nUm> ] ( 6b ) , respectively , in high yield . both complex were characterized by x-ray diffraction . they both contain a substituted n3 - allyl ligand F of e configuration , and they show a characteristic ( ortho aryl)-C-F ⋯ Zr interaction that stabilizes the electron - deficient metal center inside the dipolar structure . BC18F15 also add to one butadiene terminus of (s-cis-n4-C4H6)[Me2C(C 5H4)-(indenyl)]Zr to give a high yield of a single isomer of the respective ansa - metallocene [C4H6-B(C6F5)3] betaine complex <nUm> . the x-ray crystal structure analysis of <nUm> ha revealed that in this case a (Z)-n3-allyl-CH2B(C6F5)3 ligand is formed . this precluded the (aryl)C-F ⋯ Zr coordination . instead , the zirconium center in <nUm> form a stabilizing internal ion pair interaction between the negatively polarized [B] - C(4)H2 methylene group and the positive zirconium center . the analogously structured ansa - metallocene [(Z)-C4H6-B(C6F5)3] betaine complex <nUm> is obtained in high yield from BC18F15 addition to (s-cis-n4-butadiene)[Me2C-(C5H 4)(fluorenyl)]Zr . In solution the complex <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> exhibit structure that are analogous to those found in the solid state . however , treatment of ( butadiene ) [Me2Si(C5H4)2]-Zr ( 5a ) with BC18F15 under kinetic control ( <nUm> K in toluene-d8 ) quantitatively yield the [Me2Si(C5H4)2]Zr[(Z)-C 4H6-B(C6F5)3 ] betaine isomer <nUm> , which contains the stabilizing [B] - C(4)H2 ⋯ Zr internal ion pair interaction . subsequent thermally induced rearrangement of the kinetic product <nUm> ( DG ‡ rearr(298 K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ) then result in the formation of the eventually observed thermodynamic ansa - metallocene betaine product 6a , that contains the (E)-C4H6-B(C6F5)3 ligand and exhibit internal (aryl)C-F ⋯ Zr coordination . A similar reaction sequence wa observed during the addition of BC18F15 to the parent (butadiene)zirconocene system <nUm> : at <nUm> K the kinetic Cp2Zr[(Z)-(1-3n),kC4-C4H 6-B(C6F5)3 ] betaine product <nUm> is formed , which rapidly rearranges at temperature above <nUm> K to yield the previously observed stable Cp2Zr[(E)-C4H6-B(C6F 5)3 ] betaine system <nUm> , which is characterized by an internal C-F ⋯ Zr bond . the ansa - metallocene betaine <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> are all active homogeneous single - component ziegler catalyst for ethene and propene polymerization . they are similarly effective a the usually employed ansa - metallocene dichloride / methylalumoxane catalyst system . UV / visible investigation were carried out on the zirconocene activation mechanism in the case of a series of racEt(Ind)2ZrX2 derivative where x represents ligand of various extractability . two different elementary step were identified , depending on the amount of added activator . first , a hypsochromic shift of the ligand to metal charge transfer ( LMCT ) band occurred , corresponding to the zirconocene methylation . second , addition of larger quantity of activator ( MAO , B(C6F5)4(-) ) led to a bathochromic shift of the LMCT band to <nUm> nm that express the ionization of the zirconocene . copolymer of ethene and 1-hexene were catalyzed with (MenC5H5-n)2ZrCl2 / MAO catalytic system . the copolymer were found to have property that depend on the number of methyl substituents n but also their relative position . the presence of comonomer doe not influence the termination reaction following insertion of ethene . new example of chiral C2 - symmetric zirconocenes of low stereoselectivity are presented . zirconenes <nUm> and <nUm> , upon activation with methylalumoxane , produce amorphous polypropylene with acceptable molecular weight at practical polymerization temperature and mmmm pentad value between <nUm> and <nUm> % . non-bonded interaction analysis by molecular mechanic account for the low enantioselectivity of <nUm> and <nUm> , and predicts the isospecificity of the rac-H2C(2-Me-3-iPr-1-Ind)2ZrR+ catalyst . metallocene complex having multiple Si-Br functionality attached to the ancillary ligand were synthesized by boron - silicon exchange . the obtained functionalized complex are readily immobilized on dehydrated ( partially dehydroxylated ) silica . an unbridged zirconocene complex bis(1,2-diphenylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride [(1,2-Ph2-C5H3)2ZrCl2] <nUm> ha been synthesized and structurally characterized . when activated by MAO , <nUm> produce ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene with high melting transition temperature , a well a atactic oligopropylene with average molecular weight of ∼ <nUm> g mol-1 .

A bathochromic shift wa observed for <nUm> < Al / Zr < <nUm> in the system containing Me2SiCp2ZrCl2 , and for markedly greater component ratio in the system with Me2CCp2ZrCl2 . introduction of TMA in the mixture markedly accelerated the alkylation rate and retarded the formation of complex responsible for the bathochromic shift . A model of the complex structure is proposed and the law of complex formation in the system studied are discussed . reaction of (C5H4R)2Zr(C ≡ CPh)2 ( r = me , t-Bu ) with vanadocene Cp2V yield the heterodimetallic complex Cp2V(m-e2:e4-butadiyne)Zr(C 5H4R)2 ( <nUm> , r = t-Bu ; <nUm> , r = me ) . both compound have been characterized by elemental analysis , raman spectroscopy , and magnetic susceptibility . according to the x-ray structure of Cp2V(m-e2:e4-butadiyne)Zr(C 5H4t-Bu)2 ( 4 ) , the [Cp2V] and [(C5H4t-Bu)2Zr] metallocene moiety are bonded to a butadiene framework through the two internal carbon atom for [Cp2V] and through the two internal and the two external carbon atom for [(C5H4t-Bu)2Zr] . the distance and angle observed around the internal carbon atom of the butadiene framework indicate that both carbon are planar and tetracoordinate . these structural consideration are supported by a topological analysis of the electron localization function ( ELF ) . the existence of the (C5H4R)2Zr(e 4:1,2,3,4-PhC = C = C = CPh ) ( r = H , SiMe3 , t-Bu , me ) zirconacyclocumulene specie a a key intermediate in the formation of the ( Cp2V(m-e2:e4-butadiyne)Zr(C 5H4R)2 heterodimetallic compound is evidenced by NMR study of either the formation of such zirconacyclocumulene specie by addition to (C5H4R)2Zr(C ≡ CPh)2 of a catalytic amount of Cp2V or of the formation of compound <nUm> or <nUm> by addition of Cp2V to (C5H4R)2Zr(e 4:1,2,3,4-PhC = C = C = CPh ) ( r = t-Bu , me , respectively ; synthesized from dialkynyl zirconocene complex (C5H4R)2Zr-(C ≡ CPh)2 via hn daylight ) . the x-ray structure of the (C5H4R)2Zr(C ≡ CPh)2 ( r = H ( 6 ) , t-Bu ( 7 ) , SiMe3 ( 8 ) ) dialkynyl zirconocene complex is also reported . study related to the behavior of different metallocene catalyst for the homopolymerization of 1-octadecene and it copolymerization with ethylene will be presented . the metallocenes : rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 , rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 and Ph2C(Flu)(Cp)ZrCl2 were chosen for the homopolymerization study . they show important difference in catalytic activity at high temperature ( ≥ <nUm> ° C ) , with rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 showing the highest activity . At lower temperature ( ≤ <nUm> ° C ) the difference are negligible . for the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-octadecene only the catalyst rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 were studied . the result show that their catalytic activity is just like that for the homopolymerization of 1-octadecene , with higher activity for the metallocene with the et - bridged catalyst . 13C - NMR analysis show that the composition of the copolymerization product depends on the catalytic system . copolymer obtained with rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 have greater comonomer incorporation . thermal analysis show that poly-1-octadecene synthesized with the catalyst rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 is very dependent on the polymerization temperature . the homopolymer obtained at <nUm> ° C present two endothermal peak at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> ° C , a compared with the one obtained at <nUm> ° C which present one wider peak with a maximum at <nUm> ° C . for the catalyst rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 this trend is not observed . the type of metallocene and the reaction time do not significantly change the intrinsic viscosity , but the polymerization temperature change it drastically , giving higher value at lower temperature . viscosity measurement on the copolymer show that an increase of comonomer concentration in the feed reduces the molecular weight of the copolymer , and it wa also found that for homopolymer , the molecular weight is independent of the catalytic system . we systematically assessed the cytotoxic effect of five metallocene dichloride containing vanadium ( vanadocene dichloride ) , titanium ( titanocene dichloride ) , zirconium ( zircodocene dichloride ) , molybdenum ( molybdocene dichloride ) , and hafnium ( hafnocene dichloride ) a the central metal atom and <nUm> other vanadocene complex . these compound were tested against the human testicular cancer cell line tera-2 and ntera-2 using both 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and apoptosis assay . notably , only the vanadium(IV) - containing metallocenes exhibited significant cytotoxicity against tera-2 and ntera-2 cell and induced apoptosis within <nUm> h. vanadocenes with dithiocyanate [ VCp2(SCN)2*0.5 H2O ] and diselenocyanate [VCp2(NCSe)2] a ancillary ligand were identified a the most potent cytotoxic compound . vanadocenes , especially the lead compound VCp2(NCSe)2 , may be useful in the treatment of testicular cancer . enantio- and diastereoselective diels - alder reaction between dienophiles <nUm> and cyclopentadiene are catalyzed by a chiral , dicationic complex formed on reaction of the chiral ansa - zirconocene <nUm> ( x = me ) with <nUm> equiv of the strong acid [(Et2O)2H][B(ArF)4] ( <nUm> ; ArF = 3,5-(CF3)2C6H3 ) , in either dichloromethane or 2-nitropropane solvent . the enantioselectivities are higher at lower catalyst loading , particularly in dichloromethane solution , and spectroscopic study suggest that this is related to competitive formation of ether - coordinated complex at relatively low oxazolidinone : catalyst ratio . reaction of the branched tetraalkynylsilanes ( RC ≡ C)4Si ( 1a : r = ph , 1b : tBu , 1c : SiMe3 ) with the metallocene source Cp2Ti(e2-Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) ( 2 ) led to complex 4-6 , and those of 1a with Cp2Zr(THF)(e2-Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe <nUm> ) ( 3 ) to complex <nUm> . these , via 2-fold migration and C-C coupling of the alkynyl group , gave a novel type of dinuclear carbon - rich spiro complex . the conversion proved to be independent of the metal , the substituents r , and the stoichiometry employed . all new complex have been characterized spectroscopically . additionally , an x-ray crystal structure analysis wa performed for <nUm> .

Rac-H2C(3-t-Bu-1-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) is a novel , easy to synthesize , high performance catalyst for the polymerization of isotactic propylene ( i-PP ) . methylalumoxane (MAO)-activated <nUm> produce i-PP with good activity at <nUm> ° C in liquid monomer and AlMAO / Zr of <nUm> mol / mol , melting point around <nUm> ° C , and average viscosity molecular weight around <nUm> , at tp = <nUm> ° C . the isotacticity of i-PP from <nUm> / MAO is similar to those of the xylene-insoluble fraction of i-PP from heterogeneous Ti - Cl2Mg catalyst . melting point are lower than those of i-PP from Ti catalyst , but close to or higher than stereospecific zirconocene catalyst . molecular weight distribution are narrow a typical of metallocene catalyst . the use of zirconocene coupling reaction for the synthesis of novel conjugated polymer with interesting electronic property is explored . it is demonstrated that zirconocene - coupling reaction provide a versatile method for tuning the electronic and optical property via manipulation of the chemical structure and composition of the polymer backbone . this chemistry is used to synthesize highly emissive polymer containing electron - deficient thiophene-1-oxide and dioxide unit and a base - dopable cp - containing polymer . the morphology of the thermoplastic polypropylene elastomer generated with unbridged bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconocene is studied using differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and nitric acid digestion . thermal fractionation DSC reveals the presence of many melting fraction which is likely caused by a broad distribution in crystallizable block length . hard crystalline domain dispersed in a continuous amorphous matrix are clearly visible in the AFM image . image of stretched sample show irreversible morphology change at high elongation . high temperature nitric acid digestion study provides another estimate of the crystalline domain size in the polymer . copolymerizations of ethylene / 1-hexene were conducted using different zirconocene / AIR3 / BC18F15 catalytic system at <nUm> ° C . when AIEt3 wa used a alkylate agent , very low copolymerization activity wa observed with both bridged catalyst Et[Ind] 2ZrCl2 and unbridged zirconocene Cp2ZrCl2 in-situ activated with BC18F15 . In appropriate Al / Zr mole ratio using Al(i-Bu)3 , the catalytic activity of both zirconocene catalytic system were similar to those of sophisticated zirconocene / methylaluminoxane(MAO) catalytic system . the catalytic activity , comonomer incorporation and molecular weight of the copolymer synthesized with Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 / Al(i-Bu)3 / B(C6F 5)3 were higher than those obtained with cp 2ZrCl2 / al( / -Bu)3 / B(C6F 5)3 . the effect of the concentration of 1-hexene on catalytic activity , copolymer molecular weight , and comonomer incorporation wa investigated . the complicated " co-monomer effect " , together with an increase in comonomer incorporation , a decrease in the copolymer molecular weight , wa found when the comonomer concentration wa increased . α , b-unsaturated tellurolesters have been prepared in good yield by the reaction of ArTel with acylzirconocene chloride . the complex (C5H5)2Zr(Me)(methallyl) ( 1 ) wa prepared and studied a a model for Zr - bound allyl specie which are likely to arise in zirconocene - based polymerization system . <nUm> undergoes allyl-alkyl exchange with trimethyl aluminum ( TMA ) or with methyl alumoxane ( MAO ) at rate that are proportional to the Al concentration , but remain 1-2 order of magnitude below those of typical olefin insertion . it perfluorotriphenylborane adduct <nUm> , i.e. , the contact ion pair (C5H5)2Zr(methallyl)++H 3CB(C6F5)3- , ha been characterized with regard to the rearrangement dynamic of it allyl ligand . propene reacts with <nUm> , at rate which are substantially lower again than those of cationic Zr - alkyl specie , under insertion between Zr and one of the allylic terminus . scrambling of deuterium from an allylic CD2 terminus over several C atom position next to the unsaturated chain end indicates rather extensive metal migration within an initial olefin insertion product . density - functional calculation indicate that insertion of propene directly into an e3-coordinated Zr - allyl unit occurs with lower activation energy than insertion into an e1-bound Zr - allyl specie and that the lowest - energy pathway for the reactivation of a cationic zirconocene allyl specie is it reconversion to the corresponding Zr - alkyl specie by molecular hydrogen . the synthesis and propene polymerization performance of the novel rac - [ CH <nUm> ( 3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl ) <nUm> ]ZrCl <nUm> ( 2 ) and rac - [ CH <nUm> ( 3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl ) <nUm> ]ZrMe <nUm> ( 2-Me <nUm> ) are described . the ligand precursor , bis(1-tert-butyl-3-indenyl)methane ( L2 ) , is obtained in ca. <nUm> % conversion from the condensation of 3-tert-butylindene and formaldehyde in DMF at room temperature and is isolated a a yellow powder by washing with pentane . red <nUm> is obtained in 50-60 % yield and free from it meso stereoisomer by reacting an et <nUm> O solution of the ligand dianion , (L2)Li <nUm> ( et <nUm> O ) x , with a slurry of ClZr <nUm> in either pentane or toluene . yellow 2-Me <nUm> is prepared in <nUm> % yield by reaction of <nUm> with excess MeMgCl in toluene . alternatively , 2-Me <nUm> ( contaminated with about <nUm> % of it meso isomer ) can be obtained directly from the ligand L2 , by reacting L2 in et <nUm> O with <nUm> equiv of MeLi and then <nUm> equiv of ClZr <nUm> in toluene . both <nUm> and 2-Me <nUm> are remarkably soluble in pentane ( <nUm> , ca. <nUm> g / L ; 2-Me <nUm> , ca. <nUm> g / L ) and toluene ( <nUm> , ca. <nUm> g / L ) . <nUm> / MAO and 2-Me <nUm> / MAO polymerize liquid propene with good activity to highly isotactic ( mmmm = 95-98 % ) , fully regioregular polypropene with medium - high molecular weight ( M w = <nUm> 000-780 <nUm> ) and high melting point ( T m = 154-163 ° C ) in the T p range 30-70 ° C . the behavior of <nUm> is compared to that of the prototypical montell zirconocene rac - [ me <nUm> C(3-t-Bu-Ind) <nUm> ]ZrCl <nUm> ( 1 ) . <nUm> is the first example of a highly efficient and at the same time simple and inexpensive zirconocene catalyst for isotactic polypropene . the molecular structure of <nUm> and it Hf analogue ( hf-2 ) have been determined and compared to that of <nUm> . by kinetically stabilizing imidozirconocene complex through the use of a sterically demanding ligand , or by generating a more thermodynamically stable resting state with addition of diphenylacetylene , we have developed transition metal - catalyzed imine metathesis reaction that are mechanistically analogous to olefin metathesis reaction catalyzed by metal carbene complex . when <nUm> mol % of Cp*Cp(THF)Zr = NtBu is used a the catalyst precursor in the metathesis reaction between PhCH = NPh and p-TolCH = N-p-Tol , a <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> equilibrium mixture with the two mixed imines p-TolCH = NPh and PhCH = N-p-Tol is generated in C6D6 at <nUm> ° C . the catalyst wa still active after <nUm> day with an estimated <nUm> turnover ( t1 / <nUm> <nUm> m ;

TON = <nUm> h-1 ) . an extensive kinetic and equilibrium analysis of the metallacyclobutene - catalyzed metathesis of PhCH = N-p-Tol and p-F-C6H4CH = N-p-F-C6H4 wa carried out by monitoring the concentration of imines and observable metal - containing intermediate over time . numerical integration method were used to fit these data to a detailed mechanism involving coordinatively unsaturated ( 16-electron ) imido complex a critical intermediate . examination of the scope of reaction between different organic imines revealed characteristic selectivity that appears to be unique to the zirconium - mediated system . several zirconocene complex that could generate the catalytically active " CpCp'Zr = ArN " ( cp ' = cp or cp* ) specie in situ were found to be effective agent in the metathetical exchange between different n-aryl imines . N-Alkyl aldimines were found to be completely unreactive toward metathesis with n-aryl aldimines , and metathesis reaction involving the two n-alkyl imines TolCH = NPr and PhCH = NMe gave slow or erratic result , depending on the catalyst used . metathesis wa observed between n-aryl ketimines and n-aryl aldimines , but for n-aryl ketimine substrate , the catalyst resting state consists of zirconocene enamido complex , generated by the formal C-H activation of the a position of the ketimine substrate . homopolymerization of 4-methyl-1-pentene and it copolymerization with ethylene in the presence of catalyst based on zirconocenes , [(CH3)5Cp]ZrCl3 , [(CH3)2C(Cp)2]ZrCl2 , [(CH3)2C(Ind)2]ZrCl2 , [(C6H5)(C2H5)C(Ind)2]ZrCl <nUm> , [(CH3)2Si(Ind)2]ZrCl2 , [(CH3)2C(CH3Cp)(Flu)]ZrCl2 , and [(Ph)2C(Cp)(Flu)]]ZrCl2 , were studied . it wa shown that the order of loading of the reagent affect the yield of poly ( 4-methyl-1-pentene ) . unsymmetrical , bridged metallocenes exhibit the highest activity in polymerization . for the [(CH3)2C(CH3Cp)(Flu)]ZrCl2-methylalu minoxane system , formation of a syndiotactic poly(4-methyl-1-pentene) wa observed .

In each case a single stereoisomer is formed that contains a s-p-structured e3-benzylic coordination of the chain end , exhibiting the meso-allyl position oriented ci to the substituted cp ring at the resulting metallacyclic framework . complex 9b wa characterized by x-ray crystal - structure analysis . the catalytic activity of Cp2ZrCl2 supported on three type of molecular sieve ( MCM-41 , VPI-5 and Y zeolite ) wa evaluated in the polymerization of ethylene . the support were dehydrated , pre-treated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , and then reacted with Cp2ZrCl2 . after heterogenization of Cp2ZrCl2 on the molecular sieve , the MAO concentration could be reduced without significant effect on the catalytic activity . the polymer obtained with the heterogeneous catalyst showed higher melting point and molecular weight , a well a narrower polydispersion than those obtained with the homogeneous catalyst precursor . the substituted 6-hydroxy-trans-3-hexenoic acid 2-4 have been prepared by a template coupling reaction between ( butadiene ) zirconocene , C6O6W , and cyclobutanone , cyclodecanone , or cyclododecanone , respectively , followed by hydrolytic / oxidative demetallation of the resulting metallacyclic zirconoxycarbene tungsten complex . the hydroxyalkenoic acid 2-4 have been found to form two novel fundamental type of associated supramolecular structural array in the solid state through intermolecular hydrogen bonding , which have been characterized by x-ray diffraction analysis . the cyclobutanone - derived compound <nUm> exhibit an infinitely extending sheet - like structure , which is composed of symmetrically alternating interconnected 12- and 36-membered ring , each being constructed from the functional group or framework of four individual molecule of <nUm> . In contrast , the cyclodecanone- derived compound <nUm> adopts a ribbon - type structure composed of C2- symmetrically arranged symmetry - equivalent 15-membered ring , each containing the functionality from three individual molecule of <nUm> . on the basis of scanning force microscopy study , the cyclododecanone - derived compound <nUm> would appear to have a similar structure in the solid state . the structural feature of the molecular assembly that are formed by intermolecular hydrogen bonding of compound 2-4 in the solid state are selectively controlled by the size and favoured conformation of the spiro - anellated carbocyclic ring at C6 of the 6-hydroxy-trans-3-hexenoic acid carbon chain . the title complex are stable , borate - bridged ansa - zirconocene specie which have been prepared by reacting [ { Ph(SMe2)B(e5-C5H4) 2}ZrCl2 ] ( 1 ) with cp*2 - AlMe and [PPN]Cl . their molecular structure were determined by x-ray diffraction . noteworthy are the stability of the borate-cyclopentadienyl linkage and the enhanced lewis acidity of the boron within it strained ansa position . the chemistry research community is identifying hafnium 's potential capability a a catalyst to advance N and C-H activation reaction . the research ha found a close relationship between the physical and chemical property of hafnium and zirconium . it is reported that hafnocene-N2 and zirconocene-N2 complex react with H to form a hydrazine core between two metallocene unit . hafnium is also found to offer broader reactivity of the dihafnocene-N2 complex with carbon dioxide leading to double insertion of carbon dioxide into the Hf-N bond to form a n2-carbon dioxide core . the group <nUm> metallocene reaction with acetylene form adduct between bi ( trimethylsilyl ) acetylene , titanocene , and zirconocene . the chemical researcher have applied the enhanced reactivity of hafnium organometallic compound for synthesis and catalysis . several supported zirconocene catalyst were prepared by using Cl2Mg · 6H2O a a precursor for producing an active support . such catalyst combined with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) obtained by reacting Cl2Mg · 6H2O with AlMe3 show good activity for ethylene polymerization similar to that of anhydrous Cl2Mg supported zirconocene catalyst . the chemical structure of end group of medium - low molecular weight atactic and isotactic polypropylene ( a-PP and i-PP ) , produced with zirconocene / methylalumoxane catalyst , have been analyzed and used to infer the chain - transfer reaction mechanism , which are then correlated with the zirconocene ligand structure and the polymerization condition . for the chiral , isospecific ansa - zirconocenes such a rac-[ethylenebis(1-indenyl)]ZrCl2 / methylalumoxane ( <nUm> / MAO ) and rac-[ethylenebis(4,7-dimethyl-1-indenyl)]ZrCl2 / methylalumoxane ( <nUm> / MAO ) catalyst , i-PP molecular weight is dependent on the reg / ospecificity of the catalyst , a shown by the presence of cis-2-butenyl end group , formed by chain transfer to the monomer after a secondary propylene insertion . At low monomer concentration , chain - transfer with <nUm> / MAO shift from predominant transfer to the monomer after a secondary propylene insertion to b-methyl ( allyl end group ) and b-hydrogen transfer after a primary insertion ( 2-propenyl , or vinylidene , end group ) . Ansti-bis(3-R-indenyl)ZrCl2 ( ansa = CH2 , Me2Si , Me2C ; r = me , t-Bu , Me3Si ) catalyst , which are highly regiospecific , produce polypropylene with chain transfer via both b-hydrogen transfer after a primary insertion and b-methyl transfer . for example , rac-Me2C(3-t-Bu-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 4 ) exhibit the highest selectivity for b-methyl transfer so far observed in an isospecific zirconocene .

In contrast , the corresponding zirconocene complex <nUm> affords , by an analogous reaction , a dinuclear complex . In additional experiment the known complex Cp*2Zr(e2-PhC2SiMe3) ( 8 ) wa prepared , starting from Cp*2ZrCl2 and Mg in the presence of PhC = CSiMe3 . this complex reacts with carbon dioxide resulting in a mixture of the regioisomeric zirconafuranones 9a and 9b . from these in the complex 9a , having the SiMe3 group in b-position to the metal , the Zr-C bond wa quickly hydrolyzed by water to give the complex Cp*2Zr(OH)OC( = O ) - C(SiMe3) = CHPh ( 10a ) compared to complex ( 9b ) which give slowly the complex Cp*2Zr(OH)OC( = O ) - CPh = CH(SiMe3) ( 10b ) . the production of polyethylene by zirconocene catalysis is a multistep process that includes initiation , propagation , and termination . each of these step ha a number of associated equilibrium and transition state structure . these structure have been studied in the gas - phase environment using density functional and integrated method . we have also examined the effect of solvation upon the energetics of the various polymerization step employing continuum and explicit representation of the solvent ( toluene ) . the reaction step we have studied are initiation , propagation , propylene and hexene incorporation , termination by hydrogenolysis , termination by b-H transfer to the metal , termination by b-H transfer to the monomer , and reactivation . the solvation effect of toluene take on special significance for the initiation , termination by hydrogenolysis and by b-H transfer to the metal , and reactivation step . none interaction between different zirconium compound a schwartz reagent [Cp2ZrHCl]n , zirconocene [Cp2Zr] or benzyne zirconocene and unsaturated system incorporating main group element have been investigated . efficient new methodology of preparation of several linear mono- , di- , tri-or polyphosphanes a well a mono- , di-or tricyclic compound incorporating phosphorus , nitrogen , antimony or tin are reported . the mono- and bis-ring substituted zirconocenes with pendant phenyl group [ Zr(e-C5H5)(e-C5H4CMe 2Ph)Me2 ] <nUm> , [ Zr(e-C5H5)(e-C5H4CMe 2C6H4Me-p)Me2 ] <nUm> , [ Zr(e-C5H4CMe2Ph)2Me <nUm> ] <nUm> , and [ Zr(e-C5H4CMe2C6H 4Me-p)2Me2 ] <nUm> have been prepared . the crystal structure of <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined . compound 2-5 react with methyl abstracting reagent such a BC18F15 or [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4] - to form cationic zirconocene complex 6-9 a solvent separated ion pair a shown by low temperature NMR spectroscopy . for the cationic complex [ Zr(e-C5H5)(e-C5H4CMe 2Ph)Me]+[RB(C6F5)3] - ( r = me 6a or C6F5 6b ) and [ Zr(e-C5H5)(e-C5H4CMe 2C6H4Me-p)Me]+[RB(C 6F5)3]- ( r = me 7a or C6F5 7b ) evidence for the co-ordination of a phenyl group to the zirconium centre via agostic C-H-M interaction wa obtained by NMR spectroscopy . these cationic complex can be considered a model for solvent adduct in kaminsky catalyst . the cationic complex [Zr(e-C5H4CMe2Ph)2Me] +[RB(C6F5)3]- ( r = me 8a or C6F5 8b ) ( derived from <nUm> ) and [ Zr(e-C5H4CMe2C6H 4Me-p)2Me]+[RB(C6F5) 3]- ( r = me 9a or C6F5 9b ) ( derived from <nUm> ) , respectively , exhibit more complex behaviour . these observation contrast with those from the previously published benzyl congener [Zr(e-C5H4CH2Ph)2Me2] <nUm> which , with methyl abstracting agent , generates both a solvent separated cation / anion pair and a tight ion pair . zirconocene supported on alumina or magnesium chloride exhibit modest olefin polymerization activity but not when it is supported directly on silica . the surface silanol a well a siloxane group must be passivated with appropriate reagent . A very active and stereospecific supported catalyst wa obtained by first reacting silica with methylalumoxane and bisphenol A before the impregnation of the ansa - zirconocene precursor . the main difference between a homogeneous and supported catalyst is that at the same gross amount of metallocene , the net concentration of it in the pore of a support material is several order of magnitude greater than it exists in solution thus the rate of deactivation in the former case is correspondingly faster than in the latter . most other supported metallocene catalyst based on support such a zeolite , cyclodextrin , polymeric MAO , synthetic polymer , etc. , are poor in olefin polymerization for this and other reason discussed . the tetraphenyl substituted disiloxane bridged ansa - zirconocene ha been generated to probe the effect of bridging ligand on metallocene polymerization . the indicated zirconocene ha been synthesized by the reaction of Cl4Zr with the distannylated precursor compound . the new disiloxane bridged ansa - metallocene wa characterized by 1H and 13C NMR , mass analysis , and elemental analysis . ethylene polymerization wa carried out to in- , vestigate the polymerization property of the prepared complex . polymerization experiment exhibited that the catalytic activity increase with the increase in polymerization temperature a well a the amount of cocatalyst . on the other hand , the molecular weight of the polymer decreased with the increase in polymerization temperature . it turned out that tetraphenyl replacement caused about <nUm> to <nUm> % activity reduction . the most important feature associated in tetramethyl to tetraphenyl substitution wa that molecular weight of the polymer from the tetraphenyl substituted complex were enormously improved comparing to those of the polymer from the tetramethyl one . three procedure were developed for the preparation of Cp2ZrH{(m-H)2BC4H8} , <nUm> . it can be prepared from the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with K[H2B2(m-H)(m-C4H8) <nUm> ] in a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio ; the reaction of Cp2ZrCl{(m-H)2BC4H8} with K[H2B2(m-H)(m-C4H8) <nUm> ] in a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio ; and the reaction of Cp2ZrCl{(m-H)2BC4H8} with HLi in a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio . although the first and second procedure imply the possible synthesis of Cp2Zr{(m-H)2BC4H8}2 , this compound is not formed . group IVB metallocene polyethers containing the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol have been synthesized in moderate yield with chain length ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> employing the interfacial polycondensation procedure . infrared spectroscopy show the absence of the O-H group and formation of the M-O linkage consistent with the formation of the polyether . F-MALDI MS result are consistent with the presence of metal - containing fragmentation cluster containing one and two metal atom and ion fragment up to several hundred unit long . the polymer all show moderate to good inhibition of a group of cancer cell line including colon , breast , lung , and prostrate cell line . the titanocene - containing polymer ha significant CI50 value showing a preference to inhibit the cancer cell line in preference to the WI-38 normal cell line . acetylenic stannanes react with Cp2Zr(H)Cl ( cp = e5-C5H5 ) giving organozirconium(iv) complex , which are trapped with alkynyliodonium tosylates in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 to afford (Z)-l-en-3-yn-2-ylstannanes . (Butadiene)zirconocenes add tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane in a <nUm> : <nUm> stoichiometry to yield metallocene-hydrocarbylborate-betaine system that serve a active single component metallocene ziegler catalyst . under specific reaction condition , the first olefin insertion step can be experimentally observed . this is used to characterize the stereochemistry and reaction profile of single alkene insertion at a variety of metallocene ziegler catalyst and related system . we have analyzed the computational result for several elementary reaction of the ethylene polymerization process catalyzed by an alternative ( to the existing metallocene catalyst ) " non-cyclopentadienyl " catalyst such a diimine - M(II) ( where m = Ni and Pd ) and chelating bridged ti- and Zr - complex . the obtained data have been compared with those for the existing zirconocene - based catalyst . In general , it wa shown that : ( i ) the resting stage of the process is a metal-olefin-alkyl complex , the olefin coordination energy of which is a few kcal / mol larger for diimine - M(II) system than zirconocene or dialkoxide system ; ( ii ) the rate - determining barrier is a migratory insertion barrier calculated from the metal-olefin-alkyl complex , which is found to be a few kcal / mol larger for the diimine - M(II) system compared to the Cp2ZrCH3+ catalyst . the presence of certain flexible bridging ligand x in the Ti - alkoxide complex , [Y(Ph)X(Ph)Y]TiCH3+ , which are capable of donating electron density to the cationic metal center at various stage during the reaction make this barrier a few kcal / mol smaller for the dialkoxide than the Cp2ZrCH3+ catalyst . it wa shown that an increase in the metal - bridge interaction decrease the migratory insertion barrier and , consequently , increase the catalytic activity of these complex . although the diimine - M(II) catalyst are le active than zirconocene - based one , the microstructure of the polymer produced by the former catalyst , which is found to be a function of temperature , ethylene , steric bulkiness of the auxiliary ligand , and transition metal center , make them attractive for practice . we also have studied the mechanism of several chain termination / transfer reaction , a well a the role of steric effect in the studied elementary reaction . we have clearly demonstrated tremendous possibility of the computational chemistry in solving complex problem of the homogenous catalyst , and it high capability of predicting new and more active catalyst for different commercially important process including olefin polymerization reaction . ethylene is polymerized by heterobimetallic combination of early and late transition metal catalyst . dual combination of zirconocenes and cationic nickel and iron catalyst with multidentate nitrogen - donor ligand are described . reactor blend of linear and branched ethylene homopolymers are obtained . with zirconocene / nickel complex catalyst combination , addition of hydrogen selectively reduces the molecular weight of the linear polyethylene formed by the metallocene catalyst . tetramethyldisilane - bridged bis(1 - indenyl and tetrahydroindenyl ) metallocene dichlorides(Me2SiSiMe2)Ind2MCl 2[M = ti(1) , zr(2) ] and (Me2SiSiMe2)[IndH4]2MCl 2[M = ti(3) , zr(4) ] were synthesized . complex 1-4 were characterized by 1H NMR , mass spectrum and elemental analysis . complex <nUm> and <nUm> were used for the polymerization of ethylene after activation with methyl aluminoxane(MAO) at different temperature and normal pressure . the titanocene <nUm> show a lower activity but produce polyethylene with a higher molecular weight than zirconocene <nUm> . the catalyst system show a dependency of the activity and molecular weight on temperature . metallocene catalyst in dissolved form are in most case unsuitable for the production of polyethylene or polypropylene on an industrial scale . In order to use them in existing technical process , metallocenes have to be supported . Cs - symmetric zirconocenes show a high activity and no leaching additional triisobutyl aluminum is used a scavenger and MAO - covered silica for heterogenization . the aluminum : zirconium ratio can be reduced to value of <nUm> : <nUm> to get optimal activity . the syndiotacticity of the obtained polypropylene is lower compared with polymer of the homogeneous catalyst and decrease strongly with a thinner propene concentration . the moderate electrophilicity of palladium (II) - phosphine catalyst compared to those of zirconocene dichloride make them more tolerant toward a variety of polar functionality of olefinic monomer . this allows use of Pd (II) complex a catalyst for the copolymerization of olefin with readily available polar monomer , like acrylic acid derivative or carbon monoxide . In particular , development during the recent year have opened the way to a new and broad family of high molecular weight 1-olefin / CO co- and terpolymers . these 1,4-polyketone material show interesting and easily variable property which can be tuned from insoluble , highly crystalline to thermoplastic elastic . the latter polymer resemble in some case flexible PVC and even vulcanized natural rubber . new data on the structure of polymethylaluminoxane[-Al(CH3)O-]n ( MAO ) , the nature of it lewis acidity , and the mechanism of formation of the active center of the metallocene catalyst during interaction between MAO and Cp2ZrMe2 obtained by spectroscopy ( 27Al , 17O , 1H , and 13C NMR and spin probe ESR ) and density functional theory ( DFT ) calculation are considered . A three - dimensional structure of MAO ( a cage structure ) with four - coordinated aluminum atom and three - coordinated oxygen atom is found to be the most probable . experimental evidence for the presence of relatively weak lewis acid site in MAO ( about <nUm> site per <nUm> atom of Al ) is obtained for the first time . the acidity of MAO depends on the size of a MAO molecule n , and it increase with increasing n . A scheme for the formation and structure of lewis acid site formed upon interaction between MAO and Al2Me6 , which is always present in the MAO sample is proposed . cationic intermediate formed in the MAO / Cp2ZrMe2 system at high molar ratio Al / Zr = 200-4000 corresponding to real condition of polymerization are characterized for the first time . A scheme of equilibrium between them and the most probable precursor of the active center in this system are proposed . A new mechanism for the formation of the [Cp2ZrMe]+[MAO · me]- ionic pair involving the abstraction and occlusion of a methyl ligand in the bulk of a MAO molecule is proposed on the basis of quantum - chemical calculation . the polyethylene obtained in the presence of the catalyst constituted by the meso isomer of the prototypical zirconocene complex (ethylene)bis(l-indenyDzirconium dichloride activated by methylalumoxane is characterized by the presence of ethyl branch . the intensity of the 13C NMR signal associated with these branch indicate that there are about 1-2 ethyl group per <nUm> monomer unit . As a consequence , the melting temperature is 10-15 ° C lower than the linear polyethylene obtained with the rac mixture of the same zirconocene complex . on the basis of kinetic evidence , a branching mechanism that involves a 9-H transfer to the coordinated ethylene is proposed . catalytic pauson - khand reaction product with norbornadiene could be effectively transformed to trisubstituted cyclopentadienes , which have been used to synthesize a series of unbridged bis(1-R'-2-R-3-R'-trisubstituted cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride <nUm> ( r = R' = ph ) , <nUm> ( r = ph , R' = me ) , <nUm> ( r = n-Bu , R' = me ) , <nUm> ( r = t-Bu , R' = me ) , <nUm> ( r = (CH2)4OMe ) , R' = me ) , and <nUm> ( r = n-Bu , R' = ph ) . the crystal structure of <nUm> wa determined by x-ray crystallography . these zirconium complex in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) show activity for the polymerization of ethylene . the activity are in the following order : <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> ∼ <nUm> ∼ Cp2ZrCl2 > <nUm> ∼ <nUm> . the activity of <nUm> is four time higher than that of Cp2ZrCl2 under similar condition . In this work , the boron ( B ) modification of MCM-41 - supported dMMAO / zirconocene catalyst showed a promising increase ( almost twice ) in catalytic activity in ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization . the enhanced activity can be attributed to the decreased interaction between the support and dMMAO with boron modification a wa proved by TGA . it wa proposed that boron acted a a spacer anchoring the support and dMMAO . however , at high boron loading ( ca. <nUm> wt % ) , the activity slightly decreased due to the migration of dMMAO into boron layer resulting in le surface concentration of [Al]dMMAO which wa measured by XPS . the inhibition of chain transfer reaction during polymerization apparently occurred upon the boron modification providing higher MW polymer . it wa also suggested that boron modification ha rendered more uniform catalytic site which wa leading to narrower MWD of the polymer observed . based on 13CNMR , boron modification did not affect the microstructure of copolymer obtained . however , the insertion of 1-octene increased with boron modification probably due to decreased steric hindrance of the MCM-41 support . trimethylphosphine - stabilized ethylene complex <nUm> of the ethylenebisindenyl-supported zirconocene fragment are prepared via magnesium reduction of rac - (EBI)ZrCl <nUm> in the presence of ethylene and PMe <nUm> . when the reaction is halted after <nUm> h , good yield of a mixture containing rac-(EBI)Zr(e <nUm> -CH <nUm> = CH <nUm> )PMe <nUm> , rac-1 , and the racemic diastereomer of the zirconacyclopentane derivative (EBI)Zr(e <nUm> -CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> ) , rac-2 , are obtained . this mixture may be converted to pure rac-1 if treated with excess PMe <nUm> . if the magnesium reduction of rac - (EBI)ZrCl <nUm> is left for <nUm> day in the presence of magnesium chloride , complete epimerization to meso-1 is observed . thus , both diastereomers of <nUm> are available . compound meso-1 and rac-2 have been characterized crystallographically . the coordinated ethylene ligand in compound <nUm> are susceptible to electrophilic attack by the pentafluorophenyl-substituted boranes HB(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> and B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> , forming zwitterionic metallocene product . for reaction involving HB(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> , the product meso-3 and rac-3 are characterized by a strong zirconium - hydrido borate interaction , a well a a weak Zr-Cb bonding . In addition to complete solution characterization , the structure of meso-3 wa determined crystallographically . upon treatment of rac-1 with B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> , a more charge - separated zwitterion , rac-4 , wa formed . In addition to retaining it PMe <nUm> ligand , the complex is stabilized by a strong b-CH <nUm> interaction , a determined by x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy . structural comparison between the compound reported herein and previous example in metallocene chemistry are presented . BC18F15 open the ring of the N-tBu azazirconacyclobutane <nUm> by abstracting the carbon from the zirconium ; the resulting amido cation <nUm> reacts slowly with ethylene to form a chelating g-iminoalkyl zirconocene cation , <nUm> . similarly , BC18F15 remove carbon from the Zr of the N-Ph azazirconacyclopentane 5a and the N-SiMe3 azazirconacyclopentane 5b , forming amido cation that are stabilized in the solid state by coordination of phenyl substituents on N ( <nUm> , from 5a ) or C ( <nUm> , from 5b ) ; <nUm> slowly loses hydrogen , forming an azaallyl cation <nUm> . In contrast AlMe2Cl coordinate the N of the zirconaaziridines <nUm> , resulting in an sp2 N coordinated to Zr through a p orbital . the structure of <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and 11a have been established by x-ray crystallography . the reactivity of group <nUm> zirconocene dichloride incorporating (1-trimethylsilyl)-e5-indenyl ( Me3SiInd ) and e5-1-(trimethylsilyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydromdenyl ( Me3SiTHI ) ligand toward boron tribromide wa investigated . whereas the reaction of (Me3SiInd)CpZrCl2 ( 1 ) with BBr3 in CCl2H2 immediately cleaved the indenyl ligand from the metal , (Me3SiTHI)CpZrCl2 ( 3 ) reacted with BBr3 in CCl2H2 at <nUm> ° C for <nUm> day to obtain [1-(BrSiMe2)THI]CpZrBr2 ( 6 ) in <nUm> % yield . the reaction of (Me3SiInd)Li ( <nUm> equiv ) with ZrCl4(THF)2 afforded pure rac-(Me3-SiInd)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) in <nUm> % yield . hydrogenation of ( 2 ) ( <nUm> bar , O2Pt catalyst ) afforded rac-(Me3-SiTHI)2ZrCl2 ( 4 ) in <nUm> % yield . single - crystal x-ray diffraction analysis of <nUm> showed that the Zr atom lie on a crystallographic C2 axis with the CH2 annelated ring projecting into the Cl2Zr hemisphere of the pseudotetrahedral coordination environment . the reaction of <nUm> with MeLi in toluene afforded rac-(Me3SiTHI)2ZrMe2 ( 5 ) in <nUm> % yield . 1H NMR and 13C NMR analysis confirmed the rac assignment for <nUm> . treatment of <nUm> with BBr3 in CCl2H2 at <nUm> ° C for <nUm> day afforded rac-[1-(BrMe2Si)THI]2ZrBr2 ( 7 ) in <nUm> % yield . the reaction of <nUm> with moisture in ambient air gave the ansa - metallocene rac-[m-O-(1-Me2SiTHI)2]ZrBr2 ( 8 ) in <nUm> % yield . In solution , <nUm> showed time - averaged C2 symmetry ( 1H NMR ) ; however , single - crystal x-ray diffraction analysis showed that <nUm> adopts an asymmetric conformation in which only one of the CH2 annelated ring project into the Cl2Zr coordination hemisphere . neither <nUm> nor <nUm> served a a precatalyst for alumoxane - cocatalyzed , homogeneous propylene polymerization . none treatment of the alkyl group <nUm> metallocene cation reagent [ZrCp2{CH2Si(CH3)3}(THF)] +[BPh4]- 2b with bis(propynyl)zirconocene 1a yielded the cationic dimetallic complex [ (ZrCp2)2(m-e1 : e2-CH3CCCH3){m-k 2-C ≡ CCH2Si(CH3)3}]+ 3d with BPh4- anion . complex 3d wa characterized spectroscopically and by a crystal structure analysis . it contains a planar four-co-ordinate carbon atom , which is stabilized by the interaction with both group <nUm> metal centre . finding the C4H11Si substituent , that originates from the alkylzirconocene reagent , attached at the m-acetylide ligand in the final product is unusual . A reversible alkynyl carbometallation sequence is proposed to account for the observed selective formation of 3d . complex 3d reacted with alkyl isocyanides RN ≡ C ( r = CMe2CH2CMe3 , CMe3 , or cyclohexyl ) by replacement of the m-e1 : e2-CH3CCCH3 ligand to form the m-isocyanide complex [ (ZrCp2)2(m-e1-C : e2-C,N-RNC){m-k2-C ≡ CCH 2Si(CH3)2}]+ ( with BPh4- anion ) of which one wa characterized by a crystal structure analysis . dinitrile cyclization reaction leading to new six - membered heterocycle 1-s3,l3-phospha-2,6-diazines 3a,b and 1,4-s3,l3-diphospha-2,6-diazines <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> are presented . these synthesis involve dinitrile derivative , schwartz reagent [Cp2ZrHCl]n , and phosphorus compound a promoted cyclization reagent . an x-ray crystal structure of the 1,4-s3,l3-diphospha-2,6-diazine <nUm> is reported . the polymeric [Ind2Si(C6H4)]n and [Ind2Si(C6H4)]m compound ( ind = indenyl ) were synthesized via the condensation reaction of bisindenyldichlorosilane and p-dilithiobenzene or p-dilithiobiphenyl , and the supported - type zirconocene catalyst were prepared by reacting them with zirconium tetrachloride . the content of zirconium in the catalyst is much higher than that in the metallocene catalyst supported by inorganic compound . polymerization of ethene and propene were conducted with them using methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or ordinary alkylaluminiums a cocatalysts and toluene a the solvent . the catalyst combined with MAO display very high activity especially for the ethene polymerization . from the polymerization at high temperature , it wa found that the active specie are markedly stabilized , probably due to the rigid backbone of the carrier . the activity of the catalyst activated with ordinary alkylaluminiums is far le a compared with those activated with MAO . reaction of the branched polyynes tris(tert-butylbutadiynyl)benzene ( 1,3,5-(tBuC ≡ CC ≡ C)3C6H3 ) ( 1 ) with the metallocene source Cp2Ti(e2-Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) ( 2 ) and Cp2Zr(THF)(e2-Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe <nUm> ) ( <nUm> ; THF = tetrahydrofuran ) led to diverse novel organometallic ti6 ( 4 ) , zr3 ( 5 ) , and zr6 ( 6 ) complex depending on the metal , the polyynes , and the stoichiometry employed in the conversion . the new complex have been characterized spectroscopically . additionally x-ray crystal structure analysis were performed for <nUm> and <nUm> . this paper describes the use of several kind of group IV cp based catalyst system , in the synthesis of co- and terpolymers of ethylene , propylene and . a-olefins endowed with OH and COOH functional group . the hydroxy monomer used were 5-hexen-l-ol ( 4 ) and 10-undecen-l-ol ( 5 ) and the carboxy monomer wa 10-undecen-l-oic acid ( 6 ) . the three catalyst system used were the C2 symmetric ansa - zirconocene ( 1 ) the " in-site " titanium complex ( 2 ) and the non-rigid zirconocene ( 3 ) , all activated by methylaluminoxane . trimethylaluminium wa used to protect the functional group of polar monomer . the first two catalyst system suffer similar activity loss in the presence of polar monomer whereas the third one exhibited better tolerance toward the hydroxyolefins . NMR and FTIR spectroscopy were used to characterize the polymerization product . all three catalyst system afforded functionalized co- and terpolymers by direct polymerization of ethylene / propylene / hydroxy-a - olefin but only the catalyst system ( 1 ) / MAO display appreciable activity for direct polymerization of ethylene , propylene and carboxy-a-ole-fins . deprotonation of the aminofulvene <nUm> with LiCH(SiMe3)2 provides <nUm> , which reacts with MCl4 ( m = Zr or Hf ) by intramolecular NMe2H elimination and coupling of the fulvene moiety to form complex <nUm> or <nUm> . this reaction is a useful synthetic pathway to allyl-bridged ansa - metallocenes , especially those with a conjugated 14p electron system . r ' = dimethylamino . the present work is aimed at increasing the seed germination of damaged and older seed in an effort to allow such seed to act a reliable seed source . the synthesis and structural characterization of kinetin - containing group IVB metallocene - containing polymer is described . A number of seed were treated with ppm amount of kinetin and kinetin - containing polymer . the rate of seed germination wa generally increased for the seed that were treated in comparison to those seed that were not treated . these increase in seed germination ranged to over seven fold . liquid co- and terpolymers based on inexpensive and abundant a-olefins and ethylene feed stock were produced using a single site zirconocene catalyst . the process is based , in part , on the formation of synthetic hydrocarbon base oil ( SHC ) with catalyst having a high viscosity index , low pour point , low volatility , low cold cranking viscosity , high flash point , and excellent oxidation stability . the characteristic of the liquid polymer were modified by cracking and hydrogenation to generate SHC . the oil ' performance property were comparable to or better than PAO and are an economical alternative to formulating high performance motor oil and lubricant . formal [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between the a-phosphino zirconaindene <nUm> and various cumulenes [ CO2 , CS2 , Cy-N = C = N-Cy ( cy = cyclohexyl ) , R-N = C = S ( r = me , ph ) , R-N = C = O ( r = ph , ' bu ) ] afford stable zwitterionic monomeric five - coordinated anionic bis-(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium complex 2-6 . single - crystal x-ray structure of two of these compound ( <nUm> , 6b ) are reported . A related biszwitterionic zirconocene complex <nUm> is prepared through the reaction of carbon disulfide with the tricyclic a-phospholane zirconaindan <nUm> ; in this case cycloaddition reaction take place on the two carbon sulfur double bond of CS2 . unbridged , sterically substituted zirconocene dichloride can be prepared in high yield by the interaction of a dialkylzirconium dichloride with <nUm> equiv of the appropriate fulvene in hydrocarbon medium with alkene displacement . the requisite dialkylzirconium dichloride can readily be produced by the alkylation of Cl4Zr in hydrocarbon medium with <nUm> equiv of an alkyllithium reagent . generating the R2ZrCl2 reagent in hydrocarbon medium permit their use a hydrozirconating agent for a variety of polar unsaturated organic substrate . A stereoregular alternating ethylene-styrene copolymer , also stretchable in fiber form , ha been obtained with rac-isopropylidenebis(1-indenyl)zirconium dimethyldiamide activated by the methyl-alumoxane catalytic system . from x-ray diffraction fiber spectrum , an isotactic structure ha been assigned to this copolymer a well a the previously described stereoregular ethylene-styrene copolymer . the polymer ha zigzag planar chain conformation with phenyl group oriented perpendicularly to the chain axis . the crystallographic symmetry in B2 / m . lattice constant ( monoclinic , unique axis c ) : a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å ; γ = <nUm> ° . the disagreement index for measured reflection is R1 = <nUm> . A series of substituted indenyl-fluorenyl asymmetric ethylene-bridged ligand have been prepared from the reaction of 1-(9-fluorenyl)-2-bromoethane and the lithium salt of the desired indenyl moiety . the ligand have been converted to the corresponding substituted asymmetric ethylene-bridged metallocenes ( m = Zr , Hf ) . these metallocenes have been evaluated a catalyst precursor for the polymerization of ethylene and propylene . the influence of substitution on the selectivity of the propylene polymerization ha been studied . the metallocene [1-(9-fluorenyl)-2-(2,4,7-trimethyl-1-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride wa found to produce highly isotactic polypropylene with an [mmmm] value of <nUm> % . A general investigation of the elementary reaction involved in the activation process of zirconocene and Ni - based derivative by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) wa performed through the association of polymerization kinetics and spectroscopic investigation of the catalytic system . this study demonstrates the close correlation between polymerization activity and the change in the UV / visible characteristic absorption band of the transition metal derivative used a catalyst . hex-1-ene wa chosen a model monomer . homo- and copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene were conducted at different temperature and ethylene pressure with several zirconocenes activated with dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( Me2PhNH*B(C6F5) <nUm> ) / triisobutylaluminium ( i-Bu3Al ) to study the effect of ligand structure and polymerization condition on catalytic activity , molecular weight and chain transfer reaction . At high temperature and low ethylene pressure , rac-ethylene(bisindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) activated with Me2PhNH*B(C6F5)4 / i-Bu 3Al initially give a highly active catalyst that is rapidly deactivated . trans-Vinylene double bond , which were not formed at low temperature , were detected in polyethylene synthesized at high temperature and low ethylene pressure . they reasonably arise from b-H transfer after isomerization reaction . the molecular weight of ethylene / 1-hexene copolymer decrease with increasing 1-hexene feed , followed by the formation of vinylidene end group . this reveals that b-H transfer from propagating chain containing primary inserted 1-hexene a a terminal unit is predominant . this reaction is influenced by the ligand structure . At high temperature and high ethylene pressure , trans-vinylene and vinylidene content decrease and the vinyl content increase , indicating that the high ethylene pressure control b-H transfer after isomerization reaction . ethylene polymerization and ethylene / a-olefin copolymerization were conducted using diphenylmethylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( Ph2C(Cp)(Flu)ZrCl2 ) a a catalyst activated with dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( Me2PhNH · BC24F20 ) / triisobutylaluminium ( i-Bu3Al ) at high temperature and different ethylene pressure . this catalyst produce high molecular weight polyethylene with high activity . the molecular weight of the copolymer hardly decrease with increasing amount of comonomer in the feed . this is attributed to the control b-H transfer from the propagating chain containing primary inserted comonomer . the occurrence of inner trisubstituted double bond wa confirmed . these bond are probably formed by dehydrogenation reaction after b-H transfer from the propagating chain followed by ethylene insertion . therefore , this reaction might play an important role in the production of high molecular weight ethylene / 1-hexene copolymer at high temperature . At high ethylene pressure , isomerization reaction from inserted ethylene or primary inserted a-olefin a terminal unit , which were observed under low ethylene pressure , can be controlled at low level . institut fur anorganische chemie der universitat zu koln , greinstrasse <nUm> , D-50939 koln A series of new ansa - zirconocene dichloride compound [ PR(C5H4)2ZrCl2 ; r = me(5) , et ( 6 ) , iPr ( 7 ) , tBu ( 8 ) ] with phosphorus a bridging atom between the cyclopentadienyl ring have been prepared , isolated , and characterised by 1H , 13C , 31P NMR spectroscopy , mass spectrometry and elemental analysis . the x-ray structure of <nUm> is reported . A novel polymer - supported metallocene catalyst with crosslinked poly(styrene-co-acrylamide) ( AmPS ) a the support ha been prepared and characterized . the probability of long sequence of acrylamide ( Am ) in AmPS is still low even at an Am amount of <nUm> mol % , implying the relatively homogeneous distribution of Am . the infrared spectrum of AmPS and the supported catalyst substantiate that an amide group in AmPS coordinate with methylaluminoxane through both oxygen and nitrogen atom . ethylene / a-octene copolymerization showed that the catalytic activity is not markedly affected by adding a-octene . 13C NMR analysis of the ethylene / a-octene copolymer indicated that the composition distribution of the copolymer is uniform . novel heterobimetallic complex that consist of zirconium and rhodium , LRh(e2CH2 = CH)2Si(e5-C 5H2-2,4-Mc2)2ZrCl2 ( 3a L = e5-C9H7 , 3b e2-C5H5 , 3c e-C5Me5 ) , were synthesized , and 3b wa structurally characterized . the complex have a " C2 - symmetric " ansa - zirconocene part and the rhodium metal on the bridge part . the complex 3a - c in combination with methylaluminoxane catalyzed highly isospecific polymerization of a-olefins . their catalytic activity were higher than that of the parent zirconocene complex , and the obtained polymer had a larger molecular weight . for ethylene polymerization , the supported metallocene catalyst wa prepared by anchoring CpIndZrCl2 on silica with an appropriate spacer . the three procedure were applied for CpIndZrCl2 anchoring on silica with a hexamethyltrisiloxane or pentamethylene spacer . the anchoring procedure exerted a strong influence on the catalyst activity since the different anchoring method gave the formation of different structure of active site . with the new anchoring route , it wa possible to prepare the " heterogeneous single - site " catalyst which wa found to have only one catalyst structure on silica and exhibited a higher catalyst activity than that of the other supported catalyst . At a polymerization temperature of <nUm> ° C , the activity of the heterogeneous single - site catalyst wa comparable to that of the unsupported homogeneous zirconocene . propylene polymerization wa carried out using an ansa - zirconocene pyrrolidide based catalytic system of racemic ethylene-1,2-bis(1-indenyl)zirconium dipyrrolidide [ rac-(EBI)Zr(NC4H8)2 or ( rac-1 ) ] and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or a noncoordinating anion . In situ generation of cationic alkylzirconium specie wa also investigated by NMR - scale reaction of rac-1 and MAO , and rac-1 , AlMe3 , and [Ph3C] [B(C6Fg)4] . In the NMR - scale reaction using CD2Cl2 a a solvent , a small amount of MAO ( [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> ) wa enough to completely activate rac-1 to give cationic methyl-zirconium cation that can polymerize propylene . the resulting isotactic polypropylene ( iPP ) isolated in this reaction showed a meso pentad value of <nUm> % . In a similar NMR - scale reaction rac-1 wa stoichiometrically methylated by AlMe3 to give rac - (EBI)ZrMe2 , and the introduction of [Ph3C] [B(C6F5)4] into the reaction mixture containing rac - (EBI)ZrMe2 led to in situ generation of cationic [rac-(EBI)Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2]+ specie that can polymerize propylene to give iPP showing a meso pentad value of <nUm> % . the catalyst system rac - <nUm> / MAO exhibited an increase of activity a the [Al] / [Zr] ratio increased within an experimental range ( [Al] / [Zr] = 930-6511 ) . the meso pentad value of the resulting iPPs were in the range of <nUm> - <nUm> % . the catalytic activity showed a maximum ( rp = <nUm> × <nUm> g PP / mol Zr h atm ) when [Zr] wa <nUm> × 10-6 mol / L in the propylene polymerization according to the concentration of catalyst . MAO - free polymerization of propylene wa performed by a rac - <nUm> / AlR3 / noncoordinating anion catalytic system . the efficiency of AlR3 wa decreased in the order of AlMe3 ( rp = <nUm> × <nUm> g PP / mol Zr h atm ) > Al(i-Bu)3 ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > AlPr3 ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > Al(i-Bu)2H ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > AlEt3 ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) . the performance of the noncoordinating anion a a cocatalyst wa on the order of [HNMePh2][B(C6F5)4] ( rp , = <nUm> × <nUm> g PP / mol Zr h atm ) > [HNMe2Ph] [B(C6F5)4] ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > [Ph3C] [B(C6F5)4] ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > [HNEt2Ph][B(C6F5)4] ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) . the property of iPP were characterized by 13C - NMR , FTIR , DSC , GPC , and viscometry . 13C NMR spectroscopic study of the in situ polymerization of 13C - enriched ethylene ( 13C2H4 ) in the presence of Cp2Zr(13CH3)2 and methylaluminoxane or BC18F15 a cocatalysts were carried out . the first direct observation of Cp2Zr-polymeryl specie wa made . the in situ polymerization experiment in the presence of different concentration of dinuclear [(Cp2ZrMe)2(m-Me)]+ and mononuclear cation specie [Cp2ZrMe]+ , having [MeB(C6F5)3]- or [MeMAO]- counterions , were performed . these comparison made it possible to make the assignment of the zirconocene complex bearing the polymeryl chain a ligand [Cp2Zr13CH2P]+[13CH 3MAO]- , [Cp2Zr13CH2P]+[13CH 3B(C6F5)3]- , and Cp2Zr(13CH2P)(13CH3) . they are in equilibrium with each other . mononuclear Zr - polymeryl ion pair such a [Cp2Zr13CH2P]+[13CH 3B(C6F5)3]- and [Cp2Zr13CH2P]+[13CH 3MAO]- either are the propagating active specie or are intermediate , closely related to the active specie , in the polymer propagation . metallocene / borate catalyst , generated from zirconocene dimethyl compound , LnZrMe2 , and anilinium borate , [HNMe2Ph]+[B(C6F5)4] - , were used to copolymerize 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene with 1-hexene and 4-methyl-1-pentene . the selected zirconocenes , bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium(IV) dimethyl ( Cp*2ZrMe2 ) and rac-ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium(IV) dimethyl ( rac - EB(THI)ZrMe2 ) , provided atactic and isotactic material , respectively . the isotactic polymer produced were amorphous or crystalline depending of the monomer . the calculated reactivity ratio for the copolymerization of 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene with 1-hexene and metallocene rac-EB(T-HI)ZrMe2 indicate that this system approximates an ideal azeotropic copolymerization with r1 = <nUm> and r2 = <nUm> . estimate for the reactivity ratio for the copolymerization of 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene with 4-methyl-1-pentene were r1 = <nUm> and r2 = <nUm> for rac - EB(THI)ZrMe2 and r1 = <nUm> and r2 = <nUm> for Cp*2ZrMe2 . the polymerization of 1-hexene in the presence of the saturated 1-N,N-diisopropylaminopentane with rac - EBCTHDZrMe2 / borate wa compared with analogous copolymerizations of 1-hexene / 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene . the aminopentene wa more effective than the aminopentane in inhibiting the rate of total monomer conversion , implicating both intra- and intermolecular mechanism for inhibition by the amine . copolymer of 4-methyl-1-pentene / 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene produced with rac-ethylenebisindenyl zirconium(IV) dimethyl ( rac - EBIZrMe2 ) / borate have higher decomposition temperature with increasing amount of aminopentene . this copolymer can be protonated with ClH to yield a methanol - soluble material . alkyl zirconocenes [Zr(e-C5H4R)2X2] ( where r = CH2Ph , x = Cl 1a or me 1b ; r = CHPh2 , x = Cl 2a or me 2b ; r = Si(SiMe3)3 , x = Cl 4a or me 4b ) and for comparison [ Zr(e-C5H5)(e-C5H4CH 2Ph)Cl2 ] 3a were prepared and characterised . the reaction of these compound with the methide abstracting reagent BC18F15 , B(o-C6F5C6F4)3 and [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4] - were investigated by low temperature NMR spectroscopy . compound 1b reacts with [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4] - to form the homodinuclear complex [ {Zr(e-C5H4CH2Ph)2Me} 2(m-Me)]+[B(C6F5) 4]- . the related compound [ {Zr(C5H4CH2Ph)2Me} 2(m-Me)]+[MeB(C6F5) 3]- 5a wa formed from the reaction of 1b with <nUm> equivalent of BC18F15 . reaction between 1b and <nUm> equivalent BC18F15 gave [ Me(e-C5H4CH2Ph) 2Zr(m-Me)B(C6F5)3 ] 6a and the ion pair [Zr(e-C5H4CH2Ph)2Me][MeB(C 6F5)3 ] 6b which are in equilibrium with each other . A similar observation wa made when 2b wa used instead of 1b . the sterically more demanding 4b doe not show this behaviour . the role of the ligand in ethylene polymerisation wa investigated . three possible mechanism of ethylene polymerization in the presence of zirconocene catalyst have been described through density functional calculation . about <nUm> structure ( reactant , intermediate , transition state , and product ) have been located on the potential energy surface . only two mechanism , called frontside and stepwise backside , appear to be competitive . the frontside mechanism ha already been described in the literature , but we present here some important new aspect . In particular , we discus the important role of the perpendicular form of the olefin p-complex for the frontside process . the stepwise backside mechanism is reported for the first time . the energy barrier in both mechanism are on the order of <nUm> kcal / mol , which is compatible with the experimental and theoretical value available for similar process . the energy difference between both mechanism is certainly below the computational method accuracy , and a definitive conclusion regarding the most favorable mechanism can not be drawn . the influence of other factor such a substituents on the catalyst or the size of the polymer chain could be fundamental . (e2-Formaldehyde)zirconocene dimer ( 8 ) cleanly add one or two molar equivalent of the borane BC12F10H by insertion of the H-[B] unit into the zirconium-carbon bond of the metallaoxirane moleties to form the mono- and bis-insertion product <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . these system contain five - membered heterocyclic ring that are built up by connecting five different element , namely H , B , C , O , and Zr . the bis(borane) insertion product <nUm> wa characterized by an x-ray crystal structure analysis . (Butadiene)zirconocene reacts with BC12F10H in a similar way by insertion of the H-[B] unit into the (butadiene)C4-Zr linkage to form the metallacycle <nUm> . the tricyclic zirconocene - phosphaalkyne dimer complex <nUm> reacts with diethyl mesoxalate ( 5 ) or tetracyanoethene ( 7 ) through Cp2Zr-displacement to furnish the novel oxadiphosphatricyclohexane <nUm> or the diphosphatricyclohexane <nUm> , respectively . In contrast , treatment of <nUm> with indanetrione ( 9 ) result in the formation of the dioxadiphosphatricyclooctene <nUm> , which ha been characterized by x-ray structure analysis . ethylbisindenyl zirconium dichloride ( Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) and the MAO methylalumoxane ( MAO ) co-catalyst were heterogenized on davision silica <nUm> partially dehydroxylated at <nUm> ° C , following the concept of equilibrium adsorption . the influence of MAO on the electronic environment resulting from the heterogenization wa investigated using XPS . heterogenization of Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and MAO on the above silica generated two type of zirconocenium cation ( cation <nUm> and cation <nUm> ) , independent of the heterogenization method . based on the postulated surface chemistry , cation <nUm> is presumed to be in the form of an ion - pair [SiO]-[Et(Ind)2ZrCl]+ , whereas cation <nUm> is presumed to be a trapped multi-coordinated crown complex of MAO . In the absence of MAO , only cation <nUm> is formed . the present study provides some support for the postulated surface chemistry regarding heterogenization of Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and MAO on silica . carbon-carbon bond - forming reaction of allylic organometals have been recognized a one of the most fundamental mean in organic synthesis , and a number of application for the synthesis of biologically active molecule have been reported . we have reported the carbon-carbon bond - forming reaction by the use of the allylic and related zirconium specie a reactive intermediate . these zirconium specie can be generated by treating allylic ether with zirconocene - butene complex ( " Cp2Zr " ) through the formation of zirconacyclopropane and the following b-elimination of the alkoxy group . this process wa found to be applicable to generate the γ , g-dialkoxyallylic zirconium specie <nUm> from orthoacrylate derivative . zirconium specie <nUm> possibly ha three reactive site : one is the g-position a a typical allyl metal specie , the other is the b-position followed by the a-position initiated by nucleophilic character of ketene dialkylacetal moiety and the third one is regioselective coupling reaction at the a-position . thus , g,g-dialkoxyallylic zirconium specie <nUm> can be conveniently prepared by the reaction of triethyl orthoacrylate with " Cp2Zr " . without an additive , <nUm> itself reacts with aldehyde and ketone at the g-position to afford the gem-diethoxy homoallylic alcohol derivative . under lewis acid promoted condition , this zirconium specie <nUm> reacts with a variety of carbonyl compound selectively at the b-position in the first step , followed by the cyclopropanation or cyclobutanation reaction to afford the corresponding product mainly depending on electronic nature of substrate or reaction condition . In the presence of CCuN , reaction of <nUm> with allylic phosphate proceeded at the a-position of <nUm> in a highly SN2'- selective manner to give the 5-alkenoates . none novel fl / iya - metallocene complex containing bis(indenyl) ligand bridged at <nUm> position were obtained . ethylene or trimethylene bridged type zirconocene wa synthesized from bis(p-tolyl)ethane or bis(p-tolyl)propane a starting material , respectively . dimethylsilylene bridged type zirconocene wa prepared from the protected 4-bromo-l-indanone derivative . it turned out that meso-C2H4[4,4'(2,7-dimethylindenyl)2]ZrCl2 and 7-flc-Me2Si[4,4'-(2-methylindenyl)2]ZrCl2 were suitable catalyst for producing ethylene / 1-hexene copolymer ith high molecular weight . highly isotactic polypropylene wa obtained by using rac-MejSiXS-methyl-l-phenylindenyOJZrClj catalyst and contained only small amount of 3,1-type regiodefects . the molecular structure of these complex were confirmed by x-ray analysis . the dipeptide derivative Boc-Gly-Val-OMe ( 2 ) and Boc-Ala-Val-OMe ( 3 ) selectively add the methylzirconocene cation <nUm> to the carbonyl oxygen atom of the N - terminal amino acid residue ( K-C4 = O coordination ) upon treatment with [Cp2ZrCH3(THF)+BPh4-] in dichloromethane at low temperature ( < <nUm> ° C ) to generate the complex 2-1 and 3-1 , respectively . above <nUm> ° C methane is eliminated to give the stable chelate peptide metallocene cation complex 2- A and 3-A , respectively , both featuring a combined C1 = O / N / C4 = O coordination to the zirconium center . complex 3-A wa characterized by x-ray diffraction . the analogous tripeptide derivative Boc-Gly-Val-Val-OMe ( 6 ) , Boc-Ala-Ala-Val-OMe ( 7 ) , Boc-Ala-Val-Val-OMe ( 8 ) , and Boc-Val-Val-Gly-OMe ( 9 ) all form analogous K-C4 = O Cp2ZrCH3+ cation adduct (6-9)I under kinetic control and after subsequent loss of CH4 C1 = O / N / C4 = O chelate complex (8-9)-A under thermodynamic control , both involving selective bonding of the organometallic cation to the terminal amino acid residue of the respective peptide derivative . thermolysis of the primary adduct 7-I ( > <nUm> ° C ) resulted in methane elimination and formation of a mixture of the isomer 7-B and 7-A ( isolated in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio ) . according to the detailed NMR analysis 7-A show the favored chelate coordination at the N - terminus involving C1 = O / N / C4 = O bonding , whereas the cation complex 7-B exhibit a similar chelate structure at the internal ala moiety , characterized by C4 = <nUm> / N5 / C7 = O coordination to the zirconium center . similarly , methane liberation from 8-I and 9-I gave mixture of the respective cationic chelate complex isomer 8-A / 8-C ( <nUm> : <nUm> ) and 9-A / 9-C ( <nUm> : <nUm> ) , respectively . the (8,9)-A isomer have the zirconium ion bonded at the N - terminus , whereas (8,9)-C exhibit the Cp2Zr+ unit at the C- terminus of the peptide chain , involving the ester carbonyl group in forming the chelate framework ( C7 = O / N8 / C10 = O coordination ) . the (6-9)-A isomer are thermodynamically favored . the cation complex 7-B , 8-C , 9-C rearrange to the a-type isomer upon prolonged standing at temperature > <nUm> ° C in dichloromethane solution . interaction between zirconocene or benzyne zirconocene and unsaturated specie incorporating main group element lead to a variety of new metallaheterocycles . efficient new methodology of regiospecific synthesis of mono- , bi- , or tricyclic system incorporating phosphorus , nitrogen , selenium , antimony , germanium or tin are reported . copolymerization of ethylene / 1-octene with three ansa - zirconocene / MAO catalyst system were investigated . the polymerization activity is dependent upon the influence of electronic effect . it decrease in the following order ; C 6H <nUm> ( CH <nUm> ) 2Cp 2ZrCl <nUm> > C 5H 3N(CH <nUm> ) 2Cp 2ZrCl <nUm> > CH 3N(CH <nUm> ) 2ZrCl <nUm> . the composition and sequence distribution of copolymer were calculated from 13C - NMR spectrum . it wa found that the activityes of three ansacatalysts were lower than Et(Ind) 2ZrCl <nUm> under the same 1-octeone concentration . and their copolymer had lower 1-octene incorporation than that of Et(Ind) 2ZrCl <nUm> . other property such a molecular wieght , melting point of copolymer were compared . analysis of the published data on the interaction between the component of a zirconocene-poly(methylaluminoxane) system used a the catalyst of olefin polymerization indicates that the yield of the reaction product , methane , is virtually independent of the concentration of the component over a wide concentration range . it is assumed that methane is formed in the absence of the monomer on the catalytic site of polymerization formed by the interaction of the major component and the activating admixture , including uncontrollable admixture ( H2O , O ) . under specified condition , it is the admixture that control the concentration of the catalytic center and the methane yield . for this reason , the yield of methane is independent of the concentration of zirconocene and poly(methylaminoxane) . the solid - state structure of three zirconocene aryl sulfonate were determined . In Cp2Zr(OSO2C6H5)2 ( 1 ) , one of the sulfonate ligand is monodentate , the other bidentate coordinated . Cp2Zr(OSO2-4-C6H4Cl)2 ( 2 ) and Cp2Zr(OSO2-3,4-C6H3Cl 2)2 ( 3 ) are dimer of pentacoordinated zirconocenes with two monodentate sulfonate and a double bridge of m-O,mu;-O'-sulfonates . A possible explanation for the formation of the solid - state structure is offered in term of difference in electron density of the sulfonate oxygen atom . <nUm> : C22H20O6S2Zr , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , triclinic , P1 , z = <nUm> . <nUm> : C22Cl2H18O6S2Zr , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , triclinic , P1 , z = <nUm> . <nUm> : C22Cl4H16O6S2Zr , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , triclinic , P1 , z = <nUm> . the catalytic activity of Cp2ZrCl2 supported on MgCl2(THF)2 with MAO a a cocatalyst , wa investigated in low - pressure polymerization of ethylene . this catalyst system wa found to be active [ <nUm> kg PE / ( g zr*h ) ] and stable during the polymerization process . the PE obtained ha a narrow molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) ; it molecular weight ( mw ) wa about <nUm> <nUm> . the kinetic investigation of the polymerization process revealed <nUm> % of the zirconium atom to be involved in the formation of catalytic active site . unexpected inactive byproduct were observed in the catalytic polymerization of acetylene using metallocene alkyne complex Cp2M(L)(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) , <nUm> : m = Ti , without L ; <nUm> : m = Zr , L = thf . the reaction of <nUm> wa investigated in detail by NMR to give quantitatively at <nUm> ° C the titanacyclopentadiene Cp2Ti-CH = CH - C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3) ( 3 ) . around <nUm> ° C <nUm> start to rearrange to yield the dihydroindenyl complex <nUm> via coupling of one cp - ligand with the titanacyclopentadiene . In the reaction of <nUm> under analogous condition a zirconacyclopentadiene Cp2Zr-CH = CH - C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3) ( 5 ) and the dimeric complex [ Cp2Zr(C(SiMe3) = CH(SiMe3) ] 2[m-s(1,2)-C ≡ C ] ( 6 ) were observed . whereas <nUm> decomposes to a mixture of unidentified paramagnetic specie , <nUm> wa isolated and investigated by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray analysis . In the reaction of rac-(ebthi)Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) ( ebthi = ethylenbis-tetrahydroindenyl ) with 2-ethynyl-pyridine the complex rac - (ebthi)ZrC(SiMe3) = CH(SiMe3)](s-C ≡ CPy ) <nUm> wa obtained , which wa investigated by an x-ray analysis . In reaction of Cp2ZrCl{(m-H)2BC5H10} , <nUm> , with HLi , cl- is replaced to produce Cp2ZrH{(m-H)2BC5H10} , <nUm> . reaction of <nUm> with K[H2BC5H10] yield Cp2Zr{(m-H)2BC5H10}2 , <nUm> . the methyl-substituted compound Cp2Zr-(CH3{(m-H)2BC5H <nUm> } , <nUm> , is prepared from the reaction of Cp2ZrCl(CH3) with K[H2BC5H10] . the synthetic route for the preparation of <nUm> prevents side reaction that occur in the direct alkylation of zirconocene organohydroborate complex . proton NMR spectrum of <nUm> at elevated temperature indicate that intramolecular hydrogen exchange occurs among Zr-H-B hydrogen , terminal H on Zr , and cp hydrogen . the structure of <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> are reported . crystal data for <nUm> : space group abm2 ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , z = <nUm> . crystal data for <nUm> : space group pbca ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , z = <nUm> . crystal data for <nUm> : space group C2 / c ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> . new type of silacyclobutene derivative were synthesized by zirconocene- and titanocene-ethylene complex - promoted reaction of some rac - dialkynyldiarylsilanes . the norbornene / ethylene copolymerization wa investigated by using me 2SiCp 2MtCl <nUm> ( Mt = Zr , TO / MAO catalyst system . the copolymerization kinetics wa studied under different condition . the copolymer wa characterized by DSC and 13C - NMR method . it wa found the zirconocene ha better catalyst ability for copolymerization of ethylene and norbornene than titanocene . under similar feed ratio , the copolymer with high norbornene content and glass transition temperature were synthesized compared with literature . analysis of the published data on the interaction between the component of a zirconocene-poly(methylaluminoxane) system used a the catalyst of olefin polymerization indicates that the yield of the reaction product , methane , is virtually independent of the concentration of the component over a wide concentration range . it is assumed that methane is formed in the absence of the monomer on the catalytic site of the process formed by the interaction of the major component and the activating admixture , including uncontrollable admixture ( H2O , O ) . under specified condition , it is the admixture that control the concentration of the catalytic center and the methane yield . for this reason , the yield of methane is independent of the concentration of zirconocene and poly(methylaminoxane) . the biphenyl-bridged , chiral zirconocene complex rac-2,2'-biphenyl-bis(3,4-dimethylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride catalyzes the reaction of 1,6-and 1,7-dienes with excess dibutyl magnesium to bi (butyl-magnesio-methyl)-substituted cycloalkane derivative . analogous reaction occur with butyl magnesium chloride and with heteroatom - containing dienes . the preference of 1,6-dienes for trans-fused cyclization product and that of 1,7-dienes for cis-fusion at ambient and for trans-fusion at elevated temperature is similar to that observed before for unsubstituted zirconocene complex . the r-enantiomer of the biphenyl-bridged zirconocene complex give trans-fused cyclization product with an optical purity of only <nUm> ± <nUm> % ee . the stereochemistry of these cyclomagnesation reaction is explained in term of the relative rate of mutually competing cyclization and transmetalation step . the synthesis of the doubly - [SiMe2] - bridged zirconocene complex , (Me2Si)2{e5-C5H 2-4-CHMe2}{e5-C5H-3,5-(CHMe 2)2}ZrR2 ( r = Cl ( 2 ) ; r = CH2Ph ( 3 ) ; r = CH3 ( 4 ) ) are described . the structure of (Me2Si)2{e5-C5H 2-4-CHMe2}{e5-C5H-3,5-(CHMe 2)2}-Zr(CH2Ph)2 ( 3 ) ha been examined by single crystal x-ray diffraction method . it crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-1 , with a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> , β = <nUm> , γ = <nUm> ° and z = <nUm> . compound <nUm> and <nUm> are active stereospecific pre-catalysts for the [Ph3C] [B(C6F5)4] co-catalyzed polymerization of 1-pentene . polymerization reaction at low temperature in liquid monomer produced poly(1-pentene) with syndiotactic microstructure and narrow molecular weight distribution . by contrast , in 1-pentene / toluene solution a broad molecular weight distribution is observed . under all condition examined <nUm> / MAO system produced high molecular weight , highly syndiotactic poly-1-pentene with narrow molecular weight distribution . A reduction of previously reported 2-methoxyethyl and 2-methylthioethyl functionalized zirconocenedichlorides ( e5-C5Me4CH2-CH 2EMe)(e5-C5Me5)ZrCl2 ( e = O , S ) and ( e5-C5Me4CH2CH 2EMe)(e5-C5Me4CH 2CH2E'Me)ZrCl2 ( e = O , S ; E' = O , S ) with Mg / Hg in THF lead unexpectedly to the product of O-Me and S-Me bond cleavage ( e5,s-C5Me4CH2CH 2E)(e5-C5Me5)ZrMe ( e = O , S ) , ( e5,s-C5Me4CH2CH 2E)(e5-C5Me4CH 2CH2E'Me)ZrMe ( e = O , S ; E' = O ) , and ( e5,s-C5Me4CH2CH 2S)2Zr respectively . the crystal structure of ( e5,s-C5Me4CH2CH 2S)2Zr wa established by x-ray analysis . At the same time the reduction of ( e5-C5Me4CH2CH 2EMe)(e5-C5Me5)ZrCl2 ( e = O , S ) under <nUm> atm of CO give either only the usual dicarbonyl derivative ( e5-C5Me4CH2CH 2EMe)(e5-C5Me5)Zr(CO) <nUm> ( e = O ) or a complex mixture of product ( e = S ) . bridged ligand 4,4-di(cyclopentadienyl)-N-methylpiperidine ( 4 ) and 4,4-di(indenyl)-N-methylpiperidine ( 5 ) were prepared by condensation of cyclopentadiene or indene with n-methylpiperidone . dilithium salt 4a and 5a were subsequently transformed into the corresponding ansa - zirconocenes <nUm> and <nUm> . No direct contact Zr ⋯ N wa found in the crystal structure of <nUm> . the attempt to prepare zirconocene <nUm> from distannyl derivative 5b gave an unexpected monoindenyl complex <nUm> comprising one unreacted stannylated indenyl group and having direct coordination of Zr by nitrogen . ethylene-bridged bis(N,N-diisopropyl-1-aminoboratabenzene-4-yl)zirconium dichloride ( 5a ) , dimethylsilyl-bridged bist(N,N-diisopropyl-1-aminoboratabenzene-4-yl)zirconium dichloride ( 7a ) , and dimethylmethylene-bridged (cyclopentadienyl)(N,N-diisopropyl-1-aminoboratabenzene-4-yl)zirconium dichloride ( 6a ) have been prepared . x-ray crystal structure of the dimethyl derivative of <nUm> and <nUm> show that the complex closely resemble the corresponding ansa - zirconocenes . when activated by excess methylaluminoxane , 5a , 6a , and 7a are catalyst for the polymerization of olefin . the tantalum carborane complex (Et2C2B4H4)CpTaMe2 ( 1 ) is thermally stable but undergoes clean photochemical insertion with alkyne to give vinyltantalum specie , in contrast to the thermal reactivity of isoelectronic group <nUm> metallocenes which give methylidene intermediate . certain tantalum vinyltitanium product display NMR resonance indicative of g-agostic Ta-H3C interaction sufficiently strong to stabilize two different regioisomers . decomposition of these specie occurs by apparent alkyne deinsertion and ejection of the tantalum fragment to give R2Et2C4B4H4 ( r = me , et , ph ) carborane cluster . the analogous diphenyl complex (Et2C2B4H4)CpTaPh2 ( 8 ) is thermally reactive , eliminating benzene and undergoing trapping reaction of the derived benzyne intermediate with alkyne . the structure of the resulting metallaindene complex are supported by x-ray crystallography , protonolysis , and spectroscopy . insertion occur with good regioselectivity , controlled by steric and stereoelectronic factor that differ somewhat from those observed for zirconocene and titanocene analogue . reaction of complex <nUm> with excess styrene result in a novel triple - insertion process in which styrene unit are added to both ortho position of an aryl ligand and to the central boron atom of the B3C2 ring . the proposed mechanism ( supported by the use of styrene-d8 and alkylated metallacarborane starting material ) feature two benzyne intermediate , derived from activation of both ortho-CH bond , and one insertion into a putative Ta-B bond . an important hypothesis is that a Ta-C fragment can undergo intramolecular insertion into a carborane B-H bond , a step unknown for cyclopentadienyl C-H bond and one that is potentially relevant to the use of metallacarborane complex a catalyst for olefin polymerization and related process . zirconocene - coupling of ( -C ≡ C10H17O 2CH2C ≡ c-arylene-)n polymer , followed by hydrolysis , provides a convenient , versatile route to soluble , diene-arylene polymer . the alternating copolymerization of styrene ( st ) and ethylene ( et ) with high stereo - regularity were monitored by using rac[isopropylidenebis(benzindenyl)] zirconocene catalyst under reduced temperature condition . the 13C - NMR spectrum of the polymer were measured using a spectrometer . the DSC measurement wa carried out under flowing N at a temperature rate of <nUm> ° C / min . In general , significant result were obtained . we investigated copolymerization of propylene and allylmercaptan a a commercially available sulfur containing monomer . after protection of mercapto group with alkylaluminum , the copolymerization wa conducted by isotactic ansa - zirconocene / methylaluminoxane catalyst . polypropylene containing sulfur wa obtained with triisobutylaluminum - protected allylmercaptan monomer , while the no polymer wa obtained with trimethylaluminum - protected allylmercaptan . structure of the product wa investigated by NMR and GPC , and it wa revealed that end sulfurizated polymer wa mainly produced . the polymerization behavior of three linear asymmetrically substituted dienes , i.e. 6-phenyl-1,5-hexadiene ( A ) , 7-methyl-1,6-octadiene ( B ) and r(+)-5,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene ( isocitronellene , C ) is reported in order to study the effect of substitution at one vinylic group . homopolymerization of these monomer with the catalyst system rac-Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 / MAO resulted in no reaction product in the case of monomer A and in polymer with mw , = <nUm> kg / mol and mw = <nUm> kg / mol with the monomer B and C , respectively . according to NMR analysis , the vinylene end group of isocitronellene remained untouched during polymerization , which excludes the possibility of cyclopolymerization or crosslinking . copolymerization of isocitronellene with propene resulted in incorporation of the diene ( <nUm> mol- % ) equal to the stoichiometric ratio in the monomer feed , with a relatively high catalyst activity . the degree of incorporated isocitronellene is inversely related to the polymerization temperature , providing control over crystallinity ( isotacticity ) and molecular weight of the copolymer . the isocitronellene homo- and copolymer could be epoxidized quantitatively and brominated to an extent of <nUm> % . perfluorohexyl iodide wa grafted onto the isocitronellene / propene copolymer by radical reaction ( conversion <nUm> % ) , yielding a poly(a-olefin) with fluorinated side chain . none two series of solution polymerization of propene were conducted : ( i ) using three different methylaluminoxane (MAO)-activated zirconocenes , rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( EI ) , rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( MI ) , and rac-Me2Si(Benz-[e]-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( MBI ) , at the same temperature ( <nUm> ° C ) and varying propene pressure from <nUm> to <nUm> bar and ( ii ) using rac-Me2Si(Benz-[e]-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( MBI ) at the propene partial pressure <nUm> bar and at a range of temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C ( ind = indenyl ) . 1H and 13C NMR investigation of the unsaturated chain end group in these sample wa performed , with particular attention being paid to ( i ) a detailed re-examination of the NMR assignment reported in the literature , ( ii ) the distinction between unsaturated specie formed during the polymerization reaction and those formed afterward due to thermal treatment ( i.e. during the NMR experiment ) , ( iii ) determination of the dependence of the quantity of different type of terminal on the polymerization condition ( temperature and monomer partial pressure ) . it wa shown that four unsaturated chain end group are formed during polymerization , that is , vinylidene , 2-butenyl , allyl , and the previously unidentified 4-butenyl terminal . In the oligomeric fraction of sample , no further type of unsaturated terminal were observed . two further type of unsaturated group observed , isobutenyl and the unidentified specie x , were not formed during polymerization but , at least prevalently , afterward during the high - temperature NMR experiment . A previously unidentified regiomisinsertion , lateral n-butyl , is also described . proton and 11B NMR investigation of two zirconocene boracycloalkane derivative A and B , a a function of temperature , identified two hydrogen bridged between boron and zirconium and a third attached only to zirconium . observation of the 11B decoupled proton NMR lineshape of A and B ( toluene-d8 solution ) revealed a fast intramolecular mutual exchange of the two bridged hydrogen and a slower process which exchange each of the latter with the single hydrogen bonded to zirconium alone . comparison of the observed 11B decoupled proton NMR spectrum with calculated lineshapes which take account of the exchange process yielded the corresponding rate and activation parameter . proton NMR data for A and B ( with 11B coupled ) indicate spin coupling between 11B and the bridge hydrogen of ca. <nUm> Hz , subject to averaging by 11B nuclear electric quadrupole induced relaxation ; it rate increase with decreasing temperature . thus , the coupling is averaged at the lower temperature due to 11B relaxation and on warming becomes obscured a a result of hydrogen exchange . analysis of these latter lineshapes taking account of exchange dynamic , 11B relaxation and the 11B proton coupling constant provided dynamic parameter closely similar to those obtained from the 11B decoupled proton NMR data . At elevated temperature ( <nUm> ° C ) , broadening of the cp proton resonance indicates that these proton undergo slow exchange with the three hydrido hydrogen . ansa - ligand , me <nUm> Si(RInd) <nUm> [ r = 2-p ( 1 ) and 3-p-tolyl ( 2 ) ] , have been prepared a a mixture of rac- and meso-isomers in a ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> from the reaction of me <nUm> ClSi <nUm> with cyanocuprates of 1-p-tolylindene and 2-p-tolylindene in diethyl ether , respectively . pure rac - isomer , 1r and 2r , have been isolated by fractional recrystallization of <nUm> and <nUm> . thermal diastereomerization of <nUm> and <nUm> between rac- and meso-isomers ha been studied by <nUm> H - NMR spectroscopy . these result imply that <nUm> and <nUm> undergo the diastereomerization process by migration of silicon moiety and hydrogen atom , respectively . ansa - zirconocenes , me <nUm> Si(RInd) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> [ r = 2-p ( 3 ) and 3-p-tolyl ( 4 ) ] , have been prepared from the reaction of the corresponding dilithiated ligand with ClZr <nUm> in diethyl ether and hexane at <nUm> ° C . the molecular structure of rac-3 ha been determined by a single crystal x-ray diffraction study . propylene polymerization ha been studied using rac-3 and meso-4 in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . catalyst rac-3 produce a highly isotactic polypropylene ( PP ) at <nUm> ° C by the enantiomorphic site control mechanism and meso-4 affords a syndiotactic dominant PP having a rr triad of <nUm> % at - <nUm> ° C by the chain end control mechanism . reaction of Cp2Zr(thf)(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ( 1 ) and rac-(ebthi)Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) ( <nUm> ; ebthi = 1,2-ethylene-1,1'-bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl) ) with 2-vinylpyridine lead , under elimination of the alkyne , to the five - membered azazirconacycles , which are best described a 1-zircona-2-azacyclopent-3-enes ( 1-azadiene complex ) . one of these complex couple with ethylene to yield a stable a-2-pyridyl-substituted zirconacyclopentane and reacts in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio with water to yield a b-2-pyridyl-substituted dimeric s-ethylzirconoxane . In the reaction of the 2-derived complex with BF4H , rac-[1,2-ethylene-1,1'-bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl)]zirconium difluoride wa obtained . both 1-zircona-2-azacyclopent-3-enes insert carbon dioxide to give structurally different binuclear carbonate - bridged complex . the organotin compound (e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)tin tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( 1 ) ha been synthesized from a reaction between (pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)tin chloride and lithium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate . this cation proved to be an effective ziegler - natta a-olefin cocatalyst . activity for ethylene polymerization using dimethylzirconocene and <nUm> were <nUm> × <nUm> g of PE / ( mol of 1*[C2H4]*h ) at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> × <nUm> g of PE / ( mol of 1*[C2H4]*h ) at <nUm> ° C . this system wa also effective for the polymerization of propylene . activity using rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)-dimethylzirconium with the tin cation were <nUm> × <nUm> g of PP / ( mol of 1*[C3H6]*h ) . activity increased markedly when using zirconocene dichloride / tri(i-butyl)aluminum / <nUm> . activity for ethylene polymerization using zirconocene dichloride / tri(i-butyl)aluminum / <nUm> at <nUm> ° C were <nUm> × <nUm> g of PE / ( mol of 1*[C2H4]*h ) . activity for the polymerization of propylene using rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride / tri(i-butyl)aluminum / <nUm> at <nUm> ° C were <nUm> × <nUm> g of PP / ( mol of 1*[C3H6]*h ) . A well known catalytic system for the oligomerization of 1-alkenes is zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) , when activated by a large excess of methylalumoxane ( MAO ) . surprisingly , when activated by only <nUm> equiv. of MAO , Cp2ZrCl2 selectively and catalytically dimerizes a-olefins without formation of any higher oligomeric specie . this reaction is shown to be general for a number of a-olefins . the conversion of o-diallylbenzene give a seven - membered cyclic product in an intramolecular dimerization reaction . A possible mechanism for the dimerization process involving a zirconium - hydrido specie a the catalyst is formulated , and evidence for it is given by detection of by - product and a deuteration experiment . equilibrium constant have been determined for the formation of <nUm> different zirconocene monomethyl monochloro complex from the respective dichloride complex and AlC3H9 . the result indicate that the tendency of a particular zirconocene complex to exchange a chloride against a methyl ligand is a measure for the electron deficiency at it Zr center . the result indicate particularly low electron density for complex with indenyl instead of cyclopentadienyl ligand , especially for those containing a dimethylsilyl bridge . only one methyl group is transferred to a zirconocene dichloride even by a large excess of AlC3H9 , while the uptake of two alkyl group , followed by alkane evolution , is observed with triethyl and triisobutyl aluminum . fulvenes ( 1a-e ) derived from condensation of cyclopentadiene with acetone or a variety of aldehyde were treated with Ar2LiP ( Ar = phenyl , p-tolyl ) to yield the respective substituted (diarylphosphinomethyl)cyclopentadienides ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) . subsequent reaction with Cl4Zr (THF)2 gave the respective bi [(diarylphosphinomethyl)cyclopentadienyl] zirconium dichloride ( Ar = phenyl ( 4 ) , p-tolyl ( 5 ) ) . the complex rac-[C5H4-CH(CH3)-PPh2] 2ZrCl2 ( rac-4b ) wa characterized by x-ray diffraction . the reaction of complex 4a and 5a [(Cp-CMe2-PAr2)2ZrCl2] with PdCl2(NCPh)2 or PtCl2(NCPh)2 lead to the formation of the trans-(metallocene-chelate-phosphane)metal complex 6-9 ( e.g. trans-Cl2Pd(Ph2P-CMe2-Cp)2ZrCl <nUm> ] . chloride abstraction from the reaction product of [Cp-CH(CMe3)PPh2]2ZrCl2 with PdCl2(NCPh)2 eventually gave the cationic complex [ meso,trans-(Cp-CH(CMe3)PPh2) 2(Cl)Zr(m-Cl)Pd(Cl)]+ ( 10 ) that wa also characterized by x-ray diffraction . it feature a dimetallabicyclic framework with two Cp-CHR-PPh2 ligand and a chloride bridging between the early and the late transition metal center . this paper is a review concerning metallic derivative linked to the surface of phosphorus - containing dendrimers , that are dendrimers possessing one phosphorus at each branching point . the sythetic aspect will be described first , concerning in particular the complexation of transition metal ( Fe , W , Rh , Pt , Pd , Ru ) by monophosphine or diphosphine end group , the grafting of metallocene derivative ( zirconocene and ferrocene ) , and the interaction with various cluster ( Au-Fe , Au , Ti ) . some application of these metallo phosphorus dendrimers will be described in the field of material science ( modification of the surface of existing material or creation of new material ) , and in the field of catalysis ( stille coupling , knoevenagel condensation , michael addition ) . rotational barrier about the M-S bond of 16-electron bent metallocene monothiolates (e5-C5H5)2Zr(Cl) ( SR ) ( r = -CH3 , -CH2CH3 , -CH(CH3)2 , -C(CH3)3 ) ( 1a-d ) have been measured by dynamic 1H NMR method : <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> kJ mol-1 , respectively . the groundstate orientation about the Zr-S bond of <nUm> that maximizes spp → mdp bonding ( Cl-Zr-S-R ≈ <nUm> ° ) also maximizes cp ↔ r steric interaction , whereas the rotational transition - state orientation ( Cl-Zr-S-R ≈ <nUm> ° ) is one that minimizes spp → mdp bonding and maximizes Cl ↔ r steric interaction . deviation from a ground - state orientation that is ideal for spp → mdp bonding might be expected a the size of the r group and cp ↔ r steric interaction increase . thus , the aberrant trend for the r = -C(CH3)3 derivative could be attributed to a ground - state steric effect where the sterically demanding -C(CH3)3 group force an unfavorable ( misdirected ) orientation for Mdp-Spp bonding , but a favorable orientation with respect to cp ↔ r and Cl ↔ r steric interaction . however , the solid - state structure of (e5-C5H5)2Zr(SR)2 ( r = -CH3 , -CH2CH3 , -CH(CH3)2 , -C(CH3)3 ) ( 2a-d ) exhibit regular variation of their metric parameter a evidenced by their Zr-S-C bond angle of <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> ° and S-Zr-S' bond angle of <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> ° , respectively . neither the S'-Zr-S-R torsion angle nor the dihedral angle that describe the relationship between the S / Zr / S' and cp(centroid) / Zr / cp' ( centroid ) plane ( both indicator of the relative orientation of the Zr dp acceptor orbital and the thiolate S pp donor orbital ) reflect the steric demand of the r group . thus , the size of the r group imposes a measured effect on the geometry of <nUm> and the tert-butyl group is not extraordinary . although the enthalpic and entropic effect could not be deconvoluted for rotation about the Zr-S bond of <nUm> in the present study , literature precedent suggest that both enthalpic and entropic effect may play a role in determining the irregular trend that is observed . intramolecular cocyclisation of 4-azaocta-1,7-dienes , -1-en-7-ynes , -7- en-1-ynes and -1,7-diynes using ' zirconocene ' equivalent affords 3-aza-8- zirconabicyclo[4.3.0]nonanes , -6-enes , -9-enes or -6,9-dienes . protonolysis , iodinolysis , or carbonylation of these complex affords 3,4-disubstitued piperidines . exocyclic 1,3-dienes formed from the coupling / protonolysis of 4- azaocta-1,7-diynes react with activated dienophiles to yield reduced isoquinolines . intramolecular cocyclisation of N-(but-2-enyl)-N-methyl-N-(2-methylbut- 3-ynyl)amine using zirconocene(ethylene) , followed by carbonylation affords a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of (+-)-tecomanine and (+-)-4-epi-tecomanine . none none none { [ 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl ] cyclopentadienyl } titanium trichloride ( CpNTiCl3 , <nUm> ) wa activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) to catalyze polymerization of ethylene ( e ) , propylene ( P ) , ethylidene norbornene ( ENB ) , vinylcyclohexene ( VCH ) , and 1,4-hexadiene ( HD ) . the dependence of homopolymerization activity ( A ) of <nUm> / MAO on olefin concentration ( [M]n ) is n = <nUm> ± <nUm> for e and n = <nUm> ± <nUm> for P . the value of n is <nUm> ± <nUm> for CpTiCl3 / MAO catalysis of ethylene polymerization ; this system doe not polymerize propylene . <nUm> / MAO catalyzes HD polymerization at one - tenth of AH for 1-hexene , probably because of chelation effect in the HD case . the copolymerization of e and P ha reactivity ratio of rE = <nUm> and rP = <nUm> at <nUm> ° C , and rErP = <nUm> , which suggests <nUm> / MAO may be a multisite catalyst . the copolymerization activity of CpTiCl3 / MAO is <nUm> time smaller than that of CpNTiCl3 / MAO . terpolymerization of e / P / ENB ha A of <nUm> g of polymer / ( mol of Ti h ) , incorporates up to <nUm> mol % ( ̃ <nUm> wt % ) of ENB , and high MW 's of <nUm> to <nUm> x <nUm> . all of these parameter are surprisingly insensitive to the ENB concentration . the e / P / VCH terpolymerization ha comparable A value of ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) x <nUm> g / ( mol of Ti h ) . the incorporation of VCH in terpolymer increase with increasing [VCH] . terpolymerization with HD occurs at about one - third of the A of either ENB or VCH ; the product HD - EPDM is low in molecular weight and contains le than <nUm> % of HD . these terpolymerization result are compared with those obtained previously for three zirconocene precursor : rac-ethylenebis(1-e5-inde-nyl) dichlorozirconium ( 6 ) , rac- ( dimethylsilylene ) bi ( 1-e5-indenyl ) dichlorozirconium ( 7 ) , and ethylenebis(9-e5-fluorenyl)dichlorozirconium ( 8 ) . the last compound is a particularly poor terpolymerization catalyst ; it incorporates very little VCH or HD and no ENB at all . <nUm> / MAO is a better catalyst for e / P / VCH terpolymerization , while <nUm> / MAO is superior in e / P / HD terpolymerization . reaction of [ Nb(C5H5)(NC6H3Pri 2-2,6)Cl2 ] 1a and [ Nb(C5Me5)(NC6H3Pri 2-2,6)Cl2 ] 1b with <nUm> and <nUm> equivalent of benzylpotassium respectively gave the niobium benzyl derivative [ Nb(C5H5)(NC6H3Pri 2-2,6)Cl(CH2Ph) ] <nUm> and [ Nb(C5Me5)(NC6H3Pri 2-2,6)(CH2Ph)2 ] <nUm> . treatment of <nUm> with trimethylphosphine afforded the benzylidene complex [ Nb(C5Me5)(NC6H3Pri 2-2,6)(PMe3)( = CHPh ) ] <nUm> . complex 1a reacted with phenylmagnesium chloride in the presence of PMe3 to give [ Nb(C5H5)(NC6H3Pri 2-2,6)Ph2(PMe3) ] <nUm> which upon heating at <nUm> ° C in heptane , convert to the e2-benzyne complex [ Nb(C5H5)(NC6H3Pri 2-2,6)(e2-C6H4)(PMe <nUm> ) ] <nUm> . the niobium (III) complex [ Nb(C5H5)(NC6H4Bu t-2)(PMe3)2 ] 8a and [ Nb(C5Me5)(NC6H3Pri 2-2,6)(PMe3)2 ] 8b were obtained upon magnesium reduction of 1a and 1b respectively in the presence of an excess of PMe3 . they were converted into [ Nb(C5H5)-(NC6H4Bu t-2)(e2-R1C ≡ CR2)(PMe <nUm> ) ( R1 = R2 = ph 9a ; R1 = ph , R2 = H 9b ) and [ Nb(C5Me5)(NC6H3Pri 2-2,6)-(e2-PhC ≡ CPh)(PMe3) ] 9c upon treatment with the appropriate alkyne . the molecular structure of the 2-tert-butylimido complex [ Nb(C5H5)(NC6H4Bu t-2)Cl2 ] <nUm> and 9a have been determined . analysis of the published data on the interaction between the component of a zirconocene-poly(methylaluminoxane) system used a the catalyst of olefin polymerization indicates that the yield of the reaction product , methane , is virtually independent of the concentration of the component over a wide concentration range . it is assumed that methane is formed in the absence of the monomer on the catalytic site of polymerization formed by the interaction of the major component and the activating admixture , including uncontrollable admixture ( H2O , O ) . under specified condition it is the admixture that control the concentration of the catalytic center and the methane yield . for this reason , the yield of methane is independent of the concentration of zirconocene and poly(methylaminoxane) . several luminescent zirconium thiolate complex (e5-C5H5)2Zr(SC6H4R-p)2 , where r = Cl ( 1 ) , me ( 2 ) , OMe ( 3 ) , have been synthesized by the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with HSC6H4R-p in the presence of Et3N . the crystal structure of (e5-C5H5)2Zr(SC6H4Cl-p)2 and [(e5-C5H5)2Zr(SC6H4OMe-p)]2O ( 4 ) , which ha been isolated a a hydrolysis product of (e5-C5H5)2Zr(SC6H4OMe-p)2 , have been determined . complex <nUm> crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21 / a , with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> , and V = <nUm> A3 . the Zr atom is in a distorted tetrahedral coordination environment with the thiolate ligand adopting an " endo(anti) " configuration . the two cp ring have a nearly eclipsed geometry . complex <nUm> crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21 / c , with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> , and V = <nUm> A3 . metallocene catalyst based on some clay mineral give polyethylene with long chain branch . based on the relation between the micro structure of the polyethylene and type of clay mineral , the mechanism for long chain branch formation will be discussed . stereoselective propene insertion reaction of chiral zirconocene specie of the type rac-(EBI)Zr(e2-pyridyl)+ ( EBI = ethylenebis(indenyl) ) containing substituted e2-pyridyl ligand are described . the reaction of rac - (EBI)ZrMe2 with BC18F15 followed by addition of <nUm> equiv of the appropriate pyridine yield [ rac-(EBI)Zr(e2-3-R3-5-R5-6-R 6-pyrid-2-yl)][MeB(C6F5)3] pyridyl complex ( 5a-f ; a , R3 = R5 = H , R6 = me ; b , R3 = R5 = H , R6 = ph ; c , R3 = R5 = R6 = H ; d , R3 = me , R5 = H , R6 = me ; e , R3 = H , R5 = R6 = me ; f , R3 = R5 = me , R6 = H ) . At <nUm> ° C , 5a-f react with propene to yield the 1,2-insertion product [rac-(EBI)Zr{e2(C,N)-CH2CHMe(pyrid-2-yl)}][MeB(C 6F5)3 ] , for which two diastereomers ( <nUm> / 6' ) that differ in the configuration of the metallacycle b-carbon are possible . propene insertion of 5a-f is under kinetic control at <nUm> ° C and is highly stereoselective when the pyridyl ring contains a 6-substituent ( R6 ≠ H ; 6a , de = <nUm> % ; 6b , de > <nUm> % ; 6d , de > <nUm> % ; 6e , de = <nUm> % ) . for these case , the major diastereomer is that in which the metallacycle b-Me group point toward the EBI C6 ring ( configuration S,S,S ( R,R,R ) , where the entry denote the configuration of the EBI bridgehead carbon and the metallacycle b-carbon , respectively ) . the diastereoselectivity is low in case where R6 = H ( 6c' , de = <nUm> % ; 6f , de = <nUm> % ) . propene insertion of 5a-f is reversible at <nUm> ° C , and the kinetic <nUm> / 6' mixture evolve to the thermodynamic mixture at this temperature . 6d isomerizes to a mixture of 6d , gd' , and the 2,1-insertion product [rac-(EBI)Zr{e2(C,N)-CHMeCH2(pyrid-2-yl)}][MeB(C 6F5)3 ] ( 6d' ) at <nUm> ° C . molecular modeling calculation for model rac-(EBI)Zr(e2-pyridyl)(propene)+ specie suggest that steric interaction between the pyridyl R6 substituent and the EBI C6 ring cause a tipping of the pyridyl ligand , which influence the pyridyl / propene steric contact and the facial selectivity of propene binding . the modeling calculation also suggest that the more stable propene adduct diastereomer lead to the kinetic insertion product . the mechanism of chain initiation ( reaction <nUm> ) and chain propagation leading to linear and methyl-branched polymer ( reaction <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ) a well a chain - transfer ( or chain - termination ) reaction including associative displacement ( reaction <nUm> ) b-H elimination ( reaction <nUm> ) , H exchange ( reaction <nUm> ) , and hydrogenolysis ( reaction <nUm> ) of transition - metal - catalyzed ethylene polymerization have been compared for different metal atom in the diimine - M(II) complex ( where m = Ni , Pd , and Pt ) on one hand , and between diimine - M(II) and zirconocene complex on the other . the rate - determining step of reaction <nUm> and <nUm> is the migratory insertion of the olefin into a metal - alkyl bond for both diimine-M(II)- and zirconocene - based catalyst . under the same condition , zirconocenes are slightly more active catalyst than the diimine - Ni (II) complex , with the catalytic activity of the diimine - M(II) complex decreasing a Ni > Pd > Pt . the resting stage of the process is a metal-olefin-alkyl complex , and the larger the stability of the complex , the higher the barrier height for migratory insertion . both chain - propagation reaction , <nUm> and <nUm> , start from the b-agostic intermediate . reaction <nUm> for linear chain growth begin with a barrierless bimolecular reaction of coordination of the next olefin , while reaction <nUm> for branched growth begin a a unimolecular b-hydride-elimination reaction with an activation barrier . higher temperature should increase and higher ethylene pressure should decrease the branching . the barrier height indicate that ( i ) the zirconocenes will produce a higher ratio of linear to methyl-branched polyethylene than the diimine - M(II) and ( ii ) the linear / branched ratio will be larger for the diimine - Ni (II) than it Pd analog . among the chain - termination mechanism studied , the associative - displacement mechanism <nUm> where the coordinating olefin exchange with ethylene from solution is likely to be a preferred one for diimine - M(II) - based process . the C-H activation and H - exchange chain - termination mechanism , which are favorable for zirconocenes , are inefficient for diimine - M(II) . hydrogenolysis is another favorable chain - termination process for both the diimine - M(II) and zirconocene in the presence of gaseous hydrogen . the isothiocyanato complex [ Zr(e5-C5H4Me)2(NCS) <nUm> ] and [ Zr(e5-C5H4tBu) 2(NCS)2 ] have been prepared from the corresponding zirconocene dichloride and KSCN in acetone . analogous reaction with KOCN or CKNSe , led to the formation of the stable dinuclear oxo-bridged complex [ {Zr(e5-C5H5)2(NCO)} 2O ] and [ {Zr(e5-C5H4Me)2(NCSe)} 2O ] , respectively . the molecular srtucture of [ {Zr(e5-C5H5)2(NCO)} 2O ] ha been determined by x-ray diffraction method and consists of two (e5-C5H5)2Zr(NCO) unit linked by an oxo bridge . the Zr-O-Zr bridge [ angle <nUm> ° ] is non linear . the relatively short Zr-O bond length of <nUm> and <nUm> Å support the presence of partial double - bond character . the compound contains N - coordinated cyanato ligand which are almost linear . the anion [ H2B2(m-H)(m-C4H8) 2]- , II , reacts with zirconocene dichloride and with hafnocene dichloride to form (e5-C5H5)2ZrCl{(m-H) 2BC4H8 } , III , and (e5-C5H5)2HfCl{(m-H) 2BC4H8 } , IV , complex , which contain a boracyclopentane ring that is bound to the metal through hydrogen bridge . In these reaction , <nUm> mol of the transannular hydrogen - bridged 10-membered ring compound B2(m-H)2(m-C4H8)2 is also formed . A possible reaction pathway for the formation of these complex is proposed on the basis of time - lapse 11B NMR spectroscopy . the methyl-substituted complex (e5-C5H5)2Zr(CH 3){(m-H)2BC4H8} , V , is prepared from the reaction of III with CH3Li . the molecular structure of III wa reported earlier . the structure of IV and V are reported here . crystal data for IV : space group P21 / n ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> . crystal data for V : space group pbca ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , z = ft . we report on an efficient synthetic route for the preparation of enantiomerically pure ethylene-bridged ansa - zirconocene and -hafnocene complex , bearing different cyclopentadienyl fragment . ring opening of (R)-epoxystyrene ( 1 ) with fluorenyllithium proceeds enantiospecifically and lead to optically pure 2-(9-fluorenyl)-1-(S)-phenylethanol ( 2a ) and 2-(9-fluorenyl)-2-(S)-phenylethanol ( 2b ) in nearly quantitative yield . treatment of <nUm> , the trifluoromethanesulfonate derivative of 2b , with fluorenyl- and indenyllithium result in the formation of 1-(9-fluorenyl)-1-(S)-phenyl-2-(1-indenyl)ethane ( 6a ) and 1,2-bis(9-fluorenyl)-1-(S)-phenylethane ( 6b ) , respectively . reaction of the dilithio salt of 6a with Cl4Zr and of 6b with MOU ( m = Zr , Hf ) affords the formation of the enantiomerically pure complex [ 1-(e5-9-nuorenyl)-1-(fl)-phenyl-2-(e 5-1-(R,S)-indenyl)ethane]ZrCl2 ( 7a = R,R ; 7b = R,S ) and of [1,2-bis(e5-9-fluorenyl)-1-(A)-phenylethane]MCl2 ( 7c , m = Zr ; 7d , m = Hf ) in up to <nUm> % yield . hydrogenation of 7a-d with H / O2Pt give the complex 8a-d , bearing octahydrofluorenyl and tetrahydroindenyl ligand . hydrolysis of 8a,b in basic , aqueous medium lead to the formation of C2 - symmetric m-oxo dimer ( 12a,b ) . the solid - state structure of enantiomerically pure 7b and 8c and of 12b are reported . the kinetics of propylene polymerization using homogeneous Cp2ZrCl2 / methylalumoxane ( MAO ) catalyst have been investigated at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> atm of propylene pressure . the effect of [Al] / [Zr] and [Zr] on the catalyst activity were studied . it wa found that MAO play a critical role in catalyst activation and deactivation . by assuming the coexistence of two dynamic equilibrium between active specie and inactive one which are the product of zirconocene dimerization and zirconocene - MAO complexation , a kinetic model wa proposed . the model could satisfactorily explain most of the experimental result . dimethyltitanocene reacts selectively with a variety of dialkyltartrates with protonolytic cleavage of one of it Ti - CH3 bond to form the respective dinuclear (|Jtartrato)(Cp,TiCH,) , complex <nUm> . dimethylhafnocene reacts quite analogously to give the (|itartrato)(Cp2HfCH3)2 system <nUm> , whereas in the reaction of dimethylzirconocene with the same dialkyltartrates always both zr-methyl linkage are cleaved to yield metallacyclic doubly tartrato-bridged bis(zirconocene) complex . this synthetic organometallic problem wa solved in two way . treatment of Cp,Zr(CH3)Cl with the dialkyltartrate reagent cleanly gave the respective (\atartrato)(Cp,ZrCl)2 complex <nUm> . the enolate complex CpTZr(-O-CMe = CH - ,)CH , reacts with dimethyltartrate selectively with liberation of acetone to cleanly yield the ( ji-dimethyltartrato ) ( Cp^ZrCH , ). , complex 8a . six example of the (|U-tartrato)(Cp.,MX)- , complex were characterized by x-ray crystal structure analysis , namely the compound 3a-3d ( Ti ) , 6d ( HO , and 7d ( Zr ) . A comparison of characteristic structural parameter of the Cp-,M(X)-O-C structural unit point to an increased metal-oxygen ninteraction in the order Ti < Hf < Zr , which may explain the observed different chemical behavior in this series of compound . none the recently reported zwitterionic complex Cp*[e5-C5Me4CH2B(C 6F5)3]ZrC6H5 , <nUm> , reacts rapidly with <nUm> equiv of acetone or acetophenone to form the adduct Cp*[e5-C5Me4CH2B(C 6F5)3]Zr(C6H 5)[O = C(CH3)R ] ( r = CH3 , 2a ; C6H5 , 2b ) in ∼ <nUm> % yield . spectroscopic evidence in favor of this assignment is presented ; the adduct nature of the complex wa also confirmed in each case via an x-ray structural analysis . the ketone ligand are bound in an e1 end-on fashion ( the Zr-O = C angle are near linear at <nUm> ° and <nUm> ° for 2a and 2b , respectively ) , allowing for a p-component to the Zr-O bonding . unlike other fleetingly observed ketone adduct of nonzwitterionic cationic metallocenes , the ketone ligand in compound <nUm> do not undergo insertion into the Zr-C bond neither upon thermolysis nor in the presence of excess ketone . the kinetics of propene polymerization in the liquid monomer medium and the property of the resulting iso-PP were studied in relation to the interannular bridge nature , (CH2)2Ind2ZrCl2 ( I ) , (CH3)2SiInd2ZrCl2 ( II ) , (CH3)2CInd2ZrCl2 ( III ) , and asymmetric (CH3)(cyclo-C3H5)CInd2ZrCl <nUm> ( IV ) , in MAO - activated 1,1'-bridged bisindenyl zirconocene dichloride . data are also given for the non-bridged (2-Ph-C9H6)2ZrCl2 ( V ) system used under similar condition . the system based on zirconocene III are most active and that based on II is most stable . the replacement of one methyl group in the CH2 < bridge by a cyclopropyl group ( compound III and IV ) result in the depressed initial activity and in the greater deactivation of the system during the process of polymerization . the stereoblock polymer wa formed with the catalyst system based on metallocene V , used under similar experimental condition . control of butadiene insertion mode in the copolymerization of propylene with 1,3-butadiene ha not been reported except our previous report <nUm> ) . we reported that dialkylaluminum hydride decreased mole fraction of 1,4-inserted butadiene unit by the hydroalumination of the 1,4-inserted butadiene unit in main chain <nUm> ) . introduction of hydroxy group to the main chain of the copolymer ha been investigated using oxidative treatment of the al-carbon bond . hydroxy group were successfully incorporated into the copolymer . the detail structure of the copolymer will be discussed , <nUm> ) T. ishihara , T. shiono , Macro2noJecuJes2Q03 , <nUm> , <nUm> . <nUm> ) T.Ishihara , T.Shiono , J.

A procedure for supporting syndiospecific zirconocene on OSi <nUm> open up a way of retaining the syndiospecificity of metallocene catalyst . the effect of supporting temperature , time and initial concentration of metallocene on the supported amount of metallocene were investigated . using these supported catalyst for propylene polymerization , it is possible to reduce the consumption of cocatalyst MAO ( methylaluminoxane ) and produce syndiotactic polypropylene in high syndiotacticity . if partial MAO wa replaced by triisobutylaluminium , it would be shown that the catalytic activity of these catalyst increase greatly . electroconductivities of zirconocene complex - derived catalytic system solution were measured to identify the ionic particle generated by the catalyst activator and to follow the ionic specie formed in the absence and presence of olefin . several organoaluminum compound ( OAC ) and polymethylalumoxane ( MAO ) were studied a metallocene activator . the specific electroconductivity of the solution of each metallocene complex examined in solvent varying in polarity , activated both with OAC and MAO , wa always higher than that of the starting reactant . the electroconductivity value and the olefin polymerization rate were found to vary concurrently . the data obtained show that it is possible to trace the ionic particle generated during the formation of active specie and their change in the course of polymerization reaction . metallocene / tetramethylaluminoxane ( MAO ) catalyst control the tacticity and the molecular weight and it distribution in the polymer . zirconocene and hafnocene catalyst copolymerize ethene with cyclic olefin such a norbornene and dimethanooctahydronaphthalene ( DMON ) to yield copolymer with the double bond , rather than the ring , opened to extend the chain . these product are atactic and have interesting property . syndiotactic polystyrene , mp a high a <nUm> ° C , is another class of tailor - made ( titanocene / MAO ) - catalyzed polymer . with the fluorinated ( CpTiF3 ) substituted for the chlorinated ( CpTiCl3 ) titanocenes , the activity rose by a factor of <nUm> - <nUm> . the two type of polymer were studied with numerous metallocenes used a catalyst . nine metallocenes were used to study their activity in the copolymerization of ethylene with cycloolefins . the reactivity of comonomers were established in the ethylene - DMON system catalyzed by zircono- and hafnocenes . titanocenes proved to be much more active than the system involving alkoxy-derivatives Ti(OR)4 [14] . catalytic behavior wa examined in the series of 2- and 1-substituted bisindenyl zirconium and hafnium complex , (2-PhInd)2ZrCl2 , (2-PhInd)2HfCl2 , (2-p-TolInd)2ZrCl2 , (2-p-TolInd)2HfCl2 , (1-MeInd)2ZrCl2 , (1-i-PrInd)2HfCl2 , (1-cyclo-C6H11Ind)2ZrCl2 , (2-n-BuInd)2ZrCl2 , and (2-All-Ind)2ZrCl2 . 2-Ph - substituted zirconocene showed higher activity in ethylene polymerization than did the unsubstituted indenyl complex under similar condition , and provided polyethylene of the higher molecular weight . these catalytic feature suggest the increase in activity to be caused probably by an increase in chain propagation rate . the lower productivity of (2-p-Tol-Ind)2ZrCl2 complex compared to (2-PhInd)2ZrCl2 is attributed to the electron donating effect of the methyl substituent at the phenyl ring suppressing the effect of the aryl substituent . the two hafnium analog showed considerably lower activity a compared with zirconium complex , the feature commonly observed on replacement of zirconium by hafnium . the most pronounced effect of 1-substituents on the metallocene activity wa observed for the 1-Me-and 1-i-Pr - substituted complex . the activity of the complex examined in ethylene polymerization were found to be linearly correlated with the electronic and steric substituent characteristic . the reaction of the new ligand [ 2,6-(CH2C5H4)2C5H 3N]2-Na2+ ( LNa2 ) with Cl4Zr in THF affords in good yield the trigonal - bipyramidal complex LZrCl2 , where the two chlorine atom are not equivalent . when LZrCl2 and RMgCl ( r = CH3 , n-butyl , C4H11Si ) are reacted in <nUm> : <nUm> and <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio , the corresponding complex LZr(Cl)R and LZrR2 can be isolated in good yield . differently from the Cp2Zr(n-Bu)2 , which ha never been isolated due to b-H . elimination , the analogous LZr(n-Bu)2 is thermally stable and it x-ray crystal structure ha been solved , confirming it trigonal - bipyramidal geometry with the alkyl group occupying an equatorial and an axial position . an NMR study ( 1H , 13C , HMQC , NOE ) allowed the complete structural characterization of the complex in solution . polypropene were prepared , both in and without the presence of molecular hydrogen , using the six ansa - zirconocene catalyst rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( I ) , rac-Et(IndH4)2ZrCl2 ( II ) , rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2(III) , rac-Me2Si(2-Me-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( IV ) , rac-Me2Si(Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2(V) , and rac-Me2Si(2-Me-Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2 ( VI ) and also Cp2ZrCl2 ( VII ) [ ind = indenyl ] , under standardized condition ( <nUm> bar partial pressure of propene in toluene solution , at <nUm> ° C , zirconocenes activated by methylaluminoxane ) . the microstructures of the polymer were investigated in detail by using 1H and 13C NMR and GPC , and relationship between catalyst structure and polymer microstructural feature are discussed . hydrogen wa found to activate all of the catalyst to differing degree . trend in hydrogen activation were compared with trend in ( a ) the overall number of n-butyl terminal ( resulting from chain transfer to hydrogen following secondary insertion ) , ( b ) the ratio , in the presence of hydrogen , of chain transfer to hydrogen to the other mechanism which lead to renewed chain growth following secondary insertion , and ( c ) the ratio , in the presence of hydrogen , of site following primary insertion to site following secondary insertion . the absence of any clear correlation under these three heading lead to the conclusion that the release by chain transfer to hydrogen of resting state following secondary monomer insertion can not be the only mechanism giving rise to hydrogen activation with these catalyst . reductive coupling of dimethylfulvene with alkaline earth metal yield inseparable mixture of the tetramethylethylene-bridged complex Me4C2(C5H4)2M and the unbridged metallocene (i-PrCp)2M ( m = Mg , Ca , Sr , Ba ) . In contrast , the reductive coupling of phenylfulvene with activated calcium in THF give nearly quantitative yield of a mixture of cis- and trans-diphenylethanediyl-bridged ansa - calcocenes . the more soluble ci isomer can be removed by recrystallization , yielding the C2 - symmetric trans-Ph2C2H2(e5-C 5H4)2Ca-(THF)2 ( trans-2 ) . the molecular structure of this ansa - calcocene show the cyclopentadienyl ring to be bound in an e5 fashion to the calcium center . this versatile reagent give high yield of C2 - symmetric transition metal ansa - metallocene complex via the facile reaction of trans-2 with metal chloride ( e.g. , Cl2Fe and Cl4Zr ) . the molecular structure of the corresponding anso - zirconocene dichloride complex is described . none organic - inorganic hybrid ( SAV ) supported zirconocene wa synthesized and it catalysis on ethylene polymerization wa examined . the SAV wa synthesized by copolymerization of 4-vinylpyridine with vinyl silica monomer ( SA ) , which wa modified by reacting silica with allyltrimethoxysilane ( APS ) . after treated by MAO , the SAV wa reacted with Cp2ZrCl2 to form organic - inorganic hybrid supported metallocene . the chemical structure and the composition of SA and SAV have been characterized by solid - state <nUm> C - NMR , XPS , and elemental analysis ( EA ) . the SAV supported zirconocene catalyst wa effective in ethylene polymerization at a relatively low MAO level ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) giving higher activity than that supported by O2Si . 1-Phenyl-1,4-pentanedione ( 3 ) is selectively converted to the corresponding fulvene - ketone ( 4 ) by treatment with cyclopentadiene in the presence of pyrrolidine . treatment with lithium dimethylcuprate result in selective CH3 - addition at the fulvene carbon and subsequent ring - closure reaction to give <nUm> , which in the presence of lithium diisopropylamide is rapidly dehydrated to yield the bicyclic fulvene <nUm> . it treatment with amalgamated calcium metal lead to reductive fulvene coupling and formation of the calcocene complex ( 10 ) of the substituted 7,7'-bi(tetrahydroindenyl) ligand . only the respective rac - isomer is obtained . hydrolysis of <nUm> followed by double deprotonation with butyllithium yield the corresponding 7,7'-bi(tetrahydroindenyl) dianion equivalent <nUm> . In tetrahydrofuran , <nUm> is cleaved at the 7,7'-linkage with formation of the " monomeric " disproportionation product 11-Li and 12-Li , and treatment of <nUm> with zirconium tetrachloride in THF lead back to the formation of the fulvene <nUm> . transmetalation to zirconium is , however , cleanly achieved when <nUm> is treated with donor - ligand - free Cl4Zr suspended in toluene . the corresponding diastereomerically pure rac-ansa-zirconocene dichloride <nUm> containing the ansa - bridge a part of the a-fused bi(tetrahydroindenyl) ligand system is obtained under these specific condition . complex <nUm> wa characterized by x-ray diffraction , and the outcome of the preliminary propene polymerization experiment is reported . the synthesis of Cp2ZrH(OSO2R) and Cp2ZrBH4(OSO2R) ( r = me , tBu , C8F17 , ph , p-tolyl , p-C6H4Cl , m-C6H4CF3 , m-C6H4NO2 ( BH4Zr only ) , 3,5-C6H4(CF3)2 ) is described . the hammett constant of the aryl substituents correlate well with the 11B NMR shift in Cp2ZrBH4(OSO2R) ( r = aryl sulfonate ) . hexene insertion into the Zr-H bond of Cp2ZrH(OSO2CF3) ( 1 ) is fast and reversible : reaction of Cp2Zrhexyl(OSO2CF3) with 2-butyne give Cp2ZrCMe = CHMe(OSO2CF3) and 1-hexene . treatment of <nUm> with styrene lead to a kinetically controlled mixture of Cp2ZrCH2CH2Ph(OSO2CF3) and Cp2ZrCHCH3Ph(OSO2CF3) that equilibrates with a first - order rate law . the rate is independent of added styrene . olefin insertion into the Zr-C bond wa not found . the zirconocene - mediated reaction of vinyl epoxides , vinyl acetonides and 2,5-dihydrofurans proceeds via deoxygenation , yielding conjugated dienes . upon irradiation in toluene solution , meso-racemate mixture of Me2Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C5H2)2-ZrCl <nUm> or Me2Si(2-Me-4-phenyl-C5H2)2ZrCl <nUm> react with <nUm> equiv of the dilithium salt of racemic binaphthol quantitatively to the racemic binaphtholate complex . analogous reaction with <nUm> equiv of the R(+) enantiomer of dilithium binaphtholate give a near - quantitative yield of the enantiomerically pure ansa - zirconocene binaphtholate complex . the structure of the racemic binaphtholate complex , Me2Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C5H2) 2Zr(binaphtholate) , and of a monodentate binaphtholate complex with a meso configurated zirconocene moiety , Me2Si(3-tBu-C5H3)2Zr(binaphtholate) chloride , were crystallographically determined . bis(propynyl)zirconocene ( 1b ) reacts with <nUm> molar equiv of trityl tetraphenylborate by a propynyl group transfer to form Ph3CC ≡ C2H3 and Cp2ZrC ≡ CCH3+ . the in-situ-generated (propynyl)zirconocene cation is not stable under the reaction condition but instantaneously reacts with the neutral starting material 1b to form the [ ( m-C ≡ CCH3)(m-CH3C ≡ CC ≡ CCH <nUm> ) - (ZrCp2)2+][BPh4 - ] salt , <nUm> . complex <nUm> wa characterized by an x-ray crystal structure analysis . it contains an unsymmetrically bridging hexadiyne ligand and exhibit a planar-tetracoordinate carbon center that is stabilized by a three - center two - electron interaction with the two adjacent zirconocene moiety . In solution , complex <nUm> exhibit dynamic NMR spectrum that indicate a symmetrizing exchange of the bonding situation between the two end of the m-hexadiyne ligand . the gibbs activation energy of the automerization reaction of <nUm> is DG ‡ ( <nUm> K ) ≈ <nUm> kcal mol-1 . metallocene catalyst leave a well - characterized fingerprint in the polypropene structure . attempt to expand this catalyst - polymer correlation to ethylene-propene copolymer are presented . the 13C nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) are run on <nUm> % solution of the copolymer in o-dichlorobenzene ( <nUm> % d2 ) at <nUm> ° C , with a <nUm> second pulse delay and <nUm> ° pulse . observation show that single ethylene monomer are added to regioregular propylene homopolymers , and a high level of ethylene insertion adjacent to a 2,1-propylene insertion . this mean that high molecular weight C2C3 copolymer can be synthesized with the incorporation of ethylene for each regioregular insertion . none none none the kinetics of propylene polymerization with Et(H4Ind)2ZrCl2 / methylalumoxane ( MAO ) catalyst have been investigated at 0-50 ° C and <nUm> atm of propylene pressure . the effect of polymerization temperature , catalyst concentration , and catalyst / cocatalyst mole ratio on the catalyst activity and on the property of the polypropylene product were studied . by assuming the coexistence of two dynamic equilibrium between catalytically active specie and two inactive specie , which are the product of zirconocene dimerization and excessive zirconocene - MAO complexation , a kinetic model ha been developed . this model could satisfactorily explain most of experimental result . the electronic absorption and luminescence behavior of a number of bis(4-R-1,2-diphenylcyclo-pentadienyl) zirconium dichloride complex (4-R-1,2-Ph2Cp)2ZrCl2[R = H(2) , me(3) , ph(4) ] in anhydrous n-hexane were studied under an atmosphere of nitrogen . the research result showed that the electronic absorption and luminescence behavior of these compound can be tuned by the variation of the substituents on the cyclopentadienyl group . the absorption and emission wavelength of these complex decrease in an order of r = ph > CH3 > H . As a result , complex <nUm> is a blue color emitter , while complex <nUm> is a green color emitter . the isoselective propene polymerization using the supported catalyst O2Si / MAO / Me2Si(2-Me-Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl <nUm> / AlR3 wa investigated and compared with propene polymerization using the corresponding homogeneous catalyst system . the influence of propene concentration , polymerization medium , temperature , comonomer , and external aluminium alkyl on polymerization kinetics and polypropene property such a molecular mass , stereo- and regioselectivity , morphology , and bulk density wa studied . we observed the thermochromism of the deeply colored zirconocene complex of 1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene ( DPBD ) in the solid state . variable - temperature 13C-CP / MAS NMR spectroscopy revealed that a remarkable change of the electronic structure of the DPBD molecule by constructing the complex propagates all over the carbon site and that the distortion of the electronic structure of the complex becomes continuously large a temperature is decreased . this phenomenon is closely related to the thermochromism . the mechanism of the temperature variation of the electronic structure of the complex wa attributed to the dynamic of phenyl ring and cyclopentadienyl ring of the complex . fast rotation of the cyclopentadienyl ring around it fivefold axis with the extremely small activation energy of <nUm> meV ( = <nUm> kJ / mol ) and <nUm> ° flip rotation of the phenyl ring about the C-C bond with the activation energy of <nUm> meV ( = <nUm> kJ / mol ) were recognized by the measurement of the spin - lattice relaxation rate of proton NMR . semiempirical ZINDO molecular orbital calculation revealed that the deep color of the complex originates in the HOMO-LUMO and HOMO-LUMO+1 transition . these molecular orbitals are sensitive to the orientation of the p-orbital of cyclopentadienyl ring , suggesting that the dynamic perturbation is operative for the transition energy . recently , the preparation of the first siloxy substituted bis(indenyl) ansa - zirconocene , [ethylenebis(2-(tert-butyldimethylsiloxy)indenyl)]zirconium dichloride and it preliminary application in polymerization of propylene and ethylene ha been reported . currently , the structure / property relationship of siloxy substituted metallocenes are being investigated . the polymerization behavior of several complex is being addressed . this article show some selected result and summarizes the present status of research . copolymerization of ethylene / propylene and ethylene / 1-butene with two zirconocene / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) catalyst system were investigated . the influence of et bridge between two indenyl group on the catalyst performance and the property of copolymer obtained had been discussed . it wa found that the activity of bridged et (Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst wa higher than that of nonbridged (Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst . the copolymer ( e / P and e / <nUm> - B ) produced with et (Ind)2ZrCl2 had higher comonomer content , lower molecular weight , density and melting point compared with those produced with (Ind)2ZrG2 . azaphosphazirconaindan system ( RCp ) <nUm> ZrN(R <nUm> )P(NR <nUm> r <nUm> )(oC <nUm> H <nUm> ) 4a ( r = H ) and 5a,b ( r = < -Bu ) are easily synthesized in a regiospecific way via a zirconocene-benzyne intermediate by mean of thermolysis of cp <nUm> ZrMePh <nUm> or ( f-BuCp ) <nUm> ZrPh <nUm> <nUm> in the presence of phosphaimines r <nUm> N = P-NR <nUm> r <nUm> ( 3a : r <nUm> = r <nUm> = r <nUm> = SiMe <nUm> ; 3b : r <nUm> = r <nUm> = t-Eu , r <nUm> = SiMea ) . after selective reaction of elemental sulfur on the phosphorus atom , Zr-N and Zr-C bond cleavage occurs on treatment with methanol , affording phosphine sulfide PhP(S)(NHR <nUm> )(NHR <nUm> ) 8a,b . In these two reaction , complex ( < -BuCp ) <nUm> ZrN(R <nUm> )P(S)(NIIR <nUm> )(o-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) 7a,b resulting from a selective cleavage of one N-SiMe <nUm> bond linked by the phosphorus atom can be isolated . with selenium powder , similar behavior lead to complex ( ( -BuCp ) <nUm> ZrN(R <nUm> )P(Se)(NHR <nUm> )(o-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) 10a,b . living ring - opening polymerization of the cyclic carbonate 1,3-dioxepan-2-one wa achieved by using the cationic zirconocene complex [Cp2ZrMe]+[B(C6F5)4] - a catalyst at room temperature . A linear relation between conversion and molecular weight of the obtained polymer wa observed . furthermore , block copolymerization of the cyclic carbonate and e-caprolactone wa successfully performed . this study develops scoping estimate of the required capital investment and manufacturing cost to make a zirconocene catalyst / cocatalyst system [(F6-acen)Zr(CH2C-Me3)(NMe2Ph)][B(C6F5) <nUm> ] immobilized on a specialized silica support . the cost for this fluorine - based system are compared with corresponding estimate for two other metallocene catalyst using methylaluminoxane (MAO)-based cocatalysts . including the weight of the support and cocatalyst , each of the production facility for making the three zirconocene catalyst system is sized in the range of <nUm> to <nUm> tonne per year . the cost to make the F - based catalyst system is estimated to be $ <nUm> / kg , assuming a <nUm> % return on capital invested . by comparison , the cost for the two MAO - based catalyst system fall in the range of $ <nUm> / kg to $ <nUm> / kg , assuming the same return . within the +/- <nUm> % accuracy of these estimate , these difference are not significant . given a catalyst productivity of <nUm> kg of resin per gram of zirconocene , the cost contribution in the finished ethylene-propylene copolymer resin is <nUm> cent / kg , excluding cost for selling , administration , and research . the ansa - zirconocene derivative tetramethyldisiloxandiyl bis(1-indenyl) zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) ha been prepared by the reaction of the dilithium salt of 1,3-bis(1-indenyl) tetramethyldisiloxane with Cl4Zr · 2THF . after catalytic hydrogenation , the corresponding tetrahydroindenyl complex ( 2 ) ha been formed . both <nUm> and <nUm> have been shown by 1H NMR spectrum to be the mixture of the cis(meso) and trans(rac) isomer . the pure trans isomer 1t , 2c and ci isomer 2c were obtained by recrystallization . the crystal structure of 1t and 2c were determined by x-ray diffraction . both crystal of 1t and 2c are monoclinics , belonging to space group P21 / n(1t) and P21 / c(2c) . In the unit cell of 2c , one of the six - membered ring of the tetrahydroindenyl ligand ha two different conformation which have the same probability . none the catalytic dehydrocoupling of bis(1-sila-3-butyl)benzene , <nUm> by Cp2ZrCl2 / Red-Al and Cp2ZrCl2 / n-BuLi combination catalyst yielded a mixture of oily and solid polymer . while the catalytic dehydrocoupling of 2-phenyl-1,3-disilapropane , <nUm> by Cp2ZrCl2 / n-BuLi combination catalyst produced a mixture of oily and solid polymer , the catalytic redistribution / dehydrocoupling of <nUm> by Cp2ZrCl2 / Red-Al combination catalyst gave oily polymer . the dehydrocoupling of <nUm> and <nUm> , unless the prior silane redistribution occurs , seems to initially produce a low-molecular-weight polymer , which then undergoes an extensive cross-linking reaction of backbone Si-H bond , leading to an insoluble polymer . A new dialkylzirconocene type of complex , (1,2-ph2-4-MeCp)2ZrMe2(2) , wa synthesized by reaction of (1,2-Ph2-4-MeCp)2ZrCl2(1) and with <nUm> equivalent of methyl lithium at <nUm> ° C . complex <nUm> wa characterized by elemental analysis , 1H NMR and 13C NMR . the structure of complex <nUm> wa determined by single crystal x-ray structural analysis . upon activation with Al(iBu)3 / Ph3C+ BC24F20 - , complex <nUm> showed a high catalytic activity for the ethylene polymerization reaction at lower n(Al) / n(Zr) ratio and high molecular weight polyethylene sample with high melting transition temperature were produced . the polyethylene sample were characterized by molecular weight determination , DSC and XRD analysis . reaction of zirconocene dichloride Cp2ZrCl2 with aromatic polymer bearing a-diketone and a-hydroxyketone fragment wa studied . using reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with benzil and benzoin , which model a-diketone and a-hydroxyketone fragment , it wa shown that zirconocene dichloride reacts only with hydroxyketone group of the polymer through both reaction with OH group and coordination of Zn to the keto group . the prepared polymer are rather stable and can show promise a catalyst for a number of organic reaction . In this article the recent progress of the application of chiral titanium and zirconium complex in asymmetric synthesis , particularly chiral ansa - titanocene and zirconocene in asymmetric synthesis , ha been reviewed . the feature and future perspective of these catalyst have been reviewed . an investigation ha been undertaken by use of ESCA in the characterization of the central metal(Zr) of dichlorozirconocene / methylaluminoxane homogeneous olefin polymerization catalyst . the change of electron density shown by a shift in ESCA signal ( <nUm> <nUm> eV ) indicates that the catalytic specie are " cation - like " . within the range of detecting sensitivity of ESCA spectrometer , only a part of the new catalytic derivative wa formed . the influence of complexion time and Al : Zr ratio on the formation of the catalytic zirconocene cation ha also been investigated . none the copolymerization of propene and octene-1 using rac - Et(Ind) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> / MAO catalyst ha been investigated . result show that with increasing the concentration of octene-1 in the system , the catalytic activity increased first and then decreased , the incorporation rate of octene-1 increased , and in consequence , m η , T m , crystallinity of copolymer decreased . the monomer composition and sequence distribution of the copolymer were determined by IR and <nUm> C - NMR . with a new trisiloxane - bridged dinuclear zirconocene , hexamethyltrisiloxanediylbis ( cyclopentadienylindenylzirconium dichloride ) ( TSDZ ) Cl2IndZr-CpSi(CH3)2-O-Si-(CH3) 2-O-Si(CH3)2 cp - ZrIndCl2 , the polymerization of ethylene were carried out in the presence of modified MAO ( MMAO ) a a cocatalyst . the effect of MMAO amount and polymerization temperature ( tp ) on polymerization behaviour of TSDZ were examined and compared with those of mononuclear zirconocenes such a cyclopentadienylindenylzirconium dichloride , biscyclopentadienylzirconium dichloride and bisindenylzirconium dichloride . the catalytic activity of TSDZ wa comparable to that of mononuclear zirconocenes , while the weight - average molecular weight ( mk ) and polydispersity index ( MJMk ) of polyethylene ( PE ) prepared with the former were much higher than those of PE with the latter . with increasing MMAO concentration , the catalytic activity increased but mk decreased for TSDZ , a well a mononuclear zirconocenes . with increasing tr the catalytic activity of TSDZ wa a maximum at <nUm> ° C while that of mononuclear zirconocenes increased steadily . for increased tr the decrease of mk and MJMk for TSDZ wa extraordinary compared to that for mononuclear zirconocenes . copolymer of ethylene and 1-octene , 1-tetradecene and 1-octadecene were synthetized in order to study the effect of the comonomer chain length and amount on density , melting temperature and heat of fusion . they were also compared with the property of the copolymer obtained with the heterogeneous titanium catalyst . it could be seen that the density / melting -area of the copolymer obtained with the zirconocene catalyst wa much broader than with the titanium catalyst . it could also be seen that with the same comonomer content 1-tetradecene gave lower density of the copolymer than 1-octene . however , no difference were seen between the density of the copolymer obtained with 1-tetradecene and 1-octadecene . the melting temperature of the copolymer wa seen to be the lower the longer the comonomer wa . In the area of the high branching amount the linear correlation wa not in work . it wa also shown that the difference in the heat of fusion could only be seen at high amount of branch ( > <nUm> branch / 1000C ) : the longer the comonomer the lower amount of heat wa needed to melt the copolymer . the substituted silastannatetrahydro-s-indacenes meso-Me2Si(t-BuC5H3)2SnMe <nUm> , meso-Me2-Si(Me2C5H2) 2SnMe2 , and meso-Me2Si(Me-i-PrC5H2)2SnMe <nUm> , prepared from the corresponding silanediyl-bridged dicyclopentadienide dilithium salt by reaction with Me2SnCl2 , were structurally characterized by x-ray diffraction and by 1H - NMR in solution . these cyclic stannanediyl compound react with Cl4Zr to give selectively the meso diastereomers of the ansa - zirconocene complex Me2Si(3-t-BuC5H3)2ZrCl2 , Me2Si(2,4-Me2C5H2) 2ZrCl2 , and Me2Si(2-Me-4-i-PrC5H2)2ZrCl <nUm> , respectively . reaction of Me2Si(2-Me-4-t-BuC5H2-Li +)2 with me2 Cl2Sn give , instead of Me2Si(Me-t-BuC5H2)2SnMe2 , the distannyl derivative Me2Si(2-Me-4-t-BuC5H2-1-SnMe 2Cl)2 . this compound reacts with Cl4Zr to give a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of the rac and meso isomer of Me2Si(2-Me-4-t-BuC5H2)2ZrCl <nUm> . ring - opened , racemic distannyl compound are formed also from meso-Me2Si(t-BuC5H3)2SnMe <nUm> , meso-Me2Si(Me2C5H2) 2SnMe2 , and meso-Me2Si(Me-i-PrC5H2)2SnMe <nUm> with excess Me2SnCl2 . competition between Me2SnCl2 and Zr center for reaction with stannylcyclopentadiene unit appears to limit the overall stereoselectivity of the ansa - zirconocene complex formation . the method developed by erker for the preparation of " dibornacyclopentadiene " <nUm> ha been generalized to encompass two related cyclopentadienes flanked by bridged bicyclic subunit derived from (1R)-(+)-verbenone ( 4 ) . whereas lithium dimethylcuprate addition to <nUm> lead to 5a , reaction with diisobutylaluminum hydride and methylcopper affords the le substituted analog 5b . both saturated ketone undergo the shapiro reaction and subsequent in situ condensation with ethyl formate to deliver the dienols 7a,b , respectively . the dehydrative cyclization of these intemediates proved to be more difficult to accomplish than in the earlier work involving <nUm> . exposure of 7a to camphorsulfonic acid in benzene at <nUm> ° C give rise to <nUm> in <nUm> % yield . these condition proved much too harsh for 7b , which however undergoes ring closure to give <nUm> ( <nUm> % ) with iodine in ether . following deprotonation , <nUm> can be silylated to give <nUm> , but neither the lithium cyclopentadienide nor the silane can be coaxed into forming a variety of titanocene or zirconocene complex . these reactant must consequently be more sterically crowded than <nUm> , which doe react with MCl4 ( erker ) and CpTiCl3 ( this work ) . remarkably , hydrocarbon <nUm> completely resists deprotonation , a direct reflection of the extreme nonbonded congestion in the vicinity of it sp3 - bound cyclopentadienyl proton . when polymerization of propene wa conducted using the C2 - symmetrical zirconocenes racEt(2,4,7-Me3Ind)2ZrCl2 ( I ) and rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( II ) combined with Ph3CB(C6F5)4 , the isotacticity ( [mmmm] ) and the melting point ( Tm ) of the produced polymer markedly increased , along with a decrease of the polymerization temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C . thus , isotactic polypropene ( iPP ) with Tm = <nUm> ° C wa obtained from the polymerization with catalyst I at <nUm> ° C , whereas the [mmmm] and Tm of iPP were almost unchanged in the same temperature range when the C1 - symmetrical zirconocene iPr(3-tBuCp)(3-tBuInd)ZrCl2 ( III or III' ) wa employed . additive effect of dialkylaluminum hydride on propylene-1,3-butadiene copolymerization were investigated with an isospecific zirconocene catalyst , rac-dimethylsilylbis(2-methyl-4-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 4Ph ) , activated by modified methylaluminoxane . dialkylaluminum hydride improved the apparent selectivity for 1,2-insertion of 1,3-butadiene to give a pendant vinyl group . 13C NMR analysis of the copolymer indicated that the dialkylaluminum hydride converted the 1,4-inserted butadiene unit in the copolymer to tetramethylene unit after methanolysis . the novel zirconocene complex [Cp'2Zr(m-H)(SiHR)]22+[BR' n(C6F5)4-n]22- ( cp' = cp , MeCp , Me5Cp ; r = ph or PhCH2 ; R' = bu or H ) were isolated from silane dehydropolymerization reaction mixture catalyzed by Cp'2ZrCl2 / 2BuLi / BC6F5 <nUm> or by [Cp'Zr(m-H)H]2 / 2B(C6F5)3 combination catalyst . A total structure analysis of these compound , performed by multinuclear , multidimensional NMR spectroscopy , show that each zirconocene fragment bear a positive charge , which is delocalized between the metal center and hydrosilane ligand . reaction of zirconocene dichloride Cp2ZrCl2 with aromatic polymer bearing a-diketone and a-hydroxyketone fragment wa studied . using reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with benzil and benzoin , which model a-diketone and a-hydroxyketone fragment , it wa shown that zirconocene dichloride reacts only with hydroxyketone group of the polymer through both reaction with OH group and coordination of Zr to the keto group . the prepared polymer are rather stable and show promise a catalyst for a number of organic reaction . the (C5H5-nMen)2Zr[e 2-C2(SiMe3)2 ] ( n = 2-5 ; 1,3-dimethyl , 1,2,3-trimethyl ) ( 2C-F ) complex were prepared by the reduction of corresponding zirconocene dichloride with magnesium in THF in the presence of bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene ( BTMSA ) . all of them are stable in the absence of THF . crystal structure of (C5HMe4)2Zr[e2-C 2(SiMe3)2 ] ( 2E ) and (C5Me5)2Zr[e2-C 2(SiMe3)2 ] ( 2F ) and of the analogous titanium complex are isomorphous . the red shift of the v(C ≡ C ) vibration and the downfield shift of 13C d(C ≡ C ) indicate that BTMSA in 2C-F is more strongly coordinated than in analogous titanocene complex . the nonisolated complex (C5H4Me)2Zr[e2-C 2(SiMe3)2](THF) ( 2B*THF ) rearranges after the loss of THF to give the dimer [ (e5-C5H4Me)(e1-C(SiMe <nUm> ) = CH(SiMe3)Zr(m-e1:e 5-C5H3Me)]2 ( 3B ) . the reduction of rac - (EBTHI)ZrCl2 [ EBTHI = 1,2-ethylene-1,1'-bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl) ] with equimolar amount of magnesium in the presence of Me3SiC2SiMe3 in THF at room temperature gave the first zirconocene - alkyne complex containing no additional ligand , rac-(EBTHI)Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) , <nUm> . with pyridine and (S)-(-)-nicotine complex <nUm> gave the ligand - containing complex rac-(EBTHI)Zr(L)(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ( L = pyridine , <nUm> ; L = (S)-(-)-nicotine , <nUm> ) . In the reaction of <nUm> with acetone the insertion product rac-(EBTHI)-(ZrOCMe2C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3) , <nUm> , wa formed . complex <nUm> reacted with <nUm> equiv of PhN = CHPh with substitution of the alkyne to form rac - (EBTHI)ZrNPhCHPhCHPhNPh , <nUm> . compound <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by an x-ray structure analysis . complex were prepared in which one of the 2-phenylindenyl ligand wa substituted with cyclopentadienyl type ligand , (cyclopentadienyl)(2-phenyl-indenyl)zirconium dichloride , Cp(2PhInd)ZrCl2 and Cp*(2PhInd)ZrCl2 and studied their behavior in propylene polymerization . the substitution of one of the 2-phenylindenyl ligand with a cp ligand resulted in a fourfold increase in productivity . typical productivity observed for Cp2ZrCl2 type complex were lower . the molecular weight of polypropylene prepared with complex <nUm> wa higher . upon substitution of 2-phenylindene with cp , the ability of the catalyst to generate elastomeric polypropylene is lost . catalytic system based on zirconocenes can produce polymer with an overall amount of regioirregular placement a high a 2-3 % . the higher regiospecifities of titanocene based , with respect to zirconocene based , catalytic system ha been accounted for by the large contribution of the non-bonded interaction , in favor of the monomer coordination suitable for the primary insertion when shorter Mt-C distance are involved . azametallacyclobutene Cp2ZrN-t-BuCEt = CEt ( 1 ) underwent an insertion reaction with CO to form the acyl complex <nUm> ( Cp2Zr(N-t-BuCEtCEtCO) , <nUm> % yield ) . the addition of acetone to azametallacyclobutene <nUm> ( Cp2Zr(NArCMeCPh) , Ar = 2,6-dimethylphenyl ) yielded the N - bonded enamine and O - bonded enolate complex of zirconocene <nUm> ( Cp2Zr(NArCMeCPhH)(OCMeCH2) , <nUm> % yield ) . the addition of aldehyde RCOH to metallacycle <nUm> resulted in the insertion of the aldehyde into the Zr-C bond to form complex Cp2Zr(NArCMeCPhCRHO) ( 8a ) and Cp2Zr(NArCMeCPhC(i-Pr)HO ( 9 ) in <nUm> % ( r = ph ) and <nUm> % yield , respectively . similarly , treatment of metallacycle <nUm> ( Cp2Zr-(NArCEtCEt) ) with benzaldehyde yielded the insertion product <nUm> ( Cp2Zr(NArCEtCEtCPhHO) ) in <nUm> % isolated yield . the structure of complex <nUm> wa confirmed by an x-ray crystallographic study . heating the insertion product 8a and <nUm> led to elimination of the a,b-unsaturated imines <nUm> and 14a ( ArN = CMeCPh = CRH ) in <nUm> % and <nUm> % yield , respectively , and the formation of oxozirconocene oligomer (Cp2ZrO)n . the oxozirconocene monomer wa trapped by dimethylzirconocene , preventing the formation of oligomer and resulting in the isolation of product <nUm> . A kinetic study of this retrocycloaddition produced the following activation parameter : DH ‡ = <nUm> kcal / mol , DS ‡ = <nUm> eu . A hammett slr study showed that electron - donating group α to the metallacycle oxygen accelerate the retrocycloaddition ( ρ = <nUm> ) . the preparation and crystal structure of the first group <nUm> ansa - metallocene with an oxygen atom directly bonded to the 2-position of an e5-indenyl moiety , rac-[ethylenebis(2-(tert-butyldimethylsiloxy)indenyl)]zirconium dichloride ( 3 ) , is reported . In combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , complex <nUm> polymerizes propylene to highly isotactic crystalline polypropylene ( Tm = <nUm> ° C ; mw = <nUm> <nUm> ; mw / Mn = <nUm> ) . under similar condition , the propylene polymerization activity of <nUm> / MAO exceeds that of the conventional ansa - metallocene catalyst system (dimethylsilyl)bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 4 ) / MAO by a factor of <nUm> ( <nUm> v <nUm> kg of PP / mol of Zr / h ; tp = <nUm> ° C ; C3H6P = <nUm> bar ; [Al] : [Zr] = <nUm> <nUm> : <nUm> ) . complex <nUm> crystallizes in the unusual indenyl-backward conformation . the molecular structure is consistent with the expected C2 symmetry . In reaction .of the zirconocene derivative Cp2ZrC(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3)(THF) with ketone and aldehyde the influence of the various substituents of the carbonyl compound upon the formation of different product wa investigated . formaldehyde reacts by an insertion of the carbonyl unit into a Zr-C bond to give a metallacycle which is additionally stabilized by the formation of a coordination dimer [ Cp2ZrOCH2C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3) ] <nUm> ( 1 ) . benzaldehyde yield a monomeric metallacycle Cp2ZrOCHPhC(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3) ( 2 ) . complex <nUm> is le stable than <nUm> , and at higher temperature it loses half of it moiety Me3SiC2SiMe3 , leaving { [ Cp2ZrOCHPhC(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3)][Cp 2Zr(e2-O = CHPh ) ] } ( 3 ) . benzophenone give no insertion , and the monomeric e2-ketone complex Cp2Zr(THF)(e2-O = CPh2 ) ( 4 ) wa obtained . low molecular weight ( ca. <nUm> ) ethylene-1-butene copolymer were synthesized at <nUm> ° C using rac-(dimethylsilyl)bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( II ) catalyst and methyl-aluminoxane ( MAO ) cocatalyst . comonomer composition , triad sequence distribution , and end group were analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR . the average polymer molecule contains about one double bond and one saturated end group . the unsaturated end group were formed almost exclusively by transfer from propagating chain containing 1-butene a the terminal unit . At least <nUm> % of the unsaturated end group are vinylidene and trisubstituted double bond , which are present in the approximate ratio <nUm> : <nUm> . saturated end group result from the initiation process . both ethylene and 1-butene are involved in initiation , but ethylene more than 1-butene . the product is a random copolymer with very short block ( no longer than 2-3 monomer unit ) of both ethylene and 1-butene . the comonomer sequence distribution determined by 13C NMR were fitted to first - order markovian statistic , which allowed calculation of the monomer reactivity ratio . the result are discussed in term of a reaction mechanism consisting of initiation , propagation , and chain transfer reaction . In the present study , the linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) / OZr <nUm> nanocomposites were synthesized via in-situ polymerization with rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst . first , the nano-ZrO <nUm> filler wa impregnated with the desired amount of MAO . then , copolymerization of ethylene / 1-octene wa performed in the presence of nanoZrO2 / MAO filler to produce the LLDPE / O2Zr nanocomposites . the amount of nanoZrO2 filler employed were varied at <nUm> and <nUm> g corresponding to [Al]MAO / [Zr] ratio = <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . it can be observed that the polymer yield increased with increasing the ratio of [Al]MAO / [Zr] . however , the observed polymer yield were much lower ( about 5-30 time ) compared to the yield with no filler addition . the filler content in polymer were in the range of 23-25 wt % . the characteristic of LLDPE / O2Zr nanocomposites obtained were determined by mean of DSC , SEM / EDX , TEM , 13C NMR , and XPS . it wa observed that the LLDPE / O2Zr nanocmposites exhibited slightly lower melting temperature ( Tm ) and crystallization temperature ( Tc ) . SEM micrographs demonstrate the homogeneous matrix of the sample . In addition , with EDX mapping technique , it wa also revealed that the nano-ZrO2 filler wa well distributed over the polymer matrix . based on the TEM result , it wa also revealed that the smaller and more uniform particle can be observed after polymerization . these observation suggested that the fragmentation of nano-ZrO2 particle or segregation of the secondary particle could occur resulting in good dispersion of the particle . the distribution of comonomer wa studied by 13C NMR . it wa shown to be random a seen in the similar catalytic system without filler addition . the binding energy ( BE ) for C 1 obtained from XPS to be <nUm> eV indicating no significant change in the polymer microstructure with the addition of nano-ZrO2 filler . none isotatic polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) , t-buyl acrylate and 2-ethyl hexyl acrylate in both toluene and CH 2Cl <nUm> with an ansa-zirconocenedimethyl were investigated using bis(4-methyl-2,6-dibutyl phenoxyl ) methyl aluminum a the activator . the result indicate that polymer with high molecular weight were produced in high yield . none none none 91Zr NMR chemical shift and line width ( du1 / <nUm> ) are reported for a number of ring - bridged and ring - substituted zirconocene dichloride , dibromide , and dimethyl complex . ab initio computation at the SCF level employing basis set of moderate size suggest that the magnitude of the electric field gradient ( EFG ) at the Zr atom dominates du1 / <nUm> when the substituents x at Zr are varied ( x = Br , Cl , me ) . substituents at the cyclopentadiene ( cp ) ring affect the computed EFGs much le ; in these case , the line width du1 / <nUm> are governed by the molecular correlation time tc , which were obtained for several zirconocene dichloride from T1(13C) measurement . experimental trend in d(91Zr) of zirconocenes are well reproduced computationally with the IGLO ( individual gauge for localized orbitals ) or GIAO ( gauge including atomic orbitals ) SCF method employing large basis set . model calculation suggest that d(91Zr) , a well a the EFG , are quite sensitive to the inclination and twist angle of the cp ring and , to a lesser extent , to the CpZrCp' angle . A substantial deshielding , d(91Zr) ca. <nUm> ppm , is predicted for (C5H5)2ZrMe+ , presumably the active olefin - polymerizing catalyst . the first high molecular weight polystannanes , H(SnR2)nH ( r = nBu , nHex , nOct ) , result from dehydropolymerization of secondary stannanes R2SnH2 by zirconocene catalyst . good catalyst include zirconocenes based on both CpCp*Zr ( cp* = e5-C5Me5 ) and Cp2Zr fragment , and the most active catalyst with respect to production of high molecular weight polystannanes wa Me2C(e5-C5H4) 2Zr[Si(SiMe3)3]Me . the latter catalyst produced H(SnnBu2)nH chain ( mw / Mn = <nUm> <nUm> / <nUm> <nUm> ) that were contaminated by ca. <nUm> % ( by weight ) low molecular weight cyclic oligomers . lower molecular weight resulted from dehydropolymerizations of Me2SnH2 , PhMeSnH2 , and Ph2SnH2 . At room temperature , H(SnR2)nH ( r = alkyl group ) polystannanes have lmax value at ca. 380-400 nm , attributed to s-s* transition . thermal gravimetric analysis on the polystannanes reveal that these polymer are a thermally stable a related poly(dialkylsilane)s and have onset temperature for thermal decomposition in the range 200-270 ° C , under both nitrogen and air . the H(SnnBu2)nH polymer ha been shown to be a good precursor to O2Sn , a shown by bulk pyrolysis in air ( ceramic yield : <nUm> % ) . preliminary result also indicate that these polymer may be useful a precursor to elemental tin . the polystannanes are photosensitive , and their photobleaching behavior ha been characterized by UV - vi spectrometry and 119Sn NMR spectroscopy , which demonstrated that H(SnnBu2)nH is photochemically depolymerized to a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of cyclo-(SnnBu2)5 and cyclo-(SnnBu2)6 . the polymer H(SnnHex2)nH and H(SnnOct2)nH exhibit thermochromic behavior which is visibly evident a a discoloration from yellow to colorless upon warming above room temperature . this reversible behavior is associated with an abrupt change in lmax ( e.g. , from <nUm> to <nUm> nm for film of H(SnnOct2)nH ) and a phase change at ca. <nUm> ° C ( by differential scanning calorimetry ) . thin film of H(SnnBu2)nH and H(SnnOct2)nH on glass slide were doped by exposure to F5Sb vapor to conductivity of 10-2 and <nUm> S cm-1 , respectively . preliminary experiment suggest that the dehydropolymerization occurs by a s-bond metathesis mechanism involving four - center transition state . A previous report on production of high molecular weight poly(dibutylstannane) by the reductive coupling of nBu2SnCl2 by Na / 15-crown-5 wa reinvestigated and found to produce only low molecular weight material with mw / Mn = <nUm> / <nUm> . the rate enhancement effect on comonomer addition and the synergistic effect on 1-butene addition were studied in the co- and terpolymerization of ethylene with long chain 1-olefins using zirconium based metallocenes . with the Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst , the rate enhancement effect wa evident only when the polyethylene wa insoluble in the reaction medium . when the product wa soluble , there wa a rate decrease rather than an increase . the microstructure wa investigated with first- and second - order markovian statistic . the synergistic effect wa not at work in the zirconocenes . when the concentration of 1-butene wa increased in the reaction medium the content of the long chain 1-olefin decreased in the terpolymer . this wa called an antagonistic effect . depending on the reaction condition , small amount of the tetraphosphapentacyclic compound ( tetraphosphacubanes ) 4a , b a well a the isomeric tetraphosphatetracyclic product 5a , b can be isolated from the thermolyses of the phosphaalkynes 3a , b . this cyclotetramerization can be directed towards the formation of tetraphosphacubanes when the whole process is split into two sequential cyclodimerizations . firstly , the zirconocene - phosphaalkyne dimer complex 8a-d are prepared from <nUm> and 3a-d ; in the second step , the Cp2Zr fragment is extruded from 8a-d by reaction with hexachloroethane . the tetraphosphacubanes 4a-d are obtained in good yield by this process . only in the case of 1-adamantyl-phosphaacetylene and the penta- and tetracyclic product formed concomitantly ( <nUm> + 3e → 8e → <nUm> + <nUm> ) . putative intermediate for the second dimerization step are the diphosphetes 9a-e and their diels - alder dimer 10a-e . the preparation of organocopper reagent by transmetalation protocol ha emerged a a versatile new tool for selective C,C - bond formation . In this review , the use of organoaluminum , -boron , -lead , -manganese , -mercury , -samarium , -stannane , -telluride , -titanium , -zinc , and -zirconocene derivative for the preparation of copper complex is presented and compared to traditional protocol originating from lithium or magnesium organometallics . significantly , a wide range of functionality is generally tolerated in the transmetalation procedure , and the reactivity of the resulting cuprates depends on the presence of the residual metal salt . the use of these heterobimetallic cuprates in natural product synthesis demonstrates some of the key feature of this new methodology . bimetallic Zr complex are synthesized by olefin metathesis reaction of vinyl group of monometallic complex . the Si bridged zirconocene { e5-C5Me4-SiMe2- e5-C5H3CH2CH = CH 2}ZrCl2 is transformed by metathesis reaction to the novel bimetallic complex with ansa - structure . ethylene and propylene polymerization wa conducted by bimetallic complex . the activity of the bimetallic complex depends on the steric hindrance of the ligand . the bimetallic complex with ansa - structure gave isotactic polypropylene with a similar high selectivity to that of the monometallic analog . bimetallic complex catalyzed cyclopolymerization of 1,5-hexadiene to give poly(methylene-1,3-cyclopentane) . ansa - zirconocene complex , exemplified by Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 , activated by MAO ( zirconocene / MAO ) exhibit high activity ( A ) for polymerization of propylene . polyolefins exhibiting a range of physical and mechanical property can be synthesized . the molecular structure have been determined by a combination of morphology , molecular and mechanical measurement . the NMR spectrum is consistent with a stereochemical control model of consecutive e / e ' ( E,E ' = enantiomorphic site ) . we have reported previously that the rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)methylzirconium ''cation'' ( 1 ) , which wa produced from the reaction of rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)dimethylzirconium and triphenylcarbenium ( trityl ) tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate , wa exceedingly active and stereoselective in propylene polymerization , and that it catalytic activity and stereospecificity increase with a decrease of tp . however , in the aluminum - free catalyst , a certain amount of <nUm> is consumed in the nonproductive function of scavenging inpurities . we report here an alternate and efficient method to produce alkylzirconocene - type ''cations'' polymerization catalyst . several example are described where in situ generated ( e2-alkyne ) group <nUm> metallocene type substrate add to X-[M2] reagent ( M2 = main group metal ) to form dimetallabicyclic product Cp2M(m-e1:e2-RCCR)(m-X)[M <nUm> ] which contain a planar-tetracoordinate carbon center in the m-e1:e2-hydrocarbyl bridge . thus , (e2-cyclohexyne)(PMe3)ZrCp2 ( 4a ) reacts in this way with excess trimethylgallium to give Cp2Zr(m-e1:e2-C6H 8)(m-CH3)GaMe2 ( 6a ) . complex 6a is one of the rare example of a gallium compound containing s-hydrocarbyl bridge to this heavy main group metal . complex 6a wa characterized by x-ray diffraction . it crystallizes in space group P21 / c with cell parameter a = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and RW = <nUm> . complex 6a contains a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom C(2) with pertinent bond distance and angle of <nUm> ( 5 ) Å [Zr-C(2)] , <nUm> ( 5 ) Å [Ga-C(2)] , <nUm> ( 8 ) Å [C(2)-C(3)] , <nUm> ( 7 ) Å [C(1)-C(2)] , <nUm> ( 4 ) ° [C(3)-C(2)-C(1)] , <nUm> ( 3 ) ° [C(3)-C(2)-Ga] , <nUm> ( 1 ) ° [Ga-C(2)-Zr] , and <nUm> ( 3 ) ° [C(1)-C(2)-Zr] . both cp ring are disordered . zirconium and gallium seem to form a three - center two - electron bond with C(2) . the planar-tetracoordinate geometry at carbon atom C(2) is probably electronically stabilized by the s-donor property of the attached metal center and by a p-conjugative interaction of the C(2)-C(1)-Zr moiety normal to the s-plane . (e2-1,2-Didehydrobenzene)(PMe3)ZrCp2 ( 4b ) reacts analogously with trimethylgallium to give Cp2Zr(m-e1:e2-C6H 4)(m-CH3)GaMe2 ( 6b ) in almost quantitative yield . complex 6b crystallizes isomorphously to the corresponding Al compound in space group P21 / n with cell parameter a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and RW = <nUm> . it also contains a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom [C(2)] . the reaction of ph - CKsC - GaMe2 ( 7 ) with (hydrido)zirconocene chloride produce Cp2Zr(m-PhCCH)(m-Cl)GaMe2 ( 9 ) which is probably also a similarly structured " anti-va n't hoff / LeBel complex " . complex 6a and 6b react with ethylene or norbornene at room temperature with liberation of Me3Ga and formation of five - membered metallacyclic product ( e.g. , bis(e-cyclopentadienyl)zirconaindane is obtained from 6b and ethylene ) . the nature and distribution of radioactive specie resulting from ( ng ) neutron - capture reaction in the metal atom of zirconocene dichloride and molybdocene dichloride were investigated . retention value of <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> % were obtained for zr-95 , zr-97 and mo-99 respectively . b-Transformation in 95Zr-zirconocene dichloride and 99Mo-molybdocene dichloride led to approximately <nUm> % of the respective daughter nb-95 and tc-99m being retained at the same molecular form a the parent.The nature and distribution of radioactive specie resulting from ( ng ) neutron - capture reaction in the metal atom of zirconocene dichloride and molybdocene dichloride were investigated . retention value of <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> % were obtained for zr-95 , zr-97 and mo-99 respectively . b-Transformation in 95Zr-zirconocene dichloride and 99Mo-molybdocene dichloride led to approximately <nUm> % of the respective daughter nb-95 and tc-99m being retained at the same molecular form a the parent . effective catalytic system on the basis of alkylzirconocene dichloride and methyl - alunoxane for polymerization of ethylene and it copolymerization with other α - olefine have been studied . some physico - chemical characteristic of synthesized polymer ( ρ , Tm , MM , MMD ) were studied . IR - spectroscopy , 13C NMR and x - ray analysis method were applied . In this paper we report on some preliminary result on ethylene polymerization with cp* 2ZrX2 ( cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl , x = Cl , OH , me ) - AlR3 ( r = me , et , i-Bu ) . furthermore , we carried out a study on propylene polymerization with cp* 2MCL2 ( m = Zr , Hf ) - MAO in comparison with Cp2MCL2-MAO : some data concerning the different chain - transfer mechanism observed in the two system are reported . we have studied reaction chemistry that appears to be relevant to the mechanism of the dehydrogenative polymerization of phenylsilane by zirconocene and hafnocene catalyst . these investigation suggest that the polymerization proceeds by a two - step mechanism involving sigma-bond metathesis . the active catalyst is therefore proposed to be a coordinatively unsaturated d0 metal hydride complex , which mediates a step ( condensation ) polymerization . none kinetic study were performed in short - time ethylene polymerization with biscyclopentadienyl zirconium dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) in conjunction with a methylaluminoxane catalyst system using two solvent , toluene and n-decane . the concentration of active center ( [C*] ) and the polymerization rate constant ( kp ) were greatly dependent on the solvent , that is , <nUm> mol / mol Zr and <nUm> 1(mol*s)-1 in toluene , and <nUm> mol / mol Zr and <nUm> 1(mol*s)-1 in n-decane . moreover , the catalyst activity wa increased significantly by introducing a small amount of 1-hexene or propylene a comonomer . from the observed result , the increase in the kp value caused by the comonomer wa proposed . dimethyl zirconocene and it derivative are effective catalyst for the dehydrogenative coupling of primary organosilaes to poly(organosilylenes) . the backbone Si-H function of these polymer can be functionalised by catalytic hydrosilylation . since the zirconocene polymerization catalyst is also an active hydrosilylation catalyst , it is possible to perform one - pot synthesis of functionalised polysilylenes . the bulkily substituted zirconocene dichloride complex of the type RCpCpoZrCU [ cpo = 2-MeOArCR1R2Cp , R1 , R2 = CH3 , C2H5 , CH2 , etc. ] have been synthesized by the reaction of 6,6-dialkylfulvene with 2-MeOArLi followed by treatment with RCpZrCl 3*DME ( r = H , me , i-Pr ) , and all the complex were characterised by 1H NMR , IR , MS and elemental analysis . A new type of intramolecular elimination reaction wa found and anisole wa eliminated from the complex with formation of alkenyl-substituted zirconocene . organosilanes and germanes couple readily by H / / <nUm> elimination under the influence of titanocene and zirconocene - based catalyst . the characterization of the polymer and their functionalisation by hydrosilation are described . the current level of our understanding of the mechanism of these reaction is discussed . the author describe the current state of knowledge on how the polymerization of silanes by dehydrogenative coupling occurs , how general ( or limited ) catalytic dehydrogenative coupling may be a a method for catenation of main group atom , what other catalyst may effect reaction and what other catalytic reaction can be effected by the unusual metallocene intermediate produced in this reaction . an experimental study is reported which wa carried out to obtain and characterize a new class of metalorganic polymer .

MALDITOF MS ion fragment to <nUm> dalton were found . based on dimethyl derivative of zirconocenes with the C <nUm> symmetry and perfluorenyl borate , catalyst immobilized on inorganic ( silica gel ) and organic ( polysorb ) support active for the synthesis of isotactic PP were prepared . it wa shown that the polymerization of propylene with immobilized catalyst in heptane proceeds at the steady - state rate in the presence of triisobutylaluminum . the polymer form in the form of granule whose size grows with an increase in the specific yield of the polymer . the nature of the immobilized zirconocene affect activity of the catalytic system and property of the resulting PP . the macrotacticity index . increase with an increase in the temperature of polymerization . the effective activation energy of polymerization are in the range from <nUm> to <nUm> kJ / mol . none phenylazomethine dendrimer exhibit precisely complexation with metal ion . it wa revealed that phenylazomethine dendrimers can assemble organometallic compound , such a ferrocene and zirconocene , which are known for useful catalyst and easy to be modified by other functional molecule . we found that the big complexation constant enabled ferrocene to make complex with imine at the core selectively , on the other hand , zirconocene can make complex with imine at the outer layer selectively because of the le complexatio constant . it wa also revealed that ferrocene - modified dendrimer turned to film on the electrode by the complexation of ferrocenium to it own imines or next one 's imines . bimetallic zirconocene complex were synthesized by olefin metathesis reaction of alkene - substituted zirconocenes . hydrogenation of a double bond of the bridging chain give a saturated and flexible bridging chain . the bimetallic catalyst with a short bridging chain show a higher catalytic activity for ethylene and propylene polymerization than that with a long bridging chain . the bimetallic catalyst with saturated bridging chain ha an increased activity , compared to the catalyst with unsaturated bridging chain . steric hindrance at R2 position on the cyclopentadienyl ligand decrease a catalytic activity . the steric hindrance at R1 position weekly affect the catalytic activity . transformation that take place in the rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl 2-based catalytic system of olefin polymerization were studied by electronic absorption spectroscopy . polymethylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and it modified analog containing <nUm> % of isobutyl group ( MMAO ) were used a aluminum - containing component . the evolution of absorption spectrum in toluene both with time and upon the fractional addition of new portion of MMAO or MAO to rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 wa examined . it wa presumed that the bathochromic shift of the longwave absorption band in the electronic spectrum are related to the formation of zirconocene adduct with three - coordinated AI atom and / or two - coordinated O atom of polymethylaluminoxane . calculation performed within the framework of the density - functional theory revealed the specific of formation of rac-Et(Ind)2ZrMe2 adduct in comparison with the adduct derived from Cp2ZrMe2 . high performance polymer from simple hydrocarbon monomer such a propylene ( P ) , norbornene ( N ) butadiene ( B ) and styrene ( S ) were obtained by the precise control of primary structure with coordination polymerization catalysis . syndiospecific polymerization of P wa performed with C s-symmetric ansa-fluorenylamidodmethyltitanium activated with AlR 3-free MAO ( dMAO ) in heptane . this catalysis system wa found to be effective for homo- and copolymerization of norbornene with ethylene or 1-alkene . random copolymer of P and B with 1,4-B unit synthesized by an isospecific zirconocene catalyst wa converted to a,o-divinyl isotactic PP by metathesis degradation of the copolymer with ethylene . isotactic PP with pendant vinyl group wa obtained by copolymerization of P and B in the presence of hydrogen in high activity . crystalline S-B block copolymer which posse long crystallizable syn-PS segment chemically bonding with a high cis-1,4-PB wa synthesized by adding B to a syndiotactic living PS . homogeneous single site catalyst have dominated the research interest in olefin polymerization over the past <nUm> year . sinn and kaminski1 started this trend with the discovery that methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) activates group IV transition metal catalyst . the ability to control regio- and stereochemistries , and comonomer content and distribution are some of the important advantage that metallocene catalyst afford in the polymerization process . A current goal is the reduction of the necessary amount of cocatalyst , typically methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , since it high cost and the large amount needed at industrial scale are a barrier to making metallocene system cost effective with respect to ziegler - natta catalysts2 . In this paper , we study the effect of MAO on reaction rate , molecular weight and polymer microstructure in the slurry polymerization of isotactic polypropylene . the active catalyst is a cationic specie generated in an equilibrium reaction between a zirconocene dichloride catalyst and MAO . increasing concentration of MAO shift the equilibrium to the formation of the activated complex . thus , catalyst activity increase with increasing MAO / Zr ratio3,4 . In addition , MAO in solution contains residual trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) in a typical concentration of <nUm> % wt . it is known that TMA can act a a chain transfer agent leading to the formation of an isobutyl-terminated chain and liberation of the activated complex5 . In condition where chain transfer to TMA becomes a competitive process with respect to the other chain transfer reaction , increasing amount of MAO reduce the molecular weight . slurry polymerization of propylene were carried out using rac-ethylene-bis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride / MAO a the catalyst system . polymerization were performed at <nUm> ° C in a <nUm> mL state - of - the - art semi-batch reactor . the effect of MAO / Zr ratio on the rate of reaction , molecular weight and polymer microstructure wa explored in order to allow the chain transfer reaction to TMA to be included in our previously developed kinetic model6 . an exhaustive analysis of end - group of the polymer chain by 1H and 13C NMR wa performed to gain understanding of the chain transfer mechanism . our kinetic model for the homopolymerization of propylene is developed to predict rate of reaction , molecular weight distribution and percentage of unsaturated end - group of the polymer6 . it is characterized by : ( 1 ) non-instantaneous initiation by insertion of the first monomer molecule ; ( 2 ) propagation by <nUm> insertion producing a regioerror that lower the molecular weight through competing chain transfer reaction ; ( 3 ) chain transfer to TMA ; and ( 4 ) catalyst deactivation to account for decreasing catalyst activity with time . the estimation of kinetic rate constant wa performed using a systematic optimization approach involving on - line measurement of the reaction rate and end - of - batch measurement of molecular weight distribution and polymer end - group . A least - square objective function wa defined to minimize the difference between the experimental measurement and the model prediction . the minimization wa performed subject to constraint imposed by the kinetic model equation . these constraint were posed a a set of nonlinear algebraic equation generated by applying temporal discretization technique to the dynamic model . this presentation will focus on the experimental and modeling result obtained with the rac-ethylene-bis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride / MAO catalyst system . the ultimate goal of this research is to develop a chemically based kinetic model that can be extensible to a number of single - site metallocene catalyst system . to accomplish this goal , research work with the catalyst rac-dimethylsilylbis(2-methyl-4-phenyl-indenyl) Cl2Zr and rac-ethylene-bis ( 4,7-dimethyl-1-indenyl ) Cl2Zr is underway . the former specie is highly active and stereoselective , while the later specie produce isotactic polypropylene with a high frequency of regioirregular <nUm> insertion . our current work with these catalyst system will be described in the presentation . recent progress of synthesis and application of organoaluminacycles is summarized . As synthetic method for organoaluminacycles , carboalumination or hydroalumination of alkyne followed by thermal elimination , reaction of di-organolithium reagent with aluminum halide , and zirconocene - catalyzed reaction of alkyne with AlR3 have been developed . useful synthetic reaction of organoaluminacycles , such a reaction with a variety of electrophiles , alkylation reagent , and metal - mediated coupling reaction are presented . dialkyl-substituted terminal olefin were synthesized from the coupling reaction of a-olefins which were catalyzed by zirconocene dichloride / methylalumoxane ( MAO ) catalyst system under mild condition . high yield wa gained and no other oligmer wa detected . it wa found that the ratio of Al / Zr is responsible for the selectivity of product . based on dimethyl derivative of zirconocenes with the C2 symmetry and perfluorenyl borate , catalyst immobilized on inorganic ( silica gel ) and organic ( polysorb ) support active for the synthesis of isotactic PP were prepared . it wa shown that the polymerization of propylene with immobilized catalyst in heptane proceeds at the steady - state rate in the presence of triisobutylaluminum . the polymer arises in the form of granule whose size grows with an increase in the specific yield of the polymer . the nature of the immobilized zirconocene affect the activity of the catalytic system and property of the resulting PP . the macrotacticity index increase with an increase in the temperature of polymerization . the effective activation energy of polymerization are in the range from <nUm> to <nUm> kJ / mol . In this study , behaviour of ethylene / norbornene copolymerization using zirconocene catalyst ; rac-Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 ( cat . A ) and Cp2ZrCl2 ( cat . B ) were investigated . based on activity profile at various norbornene concentration , it can be observed that although cat . A is more active than cat . B , it is le stable , indicating more rapid deactivation rate with time . it wa found that deactivation rate wa more pronounced with high concentration of norbornene for both catalytic system . asymmetric activity profile were observed for both catalytic system indicating higher deactivation rate compared to the activation rate . the copolymer produced by cat . A exhibited lower melting temperature ( Tm ) , but higher incorporation of norbornene . however , both catalyst produced copolymer with random distribution . surface modified silica were reacted with different aluminiumalkyls AlR2R ' ( r = me , et , i-Bu , r ' = H , me , et , i-Bu ) , oligomeric methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and combination of both , to yield heterogeneous cocatalysts . these cocatalyts were employed to polymerize ethylene using zirconocene dichloride a the catalyst . the polymerization activity profile have been recorded and compared with the information gained from the scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) image of the polymer . the fragmentation of the heterogeneous cocatalyts upon polymerization ha been demonstrated . the degree of fragmentation and the polymerization activity depend on the preparation of the silica support and on the preparation of the heterogeneous cocatalysts using these support . the most reactive , fragmentable heterogeneous cocatalysts show polymerization activity slightly higher than MAO in homogeneous solution and almost <nUm> time higher than commercially available MAO on silica ( = MAO on sylopol ) . the preparation of polyethylene with a broad distribution of molecular weight wa studied using Cp2TiCl2 or Cp2ZrCl2 incorporated with ( me or t-BuCp)2SmCl and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) employed a co-catalyst . the influence of parameter on the polymerization , such a molar ratio of MAO / catalyst , catalyst concentration , temperature and time have been studied in detail . it wa found that the polyethylene had higher molecular weight by using Cp2TiCl2 or Cp2ZrCl2 catalytic system combined with (t-BuCp)2SmClas compared with the system combined with (MeCp)2SmCl . meanwhile , the polyethylene obtained from (t-BuCp)2SmCl - contained catalytic system had high polydispersity ( PDI > <nUm> ) . this review article describes development in chiral metallocenes a polymerization catalyst focusing on C2 symmetric ansa - zirconocene complex . selective synthesis of rac - isomer of ansa - zirconocenes are surveyed . isospecific polymerization of propylene catalyzed by chiral zirconocenes are summarized . advanced series of polymerization by chiral metallocenes such a asymmetric polymerization and polymerization of polar monomer are also introduced . group IVB - containing poly(este r amine ) polymer containing norfloxacin in the backbone were synthesized in moderate yield using the interfacial polycondensation technique . the product are of moderate chain length with degree of polymerization ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> . the product were characterized utilizing HR EI MS , MALDI - TOF MS , and infrared spectroscopy . MALDI spectroscopy showed to be a useful tool in the analysis of the product with size up to six unit found . transformation that take place in the rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl 2-based catalytic system of olefin polymerization were studied by electronic absorption spectroscopy . methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and it modified analogue containing <nUm> % of isobutyl group ( MMAO ) were used a aluminum - containing component . the evolution of absorption spectrum in toluene both with time and upon the fractional addition of new portion of MMAO or MAO to rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 wa examined . it wa presumed that the bathochromic shift of the longwave absorption band are related to the formation of zirconocene adduct with three - coordinated Al atom and / or two - coordinated O atom of methylaluminoxane . calculation performed within the framework of the density - functional theory revealed the specific of formation of rac-Et(Ind)2ZrMe2 adduct in comparison with the adduct derived from Cp2ZrMe2 . about <nUm> % of all plastic are produced by catalytic process . organometallic compound such a lithiumbutyl , titanium iodide are used for the polymerisation of 1,3-butadiene and styrene . great industrial importance ha the production of polyethylene and polypropylene by phillipps- and ziegler - natta catalysis . beside these classical catalyst , catalyst such a metallocenes , half - sandwich , nickel , palladium , and iron complex have been synthesized - that give tailored polymer of totally different structure and allow to control the polymer tacticity , molar mass and molar mass distribution more efficient . new kind of copolymer and elastomer can be synthesized . it ha become possible to polymerize cyclic olefin with different zirconocenes or nickel and palladium catalyst without any ring opening reaction . the methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) / O2Si in situ- and ex situ - supported Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst were prepared and studied for ethylene / 1-olefin ( 1-hexene , 1-octene , and 1-decene ) copolymerization for linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) production . the in situ - supported catalytic system exhibited higher activity than the ex situ - supported catalytic system . activity continuously increased a the [Al](MAO) / [Zr] molar ratio increased up to <nUm> . the optimum [Al](TMA) / [Zr] molar ratio wa <nUm> . the ethylene / 1-octene ( EO ) copolymerization showed the most consistency , in regard to activity , for both catalytic system . the copolymer produced in both system were random copolymer . the monobridged compound [ me 2Si(C 5H <nUm> ) <nUm> ) ] <nUm> , and [ me 2Ge(C 5H <nUm> ) <nUm> ) ] <nUm> , were obtained a a mixture of three positional isomer from the reaction of the corresponding me 2ECl <nUm> with <nUm> equivalent of Li ( C 5H <nUm> ) . the monosubstituted 2,2-biscyclopentadienyl propane [ me 2C(C 5H <nUm> ) <nUm> ) ] <nUm> , resulted from the reaction of 6,6-dimethylfulvene with ciclopentadien in presence of a base catalyst . deprotonation of compound <nUm> , <nUm> or <nUm> with <nUm> equiv of nButLi and the subsequent reaction with <nUm> equivalent of ClZr <nUm> , suspended in a mixture of THF / benzene produced , in each case , the corresponding ansa - zirconocene chloride [ m-(Me 2E)(C 5H <nUm> ) 2]ZrCl <nUm> . the 1H and 13C spectrum of compound <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> are described . VT 1HNMR spectrum a ≈ <nUm> / <nUm> mixture of <nUm> and <nUm> are discussed a an aid in elucidating the spectrum at room temperature . polyethylene / montmorillonite ( MMT ) nanocomposites were prepared via in situ intercalative polymerization . poly ( styrene-co-acrylonitrile ) functionalized montmorillonite wa first obtained by emulsion polymerization . the functionalized MMT wa treated by MAO before being contacted by a zirconocene catalyst . the nanocomposites were prepared by addition and polymerization of ethylene . the exfoliation of the layered silicate in the PE / MMT composite wa confirmed by XRD and TEM observation . the higher storage modulus of the PE / MMT nanocomposites and different tan d in comparison with pure PE were revealed by dynamic mechanical analysis ( DMA ) . A new bis(indenyl)zirconocene bearing a pendant Si-Cl anchor ha been grafted onto MCM-41 , SBA-15 , MCM-48 and a disordered mesoporous silica for the polymerisation of ethylene and propylene , producing polymer with very high molecular weight , low polydispersities and , in the case of polypropylene , higher level of isotacticity than obtainable with analogous homogeneous system . it ha been synthesized two dinuclear metallocene complex [(C5H5)MtCl2] [ (C5H4)CMe2 ( C3H2 ) ] [(C5H5)SmCl][Mt = zr(5) , ti(7) ] , which were used for ethylene polymerization with MAO a cocatalyst . detailed study on the effect of polymerization caused by catalyst concentration , molar ratio of [Al] / [Cat] , temperature and time show that the catalytic activity of complex <nUm> is higher than that of the corresponding mononuclear metallocene of cp2 TiQ2 , while the catalytic activity of complex <nUm> is lower than that of the corresponding mononuclear met allocene of Cp2ZrCl2 ; the molecular weight of polyethylene produced by above two catalyst system is somewhat decreased , and the molecular weight distribution becomes broader . with prolongation of time , the molecular weight of polyethylene obtained by complex <nUm> decrease , while the molecular weight of polyethylene obtained by complex <nUm> increase . none polypropylene wa obtained using the metallocene homogeneous catalyst Methyl2Si-(2-Methyl-4-Phenyl)2ZrCl2 / MAO and the corresponding silica / MAO - supported system prepared at different condition . it wa observed that long metallocene immobilization time for the preparation of silica / MAO / zirconocene supported catalyst doe not imply in higher catalytic activity . the obtained polymer were characterized according to their melting temperature ( Tm ) and crystallinity degree ( xc ) , through DSC analysis . the result showed that the supported catalyst system produce polypropylene with higher Tm and narrower range of melting in relation to the PP obtained by the homogeneous system . polyethylene-clay nanocomposites have been prepared using in situ polymerization . In this study we have evaluated two mineral , silica and bentonite ( smectite ) , a catalyst carrier for the polymerization of ethylene with commercially available zirconocene . the activity of the homogeneous and supported metallocene system were also compared . we have observed that at high temperature , ethylene consumption sharply decrease with time by employing homogeneous catalyst . also , the polymerization profile for both supported system have rapidly achieved a steady state . moreover , the performance of the smectite - supported system wa very similar to that of the silica - supported catalyst . the obtained polymer were characterized according to their melting temperature ( T m ) and crystallinity degree ( x c ) , through DSC analysis . the polyethylene melting temperature ha significantly increased with the use of both supported system in comparison with the homogeneous counterpart . the highest T m of the obtained polyethylene wa <nUm> ° C , which corresponds to that synthesized by the smectite - supported catalyst . A series of ancillary directing ligand bearing O , S , N atom were used to react with ClZr <nUm> to get the intermediate complex , which showed certain diastereoselectivity when reacting with the dilithium salt of ethene - bridged bis(indene) . to carry out the selective synthesis , the ancillary directing ligand wa firstly reacted with equal molar amount of ClZr <nUm> in toluene under argon overnight . the resultant suspension wa transferred to the solid salt of C 2H 4-[(e 5-Ind)Li ] <nUm> ( molar ratio <nUm> : <nUm> ) at <nUm> ° C . the reaction mixture wa warmed up and stirred for <nUm> h at <nUm> ° C . then the solvent wa removed under vacuum and the residue wa analyzed directly by 1H - NMR spectroscopy to detect the relative amount of rac-C 2H 4- ( η 5-Ind ) 2ZrCl <nUm> and meso-C 2H 4- ( η 5-Ind ) 2ZrCl <nUm> . most of these ancillary directing ligand assisted the formation of racemic isomer , rac-C 2H 4- ( η 5-Ind ) 2ZrCl <nUm> , with the molar ratio of rac-C 2H 4- ( η 5-Ind ) 2ZrCl <nUm> to meso-C 2H 4- ( η 5-Ind ) 2ZrCl <nUm> a high a <nUm> : <nUm> . further research demonstrated that the diastereoselectivity wa significantly influenced by the structure , coordination atom and substituents thereon of the intermediate complex . two new hetro - dinuclear metallocene catalyst system of [(C5H5)MCl2] (C5H4)SiMe5 ( C5H4 ) ] [(C5H5)SmCl] [ m = Ti(D , zr(2) ] activated by MAO were used for the polymerization of ethylene . the affection of catalyst concentration , molar ratio of [Al] / [Cat] , temperature and time on polymerization were studied in detail . the result show that the catalytic activity of dinuclear catalyst is lower than the corresponding mononuclear metallocene , and the molecular weight , melt point and crystallinity of polyethylene produced are somewhat decrease . the use of organozirconium compound to prepare oganic fine chemical began only in the mid-1970s . it showed that alkylzirconium complex are easy to handle and that their reactivity toward electrophiles make them excellent intermediate for making alkyl halide . with hydrozirconation a the starting point , organozirconium chemistry ha taken varied path . hydrozirconation of 1-alkylnylphosphonates give the organozirconium(IV) complex <nUm> in syn-addition way . complex <nUm> wa trapped with NCS , NBS or I <nUm> to afford stereodifined a-halo-1-alkenylphosphonates in moderate to high yield . ionic and covalent derivative of the chlorine analogue of the nonbasic , weakly coordinating triflate ion , CCl3O3S - or " trichlate " ion , have been prepared and compared with the corresponding more strongly coordinated chloroacetates , ClxCH 3-xCO2M ( x = 1-3 ) , using 35Cl NQR ( nuclear quadrupole resonance ) spectroscopy . the 35Cl NQR frequency of all type of derivative are sensitive to the nature of the metal ion or lewis acid and are most sensitive in the case of monochloroacetates . In covalent ( including zirconocene ) derivative , the average NQR frequency fall a the pauling electronegativity of m fall . the result for ionic derivative contrast with previous result for ionic hexachlorometalates : the average 35Cl NQR frequency drop sharply a the ionic radius of the group <nUm> cation increase . ab initio gaussian <nUm> computation at the B3LYP / 6-311++G(3df,3pd) level on isolated XCH2CO2M ( m = Li , Na , K ; x = F , Cl ) molecule duplicate this trend , showing increasing polarization of the C-Cl bond and smaller electric field gradient for larger group <nUm> ion ; the relevance of this to the solid state polymerization of chloroacetates ( herzberg , O. ; epple , M. eur. J. inorg. chem. <nUm> , 1395-1406 ) is discussed . we have prepared the dihydrate and monohydrate of trichlic acid , CCl3HO3S . although trichlates have the highest average NQR frequency of any of these salt , the NQR frequency of trichlic acid dihydrate are anomalously lower than those of trichloroacetic acid , which suggests that it is a strong acid , ionized in the solid state to H 5O2 + and CCl3O3S - ion . In an effort to activate and functionalize nitrogen to produce H3N , assistant chemistry professor paul J. chirik et al. at cornell university have found that tweaking the ligand in a soluble zirconium complex provides a clue that may help chemist develop a homogeneous route for nitrogen fxiation . H3N form when tetramethylated cyclopentadienyl ligand are used . upon further addition of H , the end-on complex dissociates to zirconocene dihydride and liberates N , a typical observation for metal-N2 complex . this finding indicates that the tetramethyl ligand alter the coordination geometry of N in such a way to allow H3N formation . while the reaction sequence is currently not catalytic , it may shed light on how to assemble N-H bond under mild condition . the reduction of ZrCl4(PR3)2 with Li powder , in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of trans-1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene , affords the Zr (II) diene complex ( 1 ) in 90-93 % yield . this reaction consists of a rate - limiting step for the formation of the chloride - bridged Zr (III) dimer ( 2 ) and a fast diene - driven disproportionation of <nUm> to <nUm> and ZrCl4(PR3)2 that re-enters the reduction cycle . the reaction of <nUm> with Li2{Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2} in toluene produce quantitatively the desired racemic , divalent ansa - zirconocene ( 3 ) that is a highly active isospecific propylene polymerization catalyst upon activation with common activator . molecular weight of polyethylene ( PE ) obtained with using of zirconocene catalyst activated with large excess of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) were determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) method . it wa found that repeatability of the measurement is strongly influenced by MAO remained in PE sample a well a time of sample keeping in the apparatus ( dissolution + measurement time ) at temp. <nUm> ° C . A method of MAO removing from PE sample , before GPC measurement , based on additional washing of the sample with HF in methanol solution ha been proposed . this modification lead to better both authenticity and repeatability of the result . study on the influence of time of sample keeping in the apparatus at temp. <nUm> ° C showed that dissolution time of a polymer showing molecular weight up to <nUm> ̇ <nUm> g / mol should not exceed <nUm> h . the reduction of chloro-2,3,4,5-tetraethylphosphole with sodium , potassium , rubidium , and cesium in THF or 1,2-dimethoxyethane ( DME ) yield nearly quantitatively after recrystallization from a DME solution the corresponding alkali metal 2,3,4,5-tetraethylphospholides (DME)Na(PC4Et <nUm> ) ( 1 ) , K(PC4Et4) ( 2 ) , (DME)Rb(PC 4Et4 ) ( 3 ) , and (DME)Cs(PC4Et4) ( 4 ) . if the chloro-2,3,4,5-tetraethylphosphole still contains zirconocene dichloride from it preparation heteroleptic (THF)CsC5H 5*Cs(PC4Et4) ( 5 ) precipitate . whereas the sodium derivative <nUm> crystallizes a a dimer , the phospholides <nUm> to <nUm> of the heavier alkali metal crystallize a one - dimensional polymer . due to the size of the potassium cation no additional ether ligand are coordinated to this metal atom and a linear column precipitate , whereas for the Rb and Cs compound the DME complex are formed thus leading to a zig - zag chain . the substitution of half of the phospholide anion by cyclopentadienide ligand in <nUm> lead to a three - dimensional network in the crystalline state . the metathesis reaction of the potassium derivative <nUm> with Cl3Ga and ClSn <nUm> yield dimeric (DME)K[(m-Cl)4Ga2(PC 4Et4)3 ] ( 6 ) and monomeric Sn(PC 4Et4)2 ( 7 ) , respectively . whereas in the alkali metal phospholides <nUm> to <nUm> a high degree of delocalization of the anionic charge within the five - membered ring and a e5-coordination are realized , the 2,3,4,5-tetraethylphospholide anion is s-bonded to gallium (III) in <nUm> and to tin (II) in <nUm> . based on dichloride derivative of zirconocenes with C2 symmetry and borate , active catalyst of propylene polymerization were formed on a polymer support , PE with a grafted poly(acrylic acid ) treated with poly(methylaluminoxane) . it wa shown that the nature of aluminoxane affect the activity of the catalytic system : when aluminoxane is synthesized on the support surface , the activity of the catalyst increase . the influence of the nature of zirconocene and borate on the catalytic behavior of a system containing triisobutylaluminum a a cocatalyst wa studied . variation in the polymerization condition ( liquefied propylene or heptane suspension ) wa found not to affect the kinetics of polymerization , characterized by the steady - state rate of monomer consumption . particle - size analysis of the polymer prepared using various system is presented together with their molecular mass , melting temperature , and isotacticity index . composition of catalytic system and copolymerization reaction condition influence on heterogeneity of ethylene / 1-hexene copolymer obtained over MgCl2(THF)2 / MAO / Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst wa studied . one of the DSC technique , i.e. successive self - nucleation / annealing ( SSA ) method allowing separation of the polymer into fraction with differing chemical composition in result of alternating crystallization and melting cycle wa applied . it wa found that the intermolecular heterogeneity exists inside all studied sample irrespective of the reaction condition ( temperature and time ) and the catalyst composition ( Al / Zr molar ratio ) . it wa also confirmed that catalyst composition ha a considerably greater impact on heterogeneity of the copolymer a compared with copolymerization condition , which apart from the first period of the reaction - do not exert significant influence on this parameter of copolymer structure . the synthetic zeolite are characterized by a great variety of structure and composition , a well a by the different adsorption ability to ion , cluster and the transition metal complex . therefore they are interesting a support for heterogenization of the olefin polymerization catalyst . In addition the natural zeolite due to their considerable content in nature and low cost may be used a filler for the polymer composite material . the immobilized metalcomplex catalyst of olefin ( ethylene and propylene ) polymerization have been developed on the base of zeolite . In order to prepare these catalyst , the anchored aluminoxanes have been synthesized by reaction of aluminum alkyl ( AlMe3 , AlEt3 and AliBu3 ) with water contained in intracrystalline cavity and pore of zeolite ( NaY , NaZSM-5 , HZSM-5 , NH4ZSM-5 , mordenite and clinoptilolite - bearing tuff ) . these aluminoxanes , with zirconocenes , vanadium chloride and other transition metal , form the heterogenized complex that are active in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene without addition of other organoaluminum cocatalysts . the nature of zeolite used a a support , determines the content of zeolite water and affect the formation of anchored aluminoxanes and activity of immobilized catalyst . polyolefins prepared with the immobilized on zeolite zirconocene catalyst demonstrate higher molecular mass and a wider molecular - mass distribution than those of corresponding homogeneous catalyst . the stereoselectivity of supported catalyst depends on the composition , structure of metallocenes and on the zeolite nature . the new composite material on the base of ultrahigh-molecular-mass polyethylene UHMPE and natural zeolite were developed . the synthesis of composite wa carried out by ethylene polymerization on the catalytically activated surface ofzeolite filler . depending on the amount of zeolite filler in the UHMPE matrix such composition can be used a wear - resistant , impact - resistant material for production of unit working in condition of dry friction at high loading or a organomineral ion - exchange sorbent for water purification from radionuclides and heavy metal ion .

In the case of (4R,5R)-di[(1S)-phenylethyl]amino-(3R,6R)-diphenyl-1,7-octadiene , the main diastereomer of the product wa isolated with <nUm> % yield , then reductive removal of the n-substituents afforded (1R,2R)-diamino-(4R,SS)-dimethyl-(3R,6R)-diphenylcyclohexane with <nUm> % yield . three non-bridged dimethylzirconocene complex ; i.e. , bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)dimethylzirconium ( 1 ) , bis(e5-tert-butyl-cyclopentadienyl)dimethylzirconium ( 2 ) , bis(e5-indenyl)dimethylzirconium ( 3 ) , and the chiral zirconocene rac-ethylenebis(e5-indenyl)dimethylzirconium ( 4 ) were synthesized and used a catalyst for the polymerization of methyl methacrylate , MMA , combined with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( A ) or tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate dimethylanilinum salt ( B ) in the presence of ZnEt2 . the evolution of the polymerization characteristic ; i.e. , molecular weight , molecular - weight distribution , and yield were examined for the above system . the influence of the nature of the solvent wa also investigated . the aggregation behavior , the steric hindrance , and the lipophilicity of the active catalytic system are the most important parameter determining the polymerization characteristic . the tacticity of the product is reported and the influence of the catalyst structure is discussed . finally , the polymerization of other methacrylates ( alkyl = butyl , hexyl , decyl , stearyl , and sec-butyl ) , wa conducted and the effect of the nature of the alkyl ester group on the molecular and structural characteristic wa established . treatment of 1-methylimidazol-2-yl lithium with Cp2Zr(C1)CH3 ( 6 ) gave the corresponding methyl(1-methyl-2-imidazolyl)zirconocene complex <nUm> . treatment of <nUm> with BC18F15 ( 8 ) led to selective methyl abstraction . the resulting (imidazolyl)zirconocene cation <nUm> dimerized under the reaction condition to yield the dinuclear imidazolyl bridged bis(zirconocene) dication complex <nUm> that wa structurally characterized by x-ray diffraction and by DFT calculation . four new mixed - ring zirconium complex , [ CH2 = CH(CH 2)n-C5H4](RC5H4)ZrCl <nUm> [ n = <nUm> , r = CH3OCH2CH2(3) ; n = <nUm> , r = C3H7O ( 4 ) ; n = <nUm> , r = Me3Si ( 5 ) ; n = <nUm> , r = allyl ( 6 ) ] , have been prepared by the reaction of CH2 = CH(CH2)nC5H4ZrCl 3* DME[n = <nUm> ( 1 ) ; n = <nUm> ( 2 ) ] with RC5H 4Li . when activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , the catalytic activity of the above complex in ethylene polymerization were tested . complex <nUm> and <nUm> show high activity similar to Cp2ZrCl <nUm> . introduction of methoxyethyl group into cp - ligand dramatically decrease the catalytic activity of complex <nUm> and <nUm> , which can be overcome by increasing the amount of MAO . for complex <nUm> , the dependence of activity and molecular weight ( Mn ) on the Al / Zr ratio , the polymerization time ( tp ) , polymerization temperature ( TP ) and the polymerization solvent volume ( V ) wa investigated . A series of phenyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl zirconocenes have been prepared by the reaction of the corresponding ligand with n-BuLi and Cl4Zr in toluene , which were characterized by 1H NMR , MS spectrum and elemental analysis . ethylene polymerization with these complex in combination with MAO were studied . it is found that the catalytic activity and the molecular weight of polyethylene with one phenyl substituted zirconocene increase with the enhancement of polymerization temperature . NMR - spectrum of new coordination compound of zirconocene with 5-norbornene-2-ol and 5-norbornene-2-methanol were studied . besides traditional NMR technique , a series of bidimensional one were applied , such a : COSY , HMQC and NOESY . the possibility of obtaining of new metallopolymers via photoinduced polymerization of new Zr - containing monomer is discussed . busico and co-worker have provided a clue to rationalize the factor that control the tacticities observed in PP prepared with conformationally dynamic zirconocene - based catalyst under appropriate experimental condition . In order to find a good agreement between experimental and calculated stereosequence distribution , these author have proposed an alternative plausible oscillating mechanism for the catalyst . solvent and cocatalyst effect have been also documented and compared to more evident environmental factor ( i.e. , the introduction of bulky ring on the ligand ) a regard the conformational dynamism of the catalyst during chain growth . conjugate addition of (E)-3-trimethylsilyl-1-propenylziroconocene to (E,E)-divinylketones in the presence of catalytic amount of CuBr*SMe2 affords (E)-allylsilanes containing (E)-a,b-unsaturated carbonyl moiety under mild condition with good yield . they undergo highly stereocontrolled silicon - assisted intramolecular cylization when treated with Cl4Ti leading to polysubstituted cyclohexanones . the complex polymorphic behaviour of four syndiotactic polypropylene ( sPP ) sample have been analysed by mean of DSC and WAXD technique . two sample ( sPP1 , sPP2 ) were synthesised via metallocene polymerization by using the ansa - zirconocene ph 2C(Cp)(9-Flu)ZrCl <nUm> a catalyst . finally , two additional specimen with different molar mass ( sPP1 - fr1 , sPP1 - fr2 ) were prepared from the most syndiotactic sPP1 sample by temperature gradient extraction . the WAXD analysis show that together with the orthorhombic form I , form II can coexist in a variable but small proportion depending on both the chain feature and the processing condition . the relative contribution of the disordered and the ordered type of form I is also dictated by molar mass , configurational microstructure a well a processing condition . the observed change in the thermal property a measured by DSC and in the mechanic - dynamical relaxation of the sample , on slowing the crystallisation rate down , can be rationalised in term of two concurrent process , namely the perfection undergone by the crystal and the segregation of the amorphous phase . 4,4'-Dibromobiphenyl reacted with n-BuLi to form 4,4'-dilithiobiphenyl , which further reacted with <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , 5-tetramethylcyclopent-2-enone following the elimination of water to give the ligand 4-(C5Me4H) C3H2 - C3H2 (C5Me4H)-4 ( 1 ) . ligand <nUm> reacted with n-BuLi and Cl4Zr to form the p-biphenylene-bridged dinuclear tetramethylcyclopentadienyl zirconium trichloride 4-(C5Me4ZrCl3) · C3H2 - C3H2 (C5Me4ZrCl3)-4 , which reacted in situ with cyclopentadienyl lithium(CpLi) or indenyl lithium ( IndLi ) to give the corresponding p-biphenylene-bridged dinuclear zirconocenes 4-(C5Me4ZrCl2Cp') C3H2 - C6H4(C5Me4ZrCl 2Cp')-4 [ cp' = cp(2) , ind(3) ] . the zirconocenes <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by 1H NMR , MS spectrum and elemental analysis , and were studied for ethylene polymerization with methyl a-luminoxane ( MAO ) a cocatalyst . both <nUm> and <nUm> show very high activity and reach the maximum at a higher temperature , indicating that the introduction of the p-biphenylene-bridge increased the catalytic activity and thermal stability of the dinuclear zirconocene catalyst . A total synthesis of (+)-epiafricanol ( 6 ) ha been readily achieved from d-glucose . the tricyclic alcohol target wa arrived at by first forming methyl 6-O-benzyl-2-deoxy-2-C-methyl-a-D-altropyranoside ( 12 ) and converting this intermediate into methyl 2-C-methyl-2,3,4-trideoxy-a-D-threo-hexopyranoside ( 14 ) . there followed a series of step resulting in extension of the side chain to give the isopropenyl pyranoside <nUm> . this advanced intermediate wa subjected to zirconocene - promoted ring contraction , which gave rise to <nUm> and set the stage for conversion to <nUm> . this tertiary carbinol wa transformed into <nUm> by sequential ring - closing metathesis and stereodirected simmons - smith cyclopropanation . the reaction of trimethylaluminum with the internal water of a zeolite ( the Na form of ZSM-5 , O2Si : Al2O3 = <nUm> ) yielded immobilized methylaluminoxanes which , in the absence of other organoaluminum cocatalysts , reacted with metallocenes ( Cp2ZrCl2 , Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) to form heterogenized complex active in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene . the kinetics of ethylene and propylene polymerization in the presence of zeolite - supported zirconocene catalyst wa studied . the reaction order of ethylene and propylene polymerization with respect to the concentration of the monomer change from <nUm> to <nUm> a the concentration of the monomer in the reaction zone increase . the apparent activation energy of ethylene and propylene polymerization with the ZSM-5(H2O) / AlMe3 / Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst were found to be <nUm> and <nUm> kJ / mol , respectively . it is inferred that the synthesis of methylaluminoxane directly on the surface of a support and the formation of catalytic complex in the absence of free methylaluminoxane reduce the probability of leaching active center from the support surface to a solution . A series of new oxygen - substituted , asymmetric zirconocene dichloride ( rac-{1-[5,6-(ethylenedioxy)-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl]-2- (9-e5-fluorenyl)ethane}zirconium dichloride ( 3a ) , rac{1-[5,6-(ethylenedioxy)-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl]-2- (9-e5-fluorenyl)ethane}dimethylzirconium ( 3b ) and rac-{[5,6-ethylenedioxy)-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl] ( 9-e5-fluorenyl ) dimethylsilane } zirconium dichloride ( 3c ) } have been prepared and their polymerization behavior wa investigated in dependence of monomer concentration , temperature and catalyst activation . the presence of oxygen substituents on the indenyl ring result in a strong increase of polymerization activity and also of polymer molecular weight with decreasing Al / Zr ratio . significantly higher molecular mass and activity were found for the dimethyl complex 3b after activation with [(C6H5)3C+] [(C6F5)4B-] deriving from the absence of chain transfer to aluminum and higher concentration of active cata lyst specie . the mechanism of stereoerror formation of the oxygen - containing C1 - symmetric catalyst wa investigated by deuterium labeling study on propene monomer . the result are discussed on the basis of a reversible chain transfer to aluminum . the polymerized metallocene catalyst <nUm> wa prepared by the co-polymerization of ansa - zirconocene complex [ ( CH2 = CH)CH3Si(C 5H4)2]ZrCl2 ( 3 ) containing vinyl substituted silane bridge with styrene in the presence of radical initiator . catalyst <nUm> wa found to display high ethylene polymerization activity of <nUm> × <nUm> gPE / ( mol*h ) with a viscosity average molecular weight ( me ) value of <nUm> × <nUm> using methylalumoxane ( MAO ) a a co-catalyst . the ethylene polymerization ha been investigated under different condition .

In order to compare with silylene-bridged group <nUm> metallocenes . C2 symmetric dimethylgermylene-bridged zirconocene and hafnocene dichloride were prepared and employed a the catalyst for polymerization of propylene in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . germylene-bridged metallocenes always produced isotactic polypropylene of higher molecular weight than that produced by silylene-bridged analogue . the molecular structure of four metallocenes prepared from dimethylsilylene and germylenebis(2,3,5-trimethylcyclopentadienyl) were determined by x-ray diffraction and showed no substantial difference of geometry between silylene- and germylene-bridged one . unexpectedly the zirconocene metalloligand [ cp ° 2Zr- (OOCCH2SH-k1O)(OOCCH2SH-k 2O,O' ) ] ( <nUm> ; cp ° = C5 - EtMe4 ) reacts with[NiCl2(PMe2Ph)2] or [PdCl2(PnBu3)2] in the presence of NEt3 ( ratio <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> ) to give the tetranuclear IVZr - NiII complex <nUm> and the octanuclear IVZr - PdII complex <nUm> , respectively . As a discovery of C - C coupling and amine elimination reaction by treatment of 6-dimethylamino-6-methylfulvene with zirconium tetrachloride , experiment using amino-substituted benzofulvene 1a or aminopentafulvene 2a , instead of 6-dimethylamino-6-methylfulvene , gave bi [1-(dimethylamino)ethenyl-indenyl]zirconium dichloride 1c which wa characterized by x-ray diffraction a monoclinic , space group C2 / c , a = <nUm> . <nUm> <nUm> nm , b = <nUm> . <nUm> <nUm> nm , c = <nUm> <nUm> nm , β = <nUm> . <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> . <nUm> <nUm> nm <nUm> , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> . <nUm> <nUm> , and bis[(1-methyl-4,5-dihydro-2-pyrrolnyl)cyclopentadienyl ] zirconium dichloride 2c a triclinic , space group P1 , a = <nUm> . <nUm> <nUm> ( 16 ) nm , b = <nUm> . <nUm> <nUm> nm , c = <nUm> <nUm> nm , α = <nUm> . <nUm> , β = <nUm> ( 3 ) , γ = <nUm> . <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> . <nUm> <nUm> nm <nUm> , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> . <nUm> <nUm> . A zirconocene - olefin complex induced reductive radical cyclization of b-haloalkyl allyl acetal in THF . this complex served a a single electron transfer reagent to promote the cyclization . furthermore , the reaction in DME afforded tetrahydrofuranylmethylzirconium specie effectively . A single - stage , i.e. , degree of polymerization of one , and enantioselective version of the ziegler - natta alkene polymerization wa envisioned a a potentially significant and useful method for catalytic asymmetric C-C bond formation , shortly after the corresponding alkyne version involving Zr - catalyzed alkylalumination of alkyne wa discovered in <nUm> . however , the discovery of such an asymmetric reaction proved to be a major challenge . At least three widely observable unwanted side reaction , i.e. , ( 1 ) cyclic carbometalation , ( 2 ) b-H transfer hydrometalation , and ( 3 ) alkene polymerization , represented by the ziegler - natta polymerization , were noted and were to be avoided . with Zr a the metal at the catalytic center , we eventually came up with a notion that di- or multiple alkylation of Zr wa to be avoided for achieving superior acyclic asymmetric carbometalation . this , in turn , led u to avoid the use of highly nucleophilic alkylmetals containing alkali metal and Mg . aluminum used in ziegler - natta polymerization that can selectively monoalkylate Zr proved to be one of a very limited number of favorable metal . even so , undesirable cyclic carbozirconation can occur in nonpolar solvent via intricate bimetallic route to cyclic organozirconium specie . the vastly different reactant - catalyst stoichiometry and the absence of polymerization promotors , such a methylaluminoxane , in our investigation permit u to ignore the ziegler - natta polymerization a a serious and unwanted side reaction , although use of limited amount of promotors can in some case accelerate otherwise sluggish ZACA reaction . selection of the currently used Zr catalyst including (R)- and (S)-(NMI)2)ZrCl)2 ) , dichlorobis(neomenthylindenyl) zirconium wa made by screening <nUm> or so known chiral zirconocene derivative . systematic scientific design and screening of chiral ligand are clearly highly desirable , and effort along this line are ongoing . even at the current level of development , however , the ZACA reaction show considerable promise a an efficient and selective method for catalytic asymmetric C-C bond formation , which ha already been used to significantly modernize and improve synthesis of natural product including deoxypolypropionates and isoprenoids of biological and medicinal interest . the sequential homo- and copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene and 1-octene initiated by Cp2ZrCl2-methylaluminoxane and C2H4[Ind]2ZrCl2-methylaluminoxane homogeneous catalyst yielded reactor mixture based on HDPE and different amount of ethylene copolymer with these olefin . the composition and property of polymeric product formed at the stage of copolymerization are independent of the preliminary homopolymerization of ethylene . the component of the reactor mixture are capable of cocrystallization directly in the course of synthesis . the synthesized reactor mixture based on HDPE and ethylene-1-hexene copolymer which surpass linear LDPE in tensile strength posse good plastic property and a high melt flow index .

At ambient condition , <nUm> / MAO system show high catalytic activity in propylene polymerization and produce oily oligomers . the activity of a MgCl2(THF)2 / MAO / Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst wa studied in copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene in relation to Al : Zr mole ratio ( 1500-7000 at <nUm> ° C ) , experimental temperature ( 20-70 ° C ) , and time ( 20-90 min at <nUm> ° C ; 10-55 min at <nUm> ° C ) . As the temperature and the Al : Zr ratio were increased , the activity of the catalyst rose . At the same time , the degree of incorporation of 1-hexene into the polymer chain increased and the m , melting point and crystallinity of the copolymer decreased . the catalyst wa stable throughout the copolymerization . the process rate and copolymer property were not affected by copolymerization time . none the sequential homo- and copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene and 1-octene initiated by Cp2ZrCl2-methylaluminoxane and CH2 [Ind]2ZrCl2-methylaluminoxane homogeneous catalyst yielded the reactor mixture based on HDPE and different amount of ethylene copolymer with these olefin . the composition and property of polymeric product formed at the stage of copolymerization are independent of the preliminary homopolymerization of ethylene . the component of the reactor mixture are capable of cocrystallization directly in the course of synthesis . the synthesized reactor mixture based on HDPE and ethylene-1-hexene copolymer which surpass linear LDPE in tensile strength posse good plastic property and melt flow index . the reaction of trimethylaluminum with the inner water of a zeolite ( the Na form of ZSM-5 , O2Si : Al2O3 = <nUm> ) yielded immobilized methylaluminoxanes which in the absence of other organoaluminum cocatalysts reacted with metallocenes ( Cp2ZrCl2 , Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) to form heterogenized complex active in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene . the kinetics of ethylene and propylene polymerization in the presence of zeolite - supported zirconocene catalyst wa studied . the reaction order of ethylene and propylene polymerization with respect to the concentration of the monomer change from <nUm> to <nUm> a the concentration of the monomer in the reaction zone increase . the apparent activation energy of ethylene and propylene polymerization with the ZSM-5(H2O) / AlMe3 / Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst were found to be <nUm> and <nUm> kJ / mol , respectively . it is inferred that the synthesis of methylaluminoxane directly on the surface of a support and the formation of catalytic complex in the absence of free methylaluminoxane reduce the probability of leaching active center from the support surface to a solution . the polymerization of ethylene using supported zirconocene catalyst with varying support composition SiO2-MAO-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2+TIBA ( catalyst I ) and MgCl2-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2+TIBA ( catalyst II ) ( MAO is methylaluminoxane , ind is indenyl , and TIBA is triisobutylaluminum ) wa studied . the examined catalytic system differ in their activity , ability to control the molecular mass of the resulting polymer , and kinetics of copolymerization with 1-hexene . the molecular structure of PE prepared with supported catalyst I and II and a homogeneous catalyst Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2+MAO wa studied by IR and 13C NMR spectroscopy . As evidenced by 13C NMR spectroscopy , PE sample synthesized with the homogeneous catalyst and catalyst I contain ethyl branch along with the end methyl group in the low-molecular-mass fraction . on the contrary , PE prepared with supported catalyst II is devoid of ethyl branch but contains vinyl group a the basic type of unsaturation . polymeriztion of linear low density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) using a dual functional catalytic system containing different kind of metallocene / AlEt <nUm> / B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> a copolymerization catalyst and Ti(On-Bu) <nUm> / AlEt <nUm> a the ethylene dimerization catalyst wa studied . using the single cocatalyst AlEt <nUm> in the catalytic system , it is easy to overcome the shortcoming of interference between two catalytic metal in a single reactor . among the four zirconocene system used , the most active dual functional catalytic system is [ Ti(On-Bu) <nUm> / AlEt <nUm> / Et(Ind) 2ZrCl <nUm> / B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , it activity reach <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> gPE / molZr*h . the density of obtained LLDPE is <nUm> g / cm <nUm> and 1-butene insertion rate <nUm> mol % . the catalytic behavior of the highly isospecific catalyst rac-Me2Si(2-Me,4-PhInd)2ZrCl2 immobilized on the surface of a polymer support , PE with grafted poly(acrylic acid ) that wa preliminarily treated by poly(methylaluminoxane) , wa studied . the immobilized catalyst wa activated by triisobutylaluminum . the molecular mass , melting temperature , and isotacticity of the produced PP were examined . it wa shown that the modification of the catalyst by the boron salt Me2NHPhB(C6F5)4 lead to a change in the kinetics of polymerization and in the isotacticity of the resulting PP . factor affecting the rate and stability of the catalytic behavior of the studied supported catalyst such a the content of immobilized zirconocene , the concentration of triisobutylaluminum , and the reaction temperature were analyzed . it wa demonstrated that the catalyst is not washed from the support surface in the course of polymerization and that PP is produced in the form of granule with a bulk density of <nUm> - <nUm> g / cm3 . this paper describes ethylene polymerization using four kind of zirconocene with different substituents in the cp ring a catalyst and aluminoxane a cocatalyst . polymerization activity , polymerization kinetics and me of resultant polyethylene were compared . it wa found basically that polymerization activity were in the following order : A2 ≅ B2 > A1 > B1 [ A1 : ( CH2 = CH - CH2 - CH2 - cp)2 Cl2Zr ; B1 : ( CH2 = CH - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CP)2 Cl2Zr ; A2 : ( CH2 = C2H3 - CH2 - cp)2 Cl2Zr ; B2 : ( CH3 ( CH3 ) C = CH - CH2CP)2 CI2Zr ] .
