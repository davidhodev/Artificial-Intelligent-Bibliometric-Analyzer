the concept of molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) tailoring using metallocene catalysts is visualized as follows : catalysts which individually produce polymer of narrow MWD but of different average molecular weights can be selectively combined in varying amounts in order to achieve a high degree of control over the final polymer MWD . although widely lauded , this concept is seldom put to the test in the open literature . we have observed that soluble metallocene / methylalumoxane catalysts individually produce polymer of a very consistent and reproducible MWD , although the rate at which they produce polymer is subject to high variability . In semi-batch polymerizations , this causes difficulty in controlling both the reaction rate and the MWD of the final product . In this study we present the results of several polymerization experiments combining rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride with both biscyclopentadienylzirconium dichloride and bisdicyclopentadienyltitanium dichloride . we also present a model in an attempt to predict the final MWD of a polymerization combining two catalysts . by considering the variances of catalyst activity , it is possible to generate a confidence interval around the prediction for a future polymerization . these predictions are compared with the results of actual experiments . it is observed that precise control is hindered by an inability to predict the activity of the catalysts combined in a polymerization . some means of improving the predictions of MWD are given . 
ethylene polymerization by zirconocene-B(C6F5)3 catalysts with various aluminum compounds has been investigated . it is found that the catalytic activity depended on zirconocenes used , and especially on the type of aluminum compounds . for Et(H4Ind)2ZrCl2 ( H4Ind : tetrahydroindenyl ) , the activity decreases in the following order : Me3Al > i-Bu3Al > Et3Al ≫ Et2AlCl . while for Cp2ZrCl2(Cp : cyclopentadienyl ) , it varies as follows : i-Bu3Al > Me3Al ≫ Et3Al . furthermore , the activity is significantly affected by the addition mode of the catalytic components , which may imply that the formation of active centers is associated with an existing concentration of catalytic components . results of thermal behavior of polyethylene ( PE ) studied by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) show that crystallinity of the polymer prepared with Et3Al is higher than that with Me3Al or i-Bu3Al . it is also found that the number - average molecular weight ( m ) of the polymers prepared with Me3Al or i-Bu3Al is much higher than that with Et3Al . 1H - NMR studies substantiate that i-Bu3Al is a more efficient alkylation agent of Cp2ZrCl2 in comparison with Me3Al . 
nonisothermal , uncontrolled polymerization , conducted in varying mixing regimes , offered a facile methodology to evaluate the influence of several important process development factors such as mixing , reaction exotherm , and thermal perturbations on the catalytic activity and kinetic stability , polymerization performance , and properties of the resulting polymers . ethylene was homo- and copolymerixed with hexene-1 under varying impeller speeds ( hence , thermal perturbations ) , using Ind2ZrCl2 and Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and the MAO cocatalyst . with respect to the effects of the above process development actors , the following was observed : the reaction exotherm profiles , tracing the polymerization history , qualitatively represented the kinetic profile and the catalytic stability . the unbridged Ind2ZrCl2 was shown to be more stable than the bridged Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 . with change in the level of stirring from a diffusion - controlled regime to a noodiffusion - controlled , external gas - liquid mass - transfer resistance - free one , the reaction exotherm and the run time - average catalytic activity increased . so far as the influence of the chiral versus the achiral zironocene structure is concerned , the copolymer composition distribution and soluble fraction generated by chiral Et(Ind)2ZiCl2 were more sensitive to the mixing conditions and thermal perturbations than were those produced by achiral Ind2ZrCl2 . Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 produced higher molecular weight backbones , incorporated more hexene-1 and chain branching , and introduced less crystallinity in the copolymers than did Ind2ZrCl2 . the influence of Ind2ZrCl2 on higher - weight homopolymer backbones was opposite to that of Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 . incorporation of hexene-1 significantly decreased the average molecular weights and density and increased the run - time - dependent average catalyst activity . A positive comonomer effect took place . the bulk polymer properties did not critically depend on the mixing state . thermal perturbations broadened the polydispersity index . 
copolymerizations of ethylene with endo-dicyclopentadiene ( DCP ) were performed by using Cp2ZrCl2 ( cp = cyclopentadienyl ) , Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( ind = indenyl ) , and Ph2C(Cp)(FIu)ZrCl2 ( flu = fluorenyl ) combined with MAO as cocatalyst . among these three metallocenes , Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 showed the highest catalyst performance for the copolymerization . from 1H - NMR analysis , it was found that DCP was copolymerized through enchainment of norbornene rings . the copolymer was then epoxidated by reacting with m-chloroperbenzoic acid . 13C - NMR spectrum of the resulting copolymer indicated the quantitative conversion of olefinic to epoxy groups .

ethylene-propylene-diene monomer ( EPDM ) terpolymers were prepared using either vanadium ( Cl3OV / Al2Et3Cl3 ) or zirconocene ( Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO ) catalyst systems . residual metal contents in EPDM films were determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry . metallocene catalyst systems exhibited a higher activity , producing EPDM with lower molecular weight and narrower molecular weight distribution . the highest activity guaranteed lower residual metal content ( Zr / C = 10-5 ) than in the case of EPDM produced by Cl3OV / Al2Et3Cl3 ( V / C = 10-4 ) . subsequent steps of dissolution of the polymer and its reprecipitation were seen to reduce the metal contents in both metal systems . concerning the cocatalyst retention , despite initial use of a very high amount of methylaluminoxane / metallocene ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) in the reactor , only about <nUm> % of this initial concentration remained in the polymer . on the other hand , in the case of vanadium - based catalyst , almost all Al present in the initial conditions ( [?]8.3 ) remained in the polymer . In both cases , the residual Al / m ratio was close to the value generally proposed for the generation / stabilization of the active species . In the case of vanadium systems , a test in the synthesis of ethylene propylene rubbers indicated that the absence of diene in the polymer structure leads to a reduction in the residual vanadium content , indicating that the diene double bond might be responsible for partially vanadium coordination . 
the kinetics of propylene polymerization initiated by ansa - metallocene diamide compound rac - (EBI)Hf(NMe2)2 ( EBI = C2H4-(indenyl)2 , rac-1 ) were investigated . the rac-1 compound could be directly utilized for catalyst formations without converting to a dihalide or dialkyl complex in the presence or absence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the MAO - free system rac-1 / AlR3 / [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] ( 2 ) is much more effective than the rac - <nUm> / MAO catalyst . the activity of the rac - <nUm> / Al(iBu)3 / <nUm> system is much higher than that of the rac - (EBI)HfCl2 / MAO or rac - (EBI)ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst , and almost same as that of the rac - (EBI)Zr(NMe2)2 / Al(iBu)3 / <nUm> catalyst under similar conditions . the alkylation of rac-1 to rac - (EBI)HfR2 by using AiR3 needs more time than the corresponding zirconocene analogue . the activity increases by a factor of <nUm> by increasing the aging time from <nUm> min to more than <nUm> h . the activity of the rac - <nUm> / AlR3 / <nUm> catalyst is very sensitive to the type and concentration of AlR3 , and decreases in the order : Al(iBu)2H > Al(iBu)3 > AlEt3 > AlMe3 . the catalyst keeps high activity in a narrow range of the [Al] / [Hf] ratio . In addition , the activity is influenced by the concentration of <nUm> , and as a result , the maximum activity is observed when <nUm> / rac-1 = <nUm> . the activity of the rac - <nUm> / AlR3 / <nUm> catalyst is also sensitive to the polymerization temperature . the activation energies for the initiation and overall reactions are calculated as <nUm> and <nUm> kcal / mol , respectively . the properties of polymer such as isotacticity ( as [mmmm] ) , molecular weight ( MW ) , molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) , melting temperature ( Tm ) , and crystallinity are similar level with those obtained with the rac - (EBI)HfCl2 / MAO system . the MW and isotacticity of the polymer produced by MAO - free system decreases monotonically as tp increases , and MWD becomes narrow from <nUm> to <nUm> when tp increases from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C because of the compositional homogeneity of the polymer produced at high tp , which is demonstrated by fractionation of the polymer . both MW and [mmmm] values of polymers decrease as aging time and anion concentration increase . 
several kinds of Cl2Mg - supported half titanocene(XTiCl3 ; x = cyclopentadienyl , pentamethylcyclopentadienyl , indenyl , and heptamethylindenyl ) catalysts were prepared and applied to propene polymerization using Al(i-Bu)3 as cocatalyst . it was confirmed from the catalyst analysis that the ligand ( x ) is attached to titanium even after the reaction with Al(i-Bu)3 . when polymerization was conducted without any external donor , those catalysts predominantly gave atactic PP . however , addition of a suitable monofunctional lewis base like ethylbenzoate caused to change the stereospecificity of polymer from aspecific into highly isospecific . on the other hand , the use of a bifunctional donor like di-n-butylphthalate killed the activity almost completely . the isotactic PP was found to have a microstructure similar to that obtained with metallocene catalysts . 
the polymerization of ethylene was studied by using a series of polysiloxane - bridged dinuclear zirconocenes [ (SiMe2O)nSiMe2 C5H4 ] [(C9H7)ZrCl2]2 ( <nUm> , n = <nUm> ; <nUm> , n = <nUm> ; <nUm> , n = <nUm> ) , the corresponding mononuclear zirconocene C14Cl2H12Zr , <nUm> , and the pentamethylene-bridged dinuclear zirconocene [(CH2)5(C5H4)2][(C 9H7)-ZrCl2]2 , <nUm> . from the polymerization studies using these catalysts it was found that ( i ) activities of the polysiloxane dinuclear zirconocenes 7-9 were lower than that of the corresponding mononuclear zirconocene <nUm> , ( ii ) molecular weights of polyethylenes produced by the dinuclear metallocenes are greater than that of polyethylene produced by the mononuclear metallocene , ( iii ) the complex <nUm> holding the longest bridging ligand exhibited the highest activity but produced a polymer having the smallest molecular weight among the polysiloxane - bridged dinuclear zirconocenes , and ( iv ) the pentamethylene-bridged dinuclear metallocene <nUm> showed higher activity than the complexes 7-9 and the mononuclear zirconocene <nUm> . the formation of the lowest molecular weight of polyethylene by <nUm> was attributed to the influence of electron withdrawal caused by the lewis acid - base interaction between the acidic aluminum of the cocatalyst and the basic oxygen at the polysiloxane linkage as well as the lack of a steric problem . an increase in steric congestion around the metal center led to not only a decrease in catalytic activity due to preventing facile monomer access to the active site but also an increase in the molecular weight of polyethylenes due to supressing b-H elimination . 
poly(siloxane)s with bisindenyl , bisfluorenyl , bis(1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadienyl ) , bis(2,4,7-trimethylindenyl) and monoindenylmethyl side groups were synthesized by condensation of the corresponding dichlorosilanes and water . for reference , diphenylsilanediol or hydroquinone was also employed in place of water . A series of poly (siloxane)-supported zirconocene catalysts were then prepared from these precursors and applied to ethene and propene polymerizations as well as to the copolymerization of ethene with 1-octene in the presence of methylalumoxane . the polymerization activity of the new supported metallocenes depends drastically upon the substituents in the siloxane backbone . the zirconocene catalysts supported on poly(bisindenylsiloxane) and poly(bisfluorenylsiloxane) give the highest activities for ethene and propene polymerizations , respectively . the weight - average molecular weights of the polymers are also markedly dependent upon the substituents . on the other hand , the molecular mass distributions ( MMD ) are generally not so sharp , suggesting that the active species formed in these supported catalysts are not uniform . 
the PM3(tm) semiempirical method has been used to optimize the structures for the reactants and transition states of the first and second ethylene insertion processes into zirconocene catalytic systems . the results obtained for these reactions are compared with calculations published in the literature performed at different abinitio theoretical levels . the agreement between our calculations and those reported in the literature is satisfactory . taking advantage of the reduced computational effort required in semiempirical calculations two additional processes related with the socalled comonomer effect were also studied : ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization , and chain termination reaction , both in the homopolymerization and in copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene comonomer . the calculated activation energies support some experimental findings such as the higher polymerization activities in the presence of comonomers and also the molecular weight reduction of the copolymers due to the more favorable b-elimination reactions . 
both the rac- and meso-dinuclear ansa - zirconocene catalysts ( m-C12H8{[SiPh(Ind)2]ZrCl2} <nUm> ) were prepared by a coupling reaction between <nUm> equiv of diindenylphenylchlorosilane ( rac- and meso-isomers ) and <nUm> equiv of p-dilithiobiphenyl in diethyl ether at <nUm> ° C , followed by a successive reaction with Cl4Zr · 2THF in THF at <nUm> ° C . polymerizations of ethene and propene were conducted in a <nUm> dm high - pressure glass reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer at <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> ° C using methylalumoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst and toluene or decahydronaphthalene as the solvent . copolymerization of ethene and 1-octene was also checked in brief . for ethene polymerization , the meso-catalyst was found to be more active , which displayed an extremely high activity to give linear polyethene with a high molecular weight and a narrow molar mass distribution ( MMD ) . the apparent activity increased monotonously with rising polymerization temperature from <nUm> ° C up to <nUm> ° C , indicating that the active species are stable even at a high temperature . on the other hand , both the rac- and meso-catalysts showed very poor activities for propene polymerization . however , copolymerization of ethene and 1-octene proceeded at a high speed . 
the use of crosslinked poly(styrene-co-4-vinylpyridine) having functional groups as the support for zirconocene catalysts in ethylene polymerization was studied . several factors affecting the activity of the catalysts were examined . conditions like time , temperature , Al / N ( molar ratio ) , Al / Zr ( molar ratio ) , and the mode of feeding were found having no significant influence on the activity of the catalysts , while the state of the supports had a great effect on the catalytic behavior . the activity of the catalysts sharply increased with either the degree of crosslinking or the content of 4-vinylpyridine in the support . via aluminum compounds , AlR3 or methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , zirconocene was attached on the surface of the support . IR spectra showed an intensified and shifted absorption bands of C-N in the pyridine ring , and a new absorption band appeared at about <nUm> cm-1 indicating a stable bond Al-N formed in the polymer - supported catalysts . the formation of cationic active centers was hypothesized and the performance of the polymer - supported zirconocene was discussed as well . 
ansa - zirconocene diamide complex rac-Me2Si(CMB)2Zr(NMe2)2 ( rac-1 , CMB = l-C5H2-2-Me-4-'Bu ) reacts with AlR3 ( r = me , et , i-Bu ) and then with [CPh3] + [ B(C6F5)4l ~ ( 2 ) in toluene in order to in situ generate cationic alkylzirconium species . In the sequential NMR - scale reactions of rac-1 with various amount of AlMe3 and <nUm> , rac-1 transforms first to rac-Me2Si(CMB)2Zr(Me)(NMe2) ( rac-3 ) and racMe2Si(CMB)2ZrMe2 ( rac-4 ) by the reaction with AlMe2 , and then to [rac-Me2Si(CMB)2ZrMe]1 ( 51 ) cation by the reaction of the resulting mixtures with <nUm> . the activities of propylene polymerizations by rac - l / al( £ -Bu)3 / <nUm> system are dependent on the type and concentration of AlR3 , resulting in the order of activity : rac-l / Al(i-Bu)3 / <nUm> > rac - l / AlEt3 / <nUm> > rac - <nUm> / MAO > rac - l / AlMe3 / <nUm> system . the bulkier isobutyl substituents make inactive catalytic species sterically unfavorable and give rise to more separated ion pairs so that the monomers can easily access to the active sites . the dependence of the maximum rate CRp,max ) on polymerization temperature ( tp ) obtained by rac - l / al( £ -Bu)3 / <nUm> system follows arrhenius relation , and the overall activation energy corresponds to <nUm> kcal / mol . the molecular weight ( MW ) of the resulting isotactic polypropylene ( zPP ) is not sensitive to Al(i-Bu)3 concentration . the analysis of regiochemical errors of iPP shows that the chain transfer to Al(z-Bu)3 is a minor chain termination . the 1,3-addition of propylene monomer is the main source of regiochemical sequence and the [mr] sequence is negligible , as a result the mesa pentad ( [mmmm] ) values of iPPs are very high ( [mmmm] <nUm> % ) . these results can explain the fact that rac-l / Al(i-Bu)o / <nUm> system keeps high activity over a wide range of [Al(i-Bu)3] / [Zr] ratio between <nUm> and <nUm> . 
ansa - zirconocene diamide complex rac - (EBI)Zr(NMe2)2 [ rac-1 , EBI = ethylene-1,2-bis(1-indenyl) ] reacted with AlR3 ( r = me , et , iBu ) or Al(iBu2)H and then with [CPh3][B(C6F5)4] ( 2 ) in toluene in order to perform propylene polymerization by cationic alkylzirconium species , which are in situ generated during polymerization . through the sequential NMR - scale reactions of rac-1 with AlR3 or Al(iBu2)H and then with <nUm> , rac-1 was demonstrated to be transformed to the active alkylzirconium cations via alkylated intermediates of rac-1 . the cationic species generated by using AlMe3 , AlEt3 , and Al(iBu2)H as alkylating reagents tend to become heterodinuclear complex ; however , those by using bulky Al(iBu)3 become base - free [rac-(EBI)Zr(iBu)]+ cations . the activity of propylene polymerization by rac - <nUm> / AlR3 / <nUm> catalyst was deeply influenced by various parameters such as the amount and the type of AlR3 , metallocene concentration , [Al] / [2] ratio , and polymerization temperature . generally the catalytic systems using bulky alkylaluminum like Al(iBu)3 and Al(iBu)2H show higher activity but lower stereoregularity than those using less bulky AlMe3 and AlEt3 . the alkylating reagent Al(iBu)3 is not a transfer agent as good as AlMe3 or AlEt3 . the polymerization activities show maximum around [Al] / [2] ratio of <nUm> and increase monotonously with polymerization temperature . the overall activation energy of both rac - <nUm> / Al(iBu)3 / <nUm> and rac-1 / Al(iBu)2H catalysts is <nUm> kcal / mol . As the polymerization temperature increases , the stereoregularity of the resulting polymer decreases markedly , which is demonstrated by the decrease of [mmmm] pentad value and by the increase of the amount of polymer soluble in low boiling solvent . the physical properties of polymers produced in this study were investigated by using 13C - NMR , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , viscometry , and gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) . 
the effects of polymerization conditions were evaluated on the production of polyethylene by silica - supported (n-BuCp)2ZrCl2 grafted under optimized conditions and cocatalyzed by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the Al : Zr molar ratio , reaction temperature , monomer pressure , and the age and concentration of the catalyst were systematically varied . most reactions were performed in toluene . hexane , with the addition of triisobutilaluminum ( TIBA ) to MAO , was also tested as a polymerization solvent for both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst systems . polymerization reactions in hexane showed their highest activities with MAO : TIBA ratios of <nUm> : <nUm> and <nUm> : <nUm> for the homogeneous and supported systems , respectively . catalyst activity increased continuously as Al : Zr molar ratios increased from <nUm> to <nUm> , and remained constant up to <nUm> . the highest activity was observed at <nUm> K . high monomer pressures ( ≈ <nUm> atm ) appeared to stabilize active species during polymerization , producing polyethylenes with high molecular weight ( ≈ <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 ) . catalyst concentration had no significant effect on polymerization activity or polymer properties . catalyst aging under inert atmosphere was evaluated over <nUm> months ; a pronounced reduction in catalyst activity [ from <nUm> to <nUm> × <nUm> g PE ( mol Zr h)-1 ] was observed only after the first two days following preparation . 
isotactic polypropylene ( i-PP ) and syndiotactic polypropylene ( s-PP ) obtained with single - site C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocenes , respectively , activated with triphenyl carbenium tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl)borate ( 3 ) are immiscible with one another . physical mixture of the two PPs is macrophase separated and crystallizes very slowly as is characteristic of s-PP . A solution of C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocenes with <nUm> also produces an incompatible mixture of i-PP and s-PP . however , in the presence of an excess of a crossover agent such as triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) , a new polymeric material is obtained that exhibits lower Tm and DHf than either of the two homosteric polymers and a much faster rate of crystallization than that of s-PP or its physical mixture with i-PP . thermal annealing of this product markedly reduces the relative amount of crystalline phase compared to the amorphous phase and atomic force microscopy finds only microphase separation but not macroscopic phase separation . fractionation and 13C - NMR showed the material to contain not only the homosteric i-PP and s-PP but also a stereoblock PP ( i-PP-b-s-PP ) . the stereoblock fraction acts as a compatibilizing agent ; it probably is produced by the exchange of propagating polymer chains between the syndiospecific and the isospecific sites assisted by the crossover agent . 
polymerizations of styrene were carried out with half - sandwich complexes supported on silica , CpTiX3 / MAO / O2Si ( x = Cl , F ) . the optimum values for the polymerization time , the amount of cocatalyst and the alsupport / Ti ratio were found for the trichlorinated system . the highest activity obtained was <nUm> g sPS / ( mol Ti × h × mol / L styrene ) . the trihalogenated complexes were compared to one another with respect to their polymerization rate . CpTiCl3 / MAO / O2Si and CpTiF3 / MAO / O2Si behave in a similar manner , suggesting that the active species of both half - sandwich complexes on the support are the same . furthermore , aging experiments were carried out with CpTiCl3 / MAO / O2Si and , surprisingly , deactivation was observed , as opposed to supported zirconocenes which gain stability against deactivation reactions when anchored to a carrier . 
an on - line electron spin resonance ( ESR ) technique was applied to investigate the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene activated by the catalyst system CpTiCl3 / MMAO . the measurements included trivalent titanocene concentration and monomer conversion . the activation procedure was found to have a dramatic effect on catalyst activity . adding the reactants in the order of ( MMAO + CpTiCl3 ) + st gave a much higher trivalent titanocene concentration and catalyst activity than the order of ( MMAO + st ) + CpTiCl3 . the catalyst deactivation behaviors in the temperature range of 25-70 ° C were followed as a function of time during polymerization . At high Al / Ti ratios ( 500-1000 ) , the decay rates of trivalent titanocene in the presence of styrene were much faster than those of the pure catalyst system . 
A new class of organometallic polymer having a backbone of conjugated poly-yne and Zr - metal atoms has been prepared . trichloroethylene ( TCE ) and hexachlorobutadiene ( HCB ) are quantitatively converted by n-butyllithium to dilithioacetylene ( LiCfeCLi ) and dilithiodiacetylene ( Li-C = C-C = C-Li ) respectively . quenching with Cp2*ZrCl2 affords high yields of the polymers |Zr(Cp2*)C = c}n and { Zr(Cp2*)C = C-CfeCln where cp* = C2H3 = pentamethyl cyclopentadienyl . the Cp2*ZrCl2 and the polymers were characterized by viscosity , molecular weight , elemen - tal analysis , FTIR , NMR spectra , and TGA . 
monocyclopendienyltitanium trichloride ( CpTiCl3 ) was supported on polymer carriers with different hydroxyl contents , and the supported catalysts were used for styrene polymerization . the supported catalysts exhibited high activity even at low Al / Ti ratios and increased the molecular weight of the products , indicating that polymer carriers could stabilize the active sites . the polymers prepared with unsupported and supported catalysts were extracted with boiling n-butanone and characterized by carbon nuclear magnetic resonance ( 13C NMR ) and differential scanning calorimetry . the polymers obtained by supported catalysts had a high fraction of boiling n-butanone-insoluble part and high melting temperatures , but 13C NMR results showed that syndiotacticity decreased compared with that of polymers prepared with an unsupported catalyst . ESR study on the supported catalysts confirmed that the active sites supported on the carrier dropped into the solution and formed active sites the same as those in the unsupported system when they reacted with methylaluminoxane . 13C NMR analysis showed that the polymerization mechanism of the supported active sites was an active - site controlled mechanism instead of a chain - end controlled mechanism of the unsuppported active sites . 
the half - titanocene (e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)tribenzyl titanium ( Cp*TiBz3 ) with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as the cocatalyst was employed to catalyze propene polymerization at ambient pressure . A novel atactic polypropene elastomer with a high molecular weight ( mw = 2-8 × <nUm> ) was produced . the effects of the polymerization conditions on the catalytic activity and polymer molecular weight are discussed . 13C NMR analysis confirmed that the catalyst system Cp*TiBz3 / MAO produced atactic polypropenes , and the polymerization mechanism was in agreement with the bernoullian process . the triad sequence distribution of the polymer was measured and found to be as follows : mm = <nUm> % , mr = <nUm> % , and rr = <nUm> % ( bernoullian factor B = <nUm> ) ; this indicated that the insertion of propene with the catalyst system followed a chain - end control model . 
the PM3(tm) semiempirical method was used to show the effect of a second ethylene molecule in the backside position on the frontside ethylene insertion in the Cp2Zr-nPr+ g-agostic resting state . the same calculations without a companion second ethylene molecule were performed to compare geometrical parameters , energies , and electrostatic charges . the results obtained show that the geometrical parameters for both cases were identical , but differences in the electrostatic charges were observed . the energy profile presented two barriers , the first corresponding to the alkyl-chain rotation along the Zr-Ca bond and the second relating to the insertion process itself . the presence of a companion second ethylene molecule affected the energetic profile by lowering the energy barrier of the first stage with respect to the process without the companion second ethylene molecule . these results provide some theoretical support to the well - known trigger effect . 
the reactions of cp <nUm> Zr(L)(e <nUm> -Me <nUm> CSi <nUm> SiMe <nUm> ) ( L = THF , pyridine ) with e-caprolactone , cyclohexanone and cycloheptanone result in an insertion of the carbonyl group into the zirconacyclopropene ring system of the alkyne complexes to yield the five - membered metallacyclic spirozirconadihydiofurane complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> . the product with e-caprolactone is not stable at room temperature and was identified only by NMR spectra and chemical reactions . starting from rac-(ebtru)Zr(e <nUm> -Me <nUm> CSi <nUm> SiMe <nUm> ) with e-caprolactone and ethylene carbonate under analogous conditions more stable complexes ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) were obtained . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by x-ray crystal - structure analysis . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> react with further e-caprolactone in a catalytic ring - opening polymerization . the polymerization reactions were monitored by NMR spectroscopy . 
6-Amino-6-methylfulvene has been coupled with benzoic acid by treatment with 7-azahydroxybenzotriazole and DCC . subsequent two-fold deprotonation , at the NH and 6-methyl groups , generated the vinylidene-bridged cp / benzoylamido ligand <nUm> . treatment of <nUm> with ZrCl4(THF)2 gave the spirometallocene complex 3a ( characterized by x-ray crystal structure analysis ) , while reaction of <nUm> with (Et2N)2ZrCl2(THF)2 yielded the bridged half - sandwich complex 3b . treatment of 3a with two molar equivalents of the strongly electrophilic borane BC12F10H resulted in hydroboration of the exocyclic C = C double bond with concomitant intramolecular N-B adduct formation to yield the azaboretidine - type systems <nUm> ( three diastereoisomers , one of which has been characterized by x-ray diffraction analysis ) . similarly , hydroboration of 3b with BC12F10H yielded the azaboretidine derivative <nUm> . activation of the complexes <nUm> and <nUm> with methylalumoxane led to active homogeneous ziegler - type propene polymerization catalysts . 
linear , soluble copolymers containing titanium are of interest for use in targets for inertial - confinement fusion ( ICF ) experiments because the titanium is a useful spectroscopic probe for studying the nuclear fusion process . we have studied the reactions of dichlorotitanocene and diphenyltitanocene with carboxylic acids to determine if these can be used to prepare such polymers . model reactions of dichlorotitanocene with p-toluic acid show that both mono- and di-carboxylates are formed . we have prepared a soluble titanium - containing copolymer via the reaction of poly(styrene-co-methacrylic acid ) with an excess of dichlorotitanocene but attempts to remove the excess molecular titanocene from the copolymer result in crosslinking of the copolymer . model reactions of benzoic and pivalic acids with diphenyltitanocene demonstrate that monosubstituted carboxylato(phenyl)titanocenes are formed but that these products are stable only at low temperatures and decompose readily at ambient temperature . proton NMR studies of the reaction of diphenyltitanocene and benzoic acid at - <nUm> ° C indicate that this reaction is second order , suggesting that the reaction does not proceed through a benzyne intermediate . 
A series of polymer - supported RCpCpTiCl2 ( cp = e5 - CH ; RCp = e5 - RC5H4 ) has been prepared and reduced by i-C3H7MgBr in situ , then used as catalysts in hydrogenation of styrene , isomerization of 1,5-cyclooctadiene and 1,5-hexadiene , and reduction of carbonyl compounds . In some cases , the introduction of a polymer ligand on the cp ring restricts the aggregation of active sites and the formation of the inactive dimer of the titanocene species , and results in an increase of activity . regeneration of polymer - supported titanocene catalysts was performed and the results are presented and briefly discussed . 
treatment of the BC12F11 OEt2 ( 3 ) complex with n-pyrrolyl lithium gives bis(pentafluorophenyl)(N-pyrrolyl)borane ( 2 ) , a strong organometallic lewis acid , which was characterized by x-ray diffraction ( B-N bond length : <nUm> Å ) . it exhibits a columnar superstructure in the crystal and contains p-stacks of pyrrolyl units . compound <nUm> readily abstracts alkyl anions from a variety of alkyl group <nUm> metallocene - type complexes and leads to the clean formation of the respective metallocene ions or ion pairs . for example , the treatment of Cp3ZrCH3 ( 9 ) with <nUm> transfers a methyl anion to yield the ion pair [Cp3Zr]+[(C4H4N)B(CH 3)(C6F5)2]- ( 12 ) . the x-ray crystal structure analysis of <nUm> shows a close contact between zirconium and the pyrrolyl-b-carbon ( <nUm> Å ) . the borane <nUm> adds to (butadiene)zirconocene ( 13 ) to yield the betaine system [Cp2Zr]+ [ (C4H6)B-(NC4H4)(C6F 5)2]- ( 15 ) . complex <nUm> contains a distorted e3-allyl moiety inside the metallacyclic framework and it features an internal zr+ ⋯ (pyrrolyl)B- ion pair interaction with a Zr ⋯ pyrrolyl-a-carbon separation of <nUm> Å ( determined by x-ray diffraction ) . from the dynamic NMR spectra of <nUm> the bond strength of the internal ion pair interaction was estimated to be DG[?]diss ( <nUm> K ) ≈ <nUm> kcal mol-1 . treatment of dimethylzirconocene ( 16 ) with <nUm> yields the metallocene borate salt [Cp2ZrCH3]+[(C4H 4N)B(CH3)(C6F5)2 ] - ( 17 ) , which is an active catalyst for the polymerization of ethene . 
the systematic regulation of the molecular weight distribution in the MAO - activated polymerization of ethylene has been realized by using amino- functionalized ansa - zirconocene dichlorides as precatalysts ( one of the active species is shown ) . the formation of high- and low-molecular-weight polyethylene with a unimodal distribution as well as the formation of polyethylene with a bimodal distribution is possible by varying the polymerization temperature . 
the cationic alkyl zirconocene complex Cp2Zr+Me[CH3B-(C6F 5)3 ] is found to initiate the ring - opening polymerization of 1,5,7,11-tetraoxaspiro[5,5]undecane under mild condition to give poly(oxypropylenepropylenecarbonate) with low polydispersity . the rate of the polymerization is first - order with respect to monomer and catalyst concentration . At high monomer concentration , the initial rate of polymerization becomes zero - order with respect to monomer concentration . 
A novel catalyst precursor , (e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)titanium triallyloxide ( Cp*Ti(OCH2-CH = CH2)3 ) , was prepared and employed in a study of propylene polymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . this work has revealed that the half - titanocene catalyst is desirable for the production of elastomeric poly(propylene) with high molecular weight ( mw = 8-69 × <nUm> ) as well as in good yields under typical polymerization conditions . 
In this paper we report on a zirconocene dichloride / methylaluminoxane catalyst system supported on a crosslinked polystyrene in order to provide ethylene polymerization catalysts for gas phase or slurry processes . our novel approach uses the diels - alder reaction of cyclopentadiene functions as the final , crosslinking synthetic step . this provides polymer supported zirconocene catalysts with a homogeneous distribution of active sites . the catalysts were shown to be highly active and to form spherical beads as proven by scanning electron microscopy . 
nanocomposites of high density polyethylene ( HDPE ) , linear low density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) and highly branched polyethylene rubbers were prepared both by means of melt compounding and ethene homo- and copolymerization in the presence of layered silicates which were rendered organophilic via ion exchange with various quaternary alkyl ammonium cations . In comparison to melt compounding , in-situ ethene homo- and copolymerization , catalyzed with MAO - activated zirconocene ( MBI ) , nickel ( DMN ) and palladium ( DMPN ) catalysts , proved more effective in nanocomposite formation , as evidenced by larger interlayer spacings and formation of exfoliated anisotropic nanosilicates with high aspect ratio . 
four non-bridged dimethylzirconocene complexes , i.e. , bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)dimethylzirconium ( 1 ) , ( e5-cyclopentadienyl ) (e5-fluorenyl)dimethylzirconium ( 2 ) , bis(e5-indenyl)dimethylzirconium ( 3 ) and (e5-cyclopentadienyl)(e 5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)dimethylzirconium ( 4 ) were synthesized and used as a catalyst for the methyl methacrylate polymerization combined with triphenylmethyl tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate in the presence of ZnEt2 or Al(i-Bu)3 . the catalyst activity strongly depends on the zirconocene compound and decreases in the order <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> ≫ <nUm> . the polymerization proceeds in a living manner when <nUm> and <nUm> are used combined with ZnEt2 . on the other hand , stereoregularities of the resulting polymers are independent of the zirconocene compound , and syndiotactic - rich polymers are formed by a chain - end controlled mechanism . 
propene polymerizations were performed using the two ansa - zirconocene catalyst systems dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride / methylaluminoxane and dimethylsilylbis(2-methyl-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride / methylaluminoxane . the polymerization rate was observed by continuously monitoring the monomer consumption . reaction rate profiles were obtained in the temperature range from <nUm> ° C to <nUm> ° C at pressures between <nUm> and <nUm> bar and catalyst concentrations from 4.6*10-6 m to 4.2*10-5 m . isotacticity , as measured by NMR , melting point and molecular weight decreases markedly at higher temperatures . small amounts of 1,3-inserted monomer ( < <nUm> mol- % ) was observed at polymerization temperatures above <nUm> ° C . No 2,1-inserted monomer was detected . A kinetic model was developed that describes the polymerization rate for Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 as the catalyst over the entire observed temperature range , and the polymerization rate for Me2Si(2-Me-Ind)2ZrCl2 in a limited temperature range . the model includes an activation reaction , latent sites that may revert to active sites and a permanent deactivation that is second order with respect to the active sites . the activation energy for the propagation reaction was found to be <nUm> kJ / mol for Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 and <nUm> kJ / mol for Me2Si(2-Me-Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO . several kinetic models are compared and discussed . 
stereospecific polymerization and asymmetric oligomerization of allylsilanes were investigated by using C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocene catalysts . isotactic and syndiotactic poly(allylsilane)s were produced with rac-ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) and diphenylmethylene(e5-cyclopentadienyl)(e 5-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 6 ) , respectively . bulky allylsilanes afforded optically active oligomers in the reactions using optically active ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium and -hafnium complexes . 
propene polymerization was conducted with titanocene ( Cp2TiMe2 , Cp2TiMe2 ; cp = e5-C5H5 , cp* = e5-C5Me5 ) / organoborane ( BC18F15 , Ph3CB(C6F5)4 ) catalysts at -5O ° C using toluene as a solvent . the polymer obtained with Cp2TiMe2 / Ph3CB(C6F5) <nUm> is less isotactic than that obtained with Cp2TiMe2 / BC18F15 . however , the isospecificity of the former catalyst is improved with respect to that of the latter one when a toluene / CCl2H2 mixture is used as a solvent instead of toluene . As similar enhancement in isospecificity was observed when alkylaluminium is added to the polymerization system . on the other hand , only Ph3CB(C6F5)4 is an efficient cocatalyst for the propene polymerization with Cp2*TiMe2 . the polymer obtained with Cp*2TiMe2 / Ph3CB(C6F 5)4 as catalyst is atactic , even in the presence of CCl2H2 or alkylaluminium . based on these results , the stereospecificity of achiral titanocenes is discussed . 
A magnesium chloride supported zirconocene catalyst was synthesized using a soluble tetrahy-drofuran complex of magnesium chloride . the supported catalyst polymerizes ethylene with high activities in the presence of methylaluminoxane . the siginificant feature of the supported catalyst is that it polymerizes ethylene even at temperature as high as <nUm> ° C at low Al / Zr ratios . the polymer molecular weights obtained using supported catalyst are found to be higher compared to the unsupported catalyst . the molecular weight distribution index is in the range of <nUm> - <nUm> . the active site concentration of the supported catalyst was found to be five times lower than that of the unsupported catalyst . 
the olefin polymerization catalytic system iPr(CpFluo)ZrCl <nUm> / MAO was investigated by UV / visible absorption spectroscopy in solvents of various polarity at <nUm> ° C . it was shown that the UV / visible main absorption band of the zirconocene , which can be related to the ligand to metal charge transfer bands ( LMCT ) , varies greatly upon incremental addition of MAO or AlMe <nUm> . for low [ AlMe <nUm> ] / [Zr] or [MAO] / [Zr] ratios ( Al : Zr < <nUm> ) , a hypsochromic shift of the initial iPr(CpFluo)ZrCl <nUm> absorption band , corresponding to the monomethylation of the metallocene dichloride , is observed . on the contrary , for higher Al / Zr ratios ( with MAO uniquely ) , a bathochromic shift of the metallocene absorption band proceeding in two distinct steps is observed . these two steps are interpreted by the successive formation of associated ( or complexed ) and dissociated active zirconocenium species . the changes in the absorption spectra of iPr(CpFluo)ZrCl <nUm> / MAO are correlated with the initial activity observed for hex-1-ene polymerization in the various solvents examined . In the same way , the catalytic activity loss with polymerization time observed at elevated Al / Zr ratios ( > <nUm> ) with this system is attributed to a reduction of active species concentration , as indicated by the intensity decrease of their UV / visible absorption band . this reveals the low stability of active species formed from iPr(CpFluo)ZrCl <nUm> compared to those from rac - Et(Ind) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> . 
propylene / 1-hexene copolymers were prepared with the isospecific Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst by using a wide range of solvents . In the order of increasing dielectric constant ( ε ) they are : heptane ( 1.92 ) , methylcyclohexane ( 2.02 ) , toluene ( 2.38 ) , chlorobenzene ( CB ) ( 5.68 ) , methylene chloride ( 8.93 ) and o-dichlorobenzene ( o-DCB ) ( 10.12 ) . the effect of solvent structure and polarity on yield , composition , and microstructure of copolymers was investigated . the data show that solvent polarity , which has an enormous effect on the activity , has a negligible effect on the copolymer composition . very close 1-hexene contents are obtained with all the solvents used except for toluene , in which the comonomer content is remarkably lower than that in the other solvents for all compositions . detailed 13C NMR analysis of the copolymers obtained was performed : the reactivity ratios obtained by statistical elaboration of the experimental values of triad and tetrad comonomer compositions confirm the actual lower accessibility of the active site to 1-hexene in toluene than in the other solvents . this fact can be explained by the competition of the nucleophilic toluene with 1-hexene in the coordination to the active site . 
our work of the last two years concerning the use of zirconocene catalysts in the production of polyethylene ( PE ) is reviewed . In earlier studies , using Cp2ZrCl2 , the metal loading capacity of different commercial silicas , namely grace <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> was determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) . the adsorption isotherms of Al from methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) cocatalysts were determined using the 27Al(p , g)28Si nuclear reaction at <nUm> MeV . In the present work we could determine the Al / Si ratio with the simultaneous induction of nuclear reactions with 27Al and 28Si using protons of <nUm> MeV . after replacing Cp2ZrCl2 by (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 , an exhaustive search of activation , grafting and polymerization conditions ( monitored by RBS , infrared spectroscopy , differential scanning calorimetry , and gel permeation chromatography ) allowed us to set an optimized protocol that yielded polyethylene with thermal , molecular weight and composition characteristics typical of high - density PE . 
the addition of an amine NH - functionality to alkenes ( including vinyl arenes , conjugated dienes , allenes or ring - strained alkenes ) , the so - called hydroamination , represents a simple and highly atom - economical approach for the synthesis of nitrogen - containing products . A large variety of catalyst systems are available , ranging from alkali , alkaline earth , rare earth , group <nUm> and group <nUm> metals , to late transition metal catalysts , and , less prominent , bronsted and lewis acid - based catalyst systems . the mode of operation of these catalyst systems can vary significantly and the different reaction mechanisms and the scope and limitations are discussed . while intramolecular hydroamination reactions can be readily achieved with a large number of catalyst systems , significantly fewer examples for the more challenging intermolecular hydroamination are known , especially for unactivated alkenes . the stereoselective hydroamination has also received significant attention due to the importance of chiral nitrogen - containing molecules in pharmaceutical industry . A variety of highly selective chiral catalyst systems have been developed for intramolecular hydroaminations , while examples of intermolecular asymmetric hydroaminations are scarce . hydroamination in the context of this review article is defined as the addition of HNR2 across a non-activated , unsaturated carbon-carbon multiple bond . this review focuses on the hydroamination reaction of simple , non-activated alkenes . the addition of amines to slightly activated alkenes , such as vinyl arenes , 1,3-dienes , strained alkenes ( norbornene derivatives , methylenecyclopropenes ) and allenes is closely related and is covered as well . however , hydroamination reactions of alkynes and aza - michael reactions involving the addition of an N-H fragment across the conjugated or otherwise activated double bond of a michael acceptor are not covered . the scope of amine types includes ammonia , primary and secondary aliphatic and aromatic amines , azoles , and hydrazines . N - protected amines , such as ureas , carboxamides , and sulfonamides are covered as well , as they are important substrates for metal - free and late transition metal - based catalysts . the literature through january <nUm> will be covered with two selected references from <nUm> ( comprising table 3D ) . A supplemental reference list is provided for reports appearing february <nUm> through april <nUm> . the chapter is organized by the nature of the carbon unsaturation to which the amine is added . ranging from less reactive substrates such as ethylene and unactivated alkenes , to slightly activated substrates , such as vinyl arenes , and more activated substrates , including conjugated dienes , allenes and strained alkenes . enantioselective hydroamination reactions , an area that has seen significant progress over the past decade , are discussed next . finally , tandem hydroamination / carbocyclization reactions of aminodialkenes provide rapid access to complex alkaloidal skeletons . the tables at the end of the chapter are separated into five main sections : achiral intermolecular hydroamination , achiral intramolecular hydroamination , enantioselective intermolecular hydroamination , enantioselective intramolecular hydroamination , and tandem hydroamination / carbocyclization . within the first four sections the tables are further divided into subsections based on the participating alkene , i.e. alkenes , vinyl arenes , dienes , allenes , and strained alkenes . 
the ab initio hartree - fock theory has been demonstrated to give accurate geometry predictions for bridged zirconocene dichlorides . equilibrium geometries of crystallographically characterized bridged zirconocene dichlorides were optimized by hartree - fock , MP2 , BLYP , and B3LYP methods , with basis sets ranging from 3-21G* to 6-311G** . selected geometrical parameters were compared with experimental crystal structures . the least expensive HF / 3-21G* method proved to be notably accurate . the accuracy of HF / 3-21G* was verified by a comprehensive data set of <nUm> bridged zirconocene dichlorides . furthermore , experimental corrections were applied to the optimized geometry parameters to eliminate systematic deviations . corrections resulted in considerably improved accuracy for systematically overestimated metal - ligand distances , with maximum deviation falling from <nUm> to <nUm> Å , and absolute average deviations from <nUm> to <nUm> A. ligand - metal - ligand angles were predicted accurately with absolute average deviations of <nUm> - <nUm> ° . zirconium-chlorine distances and chlorine-zirconium-chlorine angles are relatively constant in the studied molecules . zirconium-cyclopentadienyl distances can be influenced mainly by modifying the ligand structure , whereas cyclopentadienyl-zirconium-cyclopentadienyl angles and cyclopentadienyl-cyclopentadienyl plane angles can be controlled by bridge modifications . the HF / 3-21G* method can be applied for the estimation of steric effects in zirconocene catalyzed polymerization reactions , therefore being suitable for the construction of structure - polymerization property correlations . 
[ Me2C(Cp) (Ind)]ZrCl2 metallocene catalyst has been prepared and employed in a study of ethene polymerization in the presence of the cocatalyst methylaluminoxane . C1 and C2 signals are detected in the 13C NMR spectra of the resultant polymers ; this reveals that the resultant polymer is a branched polyethene ( polyethylene ) . the influence of polymerization temperature , catalyst concentration and [Al] / [Zr] ratio on catalytic activities and polymerization kinetics is investigated . A plausible mechanism for forming branched polyethene is suggested . 
zirconocene dichloride and bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride are used as catalyst precursors for the heterogeneous polymerization of ethene . A methyl-substituted microgel as support material for heterogeneous cocatalysts on the basis of MAO is compared with different commercially available silica - supported cocatalysts . the catalyst performances and the properties of the obtained polyethenes show considerable differences . 
poly-a - olefins ranging from poly-1-pentene to poly-1-octadecene with narrow polydispersities were synthesized with (CH3)2Si(2-methylbenze[e]indenyl)2ZrCl2 and methylaluminoxane at polymerization temperatures ( tp 's ) ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C and were characterized by gel permeation chromatography , NMR spectroscopy , and differential scanning calorimetry . the molar masses of the homopolymers obtained with (CH3)2Si(2-methylbenz[e]indenyl)2ZrCl2 were notably higher than those of poly-a - olefins synthesized with other zirconium - based metallocenes under similar conditions . the temperature dependence of the molar mass distribution of the poly-a - olefins can be described by a common exponential decay function regardless of the investigated monomer . At tp 's ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C , moderate isotacticity prevailed , but outside this temperature range , the polymers were less stereoregular . 
ethene homopolymerization and copolymerization with 1-hexene were catalyzed by methyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl ( cp ) zirconium dichlorides , (RnC5H5-n)2ZrCl2 ( Rn = H , me , 1,2-Me2 , 1,3-Me2 , 1,2,3-Me3 , 1,2,4-Me3 , me4 , or me5 ) , and methylaluminoxane . the polymers were characterized with fourier transform infrared , nuclear magnetic resonance , gel permeation chromatography , and differential scanning calorimetry techniques . generally , an increasing number of methyl substituents on the cp ligand results in lower 1-hexene incorporation in the copolymer . the two catalysts with split methyl substitution ( Rn = 1,3-Me2 and Rn = 1,2,4-Me3 ) show a higher comonomer response than their disubstituted and trisubstituted counterparts ( Rn = 1,2-Me2 and r = 1,2,3-Me3 ) . they even incorporate more 1-hexene than Rn = H and Rn = me . these findings are qualitatively in agreement with the results of a theoretical study based on density functional calculations . the presence of comonomer does not influence the termination reactions after the insertion of ethene . there is more frequent termination after each hexene insertion with increasing comonomer incorporation except for the two catalysts with split methyl substituents . the termination probability per inserted comonomer is highest for the less substituted catalysts . 
three kinds of Cl2Mg - supported trivalent titanocene catalyst ( cat . <nUm> : Cp2TiCl2AlCl2 / Cl2Mg , cat . <nUm> : CpCp*TiCl / Cl2Mg , cat . <nUm> : Cp2TiCl / Cl2Mg ) were prepared and tested for propylene polymerization . it was found that cat . <nUm> , combined with ordinary alkylaluminum as cocatalyst , produced PP containing <nUm> wt % of isotactic PP in fairly good yield . on the other hand , cats . <nUm> and <nUm> hardly showed any activity . the effects of diisopropyldimethoxysilane ( DIPDMS ) on isospecificity of the cat . <nUm> also were investigated . the isotactic index ( I.I . ) of PP was improved drastically by the addition of DIPDMS as external donor and reached the value as high as <nUm> % , even in the absence of any internal donors . 
1-Hexene was polymerized by rac-(dimethylsilyl)bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride catalyst and methylaluminoxane cocatalyst over the temperature range 0-100 ° C . the polymerization rate , polymer molecular weight , and polymer microstructure ( stereospecificity and regiospecificity ) were studied as a function of the temperature and the concentrations of monomer , catalyst , and cocatalyst . 
A series of Me4Cp-amido complexes [ e5:e1-(Me4C5)SiMe 2NR]TiCl2 ; r = t-Bu , <nUm> ; C6H5 , <nUm> ; C6F5 , <nUm> ; SO2Ph , <nUm> ; or SO2Me , <nUm> were prepared and investigated for olefin polymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . x-ray crystallography of complexes <nUm> and <nUm> revealed very long Ti - N bonds relative to the bonds of <nUm> . these complexes were employed for ethylene-styrene copolymerizations , styrene homopolymerizations , and propylene homopolymerizations in the presence of MAO . the productivities of the catalysts derived from 3-5 were much lower than the productivity of the catalyst derived from <nUm> for the propylene polymerizations and ethylene-styrene copolymerizations , whereas the styrene polymerization activities were much higher for the catalysts derived from 3-5 than for the catalyst derived from <nUm> . the polymerization behavior of the catalysts derived from the metallocenes 3-5 were more reminiscent of monocyclopentadienyl titanocene CpTiX3 / MAO catalysts than of CpATiX2 / MAO catalysts such as <nUm> containing alkylamido ligands . J polym sci A : polym chem <nUm> : 4649-4660 , <nUm> . 
the synthesis and characterization of rac-[ethylenebis(1-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-3-indenyl)] zirconium dichloride is reported . the silyl substituted <nUm> / MAO was compared to its siloxy substituted analogue in ethylene homo- and in ethylene-1-hexene copolymerizations to elucidate the effect of the heteroatom on polymerization performance . the influence of monomer and cocatalyst concentration and the polymerization temperature was investigated . the oxygen between the indenyl ligand and the bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl group in the siloxy substituted <nUm> / MAO was found to have a positive influence on polymerization activity and copolymerization performance . 
n-pyrrolyllithium ( 1 ) adds to BC18F15 to yield [(C4H4N)B(C6F5)3]Li ( 3 ) . the corresponding monoetherate ( 3*OEt2 ) was characterized by x-ray diffraction and shows an e5 coordination of the pyrrolyl moiety to the lithium cation . treatment of <nUm> with ClH in ether leads to H+ addition at a pyrrolyl a-position to yield the neutral dipolar bronsted acid system [(C4H5N)B(C6F5)3] ( 4 ) . the reagent <nUm> can be used to protonate Cp2Zr(CH3)3 to yield [ Cp2Zr(CH3)+(C4H 4N)B-(C6F5)3- ] ( 6 ) and methane . H+ transfer from <nUm> to (butadiene)-zirconocene results in the formation of the (p-allyl)metallocene salt [ (C4H7)ZrCp2+(C4H 4N)B(C6Fs)3- ] ( 8 ) . In analogous reactions , the neutral bronsted acid was employed as a protonating activator component for the generation of homogeneous ziegler catalysts derived from a variety of (butadiene)-or (dimethyl)ansa-metallocenes . the systems generated by treatment with <nUm> show comparable activities in ethene or propene polymerization reactions as conventionally generated group <nUm> metallocene ziegler catalysts . 
the ab initio hartree - fock method has been utilized to rationalize the conformational preferences of racemic ethylene-bridged bis(indenyl) - type zirconocenes in dichloride and cationic methyl forms . this group of catalysts is characterized by conformational isomerism due to fluxionality of the ethylene bridge resulting in two distinct orientations of the indenyl ligands , indenyl-forward ( π ) and indenyl-backward ( υ ) . A systematic investigation of the influence of methyl and trialkylsiloxy substitution on the relative stabilities of π and υ conformations was performed . for the dichloride catalyst precursors the stabilities and orientations of the equilibrium structures are determined on the basis of repulsive interactions within the ligand framework . In the cationic methyl intermediates of the olefin polymerization catalytic cycle , the electron - rich indenyl ligand appears to reduce the electron deficiency of the cation by tilting towards the metal . 
the P-H - functionalized 2-(phosphanyl)ethanethiols RHPCH2-CH2SH [ r = ph ( 1 ) , 2,4,6-Me3C6H2 ( mes ) ( 2 ) , 2,4,6-iPr3C6H2 ( tipp ) ( 3 ) ] were prepared by ring cleavage of ethylene sulfide with LiPHR , followed by hydrolytic workup and distillation . 1-3 react with [Cp2TiCl2] in the presence of excess NEt3 to yield a diastereomeric mixture ( ratio ca. <nUm> : <nUm> ) of rac- and meso-[Cp2Ti(SCH2CH2PHR)2] [ r = ph ( 4 ) , mes ( 5 ) , tipp ( 6 ) ] . <nUm> is not obtained in pure form . compound <nUm> reacts with [Cu(CH3CN)4]BF4 to yield [ Cu{P,P'-PHPhCH2CH2-SB(FH)SCH2CH 2PPh(B-P)}2]BF4 ( 7 ) . 1-7 were characterized spectroscopically . <nUm> exhibits dynamic behavior in solution , as shown by 31P NMR spectroscopy . crystal structure determinations were carried out on <nUm> and <nUm> . In <nUm> , both diastereomers cocrystallize in the asymmetric unit . although the cation of <nUm> has six chiral centers , only the ( RP,RP,RP,RP,RB,R B ) / ( SP,SP,SP,SP,SB,S B ) diastereomer is present in the solid state . 
the metallocene alkyne complexes [Cp2M(L)(e2-Me3SiC2R)] react with diisobutylaluminium hydride at room temp. by addition of HAl(iBu)2 to yield the heterobimetallic complexes [ {Cp2M}(m-e1:e2-RC C SiMe3)(m-H){Al(iBu)2} ] [ {Cp2M} : (e5C5H5)2Ti , r = ph <nUm> , r = SiMe3 <nUm> ; {Cp2M} : (e5-C5H5)2Zr , r = SiMe3 <nUm> ; {Cp2M} : (ebthi)Zr , r = SiMe3 <nUm> ] { ebthi : rac-[1,2ethylene-1,1'-bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl)] } . complexes 1-4 were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> investigated by x-ray crystal structure analysis . compounds 1-4 were tested as initiators in the ring - opening polymerization of lactones . the results are discussed in comparison to the corresponding monometallic titanocene and zirconocene alkyne complexes . 
this paper describes the synthesis of a series of titanium and zirconium metallocenes bearing one or two first - generation silane dendritic wedges as bulky substituents at their cyclopentadienyl rings . wedges (R2R'SiCH2CH2)3SiCl [ r = R' = et ( 1 ) ; r = ph , R' = me ( 2 ) ] were prepared by hydrosilylation of chlorotrivinylsilane with R2R'SiH . they were reacted with K(C5H5 and , subsequently , with KH to give K[(R2R'SiCH2 CH2)3Si(C5H4) ] [ r = R' = et ( 3 ) ; r = ph , R' = me ( 4 ) ] . the dendronized cyclopentadienides <nUm> and <nUm> were the starting materials for preparation of the mixed - ring titanocenes [ { ( R2R'SiCH2 CH2)3SiC5H4 } (C5R''5)TiCl2 ] [ r = R' = et , R'' = H ( 5 ) , R'' = me ( 6 ) ; r = ph , R' = me , R'' = H ( 7 ) , R'' = me ( 8 ) ] or the symmetrically substituted metallocenes [ { ( Ph2MeSiCH2 CH2)3SiC5 H4}2MCl2 ] [ m = Ti ( 9 ) , Zr ( 10 ) ] . cyclic voltammograms and catalytic behavior of all the new metallocenes in ethylene polymerization , using MAO as a co-catalyst , have been studied and compared to that of related non-dendritic complexes . polyethylene polydispersities increase with the number of dendritic wedges in the catalyst , while activities decrease . bimodal molecular weight distributions were clearly observed for the bis-dendritic titanocene <nUm> . 
the 4-fulvenyl[2.2]paracyclophane ( 1 ) was transformed , by treatment with lithium aluminium hydride and methyllithium in tetrahydrofuran , to the corresponding cyclopentadienyl anions <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . the iron complex <nUm> was prepared from <nUm> , while <nUm> was converted into the metal complexes <nUm> ( Fe complex ) , <nUm> ( Ti ) , <nUm> ( Zr ) , <nUm> ( Ti ) , and <nUm> ( Zr ) . all new metallocene complexes were characterized by their spectroscopic data . In addition , a single crystal x-ray crystallographic analysis was performed for complex <nUm> . the metallacyclic zirconocene complex <nUm> was synthesized by the reaction of the dichloride derivative <nUm> with two equivalents of n-butyllithium . after activation of complexes 10-13 and <nUm> with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) they were used for the catalytic polymerization of ethene and propene . 
bis[(5-hexenyl)cyclopentadienyl]zirconium dichloride ( 3 ) underwent ring - closure olefin metathesis with loss of ethylene when treated with <nUm> mol % of the [ Cl2(PCy3)2Ru = CHPh ] catalyst in refluxing dichloromethane , to yield the large ansa - zirconocene complex [dec-5-ene-1,10-diylbis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)]ZrCl2 ( trans-4 ) . characterization by NMR and by x-ray diffraction revealed that the isolated complex contained a trans-C = C double bond inside the ansa bridge . similarly , bis[(allyl)cyclopentadienyl]ZrCl2 ( 7 ) gave the ansametallocene [but-2-ene-1,4-diylbis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)]zirconium dichloride ( cis-8 ) when treated with the same ruthenium metathesis catalysts ( <nUm> mol % ) under similar conditions , except that a cis-C = C double bond was now found to be present ( shown by NMR and x-ray diffraction ) . the cis-8 complex was used as a homogeneous ziegler - natta catalyst for ethylene polymerization [ after activation of the metallocene dichloride <nUm> with MAO ( methylalumoxane ) or treatment of the corresponding dimethylmetallocene complex <nUm> with BC18F15 ] . complex <nUm> was also converted into a mixture of ( scis- and s-trans-e4-butadiene)-ansa-metallocene complexes ( s-cis-15 / s-trans-15 = <nUm> : <nUm> ) by treatment with (butadiene)-magnesium . the C = C double bond of cis-8 could be hydroborated with 9-BBN or with the H-B(C6F5)2 reagent . Li+[B(C6F5)4-] added to cis-8 to yield an interesting solid - state chain structure in which the [Zr]Cl2 unit and the o- / mF pairs of two -C6F5 groups were found to be in contact with the central lithium cation in a distorted octahedral coordination environment ( as shown by x-ray diffraction ) . 
(Butadiene)zirconocene ( s-trans- / s-cis-1 equilibrium mixture ) reacts with the imine MeN = CHPh ( 7a ) to form the <nUm> : <nUm> carbon-coupling product [ kN-MeN-CHPh-CH2-e3- (CHCHCH2)]ZrCp2 ( 8a ) . the x-ray crystal structure analysis of 8a revealed a metallacyclic structure featuring a distorted p-allyl moiety and a planar - tricoordinate nitrogen atom . only one of the two possible diastereoisomers is found in the crystal ( cis-8a ) as well as in solution . treatment of <nUm> with the more bulky aldimine PhCH2N = CHPh ( 7b ) selectively gave the corresponding <nUm> : <nUm> addition product trans-8b . ketimines PhCH2N = C5H8 ( 7c ) , HN = CPh2 ( 7d ) , or d1-2-methylpyrroline ( 7e ) also reacted selectively with (butadiene)zirconocene to yield the analogous metallacyclic C-C coupling products 8c-e . treatment of 8e with BC18F15 proceeded cleanly by abstraction of a hydride anion from the carbon atom α to the nitrogen atom to form the intramolecularly coordinated imine product 10a { with the [HB(C6F5)3-] anion } . similarly , Ph3C+ abstracts a hydride ion from 8e to yield 10b { isolated with the [B(C6H5)4-] anion } . proton addition from HNR3+ reagents takes place selectively at the Zr - amido nitrogen atom of the complexes 8a or 8d to yield the substituted (p-allyl)zirconocene cation complexes <nUm> or <nUm> , respectively . the cationic complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> polymerize ethene at room temperature / <nUm> bar of ethene with moderate catalytic activities . ( 
In a single experiment , several supported zirconocene catalysts for a-olefin polymerization can be evaluated by a combinatorial concept . polyethylene particles produced by fluorescent dye tagged catalysts can be easily identified by their emission color , separated , and characterized ( see fluorescence microscope image ) . 
new C1 - symmetric metallocenes such as [ Me2C(PhCp)(Flu)ZrCl2 , [Me3Pen(Flu)]ZrCl2 , [PhMe3Pen(Flu)]ZrCl2 were synthesized and used for the polymerization of propene by higher polymerization temperatures . different polypropylene micro structures were obtained . important for industrial processes are the high molecular weights of the polymers produced by the pentalenelike catalysts , which are very stable by higher temperatures . for synthesis of syndiotactic polystyrene and new substituted half - sandwich titanocenes are used such as 1,3-Me2-CpTiCl3 , Me4CpTiCl3 , PhCpTiCl3 , cyclohexyl-CpTiCl3 . if they are fluorinated , the activity for the production of syndiotactic polystyrene can be increased <nUm> times . the synthesized polymer shows a high melting point of <nUm> ° C . 
the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) in toluene with Cp2ZrMe2 ( 1 ) - Ph3C+B(C6 F5)4- ( 4 ) as initiating system was kinetically investigated . this system can be regarded as a combination of the systems described by collins and soga . only if the ratio of <nUm> / <nUm> was larger than <nUm> , monomer conversions of more than <nUm> % and polymers with number - average molecular weights higher than <nUm> <nUm> and polydispersities <nUm> - <nUm> were obtained . from a kinetic analysis of time - conversion curves using the software package predici , it can be deduced that the mechanism is consistent with that proposed by collins et al. however , the mechanism has to be extended by incorporating a first - order termination reaction of the active species . rate coefficients of all elementary reactions were determined from time - conversion curves . the kinetic investigations were accompanied by ab initio calculations , which support the assumed kinetic model . 
combined systems including diphenylzinc , Ph2Zn , a metallocene , and methylaluminoxane , MAO , have been employed to initiate styrene polymerization . these initiator systems have been also used to initiate the copolymerization of styrene with p-alkylsubstituted styrenes and with a-olefins . both polymerization and copolymerization processes depend on the nature of the metallocene included in the initiator system , the presence of Ph2Zn , the temperature and the solvent used . titanocenes produced syndiotactic polystyrene , s-PS , while zirconocenes gave atactic polystyrene , a-PS , with a certain content , less the <nUm> % of s-PS . for copolymerizations the conversion to polymer was also influenced by the comonomer nature and its molar proportion in the initial feed , as well as the sort of metallocene , titanocene or zirconocene included . 
sterically hindered olefins like norbornene , dimethanooctahydronaphthalene ( DMON ) , 4-methylpentene , and 3-methylbutene can be copolymerised with ethene by metallocene / MAO catalysts . different C2- , cs- and C1 - symmetric and meso-zirconocenes were used . only isolated and alternating norbornene sequences but no norbornene blocks are formed by substituted [Me2C(Cp-R)(Flu)]ZrCl2 catalysts . the alternating microstructure leads to melting points up to <nUm> ° C for ethene - norbornene copolymers and up to <nUm> ° C for the semi ycrystalline alternating copolymer of ethene and DMON . other sterically hindered olefins such as 3-methylpentene build more blocky structures with high glass transition temperatures . the mechanism for the insertion reaction of the different catalysts is discussed . 
the combination of the copolymerisation ability and vinyl end group selectivity of siloxy substitution of ethylene-bridged bis(indenyl) zirconium dichlorides suggest these catalyst as potential ones for the production of polyethylene containing small amounts of long chain branching . the role of the polymerisation conditions with these highly active catalysts can clearly be seen . furthermore low contents of multiple branches may occur , even though the probability of attaching several macromonomers into one chain is low . the effect on melt rheological behaviour depends on both the amount of long chain branching and the length of the branch . moreover the position of the siloxy group is very important . polymers synthesized with catalysts , where the siloxy group is in position <nUm> , give peculiar rheological behaviour resembling cross-linked networks although the polymers are completely soluble . 
the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) with the neutral enolate cp 2ZrMe[OC(OMe) = CMe <nUm> ] in the absence and in the presence of zirconocene cations cp 2ZrMe + to bypass the rate- limited initiation of the system was investigated . only by itself the enolate is not active in polymerization , but as soon as the reaction system contains the cation MMA is quantitatively converted into syndiotactic - rich PMMA with high molecular weight ( m n > <nUm> <nUm> g mol <nUm> ) and very narrow molecular weight distribution ( m w / m n < <nUm> ) . the rate of polymerization was found to be first order reffering to the neutral enolate and also reffering to the cation . rate coefficents of all elementary reactions were determined and compared to those received by the kinetic investigation of the polymerization using the initiator system cp 2ZrMe <nUm> / ph 3CB ( C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> . the agreement of both sets of calculated coefficients is satisfying . these results confirm that the mechanism of collins et al. is suitable to describe the properties of the polymerization process . 
the copolymerization of propene with small amounts of ethene , catalyzed by tetrahydroindenyl zirconocenes such as [En(H4Ind)2]ZrCl22 or [Me2Si(H4Ind)2]ZrCl2 and MAO in liquid propene produces polymers with much higher activities and molecular weights than the homopolymerization of propene . the normal bisindenyl complexes does n't present such differences . the investigation of the microstructure shows for the tetrahydroindenyl catalyst that after a 2,1-insertion of a propene unit the system is in a sleeping state and can be activated when an ethene unit is inserted . In this case these catalysts become faster than the ansa bis-indenyl catalysts . an active catalyst for the copolymerization of ethene and norbornene is the more temperature stable [Me3PhPen(Flu)]ZrCl2 . this catalyst produces atactic copolymers with high molecular weights of ' over <nUm> <nUm> g / mol at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> mol % of norbornene content . 
A series of asymmetric ansa - zirconocene dichlorides were investigated in propene polymerization reactions with respect to monomer concentration and polymerization temperature . the two different coordination sides of these " dual - side " catalysts allow a precise control of the total amount of randomly distributed isolated stereoerrors along the isotactic polymer chains leading to bulk properties which can be adjusted from flexible , semicrystalline to excellent thermoplastic elastic . the obtained homopolypropenes have a great potential to come into competition with commercialized copolymers for possible industrial applications . 
Meso-[Me2Si(2-Me-4,6-iPr2Ind)2 Cl2Zr was synthesized in a pure form and used as catalyst for the copolymerization of ethene and a-olefins . the results are compared with polymers obtained by C1 - symmetric metallocenes and constrained geometry catalysts . the activity of the meso form is remarkable high and reaches more than <nUm> <nUm> kg polymer / mol zr*h . the ligand structure has large influence on the incorporation of 1-octene forming thermoplastics ( LLDPE ) and thermoplastic elastomers ( POE ) . 
this work presents a proposal for a mechanism of olefin polymerization using metallocenes , taking into account the effect of the counter ion , solvent , and olefin . the ystenes mechanism is also evaluated for the different symmetries of zirconocenes and for soluble and supported catalysts . the mechanism is related to experimental evidence and analyzed taking into account publisbed results about polymer characterization , kinetic evidence , and other experimental facts . the model tries to give a reasonable explanation for the different dependencies of the kinetics on the monomer : between <nUm> and <nUm> for Cs and C2 catalysts and <nUm> for c2v . 
bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconocene dimethyl ( Cp2ZrMe2 ) combined with triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] ) was brought into contact with a suspension of <nUm> % cross-linked poly(4-vinylpyridine) to give a new type of polymer - supported cationic zirconocene catalyst . the resulting polymer - supported catalyst system combined with Al(i-Bu3) showed markedly high activity for ethylene polymerization in even a non-polar solvent like hexane at 25-60 ° C and [Al] / [Zr] molar ratio 40-200 . by the analysis of Zr content of the hexane solution , it was found that no Zr was detected in the solution , i.e. no leaching of the cationic catalyst into the hexane medium . the catalytic activity was found to increase with an increase of polymerization temperature and showed the highest at [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> . the molecular weight , crystalline melting temperature , crystallinity , and bulk density of polyethylene formed were higher than those of the polymer obtained from the homogeneous system . 
the cationic bridged zirconocene complex [iPr(Cp)(Ind)Zr(Me)(THF)][BPh4] ( 1-BPh4 ) was synthesized . polymerization of methyl methacrylate with 1-BPh4 in CCl2H2 at temperatures between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C led to the formation of isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate ) . the low polydispersity index of the polymer obtained and a successful two step polymerization of methyl methacrylate with 1-BPh4 are hints towards a living polymerization mechanism . 1H and 13C NMR analysis revealed an enantiomorphic site - controlled mechanism for the formation of isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate ) . 
ethylene was polymerized with cycloalkylidene-bridged cyclopentadienyl metallocene catalysts 1-9 in the presence of methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) as the cocatalyst . unlike the normal titanocene catalysts , the cycloalkylidene-bridged cyclopentadienyl titanocene catalysts show much higher activities than the corresponding zirconocene and hafnocene catalysts and show the highest activities at higher temperature . this indicates that the cycloalkylidene-bridged cyclopentadienyl titanocene system is very thermally stable and maybe a very promising catalyst system for industrial application . 
C2 - symmetric zirconocenes activated by methylaluminoxane were utilized as catalysts in the polymerization of 1,3-diolefins . the results indicate that the most crowded catalytic precursor rac[CH2(3-tertbutyl-1-indenyl)2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) is also the most active one , giving 1,4-polymerization of 1,3-butadiene and (Z)-1,3-pentadiene and 1,2-polymerization of (E)-1,3-pentadiene and 4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene . probably , the different behavior of <nUm> with respect to other C2 - symmetric zirconocenes utilized is due to the different stability of the bond between the last inserted monomer unit and the metal , as well as to the coordination of incoming monomer . 
In this review , various synthetic and structural aspects of methylaluminoxane and the elementary processes involved in olefin polymerization , as identified by various spectroscopic techniques , are detailed . various boron - based counterions and their interactions with metal - locenium cations are discussed . A comparison between MAO and boron - based activators in terms of catalytic activity and polymer characteristics is made . finally , the use of the above system in the polymerization of cationically polymerizable monomers and acrylates is discussed . 
we report the first successful block copolymerization of ethylene and methyl methacrylate using a zirconocene - based catalyst system . the catalyst is generated in situ from Me2C(Cp)(Ind)ZrMe2 and BC18F15 in toluene . block copolymerization is achieved via the sequential addition of the monomers , starting with ethylene . the composition of the block copolymer is shown to be dependent on the time allowed for ethylene polymerization . the solubility of the resulting polymers , NMR data and GPC measurements are discussed , and a polymerization mechanism is proposed . 
the kinetics of the ethylene-norbornene copolymerization , catalyzed by rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO , <nUm> % rac / <nUm> % meso-Et(4,7-Me2Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO and rac-H2C(3-tert-BuInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO was followed by sampling from the reaction mixture at fixed time intervals . catalyst activity , copolymer composition and molar mass were studied as a function of time . the polymers showed an unusually low polydispersity and a significant increase in their molar mass with time , suggesting a quasi-living polymerization . 
the polymerization of vinyl chloride with Cp*TiX3 / MAO ( x = CH3O , C4H9O , OPh , Cl ) catalysts in CCl2H2 was investigated . the activity of the Cp*TiX3 / MAO catalytic systems depends on ligand x in that increased activity was found for increasing electron - donating capacity of x . the relationship between hammet 's sm of ligand x and polymer yield gave a straight line , indicating that the electronic effect of x plays an important role . 
the central purpose of this work is to develop an to attach the metallocene to a support without diminishing its catalytic activity . this article describes several methods to prepare supported EtInd2ZrCl2 ( EBI ) on MAO / O2Si , varying the washing step durations and washing step temperatures . the best method is the one that supports <nUm> % Zr on MAO / O2Si with a final content of Al near <nUm> % . it seems that this method combines high efficiency in MAO usage at the preparation step and high activity in propylene polymerization . the activity of the supported catalysts EBI / MAO / O2Si decreases to the third of the soluble catalysts EBI / MAO with the same Al / Zr molar ratio . Zr con tents higher than <nUm> % produce catalysts with lower productivities . probably , a MAO coverage in O2Si that is higher than a monolayer is not useful in order to stabilize the zirconocene on the MASO / O2Si support . this paper reports the kinetics of the supported catalysts and a discussion about the shape of the curves and the stability of the catalysts is appended . the molecular weight of the poly(propylene) obtained with supported catalyst increases , especially for the best preparation , comparing it with material obtained with the soluble one . the regioregularity of poly(propylene) increases when a lewis base ( ethyl benzoate-E.B . ) is added as external additive to the system EBI / MAO / O2Si and the activity of the supported catalyst is improved . 
this paper reports the effect of co- and non-copolymerizable lewis bases in propylene polymerization with the soluble system EtInd2ZrCl2 / MAO . with non-copolymerizable lewis bases , the activity and the molar mass of poly(propylene) are diminished . this result is unusual because there is agreement about the cationic nature of the active site in zirconocene / MAO systems and the effect of a lewis base must be to decrease the termination constant versus the propagation constant , considering the diminished electrophilicity of Zr . In the case of copolymerizable lewis bases , the negative effect on activity is higher . an explanation of the data is given , with a new model of lewis bases / cationic Zr interaction , taking account of recent reports about the structure of active sites . 
ethylene was polymerized using a combination of Ni(a-diimine)Cl2 ( 1 ) ( a-diimine = 1,4-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)acenaphthenediimine ) and rac-ethylene bis(IndH4)ZrCl2 ( 2 ) ( IndH4 = 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-ns-indenyl ) compounds , activated with methylaluminoxane in toluene . the polymerization were performed at three different temperatures ( <nUm> . 30. and <nUm> ° C ) , and the effect of varying the zirconium loading molar fraction ( xZr ) was monitored . the polymerization runs carried out of <nUm> and <nUm> ° C show that the productivity increases linearly with xZr . on the other hand , at <nUm> ° C the productivity reaches a maximum of <nUm> × <nUm> kg of PE / mol[M]*h for xZr = <nUm> , indicating a non-linear correlation between the productivity and xZr . the polyethylene characteristics have been evaluated by means of differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) , and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . the PE produced at <nUm> and <nUm> ° C showed monomodal molecular weight distributions with narrow polydispersities . At higher temperature ( <nUm> ° C ) , using xZr = <nUm> , two different polyethylenes were produced ; an amorphous rubbery PE with mw of <nUm> × <nUm> g*mol-1 and a linear high density PE with mw of <nUm> × <nUm> g*mol-1 . DSC thermograms of the PE obtained at <nUm> ° C ( xZr = <nUm> - <nUm> ) showed the presence of two melting points corresponding to branched and linear PE , indicating a low compatibility between the phases . by SEM it was observed that the branched polyethylene obtained at <nUm> ° C forms very small aggregates dispersed in the linear polyethylene matrix , but the polymer obtained at <nUm> ° C forms larger particles which show low compatibility with the linear polyethylene . 
phenol - functionalized polyethylenes were prepared by copolymerization of ethylene with 4-allylanisole in the presence of metallocene / MAO catalysis , followed by demethylation . anisole groups incorporated in polyethylene main chains were quantitatively converted to phenol functional groups by treating the copolymers with AlCl3 . the copolymerization of ethylene with 4-allylanisole revealed that the bridged metallocene catalyst seemed to favor the incorporation of the polar comonomer compared to the hindered metallocene catalyst . increase of the MAO concentration markedly enhanced the activity of the catalysts , but it diminished the incorporation of the polar comonomer . the end group analysis of the copolymers showed that chain transfer to aluminium occured more frequently than other chain transfer reactions . 
details of the preparation and polymerization behavior of two chiral zirconocene catalysts are presented . the results of experimental and molecular - mechanics evaluation of their stereoselectivity with respect to liquid - propene polymerization are compared with those of a related catalyst system . the elastic properties of the obtained amorphous poly(propylene) , due to the presence of small g-form crystallites , are compared with those of a highmolecular weight atactic poly(propylene) obtained in the presence of a c2v catalyst . 
propylene polymerization was conducted with the Cp2ZrHCl / BC18F15 / [tBuNSiMe2Flu]TiMe2 catalyst system with AlOct3 as a scavenger at <nUm> ° C . the polymer obtained displayed a bimodal molar mass distribution . it could be confirmed that the polymer with higher mn was produced from Zr active sites and the polymer with lower mn resulted from Ti active sites . In both fractions , mn was increased linearly with increasing polymerization time . the MWD ( mw / mn ) values of each fraction were around <nUm> . thus , it could be said that propylene polymerization proceeded in a living manner even with zirconocene active species by using the mixed metallocene system . the living like polymerization of propylene with Cp2ZrMe2 / BC18F15 / Cp*TiCl3 was also demonstrated at <nUm> ° C . under the reaction between carbon monoxide ( CO ) and this living polypropylene ( PP ) at <nUm> ° C , it could be found that CO was quantitatively incorporated into living PP . 
ethylene and butylene-1 were homo- and copolymerized using monotitanocene catalysts composed of e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl tribenzyloxytitanium [Cp*Ti(OBz)3] and two kinds of solid modified methyl-aluminoxane ( mMAO ) containing different amounts of residual trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) . the mMAO1 with lower TMA content to activate Cp*Ti(OBz)3 for homo- and co- polymerization of ethylene and butylene-1 showed higher activity and more butylene-1 incorporation in their copolymers than mMAO2 with higher TMA content . influences of copolymerization conditions including ethylene / butylene-1 ratio in the feed , polymerization temperature and Al / Ti molar ratio on activity , butylene-1 content in copolymers , molecular weight and molecular weight distribution , the triad and tetrad sequence distributions and butylene-1 content in the copolymers . the monomer reactivity ratios rE and rB ( e = ethylene . B = butylene-1 ) for ethylene / butylene-1 copolymerizations were estimated from the 13C NMR spectra . the Cp*Ti(OBz)3 / mMAO catalyst gave rise to rErB lower than <nUm> . A correlation between the reactivity ratios and mMAO composition was also made . the thermal properties of copolymers determined by DSC are mainly dependent on the butylene-1 content in the copolymers . 
propylene polymerization was conducted with CS symmetric (Ph2C)CpFluZrCl2 / B(C6 F5)3 / cp* TiMe3 system using AlOct3 as a scavenger at <nUm> ° C . the polymer produced was consisted by two kinds of fractions ; i.e. , hexane soluble ( atactic ) fraction and hexane insoluble fraction . the insoluble polymer had highly syndiotactic structure , indicating that the polymer was produced from CS symmetric zirconocene . mu 's increased linearly with increasing polymer yield , although the activity was low . thus , it could be said that syndiospecific polymerization of propylene proceeded in a living like manner with CS symmetric zirconocene active species by using the mixed metallocene system . and by the reaction of the syndiotactic poly(propylene) chain end with carbon monoxide ( CO ) , it could be found that CO was quantitatively incorporated into the syndioPP-Zr chain end . 
the polymerization of 1-hexene with the catalyst systems Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO and Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 / MAO is investigated in order to elucidate the nature of the active species in zirconocene / MAO catalyzed polymerizations . varying monomer concentration and monomer conversion does not result in any unexpected behavior . however , changing catalyst and cocatalyst concentration leads to broadened , or even bimodal , molecular weight distributions under certain reaction conditions . these results may be interpreted in terms of a coexistence of two active species with different rates of propagation and of termination . 
the effect of polymerization temperature on the polymerization of 1-hexene with the catalyst systems Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO , Me2SiCp2ZrCl2 / MAO , EtInd2ZrCl2 / MAO , Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 / MAO and 1PrCpFluZrCl2 / MAO is investigated in this paper . the molecular weight and the molecular weight distribution of poly(1-hexene) provide experimental evidence for a deviation from single - site behavior at certain polymerization temperatures , depending on the catalyst system . experimental results are interpreted in terms of different active species prevailing at different polymerization temperatures , and coexisting under certain reaction conditions . 
copolymerization of ethylene and cyclopentene ( CPE ) was carried out with various non-bridge and bridged zirconocene catalysts using methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst . non-bridged metallocene catalysts effected ethylene homopolymerization without copolymerization . on the other hand , bridged zirconocene catalysts produced copolymers containing cis-1,2-cyclopentane units . among the used catalysts , rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride [Et(Ind)2ZrCl2] gave copolymers containing the highest amount of CPE units by 1,2-insertion of 1,3-insertion . temperature - rising elution fractionation of the copolymers using 1,2-dichlorobenzene as a solvent showed a broad distribution of copolymer composition in copolymers obtained by specific zirconocene catalysts . 
A series of sila - bridged dinuclear zirconocenes [ E(C5H4)2[Cp'ZrCl2]2 ( Cp'C5H5 , e = Me2Si ( 1 ) Me2SiSiMe2 ( 2 ) , Me2SiOSiMe2 ( 3 ) , Me2SiOSiMe2OSiMe2 ( 4 ) Cp'C5HME4 , e = Me2SiOSiMe2 ( 5 ) , Me2SiOSiMe2OSiMe2 ( 6 ) ) have been synthesized . these complexes have been studied as catalysts for ethylene polymerizationin the presence of MAO . polymerization results indicated that the polymerization activity of the zirconocenes increased as the bridging ligand became longer for the same type of bridging ligands . complex <nUm> , holding trisiloxane bridging , exhibited greater activity than the mononuclear zirconocene [Cp2ZrCl2] . all the siloxane - bridged dinuclear zirconocenes showed the highest activity than at higher temperature ( <nUm> or <nUm> ° C ) in contrast to the corresponding siloxane - bridged dinuclear cyclopentadienyl and indenyl zirconocenes which showed a maximum activity at <nUm> ° C . the molecular weight of polyethylene with <nUm> was very high at low temperature ( <nUm> × <nUm> g · mol at <nUm> ° C ) but decreased significantly with increasing temperature . the molecular weight distributions obtained for polyethylene were similar with the mononuclear metallocene catalysts at low temperature . the tetramethylcyclopentadienyl complexes <nUm> and <nUm> showed lower polymerization activities than the corresponding cyclopentadienyl complexes <nUm> and <nUm> as a result of steric effects . the relationship between structure and catalytic properties of catalysts has been discussed . 
the solvent effect observed in propene / 1-hexene copolymerizations performed with the isospecific catalyst rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO is studied . A range of solvents with increasing donor character and steric hindrance has been tested , and their effect on copolymer yield , composition , and microstructure has been thoroughly analyzed . our results demonstrate that the solvent can have a significant influence on the comonomer reactivities , even though the solvent polarity is not the relevant factor . At the same comonomer compositions in solution , polymerization carried out in coordinating solvents ( e. g. , aromatic solvents ) , lead to the formation of products with considerably decreased content of 1-hexene . the reuced incorporation of the higher a-olifen is explained in terms of competition between the nucleophilic medium and the olefin monomer for coordination to the active polymerization site . these results give us valuable information regarding the mechanism of polymerization at the active centers . 
copolymerization of ethylene and 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) was carried out with non-bridged or bridged zirconocene catalysts using methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as a cocatalyst . the resulting copolymers were extracted with boiling o-dichlorobenzene ( ODCB ) to fractionate into soluble and insoluble parts . the ligand structure of zirconocenes , the feed ratio of HD , and the catalyst concentration strongly affected the copolymer composition . In the copolymerization with non-bridged zirconocene catalysts , the amount of boiling ODCB - soluble part decreased with increasing HD content in the copolymer . on the other hand , with bridged zirconocene catalysts , it increased with increasing HD content in the copolymer . the bridged zirconocene catalysts were apt to take in more HD than non-bridged catalysts . effect of catalyst concentration was investigated in relation to crosslinking reaction . temperature - rising elution fractionation ( TREF ) of the boiling ODCB - soluble part was conducted to show the occurrence of heterogenous composition in copolymers obtained with some specific zirconocene catalysts . 
three series of novel unbridged bicyclic cyclopentadienyl zirconium complexes , containing six- , seven- and eight - membered saturated rings fused to the cyclopentadienyl unit and bearing different substituents ( -H , -CH3 , -Ph ) in position <nUm> , were used in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) for the polymerization of propene at different temperatures . all the catalysts have been shown to be active , the lowest activity being observed with the eight - membered ring systems . with most catalysts the polymers obtained are fully atactic when the polymerizations are conducted at <nUm> ° C , and become partially isotactic at lower temperatures . the 13C NMR analysis shows that in one case , that is , when the seven - membered ring is associated with the phenyl substituent in position <nUm> , a preponderance of the isotactic heptad in the methyl region of 13C NMR spectrum is observed , which allows us to hypothesize the formation of stereoblocks . 
the copolymerization of propene with ethene in feed concentrations up to <nUm> mol- % ethene was investigated in dependence on catalyst substitution , activation and process conditions . polymerization reactions were performed using rac-[ethylene-bis(e5-1-indenyl)]ZrCl2 ( 1a ) , [bis(e5-1-indenyl)dimethylsilane]ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , and [bis(e5-1-(2-methylindenyl))dimethylsilane]ZrCl2 ( 3a ) after MAO- and rac-[ethylene-bis(e5-1-indenyl)]Zr(CH3)2 ( 1b ) as well as [bis-(e5-1-(2-methylindenyl))dimethylsilane]Zr CH3 ( 3b ) after borate - activation . A detailed study of the polymerization kinetics of the different metallocene catalysts was performed by using an autoclave system that allowed to follow the changes in concentration of propene and ethene in the gas and in the liquid phase , even for the first minutes of the polymerization experiments . it is known that 2-methyl substitution retards the rate of chain transfer to propene monomer , leading to increased molecular weights of the resulting homopolypropenes . however , the catalyst system 3a / MAO , bearing a CH3 - substituent in 2,2'-position of the indenyl moieties , shows a significant decline of the molecular mass of propene - ethene copolymers by rising the ethene concentration , while catalysts 1a and <nUm> , having no methyl substitution , give a distinct increase of molecular weight . our investigations show that the observed molecular weight decline is independent of the process conditions , but it depends clearly on the catalyst substitution and , in some cases , on the activation process . b-Hydride elimination to the Zr(IV) - center is the dominating chain termination process for metallocene catalysts bearing methyl groups in the 2,2'-position . chain termination via transfer to monomer and to aluminum are the preferred termination mechanisms for complexes lacking the CH3 substituents . 
copolymerizations of ethylene and 1,7-octadiene ( OD ) and 1,9-decadiene ( DD ) were investigated with various non-bridged and bridged zirconocene catalysts using methylisobutylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst . the resulting copolymers were extracted with boiling o-dichlorobenzene ( ODCB ) , and the structure of the boiling ODCB - soluble part was studied by 1H , 13C NMR and DEPT ( distortionless enhancement of polarization transfer ) spectroscopy . In the case of ethylene / OD copolymerization , the ligand structure of the zirconocene catalysts strongly affected the propagation mode of OD . the zirconocene catalysts having cyclopentadienyl or pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligands gave copolymers having 1-hexenyl and 1,3-disubstituted cycloheptane units , derived from 1,2-addition propagation and addition - cyclization propagation of OD , respectively . on the other hand , the zirconocene catalysts with indenyl ligand produced the copolymers having exclusively 1,3-disubstituted cycloheptane units . furthermore , the copolymer prepared by diphenylmethylene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride was crosslinked . the diastereostructure of the 1,3-disubstituted cycloheptane units in the copolymers was not influenced by the stereospecificity of the catalysts used , and a cis-structure was preferentially formed . In the case of the copolymerization of ethylene and DD , the c2v- symmetric zirconocene catalysts produced the copolymers with 1-octenyl branches derived from 1,2-addition propagation of DD . other C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocene catalysts with bulky ligands yielded copolymers with crosslinking structures derived form addition propagation of sidechain unsaturated bond of 1,2-added DD units .

this chapter underlines the role of the development of ideas and research efforts that have led to a success story in the advancement of metathesis chemistry and its applications . it includes examples of the most recent and major developments and applications of the various metathesis reactions , with emphasis on catalyst design and sustainable chemistry . chauvin 's mechanism applies to the whole range of olefin metathesis reactions , including cross metathesis ( CM ) , ring - closing metathesis ( RCM ) , acyclic diene metathesis polymerization ( ADMEP ) , ring - opening metathesis polymerization ( ROMP ) , enyne metathesis ( EYM ) , and ring - opening cross metathesis ( ROCM ) . the success of grubbs ' approach to stable benzylidene complexes containing the electrophilic benzylidene ligand may appear , by comparison , somewhat surprising , but it is due to the neutrality of the complexes , thus affording a considerably reduced electrophilicity of the carbene ligand compared to cationic complexes , and the great versatility of ruthenium that forms stable 16-electron complexes . 
N,O - chelated complexes of early transition metals have emerged as modular , tunable and rapidly assembled compounds for catalytic polymerization and hydrofunctionalization reactions . this simple ligand set can be installed onto reactive yttrium , titanium , zirconium and tantalum metal centers using protonolysis , or in some cases , salt metathesis reactions . the coordination chemistry of this asymmetric ligand set is ideally suited for catalysis in that these tight bite angle ligands are prone to accessing variable coordination modes and have fluxional behavior in solution phase . consequently , advances in catalytic ring - opening polymerization , hydroamination , and hydroaminoalkylation have been realized .

this chapter covers the area of ' polysilane chemistry ' , with a focus on recent studies . polysilanes are usually prepared by the wurtz - type reductive coupling of dichlorosilanes with alkali metals . controlling the microstructures of macromolecules is an important subject in polymer synthesis and a number of reports have addressed the control of the stereochemistry of polysilanes . the properties of polysilanes are extremely sensitive to the substituents , such as the heteroatoms attached to the s-conjugated polymer backbone . In this respect , the functional modification of polysilanes is quite interesting . substitution reactions onto polysilane chains could be a powerful method for the functional modification of polysilanes . polysilanes have unique characteristics that mainly originate from the s-conjugation along the main chain . hence , there is a strong relationship between the characteristics of polysilanes and their electronic states and conformations . the chapter describes some approaches to controlling the conformation of polysilanes , including oligosilanes as a simple mode . 
KGaA , weinheim . considerable gains have recently been made in the research of polymer catalysis which has emerged from the interaction of the fields of macromolecular , coordination and catalytic chemistry . using synthetic macromolecules one can create polymeric catalysts which function like enzymes and almost simulate their activity and selectivity . consequently , polymer catalysis could enable the high - yield manufacture of industrially important products at low - reaction volumes involving minimal energy consumption . catalytically active metal complexes fixed on polymeric supports can be essential in solving some important problems encountered by the chemical and petrochemical industry . heterogeneous metal complex catalysts can be regarded as a novel class of catalysts which combine the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems and which possess high activity and selectivity , specific character and stability in operation . hence , this area is a significant field of catalytic chemistry . this monograph intends to acquaint the reader with the basic material available in the field of catalysis . because this field was previously treated as a marginal area of polymer and catalytic chemistry , the authors mostly cite recent literature sources . it covers the catalytic properties of a broad class of functional polymers and their metalion complexes as well as ionite and heterogeneous ( polymer - supported ) metal - complex catalysis . the first chapter of the book deals with enzyme - like catalysis by synthetic polymers - catalysis by polymeric acids and bases , amphoteric polyelectrolytes and nonionic polymers . because coordination compounds of metal ions with macromolecular ligands are interesting with regard to bioinorganic chemistry , this book elucidates some problems involving the catalysis by water - soluble polymer - metal complexes . ester hydrolysis , hydrogen peroxide decomposition , oxidation of disubstituted phenols , hydroquinones , mercaptoalcohols and other types of reaction are chosen as model processes . A section devoted to interfacial catalysis is also included . the second chapter handles various problems regarding catalysis by ion - exchange resins . mechanisms of reactions involving acidic and basic resins are discussed . In respect of the wide use of anion - exchange resins as interfacial transfer catalysts , attention is paid to the specific nature of this reaction . similarities and differences in the catalysis of non-ionic resins and linear polyelectrolytes are shown . the third chapter presents different methods of production of heterogenized homogeneous catalysts from complexes of transition metals and polymer matrices . different ways of fixing a homogeneous metal complex on a polymeric support ( encapsulation , covalent bond , coordination bond , ion exchange and gel immobilization ) were investigated . the catalytic activity of group VIII metals fixed on different polymeric supports as well as the problems of their control are elaborated . In some cases the working mechanisms of heterogenized catalytic systems are analyzed . particular attention is paid to the effect of matrix isolation of catalytically active centers on the reactivity of heterogenized metal - complex catalysts , longevity and leaching problems as well as to methods of reducing leaching . the effect of the combined properties of a polymer matrix , metal ions and a solvent on catalyst activity and selectivity is depicted . In conclusion , general problems of the catalysis both by functional groups of polymers and by their metal complexes are discussed . an attempt is made to illustrate some characteristic properties of such metal complexes and to outline promising directions of research in this expanding field .

recent increases in the demand for mobile devices have stimulated the development of nonvolatile memory devices with high performance . In this communication , we describe the fabrication of low - cost , high - performance , digital nonvolatile memory devices based on semiconducting polymers , poly(o - anthranilic acid ) and poly(o - anthranilic acid-co-aniline ) . these memory devices have ground - breaking and novel current - voltage switching characteristics . the devices are switchable in a very low voltage range ( which is much less than those of all other devices reported so far ) with a very high ON / OFF current ratio ( which is on the order of <nUm> ) . the low critical voltages have the advantage for nonvolatile memory device applications of low operation voltages and hence low power consumption . with this very low power consumption , the devices demonstrate in air ambient to have very stable ON- and OFF - states without any degradation for a very long time ( which has been confirmed up to one year so far ) and to be repeatedly written , read and erased . our study proposes that the ON / OFF switching of the devices is mainly governed by a filament mechanism . the high ON / OFF switching ratio and stability of these devices , as well as their repeatable writing , reading and erasing capability with low power consumption , opens up the possibility of the mass production of high performance digital nonvolatile polymer memory devices with low cost . further , these devices promise to revolutionize microelectronics by providing extremely inexpensive , lightweight , and versatile components that can be printed onto plastics , glasses or metal foils .

electrochemical reactions in films of conducting polymers involve reactive chains , exchanging ions and solvent with the electrolyte under current flow . the reaction induces structural changes : conformational movements in chains and swelling , shrinking , compaction , and relaxation processes in the reactive dense gel . conformational movements and structural changes induced by reactions are not included by today 's chemical kinetic models . using different packed conformations as initial states for the study of the reaction kinetics in films of different conducting polymers , rate coefficients , activation energies , and reaction orders related to the concentration of active centers in the film change with the structure of the selected initial state . the kinetic magnitudes include and quantify conformational and structural energetic states . therefore , the reaction activation energy includes the constant reaction activation energy and the conformational energy of the initial packed state . the electrochemically stimulated conformational relaxation model describes the empirical variation of the kinetic magnitudes . 
A non-volatile polymer - memory device , based on a copolymer containing the carbozole and Eu - complex groups in a simple MIM architecture , was demonstrated . the proposed device exhibited two distinctive bistable conductivity states that could be achieved by applying voltage pulses of different polarities . the device also exhibited a high ON / OFF current ratio , fast response time , and acceptable retention ability under ambient conditions . it was found that the devices remained in the ON state for several months without any degradation . 
the effect of the cyclopentadienyl fragment in the copolymerization of ethylene with norbornene ( NBE ) by various non-bridged ( aryloxo ) (cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) complexes of the type , Cp'TiCl 2-(OAr) [ cp' = indenyl ( 1 ) , C5Me5 ( cp* , <nUm> ) , t-BuC5H4 ( 3 ) , 1,2,4-Me3C 5H2 ( 4 ) ; ArO = O-2,6-i-Pr2C6H <nUm> ] , -MAO catalyst systems has been explored . the catalytic activity and the NBE incorporation were highly dependent upon substituent on cp " employed , and <nUm> exhibited both a remarkable catalytic activity and an efficient NBE incorporation , affording high molecular weight polymers with unimodal molecular weight distributions . NBE repeat units were observed in the resultant poly(ethylene-co-NBE)s prepared by <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> , and the degree of NBE dyads as well as alternating sequences was strongly influenced by the cp' employed . these complexes ( 1,3,4 ) also exhibited high catalytic activities for ethylene / cyclopentene ( CPE ) copolymerization , but the CPE incorporation by <nUm> was less efficient than the NBE incorporation under the same conditions . the ab initio density functional ( DF ) molecular orbital ( MO ) methods were utilized to explore the effect of substituents on cp' toward the catalytic activity , the NBE incorporation and the monomer sequence distribution . good correlations between the DEcoordEt ( coordination energy of ethylene ) after NBE insertion and the activity , and between DE coordNBE ( coordination energy of NBE ) after ethylene ( or NBE insertion ) and NBE content were observed , strongly suggesting that the capability producing NBE repeat units was dependent upon DE coordNBE after NBE insertion .

we report here the synthesis of new tethered biscyclopentadienyl and bisindenyl zirconocenes , bearing one unsaturation on the interannular bridge , and their use as self - immobilizing catalysts . they proved to be active catalysts towards ethylene polymerization in solution , with activities comparable to those displayed by commercial rac-Et-(Ind)2ZrCl2 . when tested as self - polymerization catalysts under suitable experimental conditions , they gave colored precipitates that , once reactivated with MAO , were significantly active in ethylene polymerization , although lower than those of the corresponding catalytic systems in solution . the molecular weights of the produced polymers were similar to those obtained with the same catalysts in solution , but their distribution resulted to be broader , with values typical of heterogeneous catalytic systems . from 13C NMR studies we had the first spectroscopic evidence of the actual incorporation of a metallocene of this type into a polymeric chain .

polyethylene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PE-b-PMMA ) diblock copolymer has important interfacial applications . hence , a PE-b-isotactic PMMA diblock copolymer was synthesized using SiMe2(Ind)2ZrMe2 and MAO cocatalyst . the polymerization mechanism and the origin of PMMA isotacticity were duly explained . an appropriate nonisothermal avrami - erofeev crystallization model was developed to compare the crystallization kinetics of the above copolymer with that of a PE homopolymer . for both polymers , the model well matched the entire differential scanning calorimeter crystallinity profile , notably for a single avrami - erofeev index , and predicted cylindrical crystal growth . this model particularly overcomes the limitations of the published nonisothermal crystallization models , and provides interesting insight into PE crystallization . the PMMA block significantly decreased the heats of crystallization and fusion , % crystallinity , and the relative crystallization function ; increased the nonisothermal crystallization rate constant ; and introduced minimal dilution effect whereas the PE block formed a continuous or percolated phase . this study correlates catalyst structure , copolymer block tacticity , and PE nonisothermal crystallization and melting behavior . 
KGaA , WeinheimA highly stable porous organic polymer bipy - POP has been prepared from the reaction of 4,4'-bipyridine and tetrakis(4-(bromomethyl)phenyl)methane in n-methylpyrrolidone at <nUm> ° C . bipy - POP exhibited high efficiency in catalyzing the reductive debromination of a variety of benzyl bromides in N,N-dimethylformamide with dithionite as reductive reagent . for substrates that bear electron - donating group ( s ) on the benzene ring , the reactions selectively afforded dibenzyl sulfone derivatives . generally , substrates that bear an electron - withdrawing group on the benzene ring gave rise to coupling products ethane derivatives . As exceptions , F , Cl or CF3 - contained substrates were found to selectively produce sulfone derivatives . the recyclability of bipy - POP for the catalysis of the reaction of (4-fluorophenyl)methyl bromide and diphenylmethyl bromide , which afforded the corresponding sulfone or ethane derivative , revealed that , after <nUm> times of repeated use , the heterogeneous catalysis did not exhibit important decrease of the activity .

In the presence of excess AlMe3 , the {SBI} - based AlMe3 adduct 3b undergoes a slow decomposition via C-H activation in a bridging methyl unit to yield a new species ( 4b ) with a trimetallic {Zr(m-CH2)(m-Me)AlMe(m-Me)AlMe2} core . EXSY NMR data for the process 2b3b-4b suggest very rapid and reversible binding of an additional AlMe3 molecule onto AlMe3 adduct 3b . the resulting heterotrimetallic species intermediates exchange of methyl groups between different metal centers and slowly undergoes the C-H activation reaction towards 4b . zirconocene - based AlMe3 adducts bind an additional AlMe3 molecule reversibly , affording heterotrimetallic intermediates . one of the AlMe3 adducts undergoes slow decomposition via C-H activation in a bridging methyl unit to yield a new species with a trimetallic {Zr(m-CH2)(m-Me)AlMe(m-Me)AlMe2} core .

KGaA , WeinheimTransition - metal - catalyzed copolymerization reactions of olefins with polar - functionalized comonomers are highly important and also highly challenging . A second-coordination-sphere strategy was developed to address some of the difficulties encountered in these copolymerization reactions . A series of a-diimine ligands bearing nitrogen - containing second coordination spheres were prepared and characterized . the properties of the corresponding nickel and palladium catalysts in ethylene polymerizations and copolymerizations were investigated . In the nickel system , significant reduction in polymer branching density was observed , while lower polymer branching densities , as well as a wider range of polar monomer substrates , were achieved in the palladium system . control experiments and computational results reveal the critical role of the metal − nitrogen interaction in these polymerization and copolymerization reactions . 
KGaA , Weinheim.The transition - metal - catalyzed copolymerization of olefins with polar functionalized co-monomers represents a major challenge in the field of olefin polymerization . it is extremely difficult to simultaneously achieve improvements in catalytic activity , polar monomer incorporation , and copolymer molecular weight through ligand modifications . herein we introduce a polyethylene glycol unit to some phosphine - sulfonate palladium and nickel catalysts , and its influence on ethylene polymerization and copolymerization is investigated . In ethylene polymerization , this strategy leads to enhanced activity , catalyst stability , and increased polyethylene molecular weight . In ethylene copolymerization with polar monomers , improvements in all copolymerization parameters are realized . this effect is most significant for polar monomers with hydrogen - bond - donating abilities .

A series of mononuclear ( m <nUm> and m <nUm> ) and dinuclear ( C <nUm> – C <nUm> ) Ni a-diimine catalysts activated by modified methylaluminoxane were used in polymerization of ethylene . catalyst C <nUm> bearing the optimum bulkiness showed the highest activity ( <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> g PE ( mol Ni ) − <nUm> h − <nUm> ) and the lowest short - chain branching ( <nUm> / <nUm> C ) in comparison to the dinuclear and mononuclear analogues . although the mononuclear catalysts m <nUm> and m <nUm> polymerized ethylene to a branched amorphous polymer , the dinuclear catalysts led to different branched semicrystalline polyethylenes . homogeneity and heterogeneity in the microstructure of the polyethylene samples was observed . different trends for each catalyst were assigned to syn and anti stereoisomers . In addition , thermal behavior of the samples in the successive self - nucleation and annealing technique exhibited different orders and intensities from methylene sequences and lamellae thickness in respect of each stereoisomer behavior . higher selectivity of hexyl branches obtained by catalyst C <nUm> showed a cooperative effect between the centers . the results also revealed that for catalysts C <nUm> and C <nUm> , selectivity of methyl branches led to very high endotherms and crystalline sequences with melting temperatures higher than that of <nUm> % crystalline polyethylene indicating ethylene / propylene copolymer analogues . for catalysts C <nUm> and C <nUm> , more vinyl end groups were a result of the long distance between the Ni centers . kinetic profiles of polymerization along with a computational study of the precatalysts and catalysts demonstrated that there is a direct relation between rate constant , energy interval of catalyst and precatalyst , and interaction energy of et***methyl cationic active center ( Et***MCC or π – comp. ) . based on this , narrow energy interval ( activation energy ) of precatalyst and catalyst leads to fast and higher activation rate ( catalyst m <nUm> ) , and strong interaction of ethylene and catalyst leads to high monomer uptake and productivity ( catalyst C <nUm> ). moreover , theoretical parameters including electron affinity , mulliken charge on Ni , chemical potential and hardness , and global electrophilicity showed optimum values for C <nUm> .

the activity of metallocene catalysts in ethylene polymerization can be increased by a factor of up to <nUm> when the corresponding metallocene catalyst precursors possess one or two bulky alkyl ligands such as benzyl groups instead of the conventional chloro ligands . we assume that in the activation process with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) these bulky alkyl groups are transferred from the metal to the MAO cocatalyst . the actual cocatalyst is supposed to be a cage with one or more monomeric AlMe3 molecules inside . the bulky alkyl group is transferred to such an AlMe3 unit and can act as a spacer separating the catalytically active metallocenium cation from the MAO anion . this effect is supposed to be responsible for the increase in activity . 
A polymeric alloy ( SP-A ) containing syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) , atactic polypropylene ( aPP ) , and about <nUm> wt % sPS-b-aPP diblock copolymer , was prepared by the sequential feed of monomers in the presence of the half - titanocene Cp*Ti(OBz)3 ( where cp* is C5Me3 and bz is PhCH2 ) , modified methylaluminoxane , and external triisobutylaluminum . the effects of the SP-A alloy as a compatibilizer for sPS and isotactic polypropylene ( iPP ) blends were evaluated . the blending of sPS and iPP , with and without SP-A , was performed in a single - screw miniextruder with a side channel that allowed the continuous recycling of materials . the influence of SP-A on the mechanical and thermal properties of the immiscible sPS / iPP blends was investigated over a range of composition . the presence of the SP-A alloy resulted in a significant improvement of the impact strength of the blends compared with that of pure sPS and their pure blends . this improvement was particularly obvious in the sPS / iPP ( <nUm> / <nUm> wt % ) blend containing <nUm> wt % SP-A . morphological analysis of the impact - fractured surface of the ternary blends indicated that the sPS-b-aPP diblock copolymer contained in the SP-A alloy acted as an efficient compatibilizer by decreasing the dispersed - phase iPP particle size , improving the interfacial adhesion , and generating a stable microphase - separated state . 
blends of polyethylene ( PE ) were produced in a single reactor using a combination of { [ ( 2-ArN = C(Me))2C5H3N]FeCl2 } [ Ar = 2,6-2CH3(C6H4) ] and rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 . the experimental results showed that the EsP obtained have a broad molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) and both the molecular weight and the MWD can be regulated through changing the mole ratio of the two active sites . In addition , the polymerization activities decreased with the increase of the Fe / Zr mole ratio whereas the crystallinity of the PE obtained exhibited a contrary trend , decreasing as the Fe / Zr mole ratio went up . the morphology of the blends also directly relates to the Fe / Zr mole ratio , and more iron content in the bimetallic catalysts system gives rise to compact EsP of high crystallinity . this reflects that the reactor blends are morphology controllable as well and can be easily applied to present processing techniques because of adjustable molecular weights and their distribution . differential scanning calorimetry , thermogravimetric analysis , gel permeation chromatography , and scanning electron microscopy were employed to characterize the properties of the reactor blends of EsP .

syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) / montmorillonite nanocomposites were prepared via in situ intercalative coordination polymerization using mono-(n 5-pentamethylcy-clopenta-dienyl ) tribenzyloxy titanium [Cp*Ti(OBz)3] complex activated by methylaluminoxanes ( MAO ) and triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) , the influences of polymerization conditions , such as the weight ratio of montmorillonite and styrene , temperature , and monomer concentration , on the preparation of sPS / montmorillonite nanocomposites was investigated . the intercalation spacing in the nanocomposites , as well as the exfoliation of the montmorillonite interlayers , was characterized with wide angle x-ray diffraction ( WAXD ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . the dispersibility of the nanoscale elements depended on the polymerization conditions and the surfactant treatment . the crystallizability and thermal properties of these nanocomposites were determined by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) analysis and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) . experimental results indicated that the degree of crystallinity of the sPS nanocomposite increased with increasing montmorillonite content and with higher tg and thermal decomposition temperature than pure sPS . 
Cp2ttZrCl2 ( cptt = e5-ttBu2C5H3 ) was synthesized by the reaction of LiCptt with Cl4Zr and characterized by x-ray crystallographic studies . it was used as catalyst for ethylene polymerization . structural analysis was carried out on the polyethylene ( PE ) catalyzed by Cp2ttZrCl2 via wide - angle x-ray diffraction ( WAXD ) and small - angle x-ray scattering ( SAXS ) . the degree of crystallinity ( wc,x ) was calculated by WAXD . the semiaxises of the particles ( a , a , b ) of PE were determined by SAXS and it could be found that the crystalline particles of PE are mainly rod shaped determined by the characteristic function v0 ( r ) . the radius of gyration Rg , crystalline thickness lc , the thickness of noncrystalline region La , long period L , electron - density difference between the crystalline and noncrystalline regions ec - ea , and the invariant q are determined by SAXS . the results also indicate that a transition zone exists between the traditional " two phases " with a clear dimension of <nUm> nm . 
A series of hybrid supported catalysts were prepared by combining (iBuCp)2ZrCl2 and ( TpMs*(TiCl <nUm> complex ( TpMs* = HB(3-mesityl-pyrazolyl) 2(5-mesityl-pyrazolyl)- ) sequentially grafted onto MAO (methylaluminoxane)-modified silica according to a plackett burmann <nUm> <nUm> design . supported catalysts were prepared taking into account the immobilization order , silica pretreatment temperature , and grafting temperature . grafted metal content was comparatively determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) , x-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy ( XPS ) , and inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectroscopy ( ICP - OES ) . the resulting catalysts were evaluated in terms of catalyst activity and polymer properties . according to RBS measurements , grafted metal content remained comprised between <nUm> and <nUm> wt % Zr / O2Si and <nUm> and <nUm> wt % Ti / O2Si depending on the immobilization order and on silica pretreatment temperature . all the systems were shown to be active in ethylene polymerization having external MAO as cocatalyst . catalyst activity seemed to be governed by the zirconocene species , influenced slightly by Ti ones . resulting polymers were characterized by DSC and GPC . the polyethylenes mostly presented higher molecular weight than those produced by homogeneous catalysts or by zirconocene grafted on bare or on MAO - modified silica . 
new approaches have been identified for the immobilization , on a ClMg 2-based support , of borate activators for metallocene - catalyzed olefin polymerization . immobilization of [HNEt3][B(C 6F5)3(C6H4-4-OH) ] was carried out by reaction with a support of type Cl2Mg / AlR n(OEt)3-n , obtained by reaction of AlEt3 with an adduct of magnesium chloride and ethanol . use of the resulting immobilized borate in combination with zirconocene catalysts in ethylene and propylene polymerization resulted in significantly higher polymerization activities than were obtained using the same borate immobilized on a silica support . the Cl2Mg - based support also gave the better polymer particle morphology , cross-sectional imaging indicating uniform support fragmentation , as opposed to incomplete fragmentation using the silica support . high catalyst activities were obtained using a Cl2Mg / AlRn(OEt)3-n support impregnated with [Ph3C][B(C6F5) <nUm> ] . In this case , a highly porous polyethylene particle morphology was obtained . 
In the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , ethylene polymerization was successfully performed with homobinuclear zirconocene complexes { [ ( C 5H5)ZrCl2](C5H4CH <nUm> C12H7 4)[(C5H5)ZrCl2] ; 3o , <nUm> m , and 5p } , which were prepared conveniently by the reaction of disodium(phenylenedimethylene)dicyclopentadienide[C6H 4(CH2C5H4Na)2 ] with <nUm> equiv of (N5-Cyclopentadienyl)trichlorozirconium dimethoxyethane ( CpZrCl3(DME) ) in tetrahydrofuran and characterized by 1NMR and elemental analysis . the effects of the polymerization parameters , such as the temperature , time , concentration of the catalyst , MAO / catalyst molar ratio , and isomeric difference of the homobinuclear metallocene complexes 3o , <nUm> m , and 5p were studied in detail . the results showed that all three catalytic systems had moderate activities in ethylene polymerization and afforded polyethylene with relatively broad polydispersities . the catalytic activity of <nUm> m was somewhat higher than that of 3o and 5p but lower than that of 4,4'-bis(methylene)biphenylene-bridged zirconocene catalysts ; this indicated that the distance between the two metal centers was too short in comparison with a 4,4'-bis(methylene)biphenylene bridge to increase the catalytic activity . 
the leaching of the catalyst zirconocene dichloride ( cp 2ZrCl2 ) from an SBA-15 silica support during ethylene polymerization was studied ; severe leaching was observed when commercial methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) was used as the cocatalyst . however , the removal of free trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) from an MAO solution with a sterically hindered phenol reduced the catalyst leaching by 97-100 % . the results obtained from the leaching experiments with TMA - free MAO suggested that the major reason for catalyst leaching was the free TMA in the commercial MAO solution , not the pure MAO itself . 
syndiotactic polystyrene ( s-PS ) was prepared using monotitanocene catalyst of cyclopentadienyl titanium trichloride ( CpTiCl3 ) activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . solution polymerization was carried out in toluene using different polymerization conditions . syndiotacticity index ( SI ) between <nUm> and <nUm> % was obtained . increasing Al / Ti molar ratio shows an increase in both conversion percentage and SI . the conversion increased linearly with increasing Al / Ti molar ratio in the range studied . the conversion reached to an optimum value of about <nUm> % at styrene / Al molar ratio of <nUm> , while no regular behavior of SI was observed with changing the ratio . effect of temperature of the range 50-80 ° C on polymerization was studied . the most favorable temperature for the polymerization regarding activity is <nUm> ° C ; however SI decreased with temperature up to <nUm> ° C . H value to <nUm> mL / <nUm> mL solvent increased the productivity of the catalyst , however further increase of H <nUm> reduced the activity of the catalyst . polymerization time of <nUm> to <nUm> min shows a decrease in activity . the decrease was sharper for about <nUm> min of polymerization than longer time . 
two asymmetric alkylidene-bridged dinuclear titanocenium complexes (CpTiCl2)2(e5-e5-C 9H6 (CH2)nC5H <nUm> ) , l ( n = <nUm> ) and <nUm> ( n = <nUm> ) have been prepared by treating two equivalents of CpTiCl3 with the corresponding dilithium salts of the ligands C9H7(CH2)nC 5H3 ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) . additionally , ti(e5 : e3-n-BuC5H4C5H 5)Cl2 ( 3 ) and ti(e5:e5-n- BuC9H6C5H5)Cl2 ( 4 ) were synthesized as corresponding mononuclear complexes . all complexes were characterized by 1H , 13C NMR , and IR spectroscopy . homogenous ethylene polymerization catalyzation using those complexes has been conducted in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the influences of reaction parameters , such as [MAO] / [Cat] molar ratio , catalyst concentration , ethylene pressure , temperature , and time have been studied in detail . the results showed that the catalytic activities of both dinuclear titanocenes were higher than those of the corresponding mononuclear titanocenes . although the two dinuclear complexes were different in only one [CH2] unit , the catalytic activity of <nUm> was about <nUm> % higher than that of <nUm> ; however , the molecular weight of polyethylene ( PE ) obtained by <nUm> was lower than that obtained from <nUm> . the molecular weight distribution of PE produced by these dinuclear complexes reached <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . 
ethylene polymer was synthesized by the treatment of a metallocene catalyst C2Cl2P2Zr solution with ultrasonic energy . ultrasonic energy irradiation was used to change the polymer structure of the formed polymer . different ultrasonic energy irradiation times were applied to the metallocene catalyst solution . the ultrasonic energy had an effect on the average molecular weight , molecular weight distribution , and polymer productivity . A lower average molecular weight and a narrower molecular weight distri bution were produced with a longer ultrasonic irradiation time . the polymer productivity was almost constant when the metallocene catalyst was treated with ultrasonic energy . finer polyethylene particles were produced with longer ultrasonic irradiation times . 
the polymerizations of norbornene were investigated using a series of bis(b-ketoamino)nickel(II) complexes(1-6) in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) in toluene solution . the effects of catalyst structure , Al / Ni molar ratio , reaction temperature , and reaction time on catalytic activity and molecular weight of the polynorbornene were examined in detail . the electronic effect of the substituent around the imino group in the ligand is stronger than the steric bulk one on the polymerization activities , and the activities are in the order of <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> . the obtained polynorbornenes were characterized by means of 1H - NMR , 13C - NMR , FTIR , TG , and WAXD techniques . the analyses results of polymers ' structures and properties indicate that the polymerization reaction of norbornene runs in vinyl-addition polymerization mode . the obtained polynor - bornene was confirmed to be vinyl-type and atactic polymers and showed good thermostability ( tdec > <nUm> ° C ) and were noncrystalline but had short - range order . 
ethylene / styrene copolymers were synthesized under constant polymerization conditions using six different metallocene catalysts activated with methylaluminoxane . for all the catalysts used , the activity and molecular weight of the copolymers produced decreased with the amount of styrene in the reactor feed , but the styrene content of the copolymers increased . catalysts with carbon bridges and bulky ligands gave rise to copolymers with higher styrene content . As a result of the increased styrene content of the copolymer , the melting temperature decreased . this effect was ascribed to a decrease in the crystallinity of the copolymers . it was also found that lamellar thickness could be significantly diminished by the incorporation of comonomers . the copolymers showed a broad spectrum of mechanical properties as a function of the comonomer ratio . At low styrene contents , they behaved like typical semicrystalline thermoplastics , and at higher styrene contents , they exhibited the properties typical of elastomers . of the catalysts tested , [ rac-ethylenebis(4,5,6,7- tetrahydro-1-indenyl)]zirconium dichloride emerged as the most promising for the production of ethylene / styrene copolymers . 
the specific features of free - radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate in the presence of a new initiating system , benzoyl peroxide-N,N-dimethyl-N- (methylferrocenyl)amine , are studied . mutual influence of ferrocenyl- and amine groups on kinetic parameters of polymerization and on the microstructure of the resulting polymers is found . it is shown that the polymer obtained in the presence of this initiating system has predominantly syndiotactic structure . 
the influence of montmorillonite ( MMT ) on the syndiotactic polymerization behavior of styrene was studied . to avoid the hydrophilic surface of the MMT coming into contact with the catalyst , which could poison it , SAN was introduced between the MMT and CpTi CH3O . MMT was introduced into the catalytic system as a supporter for the Ti catalyst ( supported catalytic system ) or just dispersed in the polymerization solvent directly ( in situ polymerization system ) . the polymerization results showed that surface modification of MMT dramatically affected the catalytic activity as well as the syndiotacticity of the polymers . this is mainly explained by the insulator SAN preventing the formation of the inactive / little active species Si - O - Ti and other atactic active species resulting from the reaction of the -OH on the MMT layer surface with CpTi(OCH3)3 . 
the synthesis of syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) catalyzed with Cp*Ti(OBz) <nUm> / MAO / TIBA and toluene as the solvent and the effects of polymerization temperature and the external addition of TIBA on polymerization behavior were investigated . the study revealed that catalytic activity increased with polymerization temperature . the greatest activity , <nUm> kg sPS mol <nUm> Ti h <nUm> , was exhibited up to <nUm> ° C . TIBA also improved catalytic activity . the molecular weight of the polymer obtained decreased with polymerization temperature and the amount of TIBA . the structure and properties of syndiotactic polystyrene were characterized by 13C - NMR , FTIR , DSC , and GPC methods . it was confirmed that the sPS obtained featured all - trans planar zigzag conformation and higher syndiotacticity , molecular weight , and melting point . 
functionalized syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) copolymers , including sPS-graft-atactic polystyrene ( aPS ) copolymer or sPS-graft-poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) copolymer , were synthesized and characterized . sPS has been synthesized by using half sandwich titanocene / methylaluminoxane catalyst in homogenous conditions . then , a-phenyl chloroacetylation of sPS was accomplished in a heterogeneous process by using carbon disulfide as dispersing medium and a-phenyl chloroacetyl chloride and anhydrous aluminum chloride as acetylating agent and catalyst , respectively . the graft copolymer of sPS with aPS or PMMA were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization using a-phenyl chloroacethylated sPS as initiator and BrCu and bipyridine as catalyst . the structure of obtained copolymer was investigated by 1H NMR , FTIR spectroscopy , and thermal behavior of copolymers was performed by differential scanning calorimetry analyses . 
A kinetic study of a syndiospecific polymerization was performed with two kinds of catalysts : Cp*Ti-(O(C6H4)CMe 2(C6H4)O)TiCp* [ bimetallic system ] and Cp*Ti - (OMe)3 [ monometallic system ] . the purpose of this study was to determine the reasons behind the high activity of a bimetallic catalyst system . the active site structures of the two kinds of catalysts appears to be similar to the cationic Ti [III] species having e5- pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand , while the rate of the activation process of the bimetallic catalyst was found to be higher than that of the monometallic catalyst . 
A supported metallocene catalyst was synthesized by sequentially loading methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) ( <nUm> wt % in toluene ) and ( nBuCp ) 2ZrCl2 on partially dehydroxylated silica ES <nUm> modified by nBuSnCl3 . its shock load hydrogen responsiveness was evaluated by polymerizing ethylene for <nUm> h at <nUm> bar ( g ) and <nUm> ° C without separately feeding the MAP cocatalyst . the shock load hydrogen feeding increased the ethylene consumption ( at a fairly constant rate ) , catalyst productivity , as well as the resin bulk density and average particle size at DP ( of hydrogen ) ≥ ∼ <nUm> psi . the bulk density increased from <nUm> to <nUm> g / cm3 . this shows a procedure for overcoming the inherent drop in catalyst productivity caused by heterogenization of metallocenes ( that is a method for catalyst activation ) and improving the resulting resin bulk density . the volume - weighted mean particle diameter of the resulting polyethylenes was found to be 5.80-11.12-fold that of the catalyst corresponding to DP = <nUm> - <nUm> psi , respectively . the resulting kinetic profiles showed to be fairly stable . however , mw and polydispersity index were not affected . the particle size distribution , average particle size , and the scanning electron microscope photographs of the resulting resin particles confirmed the occurrence of the replication phenomenon . on the basis of the above findings , the mechanism of ethylene polymerization under the present experimental conditions has been revisited . 
ethylene-co-styrene polymers have been synthesized using the new catalyst system [norbomane7,7-bis(l-indenyl)]titanium dichloride , and characterized by SEC , 13C - NMR , DSC , and dynamic - mechanical analysis . the copolymers have higher average molecular weights compared with those produced in our group with other single - site catalysts systems in the same conditions . more specifically , the homopolymers are ultra high molecular weight polyethylenes ( molecular weight higher than <nUm> g mol-1 ) and with a narrow molecular weight distribution . all samples have shown an unprecedented homogeneous chemical composition with a random incorporation of the comonomer during the polymerization . the expected relationship between thermal properties and the amount of comomoner related to the exclusion of the phenyl units from the crystalline structure has been found , but the correlation is slightly different from those found in other copolymers . this is likely due to the different molecular features of the copolymers . In addition , intense and narrow mechanical relaxations have been found in the samples tested , pointing towards an extremely homogeneous microstructure . the materials obtained show a conspicuous strain hardening during tensile deformation at high strains , not only related to the constrain imposed by the bulky phenyl group in the amorphous region , but additionally to the extremely high number of entanglements in this region as a consequence of the high molecular mass of the samples . 
tert-Butyl vinyl ether ( tBVE ) was polymerized with the catalyst dimethyl[rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)] zirconium ( ansa - zirconocene ) with tri(pentafluorophenyl) borane [B(C6F5)3] as a cocatalyst . the effects of various polymerization conditions , such as the polymerization time , type of polymerization solvent , polymerization temperature , and catalyst concentration , on the conversion of tBVE into poly(tBVE) , its molecular weight and molecular weight distribution , and its stereoregularity were investigated . the maximum conversion of tBVE into poly(tBVE) was over <nUm> % at a polymerization temperature of <nUm> ° C with an ansa - zirconocene and BC18F15 concentration of <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> mol / mol of tBVE , respectively . the number - average molecular weights of poly(tBVE) ranged from approximately <nUm> to <nUm> , with a lower polydispersity index ( weightaverage molecular weight / number - average molecular weight ) ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> , at all polymerization temperatures . the number - average molecular weight of poly(tBVE) increased with decreases in the polymerization temperature and catalyst concentration . the mm triad sequence fraction of poly(tBVE) polymerized with ansa - zirconocene / B(C6F 5)3 at <nUm> ° C was much higher than that of poly(tBVE) polymerized with the BC18F15 catalyst at <nUm> ° C , and this indicated that the ansa - zirconocene / B(C6F 5)3 catalyst system affected the isospecific polymerization of tBVE . 
an asymmetric 3-oxa-pentamethylene bridged dinuclear titanocenium complex (CpTiCl2)2(e5-e5-C 9H6 ( C5H7 2)C5H4 ) ( 1 ) has been prepared by treating two equivalents of CpTiCl3 with the corresponding dilithium salts of the ligand C9H7(CH2CH2CCH2 CH2)C5 H5 . the complex <nUm> was characterized by 1H- , 13C - NMR , and elemental analysis . homogenous ethylene polymerization catalyzed using complex <nUm> has been conducted in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the influences of reaction parameters , such as [MAO] / [Cat] molar ratio , catalyst concentration , ethylene pressure , temperature , and time have been studied in detail . the results show that the catalytic activity and the molecular weight ( MW ) of polyethylene produced by <nUm> / MAO decrease gradually with increasing the catalyst concentration or polymerization temperature . the most important feature of this catalytic system is the molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) of polyethylene reaching <nUm> , which is higher than using common mononuclear metallocenes , as well as asymmetric dinuclear titanocene complexes like [ (CpTiCl2)2(e 5-e5-C9H6(CH2) nC5H4 ) ] ( n = <nUm> , MWD = <nUm> ; n = <nUm> , MWD = <nUm> ) . the melting point of polyethylene is higher than <nUm> ° C , indicating highly linear and highly crystalline polymers . 
two diphenyl ether bridged dinuclear titanocenes , ( C5H 5TiCl2)2{[(RC5H3)CH 2](p-C6H4)O(C6H4-p) [CH2(C5H3R)] [ r = H(5) , me(6) ] have been synthesized and characterized by 1H - NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis . In the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , <nUm> and <nUm> are efficient catalysts for ethylene polymerization . the influences of the polymerization conditions such as [MAO] / [Cat] molar ratio , catalyst concentration , polymerization temperature and time have been studied in detail . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> produce <nUm> g polyethylene ( PE ) / ( mol Ti h ) , which is in the same range as that produced by the binuclear titanocenes { ( C5H 5TiCl2)2[(C5H4CH <nUm> ) ( p-C6 H4)(C6H4-p) ( CH ) ] } ( 7 ) and ( C5H 5TiCl2)2(C5H4CH <nUm> C2H4O C2H <nUm> ) ( 8 ) . however , the molecular weight of PE is somewhat higher than that of PE using <nUm> and <nUm> . the high temperature gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) results show that the molecular weight distributions of PE produced by <nUm> and <nUm> ( MWD = <nUm> and <nUm> ) were obviously broader than those of PE produced by <nUm> ( MWD = <nUm> ) and <nUm> ( MWD = <nUm> ) . the melting points of the PE produced by <nUm> and <nUm> are higher than <nUm> ° C , indicating a highly linear and highly crystalline PE . 
the dye initiators consisting of N-[3-(p-alkylpyridine)propyl]-2-[N-(3- bromopropyl)quinoline]-2-methylenebenzotiazolium diiodides as chromophores and n-buryltriphenylborate anion as electron donor were prepared to achieve an efficient photoinitiator of free radical polymerization in a visible - light region . the relative photoinitiating efficiencies of novel photoinitiators of vinyl monomers polymerization were evaluated . the results obtained clearly documented that the bicationic photoinitiators exhibit a marked increase in the photoinitiation ability compared to the initiators consisting of a single charged hemicyanine dye . 
ethylene was copolymerized with 10-undecen-1-ol and 5-hexen-l-ol using stereorigid [rac-ethylene(Ind)2ZrCl2] , [rac-ethylene(H4Ind)2ZrCl2] , and the new catalyst systems [rac-norbornane(Ind)2TiCl2] and [mesonorbornane(Ind)2TiCl2] , activated with methylaluminoxane . the characterization of the copolymers by 13C NMR spectroscopy revealed that the polymerization products were copolymers and that the conversion of the polar comonomer was strongly favored in the case of the zirconocene precursors . very high catalytic activity values , nearly independent on the amount of comonomer in the feed , and comonomer incorporations up to <nUm> % weight have been found for 10-undencen-1-ol comonomer . 
poly(vinyl chloride ) ( PVC ) samples were synthesized by a living radical polymerization ( LRP ) method and compared with commercial PVC prepared by the conventional free radical polymerization ( FRP ) . the differences were assessed , for the first time , in terms of viscosimetry parameters and thermal analysis . the LRP method used to prepare the PVC - LRP samples is the only one available to obtain this polymer free of structural defects , being of commercial interest in a view of preparing a new generation of PVC - based polymer with out - standing performance . the polymerization temperature selected ( <nUm> ° C ) to prepare the LRP samples is currently used in the industry to prepare PVC - FRP grades with moderate to high molecular weight . since the thermal stability is a direct consequence of the polymer structure , this study is of vital importance to understand the potential of new PVC - LRP . the thermoanalytical measurements demonstrate an enhanced thermal stability of PVC - LRP when compared with its FRP counterpart . the PVC - LRP sample with very low molecular weight reveals a higher thermal stability than the most stable PVC - FRP sample . it is the first report dealing with thermal analysis of PVC prepared by LRP . 
the polymerization of norbornene ( NBE ) was investigated in the presence of two novel pyrazolylimine nickel complexes [ 2-(C3HN2Me 2-3,5){C(Ph) = [ 4-R2C6H2(Ri) 2-2,6]}NiBr2 ( complex <nUm> , R1 = iPr and R2 = H ; complex <nUm> , R1 = H and R2 = NO <nUm> ) ] activated by methylaluminoxane . the two catalytic systems showed high activity [ up to <nUm> × <nUm> g of polynorbornene ( PNBE ) / ( mol of Ni h ) ] for NBE polymerization and provided BEsNP with high molecular weights ( weight - average molecular weight ≤ <nUm> × <nUm> g / mol ) and narrow molecular weight distributions ( ca. <nUm> ) . the electron withdrawing of the nitro group in complex <nUm> could not enhance the catalytic activity for NBE polymerization ; however , the molecular weights of the polymers were increased . the catalytic activity , molecular weight , and molecular weight distribution were influenced by the polymerization conditions , such as the polymerization temperature and Al / Ni molar ratios . the obtained BEsNP were characterized by means of 1H - NMR and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques . the analysis results for BEsNP indicated that the NBE polymerization was a vinyl-type polymerization rather than a ring - opening metathesis polymerization . 
novel asymmetric metallocene catalysts lead to low isotaetie polypropylenes ( iPP ) with randomly distributed stereo irregularities . the polypropylenes are low crystalline and show elastic mechanical behavior due to physical crosslinking . the morphology of such iPP , which is responsible for the observed mechanical properties , is still sparsely resolved . In the present work a low isotactic , low crystalline metallocene iPP containing randomly distributed stereoerrors was investigated . the influence of the chain microstructure in the elastic properties was studied using two complementary investigation methods , x-ray diffraction and scanning force microscopy ( SFM ) . for a better understanding of the unique mechanical properties , microscopic changes in morphology and strain - induced variation in chain orientation were monitored during uniaxial stretching using SFM and wide angle x-ray scattering measurements . for quantitative analysis and discussion the polymer chain orientations were calculated . the correlation between the orientation , the arrangements of the amorphous and crystalline phases observed by SFM , and the mechanical properties of the material at different elongation ratios allowed an interpretation of the macroscopic behavior on the microscopic scale . it was shown that the deformation behavior of low isotaetie polypropylene with randomly distributed stereo - errors is in agreement with existing structural models , which proposed that small crystalline domains act as physical crosslinks for the amorphous matrix . 
catalytic activity during the formation of polyethylene ( PE ) / clay nanocomposites by in situ polymerization with metallocenes was studied . ethylene polymerization was carried out with the homogeneous metallocene in the presence of the clay particles and using the clay - supported metallocene catalyst . it was found that the catalytic activity of the homogeneous metallocene does not decrease in the presence of the clay particles and only a slight decrease of activity occurs using the clay - supported catalyst . the modification of the clay with MAO cocatalyst as well as its intercalation with ODA surfactant were found to play an important role during the in situ formation of the PE / clay nanocomposite . ODA - intercalated clay apparently facilitates the activation and monomer insertion processes on zirconocene centers located in internal sites of the clay structure . although metallocene supported on MAO- treated clay exhibited somewhat lower catalytic activity than that supported directly on the ODA - intercalated clay , both systems favored the production of PE nanocomposites containing highly exfoliated clay particles . 
prediction of reaction yield as the most important characteristic process of a slurry polymerization industrial process of propylene has been carried out . stacked neural network as an effective method for modeling of inherently complex and nonlinear systems-espe-cially a system with a limited number of experimental data points - was chosen for yield prediction . also , effect of operational parameters on propylene polymerization yield was modeled by the use of this method . the catalyst system was Mg(OEt)2 / DIBP / ClTi <nUm> / PTES / AlEt3 , where Mg(OEt)2 , DIBP ( diisobutyl phthalate ) , Cl4Ti , PTES ( phenyl triethoxy silane ) , and triethyl aluminum ( AlEt3 ) ( TEAl ) were employed as support , internal electron donor ( ID ) , catalyst precursor , external electron donor ( ED ) , and co-catalyst , respectively . the experimental results confirmed the validity of the proposed model . 
In this study , we examined various alkylaluminums , including triethylaluminum ( TEA ) , triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) , and diethylaluminum chloride ( DEAC ) , as cocatalysts for the activation of ethylene polymerizations in the presence of a fluorinated fujita group invented titanium ( FI-Ti ) catalyst , bis[N-(3-tert-butylsalicylidene)-2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoroanilinato] titanium(IV) dichloride ( complex <nUm> ) . DEAC , because of the strong lewis acidity , was an efficient cocatalyst for activating complex <nUm> for the ethylene polymerizations , whereas TEA and TIBA as cocatalysts could hardly polymerize ethylene . the effects of the polymerization temperature and Al / Ti molar ratio on the formation of active species , properties , and molecular weight of the resulting polyethylene were investigated . In the complex <nUm> / DEAC catalyst system , the oxidation states of Ti active species were determined by electron paramagnetic resonance . the results demonstrated that Ti(IV) active species were inclined to polymerize ethylene and yielded high-molecular-weight polyethylene . comparatively , Ti (III) active species resulted from the reduction of Ti(IV) by DEAC and afforded oligomers . moreover , the bigger steric bulk for the cocatalysts was necessary to achieve ethylene living polymerization with the fluorinated FI-Ti catalyst . 
In situ ethylene polymerizations with inorganic fillers were performed using catalyst based on titanium tetrachloride supported on polyethersulfone . the inorganic fillers used were MgO , O2Ti , and CCaO3 , which were pretreated with cocatalyst ( methylaluminoxine ) for better dispersion onto the polymer matrix . the formation of polyethylene ( PE ) within the whole matrix was confirmed by fourier transform infrared studies . the wide - angle x-ray diffraction profile of the synthesized EsP indicated the presence of crystalline region . it was found that the nature of inorganic filler did not have any remarkable effect on the melting characteristics of the polymer , but the degree of crystallinity of PE was found to be higher for OTi 2-filled PE . the amount of filler incorporated into the matrix was also evaluated through thermogravimetric analysis , where O2Ti - filled PE showed ∼ <nUm> % of filler material , which was also reflected in the higher productivity obtained by this system . the morphology of the filler - filled EsP was different , whereas the elemental dispersion was found to be uniform on the surface as elucidated through energy - dispersive x-ray spectroscopy .

nano-sized and micro-sized silica particles were used to support a zirconocene catalyst [ racemic-dimethylsilbis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ] , with methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst . the resulting catalyst was used to catalyze the polymerization of ethylene in the temperature range of 40-70 ° C . polyethylene samples produced were characterized with scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , x-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , and gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) . nano-sized catalyst exhibited better ethylene polymerization activity than micro-sized catalyst .

high - density polyethylene ( HDPE ) is the polymer most used for geomembranes , and one of the tests to determine its applicability is its long term resistance to oxidation . In this sense , this work focuses on the study of the chemical and morphological changes that PE films may experiment when subjected to digestion in nitric acid , simulating the severe ambient conditions of a landfill . the effect of digestion of HDPE , on its chemical and morphological structure , was evaluated . it was observed that the molecular weight of HDPE decreases , forming acid and nitro groups , as the time of digestion increases . also , the oxidative degradation first produced a bimodal MW distribution , but as the time of strong acid treatment increases , a trimodal MW distribution appears , at lower molecular weights . finally , as time of digestion continued , a bimodal MW distribution appears again , but at much lower molecular weights . the crystal size of the treated HDPE is directly related to the HDPE molecular weight , that is , as time of digestion increases , the molecular weight decreases and the crystal size decreases . In addition , the heterogeneity of molecular weights , such as bimodal and trimodal distributions , and the presence of chemical groups other than the normal -CH2- strings of pure PE produced defects in the unit cell parameters a and b .

separation into narrow MWD fractions ( liquid - liquid fractionation ) and preparative TREF ( temperature rising elution fractionation ) with subsequent analysis of fractions by GPC , FTIR , and 13C NMR spectroscopy were used to study the comonomer distribution of ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers produced over highly active supported titanium- and vanadium - magnesium catalysts ( TMC and VMC ) and a supported zirconocene catalyst . these catalysts produce PE with different MWD : m w / m n values vary from <nUm> for zirconocene catalyst , <nUm> for TMC , and <nUm> for VMC . 1-Hexene increases polydispersity to <nUm> for copolymer produced over VMC and hardly affects MWD of the copolymer produced over TMC and zirconocene catalysts . the most broad short chain branching distribution ( SCBD ) was found for ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers produced over TMC . VMC and supported zirconocene catalyst produce copolymers with uniform profile of SCB content vs. molecular weight in spite of great differences in m w / m n values ( <nUm> and <nUm> respectively ) . TREF data showed that majority of copolymer produced over supported zirconocene catalyst was eluted at 70-90 ° C ( about <nUm> wt % ) . In the case of VMC copolymer 's fractions were eluted in the broad temperature interval ( 40-100 ° C ) . accordingly , TREF data indicate a more homogeneous SCBD in copolymer , produced over supported zirconocene catalyst .

most visible - light photoinitiators are based on electron transfer processes and are comprised of two or more components . these initiators can lose effectiveness in viscous systems because the underlying reactions are diffusion controlled . In this contribution , the visible - light photoinitiator bis(cyclopentadienyl) bis[2,6-difluoro-3-(1-pyrryl)phenyl]titanium is characterized for polymerization of viscous systems and low light intensities . this compound absorbs visible light at wavelengths up to <nUm> nm , and does not rely on diffusion - controlled electron transfer reactions because it undergoes unimolecular decomposition . In contrast to trends observed for other photoinitiators , the effectiveness of the compound is found to increase markedly with the addition of protonic acids and with increasing system viscosity . for a given concentration of initiator and acid , a remarkably low optimal light intensity for effective polymerization is observed . the origins of these surprising results are discussed in terms of the mechanism of decomposition of the photoinitiator .

In this article , comonomer effects in copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene with four Cl2Mg - supported ziegler - natta catalysts using either ethylene or 1-hexene as the main monomer were investigated . it was found that no matter which monomer was used as the main monomer , the polymerization activity was significantly enhanced by introducing small amount of comonomer . In copolymerization with ethylene as the main monomer , the strength of comonomer effects was much stronger in active centers producing low-molecular-weight polymer than those producing high-molecular-weight polymer . In copolymerization with 1-hexene as the main monomer , the number of active centers ( [C*] / [Ti] ) was determined , and the propagation rate constants ( kp ) were calculated . deconvolution of the polymer molecular weight distribution into flory components were made to study the active center distribution . introduction of small amount of ethylene caused marked increase in the number of active centers and decrease in average chain propagation rate constant . introducing internal electron donor in the catalyst enhanced not only the number of active centers but also the chain propagation rate constant . In copolymerization of 1-hexene with small amount of ethylene , the internal donor weakened the comonomer effects to some extent and changed the distribution of comonomer effects among different types of active centers .

In combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) cocatalyst , the meta-functionalized complexes afforded mixtures of polymers that exhibit multimelting transition temperatures and broad molecular - weight distributions ( MWDs ) in propylene polymerization at atmospheric monomer pressure , whereas the ortho-functionalized complexes did not give rise to polymerization . stepwise solvent extraction of the polymer mixtures showed that the polymers consist of amorphous , moderately isotactic , and highly isotactic portions , the weight ratio of which is dependent on the reaction temperature . 13C NMR spectral analysis indicated that the [mmmm] methyl pentad value of the isotactic portion reached around <nUm> % . among the meta-functionalized zirconocenes , the di-OMe - substituted one afforded the largest amount of the isotactic portion at all temperatures , and the portion comprised <nUm> wt % of the crude polymer obtained at <nUm> ° C . In contrast , propylene polymerization with the half - functionalized unbridged zirconocene resulted in the formation of nearly atactic polypropylene with a narrow MWD of around <nUm> . these results corroborate the proposition that the rigid rac - like cation - anion ion pair of type [rac-L2ZrP] +[Me-MAO]- generated in situ , through lewis acid - base interactions between the functional groups and [Me-MAO]- , is responsible for the isospecific propylene polymerization with the given class of functionalized unbridged zirconocenes and further indicate that the formation of such ion pairs can be favored by difunctionalization at the meta position of the phenyl ring with OMe groups .

A general kinetic scheme was modified by considering a reversible reaction of latent site formation , and used to predict dynamic polymerization rate and viscosity average molecular weight of the resulting polymer . kinetic constants were estimated by the nelder - mead numerical optimization algorithm . it was shown that any deviation from the general kinetic behavior can be captured by the addition of the reversible reaction of latent site formation . simulation results were in satisfactory agreement with experimental data . 
four new donor - functionalized ansa - zirconocenes have been synthesized from the XMeSiCp2ZrCl2 and X2SiCp2ZrCl2 general formula ( where x = (CH2)3OEt , C8H4SCH2OMe , and CH2(2-MeO-3-Me-C6H3) ) . In each of these metallocenes , alkoxy groups are linked by a three-carbon chain to the silicon atom . to study the influence of the functionalized side chains , these metallocenes were activated with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) and utilized in solution polymerization of ethylene . the molecular weight distributions of the polymers formed show a bimodal shape which can be described as a superposition of two schultz - flory distributions , synonymous to at least two different catalytic species . unimodal polymers with mw / Mn = <nUm> were formed with the Me2SiCp2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst system , indicating that the unusual bimodal molecular weight distributions are due to the functionalized side chains tethered to the Si - bridge .

KGaA , weinheim . redox behaviors of monomeric and dimeric titanocenes , [Cp2TiCl2] ( 1 ) and [(Cp2TiCl)2] ( 2 ) , were investigated in two different types of ionic liquid ( IL ) with non-coordinating and coordinating anions , 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium tris(pentafluoroethyl)- trifluorophosphate ( Pyr4FAP ) and 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium triflate ( Pyr4OTf ) , respectively . UV - vis / NIR spectra obtained during the electrochemical reduction of <nUm> revealed that it was converted to <nUm> in the ILs through the formation of [Cp2TiCl] ( 3 ) . In Pyr4OTf , <nUm> was coordinated with the OTf anion in the e1-O mode , during the electrochemical reductions of Ti(IV / III ) process , whereas <nUm> was not coordinated by the FAP anion in Pyr4FAP . additionally , electrochemical H3N synthesis was carried out in a solid polymer electrolyte cell by using a gas diffusion electrode coated with Pyr4FAP or Pyr4OTf containing titanocenes . the electrochemical reduction using <nUm> in Pyr4FAP at − <nUm> V ( vs. Ag / AgCl ) gave a high yield ( <nUm> % at <nUm> C ) of H3N per Ti ion . the electrochemical reduction using <nUm> in Pyr4OTf gave a <nUm> % yield of H3N per Ti ion at <nUm> ° C . these findings indicate that the use of an IL with a non-coordinating anion such as FAP contributes to the coordination and reduction of N to titanocenes . 
(Butadiene)zirconocene adds to BC18F15 to form the metallacyclic metal- locene - boron betaine system <nUm> , which contains a C-F → Zr interaction . addition of tert-butylisocyanide or tert-butylcyanide leads to cleavage of the zirconium - fluorine linkage and formation of the adducts <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . with additional tert-butylisocyanide , <nUm> reacts further to yield the corresponding e2-imino- acyl betaines <nUm> and <nUm> ( <nUm> stereoisomers ) , whereas <nUm> inserts additional tert-butylcyanide into the Zr-C bond to give a chiral metallacyclic n-zirconaketimine complex that is probably stabilized by an internal borate → Zr interaction . ethene and propene insertion reactions into the Zr-C bond of <nUm> follow a similar course : the mono-insertion products <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively , generated in situ and characterized by NMR spectroscopy at - <nUm> ° C in [D8]toluene solution , are chiral and are also stabilized by internal borate → Zr co-ordination . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> are likely to be intermediates in the formation of active homogeneous ziegler polymerization catalysts . 
the titanium complex (C5H4-allyl)TiCl3 ] ( 2 ) undergoes olefin metathesis coupling when treated with <nUm> mol % of [ Cl 2(L1)(L2)Ru = CHPh ] ( L1 = L <nUm> = PCy3 , 4a ; L1 = PCy3 , L <nUm> = ( H2IMes ) , 4b ) to yield the dimetallic complex [ Cl 3Ti(C5H4)-CH2CH = CHCH 2-(C5H4)TiCl3 ] ( 5 ) . the allyl-substituted titanocene complex [ Cp(C5H 4-allyl)TiCl2 ] ( 3 ) analogously yields the dimetallic system <nUm> when treated with <nUm> . the ansa - zirconocene complex [ me 2Si(C5H4)(C5H 3-allyl)ZrCl2 ] ( 7 ) cleanly yields the analogous dimetallic coupling product <nUm> ( > <nUm> % isomerically pure ) , when treated with catalytic amounts of 4b in toluene . complex <nUm> gives an active homogeneous ethene or propene polymerization catalyst , especially at elevated temperatures , when treated with excess methylalumoxane . 
A series of cycloalkylidene-bridged cyclopentadienyl metallocene complexes , [ (CH2)nC(C5H4)2MCl <nUm> ] ( m = Ti , n = <nUm> ( 4 ) , <nUm> ( 5 ) , <nUm> ( 6 ) ; m = Zr . n = <nUm> ( 7 ) , <nUm> ( 8 ) , <nUm> ( 9 ) ; m = Hf , n = <nUm> ( 10 ) , <nUm> ( 11 ) , <nUm> ( 12 ) ) , have been synthesized and applied to ethylene polymerization after activation with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) . the cycloalkylidene-bridged titanocene catalysts exhibit much higher activities than the corresponding zirconocene and hafnocene analogues , and have the highest activities at higher temperatures . In comparison , the silacyclopentylidene- bridged metallocene complexes [ (CH2)4Si(C 5H4)2MCl2 ] ( m = Ti ( 13 ) , Zr ( 14 ) ) and isopropylene-bridged metallocene complexes [ Me2C(C 5H4)2MCl2 ] ( m = Ti ( 15 ) , Zr ( 16 ) ) have also been synthesized and applied to ethylene polymerization . In both cases , the titanocene complexes show much higher activities than the corresponding zirconocene analogues , especially at a lower temperature . the molecular structures of complexes 4-9 have been determined by x-ray diffraction . the structure - activity relationships , especially the effects of the bridges of ansa - metallocene complexes , are discussed . 
the dehydrocoupling of the fluorinated secondary phosphine - borane adduct R2PH*BH3 ( r = p-CF3C6H <nUm> ) at <nUm> ° C is catalyzed by the rhodium complex [{Rh(m-Cl)(1,5-cod)}2] to give the four - membered chain R2PH- BH2-R2P-BH3 . A mixture of the cyclic trimer [R2P-BH2]3 and tetramer [ R2P-BH 2]4 was obtained from the same reaction at a more elevated temperature of <nUm> ° C . the analogous rhodium - catalyzed dehydrocoupling of the primary phosphine - borane adduct RPH2*BH3 at <nUm> ° C gave the high molecular weight polyphosphinoborane polymer [ RPH-BH 2]n ( mw = <nUm> , PDI = <nUm> ) . the molecular weight was investigated by gel permeation chromatography and the compound characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy . interestingly , the electron - withdrawing fluorinated aryl substituents have an important influence on the reactivity as the dehydrocoupling process occurred efficiently at the mildest temperatures observed for phosphine - borane adducts to date . thin films of polymeric [RPH-BH2]n ( r = p-CF3C 6H4 ) have also been shown to function as effective negative - tone resists towards electron beam ( e-beam ) lithography ( EBL ) . the resultant patterned bars were characterized by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and time - of - flight secondary ion mass spectrometry ( TOF - SIMS ) .

selective catalysts can be considered as nanomachines designed to perform the synthesis of molecules with high reaction activity and high selectivity . these properties arise from a precise control of the structure of the active sites , of the three - dimensional environment and of their relationship . In both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts the active site three - dimensional environment ensemble is always a complex structure resembling the tuneable structure of enzymes , which are the most efficient catalysts optimized by nature over billions of years , to illustrate this concept the structure of a few homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for alkenes hydrogenation and for olefin polymerization are chosen and discussed as examples .

the development of transition - metal - catalyzed dehydrocoupling reactions as a synthetic method for the formation of main - group element - element bonds provides an increasingly attractive and convenient alternative to traditional routes such as salt metathesis / elimination - type reactions . since the first reported examples in the early 1980s , there has been a rapid expansion of this field , with extensions to a wide variety of metal - mediated homonuclear and heteronuclear bond - forming processes . applications of this new chemistry in molecular and polymer synthesis , materials science , hydrogen storage and the transfer hydrogenation of organic substrates are attracting growing attention . an overview of this emerging area is presented in this concepts article with a focus on recent results .

the reaction of the bis(ethylene) complex [ TpMe2Ir(C 2H4)2 ] ( 1 ) ( TpMe2 : hydrotris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)borate ) with two equivalents of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate ( DMAD ) in CCl2H2 at <nUm> ° C gives the hydride - alkenyl species [ TpMe2 - IrH{C ( r ) = C(R)C ( r ) = C(R)CH = CH <nUm> } ] ( <nUm> , r : CO2Me ) in high yield . A careful study of this system has established the active role of a number of intermediates en route to producing <nUm> . the first of these is the iridium (I) complex [ tp Me2Ir(C2H4)(DMAD) ] ( 4 ) formed by substitution of one of the ethylene ligands in <nUm> by a molecule of DMAD . complex <nUm> reacts further with another equivalent of the alkyne to give the unsaturated metallacyclopentadiene [ TpMe2 = Ir(C ( r ) = C(R)C ( r ) = C ( r ) ) ] , which can be trapped by added water to give adduct <nUm> , or can react with the C 2H4 present in solution generating complex <nUm> . this last step has been shown to proceed by insertion of ethylene into one of the Ir - C bonds of the metallacyclopentadiene and subsequent b-H elimination . complex <nUm> reacts sequentially with one equivalent of DMAD and one equivalent of methyl propiolate ( MP ) in the presence of water , with regioselective formation of the nonsymmetric iridacyclopentadiene [ TpMe2Ir{C ( r ) = C(R)C(H) = C(R)}- ( H2O ) ] ( 9 ) . complex <nUm> reacts with eth ylene giving a hydride - alkenyl complex <nUm> , related to <nUm> , in which the CH2 has inserted regiospecifically into the CIr ( r ) bond that bears the CH functionality . heating solutions of either <nUm> or <nUm> in CH2CL2 allows the formation of the allyl species <nUm> or <nUm> , respectively , by simple stereoselective migration of the hydride ligand to the ca alkenyl carbon atom and concomitant bond reorganization of the resulting organic chain . all the compounds described herein have been characterized by microanalysis , IR and NMR spectroscopy , and for the case of <nUm> , <nUm> , 7*CO , 8*NCMe , <nUm> , 9*NCMe , and <nUm> , also by single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies .

A series of new neutral allyl group <nUm> metal complexes bearing ansa - bridged fluorenyl / cyclopentadienyl ligands [ {Flu-EMe2-(3-R-Cp)} Ln(e3C3H5)(THF) ] ( e = C , r = H , ln = Y ( 2 ) , La ( 3 ) , Nd ( 4 ) , Sm ( 5 ) ; r = t(Bu , ln = Y ( 8 ) , Nd ( 9 ) ; e = Si , r = H , ln = Y ( 12 ) , Nd ( 13 ) ) were synthesized in good yields via salt metathesis protocols . the complexes were characterized by elemental analysis , NMR spectroscopy for diamagnetic complexes , and single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies for <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> . some of the allyl ansa - lanthanidocenes , especially <nUm> , are effective single - component catalysts for the polymerization of styrene , giving pure syndiotactic polystyrenes ( rrrr > <nUm> % ) with low to high molecular weights ( Mn = 6000-135000gmol-1 ) and narrow polydispersities ( MW / Mn = <nUm> - <nUm> ) . the catalyst systems are remarkably stable , capable of polymerizing styrene up to <nUm> ° C with high activities , while maintaining high syndiotacticity via chain - end control as established by a bernoullian analysis . highly effective copolymerization of styrene with ethylene was achieved using neodymium complex <nUm> ( activity up to 2530kgPS-PEmol-1h-1 ) to give true copolymers void of homopolymers with Mn = 9000-152000 gmol-1 and narrow polydispersities ( mw / Mn = <nUm> - <nUm> ) . the nature of the resultant P(S-co-E) copolymers was ascertained by NMR , size - exclusion chromatography / refractive index / UV , temperature rising elusion fractionation , and differential scanning calorimetry . it is shown that , regardless the amount of ethylene incorporated ( 1-50 mol % ) , P(S-co-E) copolymers have a microstructure predominantly made of long highly syndiotactic PS sequences separated by single or few ethylene units . co-monomers feed and polymerization temperature can be used straightforwardly to manipulate with the physical and mechanical characteristics of the P(S-coE) copolymers ( molecular weights and distributions , co-monomer content , microstructure , Tm , tg , Tc ) .

new unbridged zirconocenes functionalized with a lewis base , [ { 1-(E-C 6H4)-3,4-Me2C5H2 } 2ZrCl2 ] ( e = p-NMe2 ( 3 ) ; p-OMe ( 4 ) ; p-SMe ( 5 ) ) were prepared and their propylene polymerization behavior was examined . under methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) activation at atmospheric monomer pressure , these complexes afford mixtures of polymers exhibiting multimelting transition temperatures and broad molecular weight distribution , whereas they produce completely atactic polypropylenes under [Ph3C][B(C6F 5)4 ] activation . stepwise solvent extraction of the polymer mixtures reveals that the polymers consist of amorphous , moderately isotactic , as well as , highly isotactic portions and the weight ratio of each portion is dependent upon reaction temperature . the generation of rigid rac - like cationic active species in situ by the interaction between basic sites of catalysts and acidic sites of the [Me-MAO]- counter anion is considered to be the origin of the observed isospecificity . further investigation of bulk polymerization in liquid propylene shows not only a considerable increase of the isotactic portion of the obtained polypropylenes but also apparent isospecificity of <nUm> and <nUm> / MAO systems even at high temperature . variation of the lewis basic center leads to a dramatic change in stereoselectivity of the catalyst in the decreasing order of <nUm> > <nUm> ≫ <nUm> , in spite of their structural similarity .

by anchoring metal complexes to supports , researchers have attempted to combine the high activity and selectivity of molecular homogeneous catalysis with the ease of separation and lack of corrosion of heterogeneous catalysis . however , the intrinsic nonuniformity of supports has limited attempts to make supported catalysts truly uniform . we report the synthesis and performance of such a catalyst , made from [ Rh(C2H4)2(CH 3COCHCOCH3 ) ] and a crystalline support , dealuminated Y zeolite , giving ( Rh CH2 groups anchored by bonds to two zeolite oxygen ions , with the structure determined by extended x-ray absorption fine structure ( EXAFS ) spectroscopy and the uniformity of the supported complex demonstrated by 13C NMR spectroscopy . when the ethylene ligands are replaced by acetylene , catalytic cyclotrimerization to benzeneensues . characterizing the working catalyst , we observed evidence of intermediates in the catalytic cycle by NMR spectroscopy . calculations at the level of density functional theory confirmed the structure of the as-synthesized supported metal complex determined by EXAFS spectroscopy . with this structure as an anchor , we used the computational results to elucidate the catalytic cycle ( including transition states ) , finding results in agreement with the NMR spectra .

the ring - opening polymerization ( ROP ) behavior of a variety of substituted l,l'-ethylenylferrocenes , or dicarba[2]ferrocenophanes , is reported . the electronic absorption spectra and tilted solid - state structures of the monomers rac-[Fe(ne-C5H4)2(CHi(Pr)2] ( 7 ) , [ Fe(ne5-C5H4)2(CHMeCH <nUm> ) ] ( 8 ) , and rac-[Fe(ne-C5H4) 2(CHPh)2 ] ( 9 ) are consistent with the presence of substantial ring strain , which was exploited to synthesize soluble , well - defined polyferrocenylethylenes ( EsFP ) [ Fe(ne5C5H 4)2(C(H)MeCH2)]n ( 12 ) and [ fe(ne 5C5H4)2(CHPh)2]n ( 13 ) through photocontrolled ROP . polymer chain lengths could be controlled by the monomerto - initiator ratio up to about <nUm> repeat units and , consistent with the " living " nature of the polymerizations , sequential block copolymerization with a sila[l]ferrocenophane led to polyferrocenylethylene- polyferrocenylsilane ( PFE-b-PFS ) block copolymers ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) . PFE polymers <nUm> and <nUm> showed two reversible oxidation waves , indicative of appreciable Fe-Fe interactions along the polymer backbone . the diblock copolymers were characterized by NMR spectroscopy , GPC analysis , and cyclic voltammetry .

A series of mono- , bis- , and tris(phenoxy)-titanium(IV) chlorides of the type [ Cp*Ti(2-R-PhO)n,Cl3,-n , ] ( n = <nUm> <nUm> ; cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ) was prepared , in which r = me , iPr , tBu , and ph . the formation of each mono- , bis- , and tris(2-alkyl- / arylphenoxy ) series was authenticated by structural studies on representative examples of the phenyl series including [Cp*Ti(2-Ph-PhO)Cl2] ( 1PhC12 ) , [Cp*Ti(2-Ph-PhO)2Cl] ( 2PhCI ) , and [ Cp*Ti(2-Ph-PhO) <nUm> ] ( 3Ph ) . the metalcoordination geometry of each compound is best described as pseudotetrahedral with the cp* ring and the 2-PhPhO and chloride ligands occupying three leg positions in a piano-stool geometry . the mean Ti-O distances , observed with an increasing number of 2Ph-PhO groups , are <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> Å for 1PhCl2 , 2PhCl , and 3Ph , respectively . all four alkyl / aryl series with me , iPr , tBu , and ph substituents were tested for ethylene homopolymerization after activation with ph 3C+[B(C6F5) 4]- and modified methyaluminoxane ( <nUm> % aluminum in isopar e ; mMAO-7 ) at <nUm> ° C . the phenyl series showed much higher catalytic activity , which ranged from <nUm> and <nUm> kg ( mmol of ti-h)-1 , than the me , iPr , and tBu series ( <nUm> and <nUm> kg ( mmol of ti-h)-1 ) . among the phenyl series , the bis(phenoxide) complex of 2PhCl showed the highest activity of <nUm> kg ( mmol of ti-h ) <nUm> . therefore , the catalyst precursors of the phenyl series were examined by treating them with a variety of alkylating reagents , such as trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) , triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) , and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . In all cases , 2PhCl produced the most catalytically active alkylated species , [Cp*Ti(2-Ph-PhO)MeCl] . this enhancement was further supported by DFT calculations based on the simplified model with TMA .

conjugated systems based on phospholes and 1,1'-biphospholes bearing 3,4-ethylenedithia bridges have been prepared using the fagan - nugent route . the mechanism of this organo-metallic route leading to intermediate zirconacyclopentadienes has been investigated by using theoretical calculations . this study revealed that the oxidative coupling leading to zirconacyclo- pentadienes is favored over oxidative addition within the S-C ≡ C bond both thermodynamically and kinetically . the impact of the presence of the S atoms on the optical and electrochemical behavior of the phospholes and 1,1'-bi-phospholes has been systematically evaluated both experimentally and the oretically . A comparison with their " all-carbon " analogues is provided . of particular interest , this comparative study revealed that the introduction of S atoms has an impact on the electronic properties of phosphole - based conjugated systems . A decrease of the HOMO-LUMO separation and a stabilization of the LUMO level were observed . these general trends are also observed with 1,1'-biphospholes exhibiting s-p conjugation . the P atom of the 3,4-ethylenedithiaphospholes can be selectively oxidized by S <nUm> or O . these P modifications result in a lowering of the HOMO-LUMO separation as well as an increase of the reduction and oxidation potentials . the S atoms of the 3,4-ethylenedithia bridge of the 2,5-phosphole have been oxidized using m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid . the resulting 3,4-ethylenesulfoxide oxophosphole was characterized by an x-ray diffraction study . experimental and theoretical studies show that this novel chemical manipulation results in an increase of the HOMO-LUMO separation and an important decrease of the LUMO level . the electropolymerization of 2-thienyl-capped 3,4-ethylenedi-thiathioxophosphole and 1,1'-biphos-phole is reported . the impact of the S substituents on the polymer properties is discussed .

dehydrogenation chemistry with iron : the first examples of efficient iron - catalyzed dehydrocoupling / dehydrogenation of amine - boranes at ambient temperature have been reported .

the synthesis of group IV metal complexes that contain a tetradentate dianionic [OSSO]-carborane ligand [ ( HOC6H2tBu 2-4,6)2(CH2)2S2C 2(B10H10) ] ( <nUm> a ) is described . reactions of Cl4Ti and Ti(OiPr)4 with the [OSSO] - type ligand <nUm> a afford six - coordinated titanium complex [ Ti(OC6H2tBu 2-4,6)2(CH2)2S2C 2(B10H10)Cl2 ] ( <nUm> a ) and four - coordinated titanium complex [ Ti(OC6H2tBu 2-4,6)2(CH2)2S2C 2(B10H10)(OiPr)2 ] ( <nUm> b ) , respectively . Cl4Zr and Cl4Hf were treated with <nUm> a to give six - coordinated zirconium complex [ Zr(OC6H2tBu 2-4,6)2(CH2)2S2C 2(B10H10)Cl2(thf)2 ] ( <nUm> c ) and six - coordinated hafnium complex [ Hf(OC6H2tBu 2-4,6)2(CH2)2S2C 2(B10H10)Cl2 ] ( <nUm> d ) . all the complexes were fully characterized by IR , NMR spectroscopy , and elemental analysis . In addition , x-ray structure analyses were performed on complexes <nUm> a and <nUm> b and reveal the expected different coordination geometry due to steric hindrance effects . extended x-ray absorption fine structure ( EXAFS ) spectroscopy was performed on complexes <nUm> c and <nUm> d to describe the coordination chemistry of this ligand around Zr and Hf . six - coordinated titanium complex <nUm> a showed good activity toward ethylene polymerization as well as toward copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst ( up to <nUm> kg [ mol (Ti)]-1 h-1 in the case of <nUm> atm of ethylene pressure ) .

two novel ZrIV- and HfIV - based bisamido complexes bearing the 6-[2-(diethylboryl)phenyl]pyrid-2-yl motif , that is , [ ClZr 2{Me2Si(DbppN)2}(thf) ] ( 9 ) and [ ClHf 2{Me2Si(DbppN)2}(thf)2 ] ( 10 ) ( DbppN = 6-[2-(diethylboryl)phenyl]pyridine-2-amido ) have been prepared . their reactivities have been compared with that of a model precatalyst that does not bear the aminoborane motif . upon activation with methylalumoxane , precatalysts <nUm> and <nUm> are active in the homopolymerization of ethylene ( e ) yielding high - density polyethylene ( HDPE ) . In the copolymerization of e with cyclopentene ( CPE ) , for example by the action of <nUm> , the presence of CPE resulted in a dramatic increase in the polymerization activity of e , while CPE incorporation remained close to or at zero . In the vinyl-insertion copolymerization of norborn-2-ene ( NBE ) with e by the action of <nUm> , statistical cyclic olefin copolymers of these two monomers were obtained . At higher NBE concentrations , however , <nUm> gave rise to reversible ring - opening metathesis ( ROMP ) / vinyl- insertion polymerization ( VIP ) of NBE with e , resulting in the formation of multi-block copolymers of the general formula poly(NBE)ROMP-co- poly(NBE)VIP-co-poly(E) . this particular feature of precatalyst <nUm> , that is , the ability to induce a reversible a-H elimination / a-H addition reaction , is attributed to the unique role of the 6-[2-(diethylboryl) phenyl]pyrid-2-yl ligand . accordingly , a model precatalyst lacking this ligand does not have the ability to induce a-H elimination / a-H addition reactions . the different 11B NMR shifts of various diethylborylphenylpyrid-2-ylamines and -amides permit a ranking of the strengths of the B-N bonds in these compounds . this strength of the B-N bond is correlated with the propensity of <nUm> / MAO to produce poly(NBE)ROMP-co- poly(NBE)VIP-co-poly(E) at different temperatures .

to characterize the origin of living polymerization with nonmetallocene titanium - based catalysts containing o-fluoroaryl substituents , ethene polymerization by an o-fluorinated bis(enolatoimine) titanium catalyst and its nonfluorinated counterpart has been studied by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy by using methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or AlMe <nUm> / CPh 3B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> as activators . formation of ion pairs of the type [ TiL 2Me][MeMAO] and [ TiL 2Me][B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] has been observed for both catalysts . these ion pairs react with ethene to afford the chain - propagating species [ TiL 2P][MeMAO] and [ TiL 2P][B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , respectively ( P = growing polymeryl chain ) . for the o-F - substituted catalyst species of the second type , NMR spectroscopy provides evidence that the o-F substituents interact with the metal center . this interaction is proposed to keep the polymerization catalysis living by suppressing chain transfer to AlMe <nUm> and b-hydrogen transfer processes . never - ending story : multinuclear NMR spectroscopic characterization of the chain - propagating species in the o-F - substituted bis(enolatoimine) titanium catalyst system for living ethene polymerization and its non-fluorinated ( non-living ) counterpart is reported . for the living polymerization catalyst , weak coordination of aryl o-F substituents to Ti prevents the metal center from coming into contact with the b-CH <nUm> group of the growing polymer chain and thus hampers the chain termination . 
ultra-rigid metallocenes are studied for highly iso- and regiospecific polymerization of propene . A single - crystal x-ray structure is obtained of the rac- and meso- forms of the complex and its rac - hafnium analogue . for a better understanding typical structural parameters are compared from similar compounds . the observed smaller bite angle is assumed to be a result of this steric interaction between the methoxy substituent and the silicon bridge , a structure element that is indicative for the high steric rigidity of the ansa - metallocene frame . A significant increase of molecular weight , independent of the ligand substitution pattern , is found for iPP produced with hafnium complexes , like the hafnocene . A key step of the chain end epimerization process ( CEP ) is b-hydride elimination and therefore the amount of stereo - errors and the molecular weight of the produced polypropylenes are influenced directly by the propene concentration . 
the strong organoborane lewis acid BC6F5 <nUm> catalyzes the polymerization of phenylsilane at elevated temperatures forming benzene and H4Si as side - products . the resulting polymer is a branched polysilane with an irregular substitution pattern , as revealed by 2D NMR spectroscopy . having explored the mechanism of this novel metal - free polymerization by computational chemistry methods at the DFT level , we have suggested that unusual cationic active species , namely monomer - stabilized silyl cations , propagate the polymerization . hydride abstraction of H3Si moiety by the catalyst in the initiation step was found to be kinetically preferred by around <nUm> kcal mol-1 over activation by coordination of the monomer at the aromatic ring . the formation of linear Si-Si bonds during propagation was calculated to be less favorable than branching and ligand scrambling , which accounts for the branched and highly substituted form of the polymer that was obtained . this novel type of polymerization bears the potential for further optimization with respect to degree of polymerization and structure control for both primary as well as secondary silanes , which can be polymerized by sterically less hindered boranes . polysilanes without metals ! the strong organoborane lewis acid B(C 6F5)3 catalyzes the polymerization of phenylsilane at elevated temperatures ( see scheme ) . 2D NMR spectroscopy revealed the resulting polymer to have a branched and highly substituted structure . DFT calculations confirmed the experimental results of this metal - free synthesis with substitution and branching being kinetically more favorable processes than Si-Si bond formation for linear growth . 
long chain running : the polymerization performance of guanidinato titanium(IV) olefin catalysts is tuned by monodentate ancillary ligands . polymerization activities of up to <nUm> kgPE molcat . <nUm> h-1 bar-1 together with molecular weights of <nUm> kg mol-1 were observed ( see figure ; d-MAO = dry methylalumoxane ) . ligand transfer of the additional donor ligands has to be avoided . 
four chiral OsII arene anticancer complexes have been isolated by fractional crystallization . the two iodido complexes , ( SOs,S C)-[Os(e6-p-cym)(ImpyMe)I]PF6 ( complex <nUm> , (S)-ImpyMe : N-(2-pyridylmethylene)-(S)-1-phenylethylamine ) and ( r Os,RC)-[Os(e6-p-cym)(ImpyMe)I]PF <nUm> ( complex <nUm> , (R)-ImpyMe : N-(2-pyridylmethylene)-(R)-1- phenylethylamine ) , showed higher anticancer activity ( lower C50I values ) towards A2780 human ovarian cancer cells than cisplatin and were more active than the two chlorido derivatives , (SOs,SC)- [Os(e6-p-cym)(ImpyMe)Cl]PF6 , <nUm> , and ( r Os,RC)-[Os(e6-p-cym)(ImpyMe)Cl]PF <nUm> , <nUm> . the two iodido complexes were evaluated in the national cancer institute 60-cell-line screen , by using the COMPARE algorithm . this showed that the two potent iodido complexes , <nUm> ( NSC : D-758116 / <nUm> ) and <nUm> ( NSC : D-758118 / <nUm> ) , share surprisingly similar cancer cell selectivity patterns with the anti-microtubule drug , vinblastine sulfate . however , no direct effect on tubulin polymerization was found for <nUm> and <nUm> , an observation that appears to indicate a novel mechanism of action . In addition , complexes <nUm> and <nUm> demonstrated potential as transfer-hydrogenation catalysts for imine reduction . mirror images : two chiral OsII arene iminopyridine complexes have been isolated by fractional crystallization : (SOs,SC)- [Os(e6-p-cym)(ImpyMe)I]PF6 and ( ROs,R C)-[Os(e6-p-cym)(ImpyMe)I]PF6 . their x-ray structures , as well as those of the chlorido analogues , have been determined ( see graphic ) . the complexes exhibit high anticancer activity towards human ovarian , breast , and melanoma cancer cells , and have a mechanism of action distinctly different from cisplatin . they also show potential as transfer-hydrogenation catalysts for imine reduction .

KGaA.Two series of new dinuclear rare - earth metal alkyl complexes supported by indolyl ligands in novel m-e2:e1:e1hapticities are synthesized and characterized . treatment of [RE(CH2SiMe3)3(thf)2] with <nUm> equivalent of 3-(tBuN = CH)C8H5NH ( L1 ) in THF gives the dinuclear rare - earth metal alkyl complexes trans-[(m-e2:e1:e1-3-{tBuNCH- (CH2SiMe3)}Ind)RE(thf)(CH2SiMe3)]2 ( ind = indolyl , RE = Y , Dy , or Yb ) in good yields . In the process , the indole unit of L1 is deprotonated by the metal alkyl species and the imino C = N group is transferred to the amido group by alkyl CH2SiMe3insertion , affording a new dianionic ligand that bridges two metal alkyl units in m-e2:e1:e1 bonding modes , forming the dinuclear rare - earth metal alkyl complexes . when L1 is reduced to 3-(tBuNHCH2)C8H5NH ( L2 ) , the reaction of [Yb(CH2SiMe3)3(thf)2] with <nUm> equivalent of L2 in THF , interestingly , generated the trans-[(m-e2:e1:e1-3-{tBuNCH2}Ind)- Yb(thf)(CH2SiMe3)]2 ( major ) and cis-[(m-e2:e1:e1-3-{tBuNCH2} Ind)Yb(thf)(CH2SiMe3)]2 ( minor ) complexes . the catalytic activities of these dinuclear rare - earth metal alkyl complexes for isoprene polymerization were investigated ; the yttrium and dysprosium complexes exhibited high catalytic activities and high regio- and stereoselectivities for isoprene 1,4-cispolymerization . 
KGaA , WeinheimKinetics of activation of methyl and benzyl metallocene precatalysts by benzhydrylium ions , tritylium ions , and triarylborane B(C6F5)3were measured spectrophotometrically . the rate constants correlate linearly with the electrophilicity parameter e of the benzhydrylium and tritylium ions employed , allowing us to determine the s-nucleophilicities of the metal – carbon bond of several zirconocenes and titanocenes . bridging , substitution , metal , and ligand effects on the rates of metal – alkyl bond cleavage ( m = Zr , Ti ) were studied and structure – reactivity correlations were used to predict the kinetics of generation of metallocenium ions pairs , which are active catalysts in polymerization reactions and are highly electrophilic lewis acids in frustrated lewis pair catalysis . 
KGaA , WeinheimThe first three insertion steps of propylene for isoselective metallocenes from the one-carbon - bridged cyclopentadienyl – fluorenyl { cp / flu } and silicon - bridged ansa - bis(indenyl) {SBI} families were computed by using a theoretical method implementing the B3PW91 functional in combination with solvent corrections incorporated with the solvation model based on density ( SMD ) continuum model . for C1 - symmetric { cp / flu } - type metallocenes , two mechanisms of stereocontrol were validated theoretically : more facile and more stereoselective chain “ stationary ” insertion ( or site epimerization backskip ) and less stereoselective alternating mechanisms . for the C2 - symmetric {SBI} - type system , the computation results were in complete agreement with the sole operating chain migratory insertion mechanism . the thermochemical data obtained through the study were used to predict microstructures of polypropylenes by using three - parameter and one - parameter statistical models for the two metallocene systems , respectively . the calculated meso / rac pentad distributions were found to be in good agreement with those determined experimentally for isotactic polypropylene samples obtained at different polymerization temperatures .

A rapid and non-intrusive on - line NIR imaging sensor is developed for monitoring spatio-temporal crystallinity variations across the surface of polymer films . A multivariate image analysis and regression ( MIA / MIR ) approach is proposed and compared with standard NIR calibration techniques using averaged spectra or second order derivatives combined with PLS regression . predictions of both the local and global crystallinity variations of HOPE , LDPE , and PP polymer samples were obtained with each approach . our results show that small variations in crystallinity introduced by changes in cooling rates can be predicted within experimental errors . crystallinity spatial distributions were also validated and found consistent with processing conditions . 
early and late transition metal single - site catalysts revolutionised the polyolefin manufacturing industry and research with their ability to make polymers with uniform microstructural properties . several of these catalysts are currently used commercially to produce commodity and differentiated - commodity resins . the key to their rapid success and industrial implementation resided in the fact that they could be used without major modifications in the polymerisation reactors that previously used heterogeneous ziegler - natta and phillips catalysts . since most of these industrial processes use slurry or gas - phase reactors , the soluble single - site catalysts must be supported on adequate carriers that ensure not only high activity , but also the formation of polymer particles with the proper morphology and bulk densities . In this article , we will review several methods used for supporting single - site early and late transition metal catalysts on a variety of supports . 
the transesterification equilibrium constants were determined under temperatures from <nUm> to <nUm> K , and the reaction kinetics catalyzed by single tetrabutyl titanate , dibutyltin oxide , and their combinations was measured . by taking into account the effect of catalyst , the simplified kinetic model was developed involving the transesterification of DMC and methyl phenyl carbonate ( MPC ) with phenol , the disproportionation of MPC , and the formation of byproduct anisole . the kinetic model fitted experiments well under various temperatures and had an excellent predictive ability on the effect of catalyst concentrations . the reverse reaction of MPC transesterification with phenol , as well as that of the disproportionation of MPC , was found to be independent of temperatures within the investigated conditions . the thermodynamic information and kinetic model reported here will provide valuable insight into the understanding of the transesterification process from DMC to DPC .

In this work , supported catalysts with different Al : Zr ratios on O2Si , modified with MAO were prepared , and evaluated for their tendency towards leaching in ethylene polymerization , using additional MAO or other alkylaluminum compounds . the extent of catalyst leaching was estimated by comparing kinetic data of filtered versus unfiltered catalysts during ethylene polymerization . polydispersities and molecular weights of the HDPE obtained using filtered versus unfiltered catalysts were also compared under similar polymerization conditions . polyethylene morphologies obtained in homogeneous and heterogeneous phase were compared by SEM . bulk densities of the HDPE were evaluated and related to the leaching in the polymerizations . 
the mechanism of catalytic polymerization of acrylonitrile in the presence of titanocene dichloride under light have been investigated by UV , NMR and ESR spectroscopy . results of photochemical reaction monitored by UV and NMR showed that titanocene dichloride ( Cp2TiCl2 ) in dimethyl sulfoxide system can be decomposed by light irradiation to give cyclopentadiene . ESR studies show that cyclopentadienyl free radical in photopolymerization system of Cp2TiCl2-acrylonitrile can be trapped by two kinds of spin trapping agents , phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone and 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane , respectively . therefore , the radical mechanism of catalytic polymerization of acrylonitrile in the presence of Cp2TiCl2 under light is further confirmed . the mechanism of catalytic polymerization of acrylonitrile in the presence of titanocene dichloride under light have been investigated by UV , NMR and ESR spectroscopy . results of photochemical reaction monitored by UV and NMR showed that titanocene dichloride ( Cp2TiCl2 ) in dimethyl sulfoxide system can be decomposed by light irradiation to give cyclopentadiene .

the synthesis and characterization of four new silicon - linked lanthanocene complexes with pendant phenyl groups on cyclopentadiene were reported . based on the data of elemental analyses , MS and IR , the complexes were presumed to be unsolvated and dimeric complexes Me2Si(C5H 3CMe2C6H5)2LnCl ] <nUm> [ ln = Er ( 1 ) , Gd ( 2 ) , Sm ( 3 ) , Dy ( 4 ) ] . In conjunction with AlEt <nUm> or sodium hydride as the co-catalyst , these complexes could efficiently catalyze the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) . when the nanometric sodium hydride was used as a co-catalyst , the complexes were highly effective for the polymerization of MMA . At low temperature and in short time , in [ Me2Si(C5H3CMe2C 6H5)2LnCl]2 / HNa ( nanometric ) system , the polymer was obtained in more than <nUm> % yield and the molecular weight was greater than <nUm> . the activity reached that of organolanthanide hydride as a single - component catalyst . In [ Me2Si(C5H 3CMe2C6H5)2ErCl ] <nUm> / HNa ( nanometric ) system , the effects of the molar ratio of MMA / catalyst and catalyst / co-catalyst , and the temperature on polymerization were studied .

the wideline proton NMR spectra of polyethylene powder samples were analyzed in terms of contributions from three components : ( 1 ) a rigid part with immobile chains , ( 2 ) a soft region with liquid - like character which produces a lorentzian contribution to the spectrum , and ( 3 ) an intermediate region in which the rotation of methylene groups about C-C bonds is partially hindered . the relative mass fractions as well as chain mobilities varied greatly among samples produced by different polymerization techniques . the NMR crystallinity agreed well with that estimated by WAXD and was much higher than DSC crystallinity , indicating an inclusion of the contribution from a crystalline - amorphous interphase . the crystalline defects in the rigid part could be significantly affected by processing parameters when employing the same type of polymerization technique . the intermediate region in the NMR spectra was analyzed according to the comparison between bimodal high density polyethylene and corresponding linear unimodal one . it was found that the mass fraction of the NMR interphase could be an indication of the percentage of tie molecules between crystalline lamellae and thus may significantly affect the mechanical properties of polymeric material .

A series of poly(arylene imino)s ( PAI ) with high molecular weights and small polydispersity indices have been synthesized by the condensation polymerization of different diiodobenzenes with aromatic primary diiminos via two different methods . their structures were characterized by means of FT-IR , 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis . DSC and TG measurements show that the polymers possess high glass transition temperatures ( tg > <nUm> ° C ) and good thermal stability with high decomposition temperatures ( TD > <nUm> ° C ) . these novel polymers also exhibit good solubility in organic solvents .

KGaA , weinheim the isoprene / ethylene copolymerization catalyzed by cationic rare earth metal complexes [(e5-C5Me5)Sc(CH2SiMe3)]+ ( A ) had afforded alternating isoprene-ethylene copolymer with rich 3,4-polyisoprene microstructures , whereas no isoprene-ethylene copolymer was observed by using analogous [(PNPPh)Sc(CH2SiMe3)]+ ( B ) under the same conditions . theoretical calculations in this work have revealed that , in the case of A , successive 3,4-insertion of isoprene resulted in a noncovalent interaction between the C = C double bond of penultimate unit and the metal center , suppressing the further insertion of monomers due to higher energy barrier and endergonic character . on the other hand , the ethylene pre-inserted species with alkyl active site is more suitable for the subsequent kinetically and thermodynamically favorable isoprene insertion and copolymerization is therefore realized . In the case of B , the experimentally observed cis-1,4 - specific homopolymerization of isoprene was the outcome of both kinetic and thermodynamic control . and , the unfavorable ethylene insertion into the isoprene pre-inserted species with allyl active site could account for the experimental finding that no isoprene-ethylene copolymer was obtained . these computational results are expected to provide some hints for the design of rare earth copolymerization catalysts . 
KGaA , WeinheimThe design and synthesis of transition metal complexes with high thermal stability in olefin polymerization have become more and more important in order to meet the need of industrial application . this review focuses on the transition metal complex catalyst with high thermal stability containing different structures , including the backbone of bis(imino)pyridine , a-diimine and other types of ligands . besides the catalytic activity , the influence of reaction temperature on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the obtained polymer was also described . the plausible mechanism on the stability of catalysts at high temperature was proposed , which may give guidance to design catalyst with good thermal stability . 
KGaA , WeinheimThe copolymerization of ethylene and styrene can be efficiently carried out by using Cp*TiCl2(N = CtBu2 ) / MAO ( cp* = e5-C5Me5 ) system , yielding the poly(ethylene-co-styrene)s with isolated styrene units . In order to investigate the reasons for formation of the structure , the mechanism of copolymerization , especially the selective insertion of ethylene and styrene , is studied in detail by density functional theory ( DFT ) method . At the initiation stage , insertion of ethylene is kinetically more favorable than insertion of styrene , and insertion of styrene kinetically and thermodynamically prefers 2,1-insertion . that is different from the conventional half - titanocene system , in which the 1,2-insertion is favorable . At chain propagation stage , the computational results suggest that the continuous insertion of styrene is hard to occur at room temperature due to the high free energy barriers ( <nUm> and <nUm> kcal / mol for 1,2-insertion , and <nUm> and <nUm> kcal / mol for 2,1-insertion ) and thermodynamically unfavorable factors in two different conditions . that is mainly attributed to the steric hindrance between the coming styrene and chain - end styrene or ketimide ligand . the computational results are in good agreement with the experimental data . 
free car - parrinello molecular dynamics ( CPMD ) simulations of four diastereomers of the zirconium - propene complexes [ {iPr(3-iPr-CpFlu)}ZriBu(C 3H6)]+ ( cp = cyclopentadienyl ; flu = fluorenyl ) provide valuable insight into the mechanism and stereocontrol of propene polymerization with stereorigid metallocenes . spontaneous insertion of propene into the zirconium - isobutyl bond is not observed , and propene is found to be weakly bound and to rotate relatively freely around the C-C bond to be formed . large - amplitude rotation of the isopropyl substituent around the cp - iPr bond may play a role in triggering dissociation of propene . three of the four diastereomers eliminate propene during the course of the simulations , which makes dissociation the dominating event on a 20-ps timescale . the CPMD simulations thus support the validity of the assumption , fundamental to statistical propagation models , that each insertion is independent of the preceding insertions . using insertion barriers from static density functional calculations , the statistical model predicts the polypropene microstructure in good agreement with experiment at low polymerization temperatures for the catalysts {iPr(3-R-CpFlu)}ZrCl2 ( r = H , iPr , tBu ) . the predictions become less accurate at higher temperatures , probably due to the onset of the competing back - skip reaction , which is not included in the model .

KGaA , Weinheim.Hydrolysis of trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) leads to the formation of methylaluminoxanes ( MAO ) of general formula (MeAlO)n- (AlMe3)m . the thermodynamically favored pathway of MAO formation is followed up to n = <nUm> , showing the major impact of associated TMA on the structural characteristics of the MAOs . the MAOs bind up to five TMA molecules , thereby inducing transition from cages into rings and sheets . zirconocene catalyst activation studies using model MAO co-catalysts show the decisive role of the associated TMA in forming the catalytically active sites . catalyst activation can take place either by lewisacidic abstraction of an alkyl or halide ligand from the precatalyst or by reaction of the precatalyst with an MAO - derived AlMe2 + cation . thermodynamics suggest that activation through AlMe2 + transfer is the dominant mechanism because sites that are able to release AlMe2 + are more abundant than lewis-acidic sites . the model catalyst system is demonstrated to polymerize ethene .

KGaA.Supported phosphine ligands are auxiliaries of topical academic and industrial interest in catalysis promoted by transition metals . however , both controlled implantation and controlled conformation of ligands should be achieved to produce immobilized catalysts that are able to structurally " copy " efficient homogeneous systems . we provide herein a general synthetic strategy for assembling a new class of branched tetraand triphosphine ligands with a unique controlled rigid conformation , and thus providing a high local density of phosphorus atoms for extended coordination to the metal center . we prepared new functionalized cyclopentadienyl ( cp ) salts to design polyphosphines that were " ready for immobilization " . these protected cp fragments might also be of synthetic utility for generating other supported metallocenes . tetra- and triphosphines were then formed and diversely functionalized for immobilization on virtually any kind of support . As evidenced by 31P NMR spectroscopy and the strong " through - space " spin- spin TSJ(P,P) coupling observed between P atoms , these modified polyphosphines induce , when immobilized on a support , a high local concentration of phosphorus donors that are spatially very close to each other ( 3-5 A@ ) . these functionalized ligands have been incorporated into polystyrene to give either soluble or insoluble polymers and on inorganic supports such as silica . we report the catalytic performance at <nUm> - <nUm> mol % low palladium loading of the resulting immobilized polyphosphine ligands . this study provides proof - of - concept of supported catalytic materials built from modular polyphosphines with a novel approach to structurally controlled polydentate heterogeneous catalysts . 
abstract A combined experimental and quantum chemical study has been performed on rac- and meso-[Zr{1-Me2Si(3-e5-C9H5Et)2}Cl2] ( rac- and meso-1 ) and their hydrogenated forms ( rac- and meso-2 ) to understand ligand effects and guide ligand design for more active ansa - bis(indenyl) zirconocenes for the polymerisation of ethylene . the rac-ansa-zirconocene rac-[Zr(1-Me2Si{3-Et-(e5-C9H9)}2)Cl2] ( rac-2 ) has been prepared and fully characterised by NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis . the molecular structure of rac-2 has also been determined by single - crystal XRD . the behaviour of the catalysts was analysed in the polymerisation of ethylene and higher activities were obtained for rac-1 and its hydrogenated form rac-2 . the influence of the stereochemistry and hydrogenation of the indenyl ligand on the experimental activities has been evaluated by computational studies . the differences along the reaction pathway are dominated by changes in the relative stabilities of the catalytic intermediates . A hybrid density functional B3LYP study , in the presence of toluene as the solvent , indicates that the rac forms give rise to more active species than their meso counterparts . the hydrogenation of the rac forms is a very promising approach to increase activities in polymerisation , in contrast to the meso forms . finally , the global mechanism rate constants for the polymerisation reaction for each metallocene were calculated by using the thermodynamic formulation of transition - state theory to complement the computational study . 
visible - light - driven photocatalysis is currently attracting a great deal of attention because of its potential application in solar water splitting . however , the development of efficient and durable catalyst systems is still a challenging problem . In Ru dye - sensitised O2Ti nanopowders , catalyst performances are found to decline as a result of poor bonding of the dye molecule to the O2Ti surface and subsequent detachment and self - aggregation of the dye . our strategy to improve the stability of the dye - O2Ti interface is the encapsulation of the dye / O2Ti assembly in an amino-group - containing polyallylamine layer anchored to OTi <nUm> . A low - pressure pulsed microwave discharge plasma polymerization process was employed to coat a commercial anatase nanopowder with a thin polyallylamine layer to nanoconfine the adsorbed dye molecules . electron microscopy and UV / vis spectroscopy was carried out to characterise the resulting encapsulated nanostructures . the long - term stability of the new nanomaterial as the photoactive component of a water reduction catalyst system for H <nUm> evolution investigated in a slurry reactor under visible - light irradiation showed stable evolution rates over a period of several days . to sensitise and encapsulate : Ru dye - sensitised O2Ti is encapsulated with plasma - polymerised polyallylamine to improve long - term stability under ambient conditions for photocatalytic water splitting . using a Pd dichloro complex as the reduction catalyst and triethylamine as the electron source , a highly stable long - term performance as well as a small improvement in catalytic activity is achieved . the nanostructure is characterised by TEM as well as UV / vis and ATR - FTIR spectroscopy . 
methylenetriphenylphosphorane was coordinated to the boron of phenylborylidene-bridged bis(cyclopentadienyl)-and bis(2-Me,4-Ph-indenyl) zirconium dichloride to form zwitterionic ansa - zirconocene complexes . the cyclopentadienyl complex <nUm> , when activated with MAO , exhibits remarkable polymerization activity that is more than an order of magnitude greater than that of a related amidoborylidene-bridged complex as well as the commercially important pre-catalyst [Cp'-SiMe2-N-tBu]TiCl2 ( cp' ; C5Me4 ) . the zwitterionic bis(2-Me,4-Ph- indenyl)zirconium dichloride species is isolated as a mixture of rac and meso isomers 4-6 . the propylene polymerization efficiency of the isomer mixture activated by MAO is greater than that of a related silylene bridged system at <nUm> and <nUm> ° C ; however , the activity of the zwitterionic system decreased with further increase in temperature . the high level of isotactic triads ( <nUm> % ) and pentads ( <nUm> % ) in the polypropylene formed by 4-6 indicates that the rac isomer is the most active precatalyst of the mixture . the molecular structures of <nUm> and the rac bis-indenylzirconium isomer <nUm> and one of the meso isomers <nUm> are described .

alkylation of ansa - zirconocene [ Zr{(e5-C5H 5)SiMe2 - (MBI)}Cl2 ] ( MBI = e5-Me- C13H7 ) with MgRCl gave the dimethyl complex [ Zr{(e5-C5H5)SiMe2(MBI)}Me <nUm> ] , but unresolvable mixtures containing mono-alkylated compounds were obtained when bulkier alkyls were used . however pure dialkyl complexes [ Zr{(e5-C5H5)SiMe2(MBI)}R <nUm> ] ( r = CH2Ph , CH2SiMe3 ) were easily obtained using K(CH2Ph) and Li(CH-2SiMe3) as alkylating agents . diastereoselective insertion into the MBI - unprotected Zr-R bond was observed when all of these dialkyl complexes were treated with 2,6-xylyl isocyanide to give the iminoacyl compounds [ zr{(e5- C5H5)SiMe2(MBI)}R{CR[e2-N-(2,6- xylyl ) ] } ] ( r = me , CH2Ph , CH2SiMe3 ) . all of the new complexes were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and the x-ray molecular structures of the dibenzyl and the imino-benzyl compounds were determined . the catalytic activity for ethene polymerization and ethene / 1-hexene copolymerization of the dichloro zirconocenes [ Zr{(e5-C 5H5)EMe2(MBI)}Cl2 ] ( e = C , Si ) , activated with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , was measured .

the chemistry of the metallocene bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complexes ( Cp2M(L)(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ] [ m = Ti , without L ( 1 ) ; m = Zr , L = THF ( 2a ) ; m = Zr , L = pyridine ( 2b ) ] , the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl complexes [ cp . 2M(e2-Me3Si-C2SiMe3) ] [ m = Ti ( 3 ) , Zr ( 4 ) ] , and the ethylenebis(tetrahydroindenyl) ( ebthi ) complexes rac-[(ebthi)M(e2-Me3SiC2-SiMe3)] [ m = Ti ( 5 ) , Zr ( 6 ) ] has been described in several reviews . A fine - tuning of the reactions is possible by varying the cp ligands ( cp , cp. , ebthi ) , additional the co-ligands ( THF , pyridine ) , and / or metals ( Ti , Zr ) , and it has been pointed out that these complexes offer a number of compelling advantages over other , similar , widely used metallocene reagents . In this microreview recent ( 2000-2004 ) examples of the chemistry of complexes 1-6 are summarized , and some special interactions with lewis acids are described . In these reactions the metallocene cores " Cp'2Ti " and " Cp'2Zr " ( cp' = substituted cp ligands ) are mostly formed after dissociation of the alkyne . As examples of this , a new selective zirconocene coupling route to large , functionalized macrocycles has been established from 2b and polyynes , complex <nUm> catalyses the first anti-Markovnikov hydroarnination of terminal alkynes , complexes <nUm> and <nUm> selectively form polynuclear titanium complexes by C-C coupling of N - containing heterocycles , and complexes <nUm> , 2b , <nUm> , and <nUm> promote selective C-H and C-F bond - cleavage reactions of fluorinated N - containing heterocycles . beside this recent chemistry , this microreview also focuses on the reactions of the above-mentioned complexes with the lewis acids diisobutylaluminum hydride and tris-(pentafluorophenyl)borane . for example , complexes <nUm> , 2b , and <nUm> react with iBu2AlH to give heterodimetallic complexes containing tetracoordinate planar carbon atoms . the titanium complex <nUm> reacts with B(C6F 5)3 with elimination of the alkyne and gaseous hydrogen to give an electrophilic substitution of the cp or cp . ligand in which zwitterionic TiIII complexes are formed . the zirconium complexes <nUm> and <nUm> do not liberate hydrogen in the reaction with B(C6F 5)3 , although , after C-H activation of one methyl group of the cp . or cp part of the ebthi ligand and a B-C bond formation , zwitterionic complexes containing alkylidene groups with agostic interactions with the metal center are obtained . complex <nUm> reacts with B(C6F 5)3 with Si-C bond cleavage of the alkyne and formation of an alkynylboranate [ Me3SiC = BC19F15 ] - , which is complexed by the " rac - (ebthi)Ti " fragment to give a zwitterionic complex . some of the formed heterodinuclear complexes and the zwitterionic complexes are active catalysts in the ring - opening polymerization of lactones , cyclic carbonates , and epoxides , as well as the polymerization of ethylene .

the synthesis and characterization of chiral bis(indenyl)zirconium dichlorides containing b-pinenyl-derived ligand substituents is reported . unbridged metallocene complexes having the [?](1S , 2S , 5S)-6,6- dimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]hept-2-yl]methyl)dimethylsilyl substituent in both 1- and 2-positions of the indenyl moiety were prepared and isolated in moderate to low yields by reaction of the corresponding indenyllithium salts with ClZr <nUm> followed by work-up and crystallization procedures . the corresponding tetrahydroindenyl complexes were obtained in excellent yields by catalytic hydrogenation of the indenyl six - membered rings . In a complementary approach , a synthetic route to a-pinenyl-substituted indenyl ligand analogues was briefly evaluated , which however , suffered from low yields . selected ss-pinenyl-substituted indenyl complexes were scanned as catalysts for the dehydropolymerization of phenylsilane upon activation with nBuLi , for polymerization of ethylene and propylene upon activation with methylalumlnoxane ( MAO ) as well as for enantioselective carboalumination of 1-octene with triethyland trimethylaluminum . the bis(indenyl) complexes catalyzed the carboalumination reaction , albeit only low yields ( 8-16 % ) and low enantioselectivities ( ee = 0.5-10 % ) were obtained . the 2-substituted bis(indenyl)zirconocene / MAO catalyst system produced atactic low - molecular weight polypropylene with low polymerization activity whereas both 1-and 2-substituted complexes showed high activities in ethylene polymerization producing polyethylenes with high molecular weights ( mw > <nUm> ) .

the reactions engaged by organic radicals with transition - metal complexes are reviewed with a particular focus on how they can interplay with and affect the results of radical polymerization . radicals can either add to a metal centre to establish metal-carbon bonds , abstract an atom or group , be abstracted by an atom or group , undergo associative exchange , transfer a b-H atom or add to existing ligands in the metal coordination sphere . reversibility is key for certain controlled polymerization methods . the various ways in which metal complexes can play a role in radical polymerization lead to atom - transfer radical polymerization ( ATRP ) , organometallic - mediated radical polymerization by either reversible termination ( OMRP-RT ) or degenerative transfer ( OMRP-DT ) and chain - transfer - catalysed radical polymerization ( CTCRP ) . radicals react with transition - metal complexes in many different ways . the type of reaction , when reversible , is relevant to the outcome of metal - mediated radical polymerizations . this article analyses all these reactivity patterns and their relevance to radical polymerization processes , attempting to identify trends and principles of general use .

since its discovery , methylalumoxane ( MAO ) has become of great importance as a cocatalyst in homogeneous olefin polymerization . the working principles of single - site polymerization catalysts are well - understood , but those of the cocatalyst MAO itself are not . thus far structural and functional investigations have yielded limited insights and often give contradicting results . MAO 's complex nature is due to multiple equilibria between undefined oligomers and " free " trimethylaluminum . fundamental studies do not clearly portray the molecular structure , and the exact functioning of MAO remains a topic of debate . this comprehensive overview starts with the historical background of MAO and then focuses on its synthesis and large - scale production , structural characterization , properties , and different roles in the activation of olefin polymerization catalysts . also given is an overview of potential modifications , immobilization on surfaces , and other alternative applications that have been reported for MAO .

In situ reduction of [(fcP,B)PdMe][BArF] in the presence of a substituted norbornene results in significant decrease of catalytic activity . addition of one equivalent of oxidant restores the activity .

KGaA , weinheim In this contribution , we investigated the key factors for the successful preparation of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) from CO <nUm> and me <nUm> Al by analyzing the reaction intermediates and by - products . the preparation of MAO , which possesses high cocatalytic ability , requires a precise amount of CO <nUm> feed . GC – MS and NMR analysis of the product suggested that tert-butoxyaluminum species was a key intermediate , which guaranteed the involvement of CO <nUm> in the formation of MAO . the prepared MAO can be applied as a cocatalyst in propylene polymerization using zirconocene , titanocene , nickel , and iron catalysts ; its performance as cocatalyst reached to almost the same level as that of the commercially available MAO . considering that currently olefin monomers require thorough removal of CO <nUm> before polymerization , this method can open the way to omitting some purification processes in the polyolefin industry . 
the interaction of the group <nUm> metal chlorides , MCl4 , where m = Ti , Zr , Hf , with two equiv. of methyllithium at <nUm> ° C in toluene has led to the corresponding methylidene-metal complex , CH2 = MCl2 , possibly complexed with ClLi . that this complex was stable to at least <nUm> ° C was demonstrated by adding chemical trapping agents at this temperature : <nUm> ) benzophenone was quantitatively converted into 1,1-diphenylethylene when m = Ti or Zr ; with the Hf analogue , a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of 1,1-diphenylethylene and 1,1-diphenylethanol was produced ; <nUm> ) propiophenone reacted with the methylidene complex to yield 2-phenyl-1-butene , <nUm> % ( m = Ti ) or <nUm> % ( m = Zr ) , with the majority of the propiophenone being recovered ( the unreacted ketone is attributed to enolate salt formation competing with the methylidenation ) ; <nUm> ) diphenylacetylene reacted with CH2 = Cl2Ti by cycloaddition in <nUm> % yield , ultimately to give a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of a-methyl-cis-stilbene and a-methyl-trans-stilbene ; and finally <nUm> ) norbomene was polymerized in a ROMP process by either the methylidenetitanium or methylidene-zirconium complex , but the titanium catalyst exhibited higher activity . the stability of such methylidene complexes proved to be highly temperature- and solvent - dependent : <nUm> ) the methylidene complex in toluene was no longer detectable by chemical trapping when the reaction mixture was warmed to <nUm> ° C or above ; <nUm> ) the generation of the methylidene complex in THF was uniformly unsuccessful even at <nUm> ° C or above . from these observations this study concludes that in toluene the free methylidene complex , CH2 = MCl <nUm> , is not present but rather the agent is still bonded to ClLi . At higher temperatures in toluene or even at <nUm> ° C in THF , the ClLi dissociates from such complexation and the free methylidene dimerizes to [Cl2M-CH2]2 , as is known in the case of cp 2Ti = CH2 .

an intramolecular mannich reaction ( HNMe2 , Cl4Ti ) was used to convert 1,1'-diacetylferrocene to the unsaturated amino[3]ferrocenophane <nUm> . subsequent hydrogenation gave <nUm> . to obtain enantiomerically pure chelate P,P - [3]ferrocenophane ligands the readily available pure dimethylamino[3]ferrocenophane enantiomers (R,R)-3 and (S,S)-3 each were treated with butyllithium followed by chlorodiphenylphosphane to yield the chelate P,N - [3]ferrocenophanes (R,R,Rpl)-10 and ( S,S,S pl)-10 , respectively . their treatment with HPPh2 in glacial acetic acid resulted in substitution of the -NMe2 group by -PPh2 with overall retention of configuration to yield ( R,R,R pl)-11 and (S,S,Spl)-11 , respectively ( both characterized by x-ray diffraction ) . similarly , the reaction of (R,R,Rpl)-10 or (S,S,Spl)-10 with dicyclohexylphosphane / AcHO yielded the pure (R,R,Rpl)-12 and (S,S,Spl)-12 enantiomers , respectively . both these compounds were also characterized by x-ray crystal structure analyses . (R,R,Rpl)-12 was employed in catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation and also in asymmetric alternating carbon monoxide / propene copolymerization . A catalyst that was generated in situ from the chelate P,P - [3]ferrocenophane ligand and palladium acetate gave the CO / propene alternating copolymer with a good activity and high asymmetric induction . the catalyst derived from the reaction of (R,R,Rpl)-11 with [ rh(cod) 2]BF4 was employed in the enantioselective hydrogenation of dimethyl itaconate ( DMI ) ( <nUm> , ca. <nUm> % ee , r-configured product ) and methyl a-acetamidocinnamate ( MAC ) <nUm> ( ca. <nUm> % ee , r-configured product ) .

In the polymerization of olefins with group <nUm> metallocene dichlorides or dimethyl derivatives as procatalysts the use of polymethylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as the cocatalyst , especially in extreme excess ( 102-103 times the metallocene equivalent ) , has been shown to have an extraordinary accelerating effect on the rate of olefin polymerization , when compared with the cocatalytic action of alkylaluminum halides . In attempts at explaining the greatly superior catalytic activity of MAO in olefin polymerization ( the MAO conundrum ) , hypotheses have generally paralleled the steps involved in the cocatalytic action of RnAlCl3-n , namely the alkylation of Cp2MtCl2 , ionization of Cp2M t(R)Cl into the metallocenium cation , [ Cp2M t-R]+ , and anion , [Rn-1AlCl4-n] - and subsequent ion - pair separation . In order to understand any differences in catalytic action between such cocatalysts , we have studied the individual action of MAO ( <nUm> equiv. ) and of MeAlCl2 ( 1-2 equiv. ) on each of the group <nUm> metallocene derivatives , Cp2TiCl2 , Cp2ZrCl2 , Cp2Ti(CH3)2 and Cp2Zr(CH3)2 . with MeAlCl2 each of the metallocene derivatives appeared to form the cation , [ Cp2M t-CH3]+ , with greater ( Ti ) or lesser ( Zr ) ease , because an alkyne such as diphenylacetylene was then found to insert into the Mt - CH3 bond stereoselectively . In striking contrast , treatment of each metallocene with MAO gave two reactions very different from MeAlCl2 , namely a steady evolution of methane gas upon mixing and a finding upon hydrolytic workup that the diphenylacetylene present had undergone no insertion into the Mt - CH3 bond but instead had been reductively dimerized completely to (E,E)-1,2,3,4-tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene . to account for this astonishing difference in chemical behavior between MAO and MeAlCl2 in their cocatalytic activation of group <nUm> metallocenes to olefin polymerization , it is necessary to postulate a novel , unique sequence of reaction steps occurring between MAO and the metallocene . if one starts with the metallocene dichloride , then the free TMA present in the MAO would generate the Cp2Mt(CH3)2 . this metallocene dimethyl derivative , complexed with an oligomeric MAO unit , would undergo a transfer - epimetallation with added olefin or acetylene to form a metallacyclopropane or metallacyclopropene , respectively . with added diphenylacetylene the resulting 2,3-diphenylmetallacyclopropene would be expected rapidly to insert a second alkyne to form the 2,3,4,5-tetraphenyl-1- metallacyclopentadiene . simple hydrolysis of the latter intermediate would generate (E,E)-1,2,3,4-tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene while alternative workup with D2O would give the 1,4-dideuterio derivative of this butadiene . both such expectations were confirmed by experiment . In the case of added olefin , similar metallacyclopropane and metallacyclopentane intermediates should be produced until ring opening of the latter five - membered ring leads to an open - chain zwitterion , a process having ample precedent in the research of gerhard erker . the solution to the MAO conundrum then , namely the extraordinary cocatalytic activity of MAO in olefin polymerization by metallocenes , lies in the unique catalytic activation of the group <nUm> metallocene dimethyl derivative , which occurs by transfer - epimetallation of the olefin monomer by the cp 2Mt(CH3)2-MAO complex . the most advantageous lewis acidic sites in the MAO - oligomeric mixture for such metallocene - MAO complexation are suggested to be terminal Me2Al-O- AlMe- segments of an open - chain oligomer .

the acid - catalyzed reaction between formaldehyde and 1H-indene , 3-alkyl- and 3-aryl-1H-indenes , and six - membered - ring substituted 1H-indenes , with the 1H-indene / CH2O ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> , at temperatures above <nUm> ° in hydrocarbon solvents , yields 2,2'-methylenebis[1H-indenes] 1-8 in 50-100 % yield . these 2,2'-methylenebis[1H-indenes] are easily deprotonated by <nUm> equiv. of BuLi or MeLi to yield the corresponding dilithium salts , which are efficiently converted into ansa - metallocenes of Zr and Hf . the unsubstituted dichloro{(1,1',2,2',3,3',3a,3'a,7a,7'a-e)-2 , 2'-methylenebis[1H-inden-1-yl]}zirconium ( [ZrCl2(1')] ) is the least soluble in organic solvents . substitution of the 1H-indenyl moieties by hydrocarbyl substituents increases the hydrocarbon solubility of the complexes , and the presence of a substituent larger than a me group at the 1,1' positions of the ligand imparts a high diastereoselectivity to the metallation step , since only the racemic isomers are obtained . methylene-bridged ' ansa - zirconocenes ' show a noticeable open arrangement of the bis[1H-inden-1-yl] moiety , as measured by the angle between the planes defined by the two p-ligands ( the ' bite angle ' ) . In particular , of the ' zirconocenes ' structurally characterized so far , the dichloro{(1,1',2,2',3 , 3',3a,3'a,7a,7'a-e)-2,2'-methylenebis[4 , 7-dimethyl-1H-inden-1-yl]}zirconium ( [ZrCl2(5')] is the most open . the mixture [ZrCl2(1')] / methylalumoxane ( MAO ) is inactive in the polymerization of both ethylene and propylene , while the metallocenes with substituted indenyl ligands polymerize propylene to atactic polypropylene of a molecular mass that depends on the size of the alkyl or aryl groups at the 1,1' positions of the ligand . ethene is polymerized by rac-dichloro-{(1,1',2,2',3,3',3a,3'a,7a,7'a-e) -2,2'-methylenebis[1-methyl-1H-inden-1-yl]}zirconium ( [ ClZr 2(2') ] ) / MAO to polyethylene waxes ( average degree of polymerization ca. <nUm> ) , which are terminated almost exclusively by ethenyl end groups . polyethylene with a high molecular mass could be obtained by increasing the size of the 1-alkyl substituent . 
the mechanism of isotactic polypropylene ( iPP ) polymerization with an (R,R)-ansa-zirconocene / borate catalyst system was analyzed using quantum chemistry ( QC ) calculations by focusing on the extent of structural change during monomer insertion . the activation energy for migratory insertion , ea , was compared for four possible reaction paths with regard to monomer coordination , that is , 1,2-re , 1,2-si , 2,1-si , and 2,1-re , until the seventh monomer insertion step , explicitly including a borate anion cocatalyst . this indicated that the 1,2-re path was most favorable , except for the first step , which favored 1,2-si . As far as the first step , the product of 1,2-si is a conformational isomer to that of the 1,2-re path , and the exceptional favorability of 1,2-si does not affect the isoselectivity . these results support previous studies , except that our results address the unexplored seventh insertion step with a borate anion cocatalyst by QC calculations . the isoselectivity correlated with the extent of structural change in the whole system during the reaction . it was proved from our detail analysis that the advantage of 1,2-re with a small ea is attributed to its smaller structural changes due to low steric repulsion in the system compared with other paths . conversely , larger repulsion in the systems involved in other paths results in larger structural changes to minimize the structural strain . however , the relaxation appears insufficient due to structural restriction of the enforced four - membered ring transition state structure . A borate anion cocatalyst broke the C2 symmetry of the electronic structures of zirconocene , resulting in an odd – even ea frequency for the monomer insertion . molecular orbital analysis demonstrated that the d – π orbital overlaps can explain the approach direction of the olefin coordination and the bent structure of zirconocene , providing a different viewpoint from previous studies . the potential for catalyst control was discussed based on our results . © <nUm> wiley periodicals , inc . 
A novel metallocene catalyst was prepared from the reaction of (e3-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)dimethylaluminum ( Cp*AlMe2 ) and titanium(IV) n-butoxide Ti(OBu)4 . the resulting titanocene Cp*Ti(OBu)3 was combined with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) / tri-iso-butylaluminum ( TIBA ) to carry out the syndiotactic polymerization of styrene . the resulting syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) possesses high syndiotacticity according to 13C NMR . catalytic activity and the molecular weight of the resulting sPSs were discussed in terms of reaction temperature , concentration of MAO , amounts of scavenger TIBA added , and the hydrogen pressure applied during polymerization . 
recent examples for synthesis and reaction chemistry with (imido)vanadium(V)-alkyl , -alkylidene complexes have been briefly summarized . (Arylimido)vanadium(V) dichloride complexes especially containing aryloxo ligands exhibited notable activities for ethylene polymerization , and the reacition pathways for the polymerization / dimerization using (imido)vanadium(V) dichloride complexes containing (2-anilidomethyl)pyridine ligands can be tuned by modification of the steric bulk in the imido substituents ; the adamantylimido analogues exhibited exceptionally high both activity and selectivity in the dimerization . these vanadium (V) - alkyl complexes showed unique reactivity toward phenols ; the reaction proceeds via coordination of phenols to the vanadium . the vanadium(V)-alkylidene complexes were generated by a-hydrogen elimination from the dialkyl analogues in the presence of PMe <nUm> etc. ; the subsequent 1,2-C-H bond activation of benzene with (arylimido)vanadium(V)- alkylidene containing 1,3-(2',6'-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin-2-iminato ( im DIPPN ) ligand took place cleanly .

on the basis of quantum chemical modeling , a kinetic scheme of methyl methacrylate polymerization initiated by benzoyl peroxide in the presence of ferrocene was proposed . the process runs by mechanism , which includes the reactions of free radical polymerization , and the reactions leading to formation and operability of two type coordination active sites that are capable of converting into each other . on the basis of the proposed scheme , a kinetic model was developed . this model quantitatively described the following : the experimentally determined time dependences of the methyl methacrylate conversion , the conversion dependencies of the number - average and weight - average molar masses of poly(methyl methacrylate ) , the stereoregularity values of poly(methyl methacrylate ) , and the time dependencies of the methyl methacrylate conversion upon its polymerization on poly(methyl methacrylate ) macroinitiators obtained in radical - initiated polymerization in the presence of ferrocene . As a result of solving the inverse kinetic problem , the parameters of temperature dependences of the reaction rate coefficients of the proposed kinetic scheme were found . 
various poly(e-caprolactone)s ( PCLs ) prepared by ring - opening polymerization of e-caprolactone ( CL ) initiated by a range of metallic derivatives such as alkoxides , Al(OiPr)3 , La(OiPr)3 , sn(octanoate)2 , Ti(OiPr)4 , Zn[O(CH2) 3NHtBoc]2 , or borohydride La(BH 4)3(THF)3 were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxicity . the amount of residual metal present in the polymer samples was measured and compared to the initial quantity introduced . the effect of the metallic system on the biocompatibility profiles of the resulting polyesters was evaluated in vitro on PCL films from a series of cytotoxicity tests involving MTT and neutral red assays upon exposure to human osteoprogenitor cells . the absence of toxic influence of all these PCLs suggests that they may be used as biomaterials in contact with living human cells .

methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) was polymerized with Cp2ZrCl2 / methylalyminoxane or Cp2M(CH3)2 ( m : Zr , Hf ; cp = cyclopentadienyl ) combined with BC18F15 ( 1 ) or Ph3CB(C6F5)4 ( 2 ) , ( ph = phenyl ) . in the presence of a lewis acid like C4H10Zn with slow inititation , which gave syndiotactic-rich poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) with high molecular weight . the polymer yield increases with polymerization time , which indicates that the propagation rate is zero order in concentration of monomer . the polymer yield increases also with concentration of Cp2Zr(CH3)2.2 , which indicates the zirconocene to be the real catalyst . the polymer yield and the initiation efficiency ( N / [Zr] ) increase with the concentration of C4H10Zn , which indicates C4H10Zn , to be involved in the initiation . it is also shown that the propagation reaction is independent of the concentration of C4H10Zn . methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) was polymerized with Cp2ZrCl2 / methylalyminoxane or Cp2M(CH3)2 ( m : Zr , Hf ; cp = cyclopentadienyl ) combined with BC18F15 ( 1 ) or Ph3CB(C6F5)4 ( 2 ) , ( ph = phenyl ) . in the presence of a lewis acid like C4H10Zn with slow inititation , which gave syndiotactic-rich poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) with high molecular weight . the polymer yield increases with polymerization time , which indicates that the propagation rate is zero order in concentration of monomer . the polymer yield increases also with concentration of Cp2Zr(CH3)2.2 , which indicates the zirconocene to be the real catalyst . the polymer yield and the initiation efficiency ( N / [Zr] ) increase with the concentration of C4H10Zn , which indicates C4H10Zn , to be involved in the initiation . it is also shown that the propagation reaction is independent of the concentration of C4H10Zn . © <nUm> huthig & wepf verlag , zug 
methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) was reacted with a small quantity of p-hydroquinone to obtain a modified MAO insoluble in toluene . ethylene and propylene homo- and copolymerization were conducted with zirconocene using the modified MAO as cocatalyst both in the presence and absence of triisobutylaluminium . it was found that the modified MAO alone can not activate the zirconocene catalyst , whereas polymers with high molecular weights are obtained when combined with triisobutylaluminium . the catalytic activity is markedly dependent on the mole ratio of p-hydroquinone to MAO as well as the amount of triisobutylaluminium . 
olefin polymerizations were conducted with novel multimetallic zirconocene catalyst systems : R-CpCpZrCl2 ( 1 ) ( r = dimethylsilylferrocene ; cp = cyclopentadienyl ) and (R-Cp)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) in combination with methylaluminoxane or tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borates . In ethylene polymerization , the maximum catalyst activity was observed at a lower temperature ( 30-45 ° C ) when using complex <nUm> or <nUm> , compared with Cp2ZrCl2 . it was also revealed that complex <nUm> is a more effective catalyst than Cp2ZrCl2 for copolymerization of ethylene and propene . 
work in the field of application of metallocene - based catalysis in olefin , diolefin and styrene polymerization has become a research topic of growing interest in recent years . A great number of symmetric and chiral zirconocenes have been synthesized , that give tailored polymers of totally different structures . single site catalysts have the capability of permitting the user to control polymer tacticity , molecular weight and molecular weight distribution more efficiently . beside the homopolymers of polyethylene and poly(propylene) , new kinds of copolymers and elastomers can be synthesized . 
polysiloxanes with bisindenyl , bisfluorenyl , and bis(1,2,3,4-tetramethyl)cyclopentadienyl side groups were synthesized by condensation of the corresponding dichlorosilane compounds and water to obtain supported zirconocene catalysts . the polymerization of ethene was conducted over these catalysts combined with methylalumoxane . the polymerization activity depends markedly upon the substituents and decreases in the order : bisindenyl ≫ bisfluorenyl ≫ bis(1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadienyl) . all the supported catalysts give linear polyethene with fairly high molecular weights . the catalyst with bisindenyl groups was found to be composed of a toluene - soluble and a toluene - insoluble fraction . the polymerization profile ( activity versus time curve ) was analyzed with the toluene - soluble and -insoluble fraction as well as the corresponding homogeneous system . the homogeneous system , which exerts the highest activity in the initial phase , was completely deactivated after several hours whereas the activity of the supported catalyst , especially of the toluene - insoluble fraction , was unchanged during <nUm> h even at <nUm> ° C . polysiloxanes with different content of bisindenyl groups were also synthesized via the co-condensation with dimethyldichlorosilane and applied as the carrier . however , the activity per Zr atom decreases remarkably with an increase in dimethylsilane units . 
1-Butene polyinsertion promoted by two typical C2 - symmetric zirconocene catalysts ( i.e. rac-ethylenebis(1-indenyl)ZrCl2 ( 1 ) and rac-dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl)ZrCl2 ) ( 2 ) was investigated under both hydrooligomerization and polymerization conditions and compared with that of propene . it was found that , in spite of a similar regiospecificity for the two monomers , the fraction of " dormant " sites is higher in 1-butene polymerization , as a result of a ( much ) lower reactivity of a <nUm> last - inserted unit . accordingly , in the investigated cases , <nUm> units of 1-butene were not incorporated in the growing chains but either isomerized to <nUm> units or remained at the chain end until they underwent chain transfer via b-hydrogen elimination . experimental evidence is also presented of an epimerization reaction of the growing poly(1-butene) chain with a <nUm> last - inserted unit , leading to a decrease of polymer stereoregularity with decreasing monomer concentration . 
living cationic ring - opening polymerization of e-caprolactone ( CL ) , d-valerolactone ( VL ) and 1,3-dioxepane-2-one ( 6 ) was achieved at room temperature by using zirconocene borate complex catalysts . respective block copolymerization of CL with VL or with cyclic carbonate <nUm> was also successfully performed . the mechanism of the present cationic living polymerization is discussed . 
ethylene polymerizations and norbornene oligomerizations catalysed by Cp2Ti13CH3Cl / MAO ( cp : cyclopentadienyl ; MAO : methylaluminoxane ) mixtures have been carried out at different temperatures ( from <nUm> ° C to <nUm> ° C ) , in order to test the validity of carbene mechanisms in a-olefin polymerizations . depending on the temperature , different ratios of the cationic species [Cp2Ti13CH3]+[Cl · MAO]- and precursors of the alkylidene Cp2Ti = 13CH2 exist . the in situ polymerization of 13C enriched ethylene was monitored by 13C NMR spectroscopy . moreover , catalytic activity was determined and polyethylene samples were analyzed by 13C NMR and gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) . the following evidence has been provided against the carbene mechanism in the a-olefin polymerization with titanocene based catalysts : a ) in the in situ ethylene polymerization experiments the appearance of polyethylene signals is concurrent with the decrease of cationic [Cp2Ti13CH3]+[Cl · MAO]- signals and is not related to the intensity of the alkylidene Cp2Ti = 13CH2 signals ; b ) from the 13C NMR analysis of polyethylene chain - end groups the 13C enrichment of Cp2Ti13CH3Cl has only been found in the methyl chain - end group and not in the methylene of the propyl chain - end group , as should have been the case if the carbene mechanism had been valid ; c ) from norbornene oligomerization ( at <nUm> ° C ) the addition product 2-13C enriched methyl-norbornane has been identified . moreover , the identification of a 13C enriched methylidene-norbornane dimer at higher temperatures has revealed the possibility of norbornene addition to titanium carbenes through the formation of titanacyclobutane without the opening of the norbornene ring . however , this process requires higher energies with respect to the cossee type insertion . 
A supported version of zirconocene catalysts on siloxane copolymers having 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp'')-fluorenyl ( flu ) ( I ) or cyclopentadienyl (Cp)-fluorenyl ( II ) groups as substituents was prepared and applied to propene polymerization using methylalumoxane ( MAO ) or [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] as cocatalyst . catalyst ( I ) , which was soluble in toluene , exhibited very low activity , whereas catalyst ( II ) , which was composed of a toluene soluble ( Cat-A ) and an insoluble fraction ( Cat-B ) , displayed a fairly high activity . both catalysts ( A and B ) give a mixture of syndiotactic , atactic and a small quantity of isotactic polypropene , with a fraction of syndiotactic pentads ranging from about 50-75 % . In contrast , the corresponding non-supported catalyst gives almost completely atactic polypropene . 
the interaction of supported metallocene catalysts with methylaluminoxane leads to the desorption of the metallocene compound from the surface of the support and the formation of highly active homogeneous complexes . the catalytic properties of the system and characteristics of polyethylene formed are determined by these species . 
the Zr surface loading from Cp2ZrCl2 toluene solutions on different kinds of commercial silicas ( grace <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> ) was determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry . In all silicas , a saturation trend was observed with increasing amount of metal in the initial solution , the largest Zr loading value ( <nUm> wt.- % ) being observed for silica grace <nUm> . solid surface areas were determined by the BET method before and after metallocene immobilization , revealing that the values do not change after zirconocene impregnation . two different kinds of cocatalyst were used , methylaluminoxane and trimethylaluminium . the aluminium loading on silica grace <nUm> was determined using the 27Al(p,g)28Si nuclear reaction and titrometry , both showing that methylaluminoxane leads to an ' Al grafting ' four times more efficient than does trimethylaluminium . finally , the catalytic activity of these systems was tested in the polymerization of ethylene . the supported catalysts were shown to be active , specially using the low cost trimethylaluminium as a cocatalyst . the polymers obtained with the supported systems exhibited a higher molecular weight than those obtained with the homogeneous system . 
the effect of tert-butyl chloride ( tBuCl ) as a third catalyst component on the isoprene polymerization with neodymium isopropoxide ( Nd(OiPr)3 ) / diisobutylaluminum hydride ( Al(iBu)2H ) and Nd(OiPr)3 / methylaluminoxane-(MAO) catalysts was examined in heptane at a fixed [Al] / [Nd] ratio of <nUm> and reaction temperatures of <nUm> and <nUm> ° C . the Nd(OiPr)3 / Al(iBu)2H catalyst was inactive without tBuCl , i.e. , at [Cl] / [Nd] = <nUm> , while it showed the highest activity under the conditions of [Cl] / [Nd] = <nUm> and an addition order of { AI(iBu)2H + tBuCl } + Nd(OiPr)3 to yield polyisoprene with relatively low molecular weight ( mn ca , <nUm> × <nUm> ) , broad MWD ( mw / mn ca. <nUm> ) , and high cis-1,4 content ( ca. <nUm> % ) at <nUm> ° C . on the other hand , the Nd(OiPr)3 / MAO catalyst was effective at [Cl] / [Nd] = <nUm> , and the most active at [Cl] / [Nd] = <nUm> - <nUm> with an addition order of { Nd(OiPr)3 + MAO } + tBuCl to afford polymer with high molecular weight ( mn ca. <nUm> × <nUm> ) , fairly narrow MWD ( mw / mn ca. <nUm> ) and high cis- <nUm> content ( ca. <nUm> % ) at <nUm> ° C . thus , the novel Nd(OiPr)3 / MAO / tBuCl system features high activity , high molecular weight , narrow MWD , and high cis-1,4 stereospecificity , as compared with the conventional Nd(OiPr)3 / Al(iBu)2H / tBuCl system . 
the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) in the presence of the neutral chloro zirconocene enolates , Cp2ZrCl[OC(OMe) = CMe2 ] ( 1 ) , Me4C2(Cp)2 ZrCl[OC(OMe) = CMe2 ] ( 2 ) , and Me2C(Cp)2ZrCl[OC ( OMe ) = CMe2 ] ( 3 ) , was investigated . none of these compounds is catalytically active on its own . they could be activated by adding Ph3CB(C6F5) <nUm> ( 4 ) ; however , only if the initial concentration of enolate is higher than that of the perfluorated phenyl borate . polymers were produced with a number average molar mass of up to <nUm> <nUm> g / mol and a dispersion index of <nUm> - <nUm> with mixtures comprising <nUm> and <nUm> or <nUm> and <nUm> . the degree of polymerization depends only on the quantity of excess enolate and not on the absolute concentration of the initiator components . In contrast , a mixture of <nUm> and <nUm> was not very active . kinetic modeling of the systems as well as NMR spectroscopic investigations indicate that a bimetallic mechanism can describe chain growth . the activity of these catalytic systems depends on the structure of the ligand . the two zirconocenes with bridged cyclopentadienyl ligands , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , convert MMA considerably slower . In addition to the methyl zirconocene enolates with unbridged cyclopentadienyl ligands , the corresponding chloro zirconocene enolates are also suitable for the polymerization of MMA . the latter compounds offer the advantage that preparations for the production of the initiators are comparatively simple . 
A series of 1- and 2-aryl substituted indenyl titanium trichlorides ( ArIndTiCl3 , Ar = ph , a-Naph , b-Naph ) were synthesized and tested as catalyst precursors for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as a cocatalyst . the polymerization characteristics at varying Al : Ti ratios and the kinetic behavior of these systems were investigated at <nUm> and <nUm> ° C . the optimal Al : Ti ratio for these compounds lies in the range of 750-1500 at <nUm> ° C , while the optimum shifts to higher values of about 2000-5000 at <nUm> ° C . the activity of the investigated catalysts decreases in the order 2-PhInd > ind > cp > 1-(b-Naph)Ind > 1-PhInd > 2-(b-Naph)Ind > 2-(a-Naph)Ind > 1-(a-Naph)Ind with an activity up to <nUm> kg sPS / [ ( mol Ti ) · h ] for 2-PhIndTiCl3 / MAO as the most active catalyst . compared with CpTiCl3 / MAO , the indenyl substituted compounds show , as catalysts , increased long - term stability , which was determined by variation of the polymerization time . especially 2-PhIndTiCl3 , 1-(b-Naph) IndTiCl3 and 2-(b-Naph)IndTiCl3 show a good performance . syndiotactic polystyrenes with extremely high molar masses up to <nUm> × <nUm> g / mol can be obtained by the catalytic system 2-(b-Naph)IndTiCl3 / MAO . 
propene polymerisation was conducted with three ansa - zirconocene complexed : Me2Si(2-Me-4-PhInd)2-ZrCl2 ( A ) , me 2Si(2-Me-4-PhInd)2ZrClNMe2 ( B ) and me 2Si-(2-Me-4-PhInd)2ZrClNEt2 ( C ) . methylalumoxane ( MAO ) or [HNPhMe2][B(C6F5) <nUm> ] was used as cocatalyst . the influence of cocatalysts and trisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) on polymerisation activity , molecular weight and polymer microstructure was studied . furthermore , the alkylation and activation of the complexes were examined using UV / VIS spectroscopy . complex A was the most active in polymerisation , but polymers produced by B and C had in general higher molecular weights . replacing MAO partially by TIBA increased the molecular weight and prevented catalyst deactivation . according to the UV / VIS measurements , all complexes have low reactivity towards TMA and TIBA . similar cationic species were formed of all three studied zirconocenes in the reaction with MAO . additional TIBA did not affect the type of active species formed in the reaction of zirconocene and MAO , but increased the activity of B and C . 
copolymers of ethylene ( e ) with norbornene ( N ) were synthesized using the catalysts rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO ( 1 ) , <nUm> % rac / <nUm> % meso-Et(4,7-Me2Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO ( 2 ) , and rac-H2C(3-t-BuInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO ( 3 ) . catalyst activity , molar mass ( MM ) , and copolymer composition were studied as a function of time . the polymers showed an unusually narrow molar mass distribution ( MMD ) and a significant increase of their MM with time for up to one hour , suggesting a " quasi-living " polymerization at <nUm> ° C . the experimental data were fitted to kinetic equations and the propagation and transfer reactions were described in quantitative terms . norbornene greatly depressed the propagation rate , along with the chain transfer rate . the more sterically hindered catalysts of the series showed lower propagation and chain transfer turnover frequency than <nUm> and yielded polymers with a low ( 2 ) to very low ( 3 ) norbornene content . the presence of norbornene in solution seemed to be one of the main factors responsible for the observed " quasi-living " character of the copolymerization , probably due to coordination of norbornene to the active site . time - resolved kinetic studies also allowed for the calculation of the fraction of active metal centers , ranging from <nUm> % ( 3 ) and 66-68 % ( 1 ) to <nUm> % ( 2 ) of the total zirconium present , depending on catalyst structure . 
the origin of the syndiotactic selectivity in propene polymerization of a typical bridged fluorenyl-amido catalyst , namely [Me2Si(3,6-di-tert-butyl-9-fluorenyl)(Ntert-buty]) ] Cl2Ti ( 1 ) , activated with methylaluminoxane or [HMe2N(C6H5)][B(C6 F5)4 ] / al(i-butyl)3 , was investigated by means of <nUm> MHz 13C NMR spectroscopic microstructural polymer analysis . the asymmetric induction was traced unambiguously to enantiotopic - sites control . compared with the better - known cyclopentadienyl-fluorenyl ansa - zirconocenes , <nUm> turned out to be almost identically enantioselective ( in agreement with computer modeling ) , but less stereoselective because of a higher propensity to undergo site epimerization . this results in a chain microstructure with large predominance of m over mm stereodefects , deceptively similar to that of syndiotactic poly(propylene) produced under chain - end control . 
the synthesis of C1 - symmetric zirconocene complexes bearing the 2,5-dimethyl-7H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:4,3-b']dithiophene ligand ( S 2-3 ) linked to substituted cyclopentadienes is described . different syntheses of S2-3 , the common intermediate for the preparation of these complexes , are discussed . many of these complexes have been found to be highly active in propylene polymerization , to require very low amounts of methylalumoxane to be activated , and to produce poly(propylene)s of low isotacticity and melting points . 13C NMR analysis shows that the poly(propylene)s are fully regioregular and that the stereoerrors are randomly distributed , as shown by the enantiomorphic - site triad test e ≈ <nUm> . the experimental pentad distribution was fitted using a two - site model with different probability parameters for each site . the probability of chain back - skip was also taken into account . the molecular weight and crystallinity of the poly(propylene)s are dependent upon the type of substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ring , and the correlation between mmmm content and melting point of the PP confirms the random distribution of stereoerrors . 
sixteen C1 - symmetric zirconocene and one hafnocene complexes bearing the 2,5-R2-7H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:4,3-b']dithiophene ligand ( r = H , me , et , ph ) linked to a substituted indenyl ligand have been synthesized and tested in propylene polymerization . most of the C 1-symmetric zirconocenes of this type are highly active in propylene polymerization at low MAO / Zr ratios and produce poly(propylene)s ( PP ) in a broad range of isotacticity and melting points . the molecular weight and crystallinity of the PPs are strongly dependent upon the type of substituents on the indenyl moiety : PPs with Tm between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C and viscosity average molecular weights between <nUm> <nUm> and <nUm> <nUm> have been obtained at 50-70 ° C in liquid propylene .

homopolymerization of 4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene ( MP ) and copolymerization of 4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene with alkenes ( ethylene , 1-pentene , 4-methyl-1-pentene ) were performed to investigate the effect of the so - called backbiting coordination on the chemoselectivity of 1,3-diene polymerization . three homogeneous catalyst systems were used : CpTiCl <nUm> -MAO , cp <nUm> ClTi <nUm> -MAO and cp <nUm> ClTi - MAO . back - biting coordination is possible with the first catalyst , but not with the other two . the three catalysts gave similar results , which indicates that backbiting has no effect on the polymerization chemoselectivity , contrary to what has been reported in recent literature . an interpretation is presented for the formation of <nUm> units in MP / alkene copolymers . this interpretation is based on the fact that allyl groups have predominantly a syn configuration in MP homopolymerization , whereas allyl groups of anti configuration are formed in MP / alkene copolymerization . the role of backbiting in diene polymerization is discussed .

copolymerizations of ethylene and disubstituted diallylsilanes ( CH <nUm> = CH-CH2)2R2Si ( r = CH3 , C6H5 ) have been investigated with various zirconocene catalysts using methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst . the bridged stereospecific catalysts showed a higher reactivity for disubstituted diallylsilanes than the non-bridged aspecific catalysts , disubstituted diallylsilanes were incorporated into the polymer chain via cyclization insertion preferentially , and formed 3,5-disubstituted silacyclohexane units in the polyethylene main chain . A zirconocene catalyst , dimethylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride , produced a copolymer containing pendant ullyl groups derived from the 1,2-insertion of diallyldiphenylsilane without cyclization .

we have confirmed that water- and pentafluorophenol - modified isobutylmethylaluminoxane ( W / PM - MMAO ) enhances the productivity and stereoregularity of the yielded polymer and increases its molecular weight when propylene is polymerized using C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes . 13C NMR analysis shows that when W / PM - MMAO is used as a cocatalyst with C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes , although the pentad peaks of the stereoerrors derived from enantiofacial misinsertion have still existed ; those derived from the epimerization of the growing chain end that occurred with b-hydride elimination disappear . therefore , we propose that W / PM - MMAO interacts more strongly to the cationic metal center of metallocene than does MMAO owing to steric and electronic effect , and W / PM - MMAO suppresses b-hydride elimination , resulting in the production of polypropylene with higher molecular weight and isotacticity . to the contrary , there was no significant difference in the structure of the yielded polymer when W / PM - MMAO was used with Cs - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes . In the case of C s-symmetric ansa - zirconocene , the stereoerror is mostly the result of monomer insertion error , and small amount of stereoerror caused by " skipped " insertion , not from the epimerization of the polymer chain end that occurs after b-hydride elimination ; therefore , there might not be any difference of the microstructure of yielded polymers between MMAO and W / PM - MMAO . it can be concluded that the both cases of C2- and C s-symmetric ansa - zirconocenes are used as a catalyst , and water and phenol modification of MMAO does not affect the monomer misinsertion which is one of the mechanisms of the stereoerrors . KGaA , weinheim . 
the influence of the cocatalyst nature on the distribution of the stereoerrors along the polymer chain has been studied using either MAO or [(C6H5)3C+] [ ( C6F 5)4B- ] to activate a C1 - symmetric ( flu - ind ) complex in propene polymerization experiments . the in situ activation with borate indicated the chain back - skip as the decisive mechanism responsible for stereoerror formation . when MAO is used for activation , additionally the reversible chain transfer to aluminum occurs , which can be called into account as a second mechanism for stereoerror formation . by the combination of <nUm> NMR , DSC , WAXS and SFM , it was shown that the differences in polymerization mechanisms result in variations of stereoerror formation . due to this , the isotactic block length niso as well as their distribution along the chain changes . using MAO activation , polypropenes with crystallizable blocks consisting of 23-32 monomers in isotactic sequences were generated , which co-crystallized in a- and g-phase lamellae . when the reversible chain transfer was occluded ( in situ borate activation ) the bimodal distribution of crystalline lamellae strongly referred to a homogeneous random distribution of stereoerrors . In this case , two crystalline populations were present . the prevailing one , which crystallized in the orthorhombic g-modification , contained <nUm> consecutive isotactic blocks . additionally , small amounts of a-phase lamellae were present consisting of longer isotactic blocks ( niso > <nUm> ) . the different crystalline modifications resulted in different polymer morphologies . these changes caused in turn variations in the mechanical properties , such as elasticity and mechanical strength . this clearly shows that , by using different cocatalysts for activating C1- symmetric complexes , the properties of poly(propylenes) with statistically distributed stereoerrors can be tailored . 
linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) samples with different properties were prepared from ethylene , without the addition of an a-olefin co-monomer , using a combination of the catalyst precursors TpMsNiCl ( TpMs = hydridotris(3-mesitylpyrazol-l-yl) and cp 2ZrCl2 / SMAO-4 , by varying the nickel loading mole fraction ( xNi ) . upon activation with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , this binary catalytic system showed activities varying from <nUm> to <nUm> kg of PE · ( mol[M] · atm · h)-1 . the properties of the polymeric materials are influenced by xNa as well as by the temperature of polymerization , affording the copolymers with a melting point ( Tm ) between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C . the GPC results show that the molecular weight ( mw ) of the polymers is sensitive to the XNi . In all of the cases studied , the GPC curves displayed monomodal molecular weight distributions ( MWDs ) with the average molecular weight varying from <nUm> <nUm> to <nUm> <nUm> g · mol-1 . studies using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis ( DMTA ) show that the formation of different polymeric materials is associated with the branching content , with the stiffness varying according to the xNi and the temperature used in the polymerization reaction . KGaA , . 
isotactic polybutenes of variable isotacticity and melting points of form I in the range 100-125 ° C have been prepared with both C2- and C1 -symmetric zirconocenes . the C1 - symmetric zirconocenes bearing the bilateral symmetric 2,5-dimethyl-7H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:4,3-b'] dithiophene ligand connected by a dimethylsilandiyl bridge to a substituted indenyl ligand produce iPB with higher molecular mass , up to <nUm> at polymerization temperature of <nUm> ° C in liquid butene . the degree of isotacticity depends on the substitution pattern of the indenyl ligand . the correlations between microstructure and melting points of the crystalline forms I and II of iPB have been defined . some relevant differences in catalyst selectivity between propylene and 1-butene polymerizations have been identified . KGaA . 
six (Cp)(4-phenyl-indenyl)MCl2 ( A ) and four (Cp)(1-phenyl- indenyl)MCl2 ( C ) ( m = Zr / Hf ) based complexes were tested in ethene homo- and copolymerisation under different conditions to explain how the differences in the complex structure affect the polymerisation process and the formed polymer . polymerisation experiments reveal that hafnocene catalysts need a higher amount of MAO to reach the maximum activity than zirconocenes . hafnocenes also incorporate better 1-hexene . catalysts with the cp* or 1,2,4-Me3Cp ligand show higher activity , and work well with [HNMe2Ph] [B(C6F5)4] / TIBA as cocatalyst , but produce polymers with lower mn than the corresponding catalyst with a plain cp ligand . the cp* ligand seems to prevent 1-hexene incorporation . A methyl group in the 2-position of (Cp)(4-PhInd)ZrCl2 decreases the activity and mn but favours 1-hexene insertion . polymerisation activity is higher with catalysts with a l-PhInd - ligand than with a 4-PhInd - ligand .

random styrene-ethylene copolymers have been synthesized by the hydrogenation of styrene-butadiene copolymers . the samples were characterized by 13C NMR spectroscopy , x-ray powder diffraction , thermal analysis , and fourier transform IR ( FTIR ) spectroscopy . In the 13C NMR spectra , the resonance of the methylene carbon next to a methine bearing a phenyl group presents splitting due to its diastereotopic positions with respect to the phenyl substituents of the second and third inserted styrene units . A definitive assignment of the resonances of the SEES sequences ( S = styrene , e = ethylene ) was obtained by synthesis of a suitable model compound : 5,10-diphenyl- pentadecane . x-ray powder diffraction and thermal analysis show that these samples are amorphous . this is probably due to the shortness of the ethylene and styrene sequences in the copolymers . DSC thermograms show a single glass transition , at a intermediate temperature , between the tg values of polystyrene and polyethylene , depending on the styrene content in the chain . FTIR spectra indicate the presence of styrene sequences in an isotactic arrangement . KGaA . 
the replacement of MAO by different aluminum alkyls in the polymerization of higher a-olefins catalyzed by rac-EtInd2ZrCl2 and rac-(CH3)2CInd2ZrCl2 and in the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene with CpTiCl3 as a catalyst was studied . an activating effect for all catalysts investigated was found when adding TIBA , while TEA and THA have a deactivating effect . it was found that more than half of the expensive methylaluminoxane can be successfully replaced by TIBA without deleterious effects on the catalyst activity and the properties of the polymers synthesized during higher a-olefin polymerization catalyzed by rac-EtInd2ZrCl2 and rac - ( CH3 ) 2CInd2ZrCl2 .

KGaA.A set of titanium precatalysts [(L)TiCl3] based on imino-phenolate tridentate ligands ( ti1 , L = 3,5-tBu-2-(OH)C6H2CH-N-8-C9H6N ; ti2 , L = 3,5-tBu-2-(OH)C6H2CH-N-C2H4-O-C6H5 ; ti3 , L = 3,5-tBu-2-(OH)C6H2CH-N-CH2-C6H4OMe ; ti4 , L = 3,5-tBu-2-(OH)C6H2CH-N-C6H4-C6H5O ) is prepared and characterized by elemental analysis , IR , and NMR spectroscopy . upon activation with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , these precatalysts show good activity ( 200-660 kg of PE mol[Ti]-1 h-1 at <nUm> ° C ) in ethylene polymerization yielding high - density polyethylenes ( HDPEs ) with viscosity - average molecular weight ( mv ) in the range between <nUm> and <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 . the mv values of the resulting polyethylenes indicate strong influence of the aluminum concentration on the molecular weight , which can be associated to the probability of chain transfer from titanium to aluminum at high [Al] / [Ti] molar ratios . the polydispersity index ( PDI ) calculated from gc(oc) values are broad ( <nUm> to > <nUm> ) indicating the multisite nature of this class of titanium precatalysts . ti1 - ti4 are also tested in the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene affording high-molecular-weight poly(ethylene-co-1-hexenes) with comonomer incorporation varying from <nUm> to <nUm> mol % . the crystallization analysis fractionation ( CRYSTAF ) profiles of copolymers produced by ti2 - ti3 indicate the production of HDPE with very low efficiency ( quantity and distribution ) on incorporating 1-hexene . on the other hand , the polymer produced by ti1 shows a broad peak of branching fraction with different amount and comonomer distribution , suggesting a good 1-hexene distribution along of main polymer chain .

KGaA , Weinheim.The observed development of one - component photoinitiators of cationic polymerization reactions in the last forty years is briefly described . cationic photoinitiators can usually be activated by short wavelengths ( < <nUm> nm ) and relatively hard conditions ( high intensity ) . the search for cheaper and safer light sources has led to the use of light emitting diodes ( LEDs ) . In this review , a special emphasis is provided on the most recent and promising cationic initiators operating under near UV and visible LEDs . ferrocenium salts exhibit the broadest visible light absorption and are probably , from this point of view , the most versatile near UV and visible light cationic initiators . excellent photoinitiation performance has been found with the ferrocenium salts as one - component initiators , and the effect of ferrocenium salts based multi-component photoinitiating systems on the relevant photoinitiation performance has also been investigated . the progress made along the last forty years in the design of one - component photoinitiators of cationic polymerization reactions is briefly described .

KGaA , WeinheimThe influence of polymerization temperature ( tp ) on the isoselectivity of the C2 - symmetric zirconocene catalysts rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-PhInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO ( <nUm> / MAO ) , rac-Me(CyHex)Si[2-Me-4-(4'-tBuPh)Ind]2ZrCl2 / MAO ( <nUm> / MAO ) , and rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-5-OMe-6-tBuInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO ( <nUm> / MAO ) in propene polymerization , has been studied in the range <nUm> – <nUm> ° C in liquid propene . all three catalysts show similar polymerization activity versus tp profiles , with a maximum at about <nUm> ° C ( <nUm> / MAO ) , <nUm> − <nUm> ° C ( <nUm> / MAO ) , and <nUm> − <nUm> ° C ( <nUm> / MAO ) . <nUm> / MAO shows the highest activity at any tp . the isoselectivity of the three catalysts remains high and approximately constant in the whole tp range investigated , as indicated by the roughly constant isotactic triad content ( mm > <nUm> % ) of the produced isotactic poly(propylene)s ( iPP ) . surprisingly , the melting and crystallization temperatures of iPP increase by increasing TP . this behavior is due to an unexpected increase in catalyst regioselectivity with tp , as indicated by the decrease in the content of 2,1-erythro regiodefects ( 2,1e ) at increasing tp . A mechanism involving a metal cation – 2,1-coordinated propene slow state is proposed to account for this so far unnoticed behavior . the correlations between tp , Tm , and [2,1e] are defined for these three catalysts . ( figure presented . ). 
KGaA , WeinheimNovel vanadium - oxide - based catalysts supported on alumina , zirconia , or titania - modified silica , which are able to synthesize ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene ( UHMWPE ) , are successfully developed . compared with the unmodified silica supported catalyst , the activities of the modified catalysts are substantially enhanced . by changing the polymerization temperature ( tp ) from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C , the molecular weight of the produced UHMWPE can be easily regulated from <nUm> × <nUm> to more than <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 . it is the first time that chloride - free nonsingle site catalysts have been developed to synthesize UHMWPE within such a broad range of tp . catalyst characterization by NH3-temperature-programmed desorption and pyridine-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals that the modified catalysts have increased acidity derived from both lewis and bronsted acid sites . the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization indicates that the vanadium on the modified catalysts is more electron deficient . thus , the acidity of the catalysts and the electronic state of the vanadium play a critical role in determining the activity of the vanadium active sites for ethylene polymerization . ( figure presented . ). 
KGaA , WeinheimThe effects of sulfation on VOx / O2Si – MOy ( m = Al , Zr , or Ti ) are systemically studied for the synthesis of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene ( UHMWPE ) , showing that the activity remains stable under the investigated polymerization temperature ( tp ) from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C , and is almost doubled after sulfation . according to the results of H3N – TPD , pyridine-adsorption-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) , the enhancement effect in activity is likely related to the promoted acidity of the catalysts and the increased electron deficiency of the V center . remarkable cocatalyst dependence is found and has the priority of diethylaluminum chloride ( DEAC ) > ethylaluminum sesquichloride > triisobutylaluminum > triethylaluminum , and the highest activity of <nUm> kg PE mol-1 V could be obtained with DEAC as cocatalyst . the viscosity average molecular weight ( mv ) of the EsP can be regulated from <nUm> to <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 by decreasing tp from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C . based on the results of differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) annealing experiments , highly entangled UHMWPE is produced .

ethylene was polymerized in toluene using methylalumoxane ( MAO ) activated rac-(Me2SiOSiMe2)[Ind]2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) and rac-(Me2SiOSiMe2)[IndH4]2MtCl <nUm> ( Mt = Zr ( 2 ) ; Mt = Ti ( 3 ) ) . all three catalyst systems polymerize ethylene with high activity . the molecular weight of polymer produced with zirconocene ( 1 ) was up to a weight - average molecular weight mw = <nUm> × <nUm> at low polymerization temperature ( < <nUm> ° C ) under atmospheric pressure . the titanocene catalyst <nUm> shows lower activity and produced lower molecular weight polyethylene than zirconocenes <nUm> and <nUm> . replacement of aromatic rings in <nUm> by cyclohexane rings , leading to <nUm> , increases activity and reduces molecular weight . the catalyst systems show a dependency of the activity on temperature . 
the disiloxane - bridged zirconocene complexes , tetramethyldisiloxanediylbis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride and tetramethyldisiloxanediylbis(cyclopentadienyl)dimethylzirconium initiate the homopolymerization of ethene as well as the copolymerization of ethene and a-olefin with a modified methylaluminoxane as cocatalyst . the catalyst systems give resonable activity but the molecular weight of polyethene decreases drastically with increasing polymerization temperature . 
In the polymerization of ethene cocatalyzed with modified methylaluminoxane , the catalyst activities of the siloxane - bridged dinuclear zirconocenes , tetramethyldisiloxanediylbis(cyclopentadienylindenylzirconium dichloride ) ( 3 ) and hexamethyltrisiloxanediylbis(cyclopentadienylindenylzirconium dichloride ) ( 4 ) were lower than that obtained with the siloxane - bridged mononuclear zirconocene , tetramethyldisiloxanediyldicyclopentadienyldimethylzirconium ( 1 ) . on the other hand , weight - average molecular weight mw and ratio of weight- to number - average molecular weights mw / mn of polyethene ( PE ) obtained with <nUm> or <nUm> were higher than those of PE obtained with <nUm> . for a binary mixture of <nUm> / <nUm> or <nUm> / <nUm> , it was found that the obtained PE exhibits a bimodal molecular weight distribution for an appropriate composition of the mixed zirconocenes . mw / mn of PE could be adjusted by changing the relative concentrations of the two zirconocenes . 
new supported catalysts on the basis of cyclopentadienylindenylzirconium dichloride ( CpIndZrCl2 ) anchored on silica with a trisiloxane spacer ( ZATS ) and a pentamethylene spacer ( ZAPM ) were prepared and used for ethylene polymerization with modified methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst . ZATS and ZAPM produce polyethylene with lower molecular weight but show higher activity than silica - supported CpIndZrCl2 which was prepared by reacting zirconocene directly with silica , i.e. , the activity of silica - supported CpIndZrCl2 is enhanced by introducing a spacer between silica surface and metallocene species . 
ethylene-propene copolymerization was carried out with Cp2MCl2 ( cp = cyclopentadienyl ) , rac-Et(Ind)2MCl2 , rac-Me2Si(Ind)2MCl2 ( et = ethylene , Me2Si = dimethylsilyl , ind = indenyl , m = Zr or Hf ) / methylaluminoxane . In the case of using ansa - hafnocenes , the minimum molecular size ( extended chain length ) of ethylene-propene copolymer was obtained at about <nUm> mol- % of propene content in the copolymer . the polymerization activity decreased with increase of propene feed ratio in non-bridged non-specific metallocenes . higher polymerization activities were observed for the copolymerization compared to ethylene and propene homo-polymerization with ansa - isospecific metallocenes . the factor of molecular size lowering was studied by the chain propagation and chain transfer reaction . 
monocyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride ( CpTiCl3 ) was directly immobilized on silica surface . the resulting CpTiCl3 / O2Si - MAO was investigated in view of its suitability for syndiospecific polymerization of styrene using ESR spectroscopy . polymerization results show that both the syndiotacticity and the activity decrease upon immobilization . A possible explanation is that the active sites may become aspecific after immobilization and part of the immobilized active sites can be leached into the solution in the presence of MAO . 
thanks to the use of a ligand consisting of a saturated ring fused to the cyclopentadienyl moiety , which sensibly increases the stability of titanocenes , it was possible to investigate the oscillating behavior of titanium catalysts in propylene polymerization for the first time . the titanium - based catalysts yield poly(propylene)s with new and interesting microstructures . indeed , in spite of the significantly lower isotactic pentad content [mmmm] , the average lengths of the isotactic blocks ( niso ) are similar or even higher than that obtained with the zirconium - based homologues . accordingly , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) analysis shows melting peaks which are more evident than those obtained with the zirconium homologues . the study of the microstructure of the poly(propylene)s obtained with these catalysts allowed us to participate in the still open discussion on the oscillating mechanism of unbridged metallocenes . 
the TiIIICp2Cl - catalyzed radical ring opening of epoxides produces Ti alkoxides which initiate the ring - opening polymerization of e-caprolactone . A linear dependence of mn on conversion , linear kinetics , low mw / mn values , and the synthesis of block copolymers demonstrate a living process , while NMR spectroscopy confirms the presence of the initiator chain end . epoxides are thus introduced as a new class of initiators for the Ti - catalyzed living ring - opening polymerization of cyclic esters .

propylene was copolymerized with 1,4-divinylbenzene ( 1,4-DVB ) using rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2ZrCl2 and MAO in the presence of hydrogen . 1H NMR spectra of the obtained copolymer confirmed the successful incorporation of 1,4-DVB . 13C NMR analysis revealed a unique copolymer structure with the incorporated 1,4-DVB units predominantly forming 1,4-substituted phenyl repeating units in the polymer main chain . A plausible mechanism involving spontaneous insertion of terminal styryl into Zr-H species was proposed to rationalize the unique incorporation of 1,4-DVB . KGaA .

the ability of a Cl2Mg support to activate a transition metal catalyst has been found to depend both on the crystallographic structure of the support and on the nature of the catalyst . A high degree of crystallographic disorder can be very effective for the immobilization and activation of titanium and vanadium complexes , but is not necessarily effective for zirconocene activation . A highly disordered support prepared by the reaction of MgBu <nUm> with ClH gave high activity with Cl4Ti but low activity with (n-PrCp)2ZrCl2 . high polymerization activities with the zirconocene were only obtained with supports of type ClMg <nUm> / AlRn(OEt)3-n prepared from the reaction of AlR3 with Cl2Mg · 1.1EtOH . these supports are characterized by additional peaks in the x-ray diffraction pattern , indicating the presence of a crystalline structure which is absent in the other supports and contains highly lewis acidic sites able to generate the active metallocenium species .

catalytic natures of organometallic catalysts are modulated by coordinating organic ligands with proper steric and electronic properties to metal centers . carbon - based nanomaterials such as graphene nanoplatelets are used with and without N - doping and multiwalled carbon nanotube as a ligand for ethylene polymerizations . zirconocenes or titanocenes are immobilized on such nanomaterials . polyethylenes ( EsP ) produced by such hybrids show a great increase in molecular weight relative to those produced by free catalysts . specially , ultra-high-molecular-weight EsP are produced from the polymerizations at low temperature using the hybrid with N - doped graphene nanoplatelets . this result shows that such nanomaterials act a crucial role to tune the catalytic natures of metallocenes . 
for polymer synthesis upon visible light , actual photoinitiator operates in a restricted part of the spectrum . As a consequence , several photoinitiators are necessary to harvest all of the emitted visible photons . herein , 2,7-di-tert-butyldimethyldihydropyrene is used for the first time as a multicolor photoinitiator for the cationic polymerization of epoxides . upon addition of diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate and optionally n-vinylcarbazole , the originality of this approach is to allow efficient monomer conversions under various excitation light sources in the 360-650 nm wavelength range : halogen lamps , and light - emitting and laser diodes . the synthesis of an interpenetrated polymer network from an epoxide / acrylate blend using a red light at <nUm> nm is also feasible . the formed polymer material exhibits a photochromic character . 2,7-Di-tert-butyldimethyldihydropyrene is proposed as the first panchromatic photoinitiator for cationic polymerizations and interpenetrated polymer network synthesis . excellent polymerization profiles are reached and the chemical mechanisms are investigated

the isolation of non-fluxional alumoxane compounds , [(tBu)2Al{OAl(tBu)2}]2 and [(tBu)AlO]n ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) , has allowed for an investigation of the mode of activity observed for alumoxanes as co-catalysts for the zirconocene polymerization of olefins . [(tBu)2Al{OAl(tBu)2}]2 , which contains two three-coordinate aluminum centers , shows no reaction with Cp2ZrMe2 , and no catalytic activity towards ethylene polymerization . In contrast , the closed cage compound [(tBu)AlO]6 reacts reversibly to give the ion pair complex , [Cp2ZrMe][(rBu)6Al6O6Me] , which is active as a catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene . polymerization is also observed for mixtures of Cp2ZrMe2 with [(tBu)AlO]n ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) .

metallocene / MAO catalysts are useful for the production of syndiotactic polystyrene - a new class of high performance polymers . the melting point of the obtained syndiotactic polystyrene depends on the metallocene used and can reach up to <nUm> ° C . In the past , the most active catalysts in polymerization have been half - sandwich titanocenes such as CpTiCl3 and Cp*TiCl3 . if the chlorinated compounds are changed into the fluorinated compounds as CpTiF3 and Cp*TiF3 , the activity increases by a factor of <nUm> to <nUm> . the fluorinated titanocenes are more stable at higher temperatures and need a lower MAO excess in order to obtain optimal activities . polymers obtained with the unsubstituted CpTiF3 show melting points which are <nUm> ° C lower than those synthesized by pentamethylcyclopentadienyltitaniumtrifluoride . especially Cp*TiF3 shows a much higher activity and , compared with the chlorinated compound , gives polymers with a higher molecular weight . substituted cyclopentadienyltitanocenes have even higher activities . ethene / styrene copolymers can be obtained by catalysis with zirconocene compounds . 
the syndiotactic polymerizations of styrene are carried out with dinuclear titanocenes such as tetramethyldisiloxanediylbis(cyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride ) , Cl3Ti-CpSi(CH3)2-O-Si(CH3) 2-Cp-TiCl3 ( 1 ) , hexamethyltriSiloXanediylbis(cyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride ) , Cl3Ti-CpSi(CH3)2-O-Si(CH3) 2-O-Si(CH3)2Cp-TiCl3 ( 2 ) and hexamethyltrisiloXanediylbis(dicyclopentadienyltitanium dichloride ) , Cl2CpTi-CpSi(CH3)2-O-Si-(CH3) 2-O-Si(CH3)2Cp-TiCpCl2 ( 3 ) in the presence of modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) . although the catalyst activity of dinuclear titanocenes is lower than that of the corresponding mononuclear titanocenes CpTiCl3 and Cp2TiCl2 , the former produce polystyrene of higher weight - average molecular weight and higher syndiotactic index than the latter . among the dinuclear titanocenes examined , <nUm> has the largest catalyst activity . In addition , the copolymerizations of styrene and ethylene are carried out with <nUm> . 
combined systems including diphenylzinc ( Ph2Zn ) , a metallocene , and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , have been employed to initiate the copolymerization of styrene ( S ) with p-alkylsubstituted styrenes and with a-olefins . the copolymerization processes depend largely on the comonomer , the nature of the metallocene included in the initiator system , the presence of Ph2Zn , the polymerization temperature and the solvent used . titanocenes produced true copolymers for S / p - substituted styrene , but not in S / a-olefin copolymerization . on the other hand zirconocenes either did not copolymerize S / p - substituted styrene or produced very low conversions , while they succeeded in copolymerizing S / a-olefin , depending on the particular zirconocene employed . A low p-methylstyrene ( p-MeS ) content in the S / p-MeS copolymer and a low p-tertbutylstyrene ( p-ButS ) content in the S / p-ButS copolymer decreased Tm , making them easier to process material than s-PS . 
metallocenes are highly active catalysts for the production of precisely designed polyolefins and engineering plastics . especially zirconocene / methylalumoxane ( MAO ) catalysts and half - sandwich titanium complexes have opened a frontier in the area of new polymer synthesis and processing . the materials obtained show different microstructures , tacticities and properties compared with conventional polymers . alternating ethene / propene polymers show lower glass transition temperatures than random copolymers . constrained geometry catalysts are useful for the synthesis of norbornene / ethene copolymers . 
In the present paper the effects of the solvent , a lewis base and of non-polymerizable olefin on copolymerization of propene with higher a-olefins performed with isospecific ansa - zirconocene catalysts are investigated . A wide range of solvents with increasing polarity , donor character and steric hindrance has been tested , and their effects on copolymer yield , composition and microstructure thoroughly analyzed . our results demonstrate that the solvent can have a significant influence on the copolymer composition , even though the solvent polarity is not the relevant factor . polymerizations carried out in coordinating solvents , e.g. aromatic solvents , lead to the formation of products with considerably decreased higher a-olefin content . the reduced incorporation of the higher a-olefin is explained in terms of competition between the nucleophilic medium and the olefin monomer for coordination to the active polymerisation site . the dependence of polymer microstructure on the solvent nucleophilicity is further elucidated by copolymerization studies performed in the presence of diisopropyldimethoxysilane as a lewis base . the addition of the non-polymerizable olefin , 2-methyl-1-pentene , which does not significantly affect comonomer composition , seems to slightly modify comonomer distribution . the sum of the results obtained give us valuable information regarding the mechanism of polymerisation at the active centers . 
copolymerization of ethylene and 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) by zirconocene catalysts proceeded via cyclization - addition mechanism to form 1,3-didsubstituted cyclopentane structure in the polyethylene chain . the 1,3-cyclopentane structure was found to be taken in the crystalline structure of polyethylene ( isomorphism ) by partially chainging the trans zigzag chain into gauche conformation , thereby , inducing a transformation of orthorhombic crystal to pseudohexagonal crystal . copolymerization of ethylene and cyclopentene ( CPE ) by zirconocene catalysts yielded copolymers having 1,2-disubstituted cyclopentane structure in the polyethylene chain . the 1,2-cyclopentane structure was not taken into the crystalline structure of polyethylene . the melting point ( Tm ) and the crystallinity ( xc ) of polyethylene decreased by copolymerization of HD or CPE , and the tm- and xc - decreasing effect of CPE was stronger than HD . for copolymers of propylene and HD or CPE obtained with isospecific zirconocene catalyst , the isomorphism was not ovserved . 
pentamethylcyclopentadienyltitanium tribenzyloxide , Cp*Ti(OBz)3 , was used as the catalyst precursor for polymerizations of propene and styrene . the titanocene catalyst affords atactic polypropene and syndiotactic polystyrene with high activities in the presence of methylalumimoxane ( MAO ) . block copolymerization of propene and styrene was carried out in the presence of Cp*Ti(OBz)3 / MAO catalyst system by the means of external addition of triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) and sequential monomer feed . the copolymerization product is mainly a mixture of atactic polypropene(aPP) and syndiotactic polystyrene(sPS) homopolymers and aPP-b-sPS block copolymers , which can be separated into fractions with successive extraction with boiling methylethyl ketone(MEK) , heptane , tetrahydrofuran(THF) , and chloroform . studies on thermal properties showed that rubbery phases and crystalline regions both appear in the block copolymer at the room temperature and that aPP-b-sPS block copolymer has better toughness than sPS . 
combined systems including diphenylzinc , Ph2Zn , a metallocene , and methylaluminoxane , MAO , have been employed to initiate styrene polymerization and the copolymerization of styrene with p-alkylsubstituted styrenes and a-olefins . both polymerization and copolymerization processes depend on the nature of the metallocene included in the initiator system , the presence of Ph2Zn , the temperature , and the solvent used . S / 1-alkene copolymers were obtained when the initiator systems included a zirconocene , but not when a titanocene participated . 
results of our studies on polymerization kinetics and tests of copolymerization statistical models of ethylene-norbornene ( E-N ) copolymers obtained on the basis of microstructures determined by 13C NMR analysis are reported , ethylene-norbornene ( E-N ) copolymers were synthesized by catalytic systems composed of racemic isospecific metallocenes , i-Pr[(3Pr i-Cp)(Flu)]ZrCl2 or a constrained geometry catalyst ( CGC ) and methylaluminoxane . polymerization kinetics revealed that E-N copolymerization is quasi living under standard polymerization conditions . calculations of the number of active sites and of chain propagation and chain transfer turnover frequencies indicate that the metal is mainly in the Mt-N* state , while the Mt-E* state contributes more to transfer and propagation rates . the first - order and the second - order markov statistics have been tested by using the complete tetrad distribution obtained from 13C NMR analysis of copolymer microstructures . the root-mean-square deviations between experimental and calculated tetrads demonstrate that penultimate ( second - order markov ) effects play a decisive role in E-N copolymerizations . results show clues for more complex effects depending on the catalyst geometry in copolymers obtained at high N / e feed ratios . comonomer concentration was shown to have a strong influence on copolymer microstructure and copolymer properties . the copolymer microstructure of alternating isotactic copolymers obtained with i-Pr[(3Pri-Cp)(Flu)]ZrCl2 have been described at pentad level . second - order markov statistics better describes also the microstrucure of these copolymers . 
the spectral sensitivity of onium salt photoinitiators in cationic polymerization can be tuned from the short wavelength region of the UV spectrum to wavelengths up to the visible region by using direct and indirect activation , respectively . indirect activation is based on the electron transfer reactions between onium salts and free radical photoinitiators , appropriate sensitizers and compounds capable of forming charge transfer complexes . bisacylphosphine oxides , dimanganese decacarbonyl in conjunction with alkyl halides and titanocene type photoinitiators such as irgacure <nUm> were shown to be useful free radical promoters providing the possibility of performing cationic polymerization in the long wavelength and visible region . the synthetic routes to prepare block copolymers by using electron transfer photosensitization and free radical promoted cationic polymerization are also described . 
Diphenylzinc-metallocene-MAO initiator systems have proven to be effective initiator systems for styrene and for substituted styrenes as well as for their styrene / ( styrene - derivative ) copolymerization . titanocene produced almost pure syndiotactic polymers while zirconocenes gave atactic polystyrene together with a low content , less than <nUm> % , of syndiotactic polystyrene . systems including a zirconocene , particularly ethenyl(bisindenyl)zirconium dichloride were effective initiators of 1-alkene polymerization and of styrene / 1-alkene copolymerization . conversion to polymer increases with the molecular size of 1-alkene . styrene derivative and styrene / ( styrene derivative ) polymerization was greatly influenced by the inductive effect of substituent and by steric hindrance due to the monomer . 
series of propene - norbornene ( P-N ) copolymers were synthesized in the presence of two C2 symmetric zirconocenes , rac - Et(Indenyl) 2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) and rac-Me2Si(Indenyl) 2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , and of the Cs symmetric zirconocene Me2C(Cp)(Fluorenyl)ZrCl2 ( 3 ) with MAO as cocatalyst . P-N copolymers were characterized by 13C NMR spectroscopy , SEC , and DSC . A first assignment of the main 13C NMR signals of P-N copolymers obtained with <nUm> and <nUm> containing isolated N units was obtained on the basis of DEPT experiments and by comparison with isotactic polypropene ( i-PP ) and E-N copolymer spectra . ab initio theoretical 13C NMR chemical shifts , combined with R.I.S . statistics of the P-N chain , gave important detailed indications for the assignment of the complex 13C spectra of these copolymers . such assignments were used to estimate the N copolymer content . the comparison of N content values obtained from the areas of different regions of the spectra reveals that <nUm> propene misinsertions are formed in greater amount as the [N] / [P] ratio of the feed increases . this may be due to the steric hindrance of the Mt - tertiary carbon bond when N is the last inserted unit , which makes difficult the next propene insertion and causes the low polymerization activities , molecular masses and tg . the spectra of P-N copolymers obtained with <nUm> revealed to be even more complex . A limited assignment of the spectrum has been achieved . this allowed us to evaluate the N content in the copolymers and to evidence the low tendency of the Cs symmetric <nUm> to give <nUm> propene misinsertions in P-N copolymers . this is in agreement with the results observed with this catalyst in propene homopolymerization . 
concomitant immobilization of zirconocene ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) into a silica matrix was performed during the O2Si synthesis through non-hydrolytic sol - gel method . two different routes , varying the ClSi <nUm> : Si(OEt)4 ratio were evaluated in terms of zirconocene content and catalyst activity in ethylene polymerization , using methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst . the catalysts were characterized by rutherford backscattering spectrometry , fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , diffuse reflectance spectroscopy , scanning electron microscopy and x-ray dispersive spectroscopy . the zirconocene content laid between <nUm> and <nUm> wt. % Zr / O2Si , depending upon the components ratio employed in the sol - gel synthesis . catalyst grains presented of irregular shape ( 20-100 mm size ) and zirconocene distribution was not uniform . both routes led to supported catalysts active in ethylene polymerization . catalyst activity was intermediate between that exhibited by the homogeneous and the grafted zirconocene on silica . resulting polyethylenes presented narrow molecular weight distribution and molecular weight slightly higher than that observed in the case of polymer produced with the homogeneous system . 
the major part of the present paper discusses the ability of well - defined o-undecenyl polystyrene , polyisoprene or poly(styrene-block-isoprene) macromonomers to undergo coordination homopolymerization in the presence of selected titanium catalysts . special emphasis is given to the influence of the nature of the catalyst , the polymerization temperature and the macromonomer molar mass and concentration on homopolymerization yield and average degree of homopolymerization ( DPn ) . titanium - based catalytic systems such as CpTiCl3 / MAO and Cp*TiCl3 / MAO only yielded dimers . the use of the homogeneous metallocene catalyst with constrained ligand geometry ( CGC - Ti / MAO ) having an open active site , significantly improved the degree of polymerization . increasing macromonomer molar mass , causes only a slight decrease of DPn whereas conversion increased moderately . the final section briefly discusses the copolymerization of o-undecenyl polystyrene macromonomers with ethylene in the presence of versipol ™ catalysts .

In the presence of an trialkyl aluminum cocatalyst the activation of scandium , yttrium and lutetium mono(cyclopentadienyl) complexes with various substituted cyclopentadienyl ligands by [Ph3C][B(C6F 5)4 results in highly efficient catalysts for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene . As active species half - sandwich alkyl cations is assumed that is isostructural with the mono(cyclopentadienyl) titanium alkyl cation originally proposed by zambelli . KGaA . 
the recently described reaction products of zirconacyclopropenes cp 2Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) and five - membered zirconacyclocumulenes ( zirconacyclopenta-2,3,4-trienes ) Cp*2Zr(e4-1,2,3,4-RC4R) , cp* = e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl , r = me , Me3Si and ph , with i-Bu2AlH are active catalysts in the polymerization of ethylene and in the ring opening polymerization of e-caprolactone . here we describe the different activity of these complexes after thermal activation or if additional i-Bu2AlH together with water are added . these results are compared to those which were obtained with the complexes Cp2Zr(e 4-1,2,3,4-H2C4H2 ) , rac - (EBTHl)ZrF2 , roc(EBTHI)ZrCl2 , [ rac-(EBTHI)Zr(H)(m- H)]2 and roc (EBTHI)Zr(F)CH2 - CH2( 2-Py ) after activation with i-Bu2AlH together with water .

exceptionally strong materials could be synthesized by filled polyolefins with nanosized , regid particles or fibers . metallocene catalysts are excellent tools in the production of tailored microstructures as well as tacticitles of polypropylenes . they are soluble in hydrocarbons and therefore can cover perfectly the surface of nano particles . here multi-walled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNT ) ( diameter 15-25 nm , length up to <nUm> mm ) were used as fillers . before polymerization , the fillers were separated by ultra sound and then treated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . MAO reacts partially with defects and functional groups of oxidized MWCNT . catalytically active centers are formed after adding the zirconocenes or other transition metal complexes directly on the CNT surface . the thickness of the polymer layer can be controlled by the monomer pressure and polymerization time . we obtained coatings of <nUm> to <nUm> nm . by this method carbon nanotubes can be covered also with isotactic or syndiotactic polypropylene , but also with polyethylene with any molecular mass . the nanocomposltes obtained were especially investigated In regard to their crystallization behavior , which depended significantly on the matrix used . 
A new class of chromium catalysts were obtained by combining bidentate phosphine chromium (II) complexes with methylaluminoxanes . these systems were found to be very active in the polymerization of butadiene giving <nUm> polymers having different tacticity ( iso or syndio ) depending on the type of phosphine bonded to the chromium atom . moreover , they were also able to polymerize norbornene , giving crystalline all exo-enchained vinyl addition polymers , exhibiting a rather unusual structure in the field of olefin stereospecific polymerization , namely diheterotactic structure , characterized by regular sequences of ( mr ) atactic triads . 
syndiotactic polymerization of styrene in aliphatic solvents ( hexane and cyclohexane ) and aliphatic solvent / toluene mixtures was evaluated using a previously reported catalytic system formed by FluTi(OiPr) <nUm> / MAO in order to evaluate polymerization reaction conditions and their effect on polymer tacticity . highly syndiotactic polystyrene was produced indistinctly using pure aliphatic solvent or mixtures with toluene . on the other hand , the effect of polymerization conditions such as temperature , catalyst precursor and styrene concentrations , Al / Ti ratio and aliphatic solvent / toluene ratio over catalytic activity were analyzed . 
the aluminohydride of zirconocene me 3SiCp 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> was supported on pre-treated OSi <nUm> , and its catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization and ethylene-1-hexene copolymerization was evaluated in order to compare with the corresponding activity of the complex in solution . As expected for systems based on metallocenes , the aluminohydride of zirconocene complex showed higher activity in solution than in suspension , however its thermal and kinetic stability was significantly increased . the effect of the co-catalyst concentration ( MAO ) on the activity and the molecular weight of the polymers are also reported in this study , finding that in heterogeneous phase low concentrations of MAO were used to activate the pre-catalyst . the MW of the polymers and copolymers synthesized with the supported me 3SiCp 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> / OSi <nUm> could be controlled by adding molecular hydrogen ( H <nUm> ) as chain transfer agent in the polymerization and copolymerization reactions . 
As an alternative to inorganic supports , emulsions and organic carriers were developed for metallocene - catalyzed polyolefin synthesis in the last years . oil - in - oil emulsions based on a perfluorinated solvent provide the possibility to synthesize polymer particles on the nanometer length scale , while the latex particles consisting of polystyrene with different surface functionalities yield particles on the micrometer range . to obtain a deeper insight to the reaction course of both techniques and to the product morphology and fragmentation behavior of the organic carriers , substantial information concerning the kinetics of these reactions is crucial . thus , standard analytical methods were combined with real - time video microscopy and laser scanning fluorescence microscopy ( LSCFM ) of perylene labeled particles for improving these methods for polyolefin synthesis .

copolymerizations of ethylene and a-olefins ( 1-hexene and 1-octene ) using a supported catalyst derived from the activation of a zirconocene aluminohydride complex with PMAO and MMAO are reported . the supported ( nBu-Cp 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> ) / OSi <nUm> / MAO system was evaluated by high - throughput techniques , in order to find approaches to the optimal copolymerization conditions . the polymerization reactions were carried out in a parallel polymerization reactors system ( PPR ) by symyx technologies , inc . the screening of the activity of the supported system and the molecular weight ( MW ) of the polymers and copolymers obtained in the PPR , allowed us to optimize copolymerization conditions , like hydrogen ( H <nUm> ) addition to control MW and molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) , polymerization temperature , cocatalyst ratio , and solvent type . the copolymerization reactions were scaled-up in order to validate the performance of the catalytic system at higher polymerization scales , according to the results obtained in the combinatorial phase . the scaled-up copolymerizations of ethylene with 1-hexene and 1-octene , showed high activities and MW , and low comonomer incorporation ( from <nUm> to <nUm> mol- % , determined by 13C NMR ) . however , the crystallinity ( x c ) , thermal properties ( T c and T m ) and densities of the polyethylenes obtained with the supported ( nBu-Cp 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> ) / OSi <nUm> / MAO system , were significantly modified , approaching those of metallocene linear lowdensity polyethylenes ( mLLDPE ) .

binary metallocene - MAO and ternary diphenylzinc-metallocene-MAO initiator systems have been tested as initiators in the homopolymerization of styrene and also in its copolymerization with several diverse comonomers including substituted styrenes , styrene derivatives , a-olefins and dienes . various titanocenes and zirconocenes and some exploratory experiment with hafnocene were carried out . the results indicate that titanocenes were more effective than zirconocenes in the homopolymerization of styrene while zirconocenes did better in a-olefin polymerization . it was found that titanocenes generated mainly syndiotactic polystyrene , s-PS , while zirconocenes yielded atactic polystyrene or , depending on the zirconocene , a low percentage of s-PS . for these types of initiators the polymerization process depends largely on the inductive effect of the substituents linked to the benzene ring of styrene and on its position ( ortho , meta or para ) . substituent multiplicity reduced markedly the effectiveness of these initiator systems . styrene / isoprene polymerization was also studied using binary zirconocene - MAO initiator systems that yielded low conversions and also low molecular weight polymers . 
In this work we studied the copolymerization of ethylene and different alpha-olefins ( propylene , 1-butene , 1-hexene , and 1-octene ) using aluminohydride zirconocene systems supported on modified silica . the copolymerization reactions were carried out in hexanes , at different Al / Zr ratios , using two different comonomer concentrations . the effect of comonomer type on catalyst activity and polymer molecular weight and chemical composition distributions ( MWD and CCD ) was compared . average comonomer incorporation was determined by 13C NMR and the CCD by crystallization elution fractionation ( CEF ) . most of the copolymerizations showed very high catalytic activity ( up to <nUm> kg PE / mol Zr ) , and the molecular weight was higher for the copolymers containing 1-octene , demonstrating that aluminohydride zirconocene systems can copolymerize ethylene and alpha-olefins effectively .

summary : quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopy is used to determine reactivity ratios and end group and branching frequency of ethylene-styrene and ethylene-isobutylene co-polymers synthesized at a temperature T = <nUm> ° C and pressure p = <nUm> bar at different levels of co-monomer fraction . In the forefront of the studies quantitative 13C NMR conditions have to be investigated . optimum conditions are achieved using a relaxation agent chromium (III) acetylacetonate ( cr(acac)3 ) at measurement temperature T = <nUm> ° C and a delay time d1 = <nUm> s with a <nUm> ° pulse and inverse - gated decoupling . the analysis of conversion dependence of co-monomer content shows an increase in conversion with increasing co-monomer content for the ethylene-styrene co-polymerization , whereas conversion decreases with rising isobutene fraction in the co-polymer . reactivity ratios for ethylene-styrene as well as for ethylene-isobutylene co-polymerization system are determined with values rES = <nUm> ± <nUm> and rSE = <nUm> ± <nUm> and rEIB = <nUm> ± <nUm> and rIBE = <nUm> ± <nUm> . frequency on methyl end groups , end - of - chain contributions caused by transfer to propionic aldehyde and butyl branches are gained . for the ethylene-styrene co-polymer system a decrease in frequency is observed , whereas for the ethylene-isobutylene co-polymer system the opposite occurs . influence of the co-monomers on the polymerization reaction steps as transfer to chain transfer agent and backbiting reaction is discussed . 
KGaA , Weinheim.Summary this study investigates the characteristics of the recently developed catalytic h-shuttling polymerization ( HSP ) of polar vinyl monomers mediated by cationic zirconocenium catalysts , through examining the scopes of chain transfer agent , catalyst , and monomer . amongst the three classes of chain transfer agents ( metal hydrides , metal aryl / alkyls , organics ) investigated for the MMA polymerization catalyzed by Cs - ligated catalyst <nUm> , the lewis acid BC18F15 , metal hydrides MH ( m = K , Na , Li ) and the organic PhNMe2 promote efficient catalytic polymerization , while metal alkyls such as Et3Al and Et2Zn serve only as the scavenger and / or monomer activator and thus do not promote chain transfer . In the presence of <nUm> equivalents of KH , both Cs - ligated catalyst <nUm> and achiral c2v - ligated catalyst <nUm> promote catalytic MMA polymerization through effective chain transfer , whereas C2 - ligated catalyst <nUm> shows no chain transfer . of several other conjugated polar vinyl monomers investigated , including acrylamides and a-methylene-g-butyrolactones , only N,N-diphenylacrylamide ( DPAA ) exhibits catalytic polymerization behavior . thus , in the presence of enantiopure pre-catalyst (S,S)-4 and excess BC18F15 , DPAA is polymerized catalytically and asymmetrically to optically active poly(DPAA) with a narrow MWD of <nUm> . 
KGaA , WeinheimThe main aim of this work is to obtain heterogeneous , zirconocene aluminohydride / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) polymerization catalysts , without using inorganic carriers like silica . the syntheses of zirconocenium ion - based clathrates , formed from aluminohydride zirconocene complexes activated with MAO , are reported here . several different approaches were examined for the synthesis of these clathrate compositions ; in one approach the catalyst ( nBuCp2ZrH3AlH2 / MAO ) was first prepared in toluene solution , and the clathrate phase then generated by addition of silicone oil . an alternate approach involved reaction of silicone oil or another clathrate - forming additive ( e.g. ClK ) with MAO to form a solidified clathrate , and then introducing the zirconocene aluminohydride complex ( nBuCp2ZrH3AlH2 ) . the clathrate catalysts were probed in the polymerization of ethylene in hydrocarbon slurry , without using additional co-catalyst ( MAO ) , or at very low concentrations of modified MAO ( MMAO <nUm> , <nUm> wt- % in iso-octane ) . the catalytic activities of the solid clathrate catalysts were compared as well as the morphology and properties of the polyethylene synthesized in slurry .

this paper summarizes a functionalization approach that can prepare functional PP with desirable molecular structures , including functional groups , microstructures , high molecular weight , and narrow molecular weight and composition distributions . A newly - developed catalysis technology with several designed " reactive " comonomers to circumvent the inevitable deactivation of the transition metal cationic active site by functional groups in the direct polymerization process has been applied . the reactive comonomers , containing organoborane , benzylic protons ( ph{symbol}-CH3 ) , and styrene moieties exhibit three essential properties , including ( a ) stability with the active site , ( b ) solubility in the polymerization media , and ( c ) versatility for interconversion to desirable functional groups under mild reaction conditions . with proper choice of metallocene catalysts , they resemble to high a-olefin monomers and can be effectively incorporated into the PP structure . In addition to the interconversion of the incorporated reactive sites to the desirable functional groups in PP copolymers , some reactive sites have been also transformed into " living " radical or anionic initiators to initiate graft-from polymerization of polar monomers to obtain PP graft copolymers .

KGaA , Weinheim.The synthesis in a liquid propene phase of ethylene-propylene copolymers of low molecular weights ( 3000-20000gmol-1 ) is accomplished using three different metallocenes containing bridged bis(indenyl) moieties : ( A ) rac-dimethylsilylbis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride , ( B ) rac-ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride , and ( C ) rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride . hydrogen pressures higher than <nUm> bar were required to drop the molecular weight below 25000gmol-1 . metallocene B gives rise to the copolymers with lower molecular weights ( < 5000gmol-1 ) , irrespective of the ethylene content , due to the presence of a hydrogenated six membered ring in the indenyl moiety as well as a -CH2- bridge . DSC experiments indicate that for low ethylene contents ( below <nUm> wt % ) , metallocene A gives rise to copolymers with the highest melting temperatures and the lowest melting enthalpies , suggesting the existence of longer isotactic propylene sequences into the copolymer backbone . 
KGaA , WeinheimThe polymerization of ethylene is investigated in a semibatch solution reactor using bis(n-propylcyclopentadienyl)hafnium dichloride catalyst and tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate dimethylanilinium salt ( [B(C6F5)4]-[Me2NHPh]+ ) as the catalytic system . trioctylaluminum ( TOA ) is used as impurity scavenger and alkylating agent . ethylene pressure , polymerization temperature , TOA , borate , and catalyst concentrations are changed to investigate ethylene polymerization kinetics with this catalyst system . A <nUm> central composite design , augmented with extra runs to further explore the effect of some factors , is used as the statistical basis for the polymerization study . ethylene propagation follows first - order kinetics . chain transfer to monomer , b-hydride elimination , and transfer to TOA are the main chain transfer reactions . In addition to alkylating the catalyst precursor , TOA also deactivates the catalyst . the mode of reactor addition for catalyst , borate , and TOA has also been studied . when TOA and borate are added sequentially to the reactor , followed by the catalyst , the polymerization activity is lower than when the catalyst and borate are added simultaneously , suggesting that complexation with borate avoids deactivation reactions with TOA .

the present work discusses first the homopolymerization of o-allyl , o-undecenyl or o-vinylbenzyl polystyrene ( PS ) macromonomers in the presence of selected early or late transition metal catalysts . homopolymerization degrees were found to depend on the type of catalyst , the terminal double bond , the polymerization temperature and the concentration of the various species . higher molar masses were reached at low temperatures and low catalyst and cocatalyst concentrations . best results were obtained with the constrained geometry catalyst (CGC)-Ti . the same PS macromonomers were copolymerized with ethylene in the presence of the VERSIPOL ™ catalyst to design a new type of poly(ethylene) based graft copolymer . the macromonomer weight percent content decreases with increasing ethylene pressure whereas the molar mass of the copolymer increases with ethylene pressure . the PS macromonomer content as well as the molar mass of the copolymer can be still increased by using a,o-difunctional PS macromonomers . the dilute solution and solid - state behavior of these copolymers were examined and compared to those of poly(ethylenes) prepared under the same conditions . the present work discusses first the homopolymerization of o-allyl , o-undecenyl or o-vinylbenzyl polystyrene ( PS ) macromonomers in the presence of selected early or late transition metal catalysts . homopolymerization degrees were found to depend on the type of catalyst , the terminal double bond , the polymerization temperature and the concentration of the various species . higher molar masses were reached at low temperatures and low catalyst and cocatalyst concentrations . best results were obtained with the constrained geometry catalyst (CGC)-Ti . the same PS macromonomers were copolymerized with ethylene in the presence of the VERSIPOL ™ catalyst to design a new type of poly(ethylene) based graft copolymer . the macromonomer weight percent content decreases with increasing ethylene pressure whereas the molar mass of the copolymer increases with ethylene pressure . the PS macromonomer content as well as the molar mass of the copolymer can be still increased by using a,o-difunctional PS macromonomers . the dilute solution and solid - state behavior of these copolymers were examined and compared to those of poly(ethylenes) prepared under the same conditions . copyright 
an opal - supported zirconocene complex ( OC ) was prepared and employed to prepare functional polyethylene composite for the first time through in situ polymerization of ethylene . the formation mechanism of anion relating to opal was explained and the values of anions released from pristine opal and that contained in the asfabricated polyethylene composites were detected . the OC exhibited high catalytic activities in ethylene polymerization with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) the cocatalyst . In addition to higher viscosity - average molecular weights ( me ) , experimental results also showed that the resulting polyethylene composites possessed improved anion - releasing capacity in comparison with pristine opal in addition to increased tensile strength , young 's modulus , and onset decomposition temperature ( tonset ) relative to neat polyethylene due to highly uniform dispersion of opal in polyethylene matrix . 
ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene ( UHMWPE ) / fumed silica nanocomposites were prepared via in situ polymerization using a bi-supported ziegler - natta catalytic system . nanocomposites with different nanoparticle weight fractions were produced in order to investigate the effect of fumed silica on thermal and mechanical properties of UHMWPE / fumed silica nanocomposites . the viscosity average molecular weight ( m ) of all samples including pure UHMWPE as the reference sample and nanocomposites were measured . scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) images showed the homogenous dispersion of nanoparticles throughout the UHMWPE matrix while no nanoparticle cluster has been formed . crystallization behavior of nanocomposites was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , which showed a slight increase in melting temperature by enhancing the nanoparticle concentration while no significant change was observed in the crystallization temperature as the fumed silica concentration enhanced . the improvement in all thermal stability parameters was recorded by thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) . besides , via tensile testing , it was confirmed that addition of nanoparticles caused considerable improvement in such mechanical properties as young 's modulus , yield stress , and tensile strength of samples while the elongation at break declined by addition of more nanoparticles . 
supported zirconocene catalysts on a new support , MgO , were prepared and tested in ethylene polymerization . three types of impregnation methods were employed to find an optimum supporting method for MgO . the direct impregnation of Cp2ZrCl2 on MgO showed low metal loading and polymerization activity , while the catalyst had a higher metal loading and polymerization activity when MgO was treated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) before supporting . treatment of MgO with MAO during the supporting step invoked two types of catalytic sites , which was evidenced by the bimodal molecular weight distribution of the polymer products . MgO is considered to have potential as a support for metallocenes . 
the use of biomass as support for zirconocene catalysts in ethylene polymerization was studied . cellulose , starch and chitosan were conveniently characterized . many factors affecting the activity of the catalysts were examined . parameters such as surface area were found to have no significant influence on the activity of the catalysts . the activity of the catalysts sharply increased with the degree of deacetylation in the chitosan supports . using this support the highest activity in ethylene polymerization was obtained . the polymers obtained with the zirconocene supported on chitosan or cellulose pretreated with methylaluminoxane exhibited a higher obtained weight than those obtained with a homogeneous system . polymer particles obtained with these supported metallocene catalysts showed a good replication of the original support particles . 
polyethylene nano-composites , with different loading of silicon nitride ( NSi ) ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> wt % ) as filler were prepared by polymerization of ethylene , using zirconocene as catalyst . experimental results showed that activity of zirconocene catalyst activity was higher for the composites having filler loading of <nUm> wt % . the thermal studies using differential scanning calorimeter ( DSC ) and thermo - gravimetric analysis ( TGA ) indicated that crystallinity & thermal stability was also influenced with the variation of filler loading . combustibility studies using micro-calorimeter showed that increase in the filler loading will decrease the combustibility of polyethylene nano-composites . wide angle x-ray diffraction ( WAXD ) results indicated a decrease in the percentage of crystallinity with increase in filler wt % . scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) images revealed that morphology of the composites having <nUm> and <nUm> wt % of NSi are more fibrous when compared to control and composites having <nUm> wt % filler loading .

A combination of diphenylzinc , a metallocene and methylaluminoxane ( Ph2Zn-metallocene-MAO ) is a suitable initiator system for the polymerization of styrene and for its copolymerization with para-alkyl substituted styrenes . this paper reports new experimental results which reinforce our previous findings indicating that polymerization processes are initiated by monomer coordination to active species resulting from these particular combined systems . polymerization propagates by a cationic pathway . further to our previous observation that the I+ inductive effect of para-substituents in styrene improves conversion to polymer , we now find that methyl substitution on the vinyl double bond of styrene , in spite of the I+ inductive effect and as a result of increased steric hindrance , makes the polymerization process difficult . on the other hand , the replacement of titanocenes by zirconocenes or hafnocenes generates Ph2Zn-metallocene-MAO initiator systems which are also able to induce homo- and copolymerization , but with lower yields and producing practically amorphous polymers . the efficiency of our Ph2Zn-metallocene-MAO initiator systems follows the order titanocene > zirconocene > hafnocene , at least for the studied metallocenes . 
the commercial interest of metallocene complexes for olefin polymerization has led to additional efforts to prepare suitable metallocene complexes efficiently and economically . ethylene polymerization was carried out with a series of heterogeneous catalysts which were prepared in various Zr / silica ratios by immobilization of Ind2ZrCl2 preactivated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) on silica . this method to form the catalyst system resulted in a polymerization catalyst with reduced fouling tendencies and improved reactor operability . polymerization of ethylene was conducted in buchi reactors in a slurry phase under mild pressure . some of the physical properties of the obtained polymers were also determined . 
two new half - sandwich titanocene catalysts for the stereospecific polymerization of styrene , RCpTi(o-MeOPhCPh2O)Cl2 ( r = H ( 1 ) ; r = me ( 2 ) ) , were prepared by reaction of the corresponding RCpTiCl3 complexes with o-methoxyphenyldiphenylmethanol ( o-MeOPhCPh2OH ) in the presence of triethylamine . upon activation with excess methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , they showed high activities and high thermal stabilities for the stereospecific polymerization of styrene . the influences of polymerization temperature , Al / Ti molar ratio , solvent ( aliphatic or aromatic ) and time on the activity and syndiotacticity of the styrene polymerization were investigated . 
A novel high - quality polyphenanthrene ( PPH ) film with electrical conductivity of 10-1 S cm-1 was synthesized electrochemically by direct anodic oxidation of phenanthrene in boron trifluoride diethyl etherate containing <nUm> % concentrated sulfuric acid ( v / v ) . the oxidation onset potential of phenanthrene in this medium was measured to be only <nUm> V versus saturated calomel electrode ( SCE ) , which was lower than that determined in acetonitrile + <nUm> mol L-1 B2F4NU4 ( <nUm> V versus SCE ) . as-formed PPH films from this medium showed good electrochemical behavior and stability . de-doped PPH films were thoroughly soluble in dimethylsulfoxide or CCl3H . the structure and morphology of the polymer were investigated using UV - visible and fourier transform infrared ( FTIR ) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy . FTIR and 1H NMR spectra showed that the PPH was grown via the coupling of the monomer mainly at the C4 , C5 , C9 and C10 positions . fluorescence spectral studies indicated that PPH was a blue - green light emitter . 
background : much of the current research related to the development of in situ nanocomposites of olefins by polymerizing them with metallocenes in the presence of surface - treated fillers is carried out in the slurry phase . In slurry - phase methods a large amount of solvent is required and there is always a need of purification of the final product due to the possibility of traces of solvents present in the product . to overcome these drawbacks , to perform solvent - free metallocene - catalysed polymerizations with in situ incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles , we have used a gas - phase polymerization technique as this does not require solvents and also utilizes monomer feed stocks efficiently . results : the catalyst used for the synthesis of in situ polyethylene nanocomposites by gas - phase polymerization was nanosilica - supported zirconocene . the fillers used were Cloisite-20A , kaolin and nanosilica . three different in situ polyethylene nanocomposites , i.e. Cloisite-20A-filled polyethylene ( CFPE ) , kaolin - filled polyethylene ( KFPE ) and nanosilica - filled polyethylene ( SFPE ) , were prepared by gas - phase polymerization . the nanocomposites were obtained in the form of fine powder . the polyethylene content in the developed nanocomposites is in the orthorhombic crystalline phase . using our approach , it is observed that the nanofillers are completely encapsulated by a thin layer of polyethylene . significantly higher molecular weight polyethylene was formed in the case of KFPE in comparison to CFPE and SFPE . the thermal decomposition temperature , melting temperature and enthalpy are also observed to be higher for KFPE . conclusions : the gas - phase polymerization technique has been successfully carried out for the synthesis of in situ polyethylene nanocomposites . 
this mini-review gives a short summery of the chain - end chemistry of polysilanes , notably that - leading to block copolymers . the anionic polymerisations of cyclotetrasilanes or'masked ' disilenes naturally lend themselves to the formation of polysilane - containing copolymers . A more robust , if less controlled , method results from the wurtz - type reductive coupling reaction that yields polysilanes with silyl chloride chain - ends which are extremely sensitive to nucleophilic substitution . these may be used with appropriately functionalised polymers ( such as polyisoprene ' or poly(ethylene oxide ) ) to prepare multiblock copolymers , or with functionalised groups designed as initiating centres for subsequent controlled reversible deactivation radical polymerisations ( such as atom transfer radical polymerisation . 
themanufacture of linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) is of great significance in academia and industry . the employment of a single monomer , i.e. ethylene , to produce LLDPE by introducing two catalysts into one reactor to conduct ethylene copolymerization with in situ - generated a-olefins has proved to be an effective way in this case . moreover , immobilization of catalysts affords LLDPE with bettermorphology and improved physical properties.An iron - based diimine complex immobilized on methylaluminoxane (MAO)-treated mesoporous molecular sieves was used to oligomerize ethylene to a-olefins with improved selectivity to lower molar mass fractions . based on this , zirconocene compound was also supported on mesoporous molecular sieves to comprise a two - catalyst system to produce LLDPE from a single ethylene monomer . copolymerization performed at both atmospheric and high pressure produced LLDPE of high molecular weight and broad molecular weight distribution without using MAO during the polymerization processes . physical and mechanical measurements evidenced significant increases in tensile strength , tensile modulus and izod impact strength . A marked shear - thinning phenomenon and improved storagemodulus of LLDPE produced using catalysts supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15mesoporousmolecular sieves indicated a stronger interfacial interaction between themolecular sieve support and the polymeric matrix . 
spherical and well - dispersed silica / poly[styrene-co-(acrylic acid ) ] ( O2Si / PSA ) core - shell particles have been synthesized using an improved phase - inversion process . the resulting particles were successfully used as supports for polyolefin catalysts in the production of polyethylene with broad molecular weight distribution . through the vapor phase , instead of the liquid phase in the traditional process , a non-solvent was introduced into a mixture of micrometer - sized O2Si and PSA solution . the core - shell structure of the resulting O2Si / PSA microspheres was confirmed using optical microscopy , scanning electron microscopy , fourier transfer infrared spectrometry , thermogravimetric analysis and measurement of nitrogen adsorption / desorption isotherms . In order to avoid agglomeration of particles and to obtain a good dispersion of the O2Si / PSA core - shell microspheres , the non-solvent was added slowly . As the concentration of PSA solution increased , the surface morphology of the core - shell particles became looser and more irregular . however , the surface area and the pore volume remained the same under varying PSA concentrations . the O2Si / PSA core - shell microspheres obtained were used as a catalyst carrier system in which the core supported (n-BuCp)2ZrCl2 and the shell supported Cl4Ti . ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization results indicated that the zirconocene and titanium - based ziegler - natta catalysts were compatible in the hybrid catalyst , showing high activities . the resulting polyethylene had high molecular weight and broad molecular weight distribution . 
the obtained polynorbornene showed a modest molecular weight ( Mn ≈ <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 ) and broad molecular weight distribution ( polydispersity index ≈ <nUm> ) . A copolymer of norbornene with 1,3-butadiene was prepared using a binary catalytic system consisting of bis(phenoxyimine) titanium complex and triisobutylaluminium . the norbornene units in the copolymer adopted a vinyl-type addition structure confirmed using distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer <nUm> 13C NMR microstructure analyses . polymerization kinetics studies showed that neither monomer feed ratio nor conversion had an effect on the composition of the copolymer backbone which was composed of <nUm> % norbornene units and <nUm> % 1,3-butadiene units . the essentially constant polymer composition implied an alternating nature of chain propagation . the copolymer exhibited good thermal stability and moderate glass transition temperature ( <nUm> – <nUm> ° C ) with a relatively high molecular weight ( mw = <nUm> × <nUm> – <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 ) , and excellent transparency ( maximal transmittance > <nUm> % ) . © <nUm> society of chemical industry . 
the different elementary steps in the activation process of racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 by commercial methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) have been studied by UV / visible spectroscopy and correlated with hexene polymerization kinetics . after monomethylation of the zirconocene dichloride ( λ = <nUm> nm ) , abstraction of Cl ligand by MAO at low Al / Zr ratios ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) yields tight ion pairs , with an absorption band centred at λ = <nUm> nm , which are inactive towards hexene polymerization . addition of MAO in large excess ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) is required to form the active species . the latter , characterized by an absorption at λ = <nUm> nm , were identified as trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) separated ion pairs . the activation by commercial MAO of racEt(Ind)2ZrX2 , with x being methyl , benzyl or dimethylamino as extractable group , instead of chloride , reveals much easier and complete activation at low Al / Zr ratios ( Al : Zr = 50-150 ) . for these systems , formation of active ion pairs of different catalytic activities and absorbing in the range λ = 430-440 nm is observed . the use of TMA - depleted MAO instead of commercial MAO , as cocacalyst for racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 activation also allows the formation of active tight ion pairs absorbing at λ = <nUm> nm at low Al / Zr ratio . these results underline the negative role of chloride ligands when associated with TMA ( contained in MAO ) in the activation process of zirconocene for olefin polymerization , and also suggest interesting alternatives to reduce the amount of MAO necessary for metallocene activation . 
treatment of 2-(5-methyl-2-furyl)tetrahydroindenyllithium with Cl4Zr gave bis[2-(5-methyl-2-furyl)tetrahydroindenyl]zirconium dichloride ( 8 ) . dynamic 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed a cp - furyl rotational barrier of DGArrot[?] ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 . the x-ray crystal structure analysis of <nUm> showed the presence of a rac - like metallocene conformation in which the furyl rings are oriented coplanar with the cp moiety of the tetrahydroindenyl ligand systems , but the two furyl rings are oriented differently : one has the oxygen atom oriented toward the open front side , whereas the other has the furyl oxygen pointing toward the narrow back side of the bent metallocene wedge . the 8-MAO ziegler - natta catalyst system produces an atactic polypropylene oil . 
ethene was polymerized with the catalytic systems L2ZrCl2 / MAO / TMA ( where L = cp , Me5Cp , or Me4Cp ; cp = e5-cyclopentadienyl ; MAO = methylaluminoxane ; and TMA = trimethylaluminum ) at <nUm> ° C , <nUm> bar , and AlTMA / Zr ratios of 0-2700 . the polymerization activity was reduced with the addition of TMA for L = cp but was almost unaffected for the methyl-substituted catalysts . increasing the TMA concentration resulted in a lower molecular weight of the polymer , with the largest effect for L = Me5Cp . A gel permeation chromatography analysis of the polymers revealed a high molecular weight shoulder and a nearly bimodal distribution for L = Me5Cp at high TMA concentrations . A possible explanation of such a shoulder in terms of long - chain branching was ruled out by dynamic viscosity measurements . the origin of this effect more likely stemmed from competition between chain transfer to aluminum and b-hydrogen transfer reactions at two different sites , one TMA - sensitive and one TMA - insensitive . polymerizations at various pressures and temperatures substantiated this assumption . A clue to the underlying mechanism came from investigations of chain transfer to TMA studied with density functional calculations . complexation of Me3Al to Zr was much stronger for L = cp than for L = Me5Cp . however , the overall chain - transfer barrier was much higher for L = cp . these results agreed both with the reduced activity for L = cp and with the strongly reduced molecular weight for L = Me5Cp observed with the addition of TMA . 
cyclopentadienyl magnesium chloride ( MgClCp ) and its functionalized derivatives represent original and interesting supporting materials to heterogenize metallocene catalysts for olefin polymerizations . the synthesis of MgClCp , its functionalization , and the preparation of a catalytic system in which the ZrCl2(Flu)+ moiety is joined on the support through a cyclopentadienyl ligand are reported . this catalyst was tested in ethene polymerization , and both the catalytic activity and properties of the produced polymer were measured . its performance was compared with that shown by the catalyst ZrCl2CpFlu employed under the same conditions for both unsupported and conventional supports , such as Cl2Mg . the results showed a remarkable improvement in terms of the activity and polymer properties with these heterogenized catalysts . moreover , this system showed stability toward leaching processes and was characterized by good morphological control of the growing polymer . finally , catalysts in which [HB(3,5-Me2pyrazolyl)3]ZrCl2+ and [HB(3,5-Me2pyrazolyl)3]ZrClOtBu+ moieties were bonded to a functionalized MgClCp- support were also synthesized and tested . the results showed that the proposed supports could be usefully used to heterogenize tailored metallocene homogeneous catalysts . In fact , new catalysts were prepared that combined the peculiar advantages of both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts and overcame the disadvantages of the latter , such as a lack of morphology and reactor fouling .

norbornene polymerization was performed with monocyclopentadienyltitanium tribenzyloxide activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the catalyst afforded a pure vinyl-type polymer at temperatures below <nUm> ° C and at appropriate MAO concentrations . however , at higher temperatures or high MAO concentrations , a portion of the titanium species was pyrolyzed to form an alkylidene compound that catalyzed the ring - opening metathesis polymerization of norbornene . As a result , both vinyl-type and ring - opening polymers were produced under the reaction conditions . 
ethylene polymerization was carried out with zirconocene catalysts supported on montmorillonite ( or functionalized montmorillonite ) . the functionalized montmorillonite was from simple ion exchange of [CH3O2CCH2NH3]+ ( MeGlyH+ ) ions with interlamellar cations of layered montmorillonites . the functionalized montmorillonites [ high - purity montmorillonite (MMT)-MeGlyH+ ] had larger interlayer spacing ( <nUm> Å ) than montmorillonites without treatment ( <nUm> Å ) . the zirconocene catalyst system [ Cp2ZrCl2 / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) / MMT - MeGlyH+ ] had much higher Zr loading and higher activities than those of other zirconocene catalyst systems ( Cp2ZrCl2 / MMT , Cp2ZrCl2 / MMT - MeGlyH+ , Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO / MMT , [Cp2ZrCl]+ [BF4] / MMT , [Cp2ZrCl]+ [BF4]- / MMT - MeGlyH+ , [Cp2ZrCl]+ [BF4]- / MAO / MMT - MeGlyH+ , and [Cp2ZrCl]+[BF4]- / MAO / MMT ) . the polyethylenes with good bulk density were obtained from the catalyst systems , particularly ( Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO / MMT - MeGlyH+ ) . MeGlyH+ and MAO seemed to play important roles for preparation of the supported zirconocenes and polymerization of ethylene . the difference in Zr loading and catalytic activity among the supported zirconocene catalysts is discussed .

the preparation of lustrous conducting polyacetylene films by the polymerization of acetylene with vinyltitanium species as initiators was studied . organotitanium species were generated by the alkylation of titanium vinylcarbene complexes with tert-butyl chloride . solid - state 13C NMR and IR analyses of the obtained polyacetylene indicated that polyacetylene with a trans configuration was produced . the use of titanocene(II) species Cp2Ti[P(OEt)3]2 and titanium vinylcarbene complexes for the preparation of polyacetylene films was also studied . the morphology of the films and the mechanisms of polymerization are discussed . 
heterogenization of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] on a silica support stabilized with chlorotriphenylmethane ( CICPh3 ) and N,N-dimethylaniline ( HNMe2Ph ) creates the following supported borane cocatalysts : [HNMe2Ph]+[B(C6 F5)3-SiO2]- and [CPh3]+[B(C6F5)3- SiO2]- . these supported catalysts were reacted with Cp2ZrCl2 TIBA in situ to generate active metallocene species in the reactor . triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) was a good coactivator for dichloro-zirconocene , acting as the prealkylating agent to generate cationic zirconocene ( Cp2ZrC4H9+ ) . the catalytic performances were determined from the kinetics of ethylene-consumption profiles that were independent of the time dedicated to the activation of the catalysts . the scanning electron microscopy - energy dispersive x-ray measurements showed that BC18F15 dispersed uniformly on the silica support . under our reaction conditions , the [CPh3]+[B(C6F5)3- SiO2]- system had higher productivity and weight - average molecular weight than the [HNMe2Ph]+[B(C6 F5)3-SiO2]- system . for the [CPh3]+[B(C6F5)3- SiO2]- system , the productivity increased with the amount catalyst ; however , the polydispersity index of polyethylene synthesized did not change . the final shape of polymer particles was a larger - diameter version of the original support particle . the polymer particles synthesized with supported [CPh3]+[B(C6F5)3- SiO2]- catalysts had larger diameters . 
ethene - propene copolymerizations were performed in the presence of Cs symmetric group <nUm> metallocenes . the reactivity ratios were strongly influenced by both the transition metal and the ancillary ligands . substantially alternate , almost random , and blocky copolymers were obtained with titanocene , zirconocene , and hafnocene , respectively , with the bis(dimethylsilyl)-1,1'-2,2'-diyl-(3',5'-diisopropyl)(4- isopropyl)-(cyclopentadienyl) ligand , and a blocky copolymer was obtained with ( diphenyl methylidene)(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)TiCl2 . 
the polymerization of vinyl chloride ( VC ) with half - titanocene / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) catalysts is investigated . the polymerization of VC with the Cp*Ti(OCH3)3 / MAO catalyst ( cp* = e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ) afforded high-molecular-weight poly(vinyl chloride ) ( PVC ) in good yields , although the polymerization proceeded at a slow rate . with the Cp*TiCl3 / MAO catalyst , the polymer was also obtained , but the polymer yield was lower than that with the Cp*Ti(OCH3)3 / MAO catalyst . the polymerization of VC with the Cp*Ti(OCH3)3 / MAO catalyst was influenced by the MAO / Ti mole ratio and reaction temperature , and the optimum was observed at the MAO / Ti mole ratio of about <nUm> . the optimum reaction temperature of VC with the Cp*Ti(OCH3)3 / MAO catalyst was around <nUm> ° C . the stereoregularity of PVC obtained with the Cp*Ti(OCH3)3 / MAO catalyst was different from that obtained with azobisisobutyronitrile , but highly stereoregular PVC could not be synthesized . from the elemental analyses , the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the polymers , and the analysis of the reduction product from PVC to polyethylene , the polymer obtained with Cp*Ti(OCH3)3 / MAO catalyst consisted of only regular head - to - tail units without any anomalous structure , whereas the Cp*TiCl3 / MAO catalyst gave the PVC - bearing anomalous units . the polymerization of VC with the Cp*Ti(OCH3)3 / MAO catalyst did not inhibit even in the presence of radical inhibitors such as 2,2,6,6,-tetrametylpiperidine-1-oxyl , indicating that the polymerization of VC did not proceed via a radical mechanism .

copolymerization of ethylene or propylene and norbornene ( NB ) was carried out with stereospecific zirconocene catalysts rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride , rac-dimethylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 2 ) , rac-dimethyl-silylenebis(2-methylindenyl)zirconium dichloride , and diphenylmethylene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride combined with cocatalysts at <nUm> ° C . temperature - rising elution fractional of the copolymers was carried out with cross-fractionation chromatography with o-dichlorobenzene as a solvent , and a broad distribution of the copolymer composition was detected . the fraction eluted at lower temperature contained higher NB . the effect of the polymerization time was examined in the ethylene-NB copolymerization with catalyst <nUm> , and the higher - temperature elution fraction increased with increasing polymerization time . 
macroporous functionalized polymer beads of poly(4-vinylpyridine-co-l,4-divinylbenzene) [P(VPy-co-DVB)] were prepared by a multistep polymerization , including a polystyrene ( PS ) shape template by emulsifier - free emulsion polymerization , linear PS seeds by staged template suspension polymerization , and macroporous functionalized polymer beads of P(VPy-co-DVB) by multistep seeded polymerization . the polymer beads , having a cellular texture , were made of many small , spherical particles . the bead size was 10-50 mm , and the pore size was <nUm> - <nUm> mm . the polymer beads were used as supports for zirconocene catalysts in ethylene polymerization . they were very different from traditional polymer supports . the polymer beads could be exfoliated to yield many spherical particles dispersed in the resulting polyethylene particles during ethylene polymerization . the influence of the polymer beads on the catalytic behavior of the supported catalyst and morphology of the resulting polyethylene was investigated . 
this article reports the use of a binary single - site catalyst system for synthesizing comb - branched polypropylene samples having isotactic polypropylene ( iPP ) backbones and atactic polypropylene ( aPP ) side chains from propylene feedstock . this catalyst system consisted of the bisiminepyridine iron catalyst { [ 2-ArN = C(Me)]2C5H3N}FeCl2 [ Ar = 2,6-C6H3(Me)2 ] ( 1 ) and the zirconocene catalyst rac-Me2Si(2-MeBenz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) . the former in situ generated 1-propenyl-ended aPP macromonomer , whereas the latter incorporated the macromonomer into the copolymer . the effects of reaction conditions , such as the catalyst addition procedure and the ratio of <nUm> / <nUm> on the branching frequency , were examined . copolymer samples having a branching density up to <nUm> aPP side chains per <nUm> iPP monomer units were obtained . the branched copolymers were characterized by 13C NMR and differential scanning calorimetry . 
because of the great economic interest in propylene-based polymers and the possibility of designing materials with desired properties with metallocene catalyst mixtures , we investigated the characteristics of polypropylenes produced by mixtures of SiMe2Ind2ZrCl2 : dimethylsilane-bis(indenyl) zirconocene ( 1 ) and Et(Flu)(Cp)ZrCl2 : ethylidene ( fluorenyl cyclopentadienyl ) zirconocene ( 2 ) in different proportions . the polymers were fractionated with solvents , and the fractions were characterized . we observed that the polymers produced by the different mixed systems showed lower weight - average molecular weights and only slightly broader molecular weight distributions than polypropylenes synthesized by the individual catalysts . we concluded that catalyst <nUm> acted independently of catalyst <nUm> , producing polymers with the same isotacticity . 
ethene homopolymerization and copolymerization with 1-hexene were performed with three new tetramethyldisilylene-bridged zirconocene catalysts with 2-indenyl ligand ( A ) , 2-tetrahydroindenyl ligand ( B ) , and tetramethyl-cyclopentadienyl ligand ( C ) and with methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst . catalysts A and B showed substantial comonomer incorporation , resulting in a copolymer melting temperature more than <nUm> ° lower than that of the corresponding homopolymer . In contrast , catalyst C produced a copolymer with a low 1-hexene content and a high melting temperature . the reduction in the molecular weight with 1-hexene addition also correlated well with the comonomer incorporation . for all three catalysts , the homopolymer and copolymer unsaturations indicated frequent chain termination after 1-hexene insertion and a high degree of chain - end isomerization during the homopolymerization of ethene . the chain transfer to Al in the cocatalyst also appeared to be important . the comonomer response could be correlated with the structural properties of the catalyst , as derived from quantum chemical calculations . A linear model , calibrated against recent experiments with unbridged (MenC5H5-n)2ZrCl2 catalysts , suggested that the low comonomer incorporation obtained with catalyst C was caused partly by a narrow opening angle between the aromatic ligands and partly by steric hindrance in the transition state of comonomer insertion . 
ethylene homopolymerizations and copolymerizations were catalyzed by zirconocene catalysts entrapped inside functionalized montmorillonites that had been rendered organophilic via the ion exchange of the interlamellar cations of layered montmorillonite with hydrochlorides of l-amino acids ( AAH+Cl- ) or their methyl esters ( MeAAH+Cl- ) , with or without the further addition of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ( C16H33N+Me3Br- ; R4N+Br- ) . In contrast to the homogeneous Cp2ZrCl2 / methylaluminoxane catalyst for ethylene homopolymerizations and copolymerizations with 1-octene , the intercalated Cp2ZrCl2 activated by methylaluminoxane for ethylene homopolymerizations and copolymerizations with 1-octene proved to be more effective in the synthesis of polyethylenes with controlled molecular weights , chemical compositions and structures , and properties , including the bulk density . the effects of the properties of the organic guests on the preparation and catalytic performance of the intercalated zirconocene catalysts were studied . 
the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) was investigated with tris(pentafluorophenyl)alane [ Al(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] and four metallocene imido complexes that varied in the complex symmetry / chirality , metal , and r group in the = NR moiety , as well as a zirconocene enolate preformed from the imido zirconocene and MMA . this study examined four aspects of MMA polymerization : the effects of the metallocene imido complex structure on the polymerization activity and polymer tacticity , the degree of polymerization control , the elementary reactions of the imido complex with Al(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> and MMA , and the polymerization kinetics and mechanism . there was no effect of the imido complex symmetry / chirality on the polymerization stereochemistry ; the polymerization followed bernoullian statistics , producing syndiotactic poly(methyl methacrylate)s with moderate ( ∼ <nUm> % [rr] ) to high ( ∼ <nUm> % [rr] ) syndiotacticity , depending on the polymerization temperature . polymerization control was demonstrated by the number - average molecular weight , which increased linearly with an increase in the monomer conversion to <nUm> % , and the relatively small and insensitive polydispersity indices ( from <nUm> to <nUm> ) to conversion . the reactions of the zirconocene imido complex with Al(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> and MMA produced the parent base - free imido complex and the [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition product ( i.e. , zirconocene enolate ) , respectively ; the latter product reacted with Al(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> to generate the active zirconocenium enolaluminate . the MMA polymerization with the metallocene imido complex and the alane proceeded via intermolecular michael addition of the enolaluminate to the alane - activated MMA involved in the propagation step . 
copolymerization of olefins ( ethylene and propylene ) and 5-hexen-1-ol pretreated with alkylaluminum was performed using [dimethysilylbis(9-fluorenyl)]zirconium dichloride / methylaluminoxane as the catalyst . the copolymerization required extra addition of alkylaluminum to prevent deactivation of the catalyst when 5-hexen-1-ol was pretreated with trimethylaluminum , whereas the triisobutylaluminum - treated system did not require any addition of alkylaluminum . the molecular weight of the copolymer depended on the kind of alkylaluminum compound ( masking reagent , additive , and cocatalyst ) . 13C NMR analysis proved that poly(ethylene-co-5-hexen-1-ol) containing <nUm> mol % of 5-hexen-1-ol acted as an alternating copolymer , whereas the poly(propylene-co-5-hexen-1-ol) acted as a random copolymer . the surface property of the copolymers was simply evaluated by means of water drop contact angle measurement . it was found that the copolymers containing large amounts of 5-hexen-1-ol units showed good hydrophilic properties . 
A novel approach to the preparation of polyethylene ( PE ) nanocomposites , with montmorillonite / silica hybrid ( MT-Si ) supported catalyst , was developed . MT-Si was prepared by depositing silica nanoparticles between galleries of the MT . A common zirconocene catalyst [ bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride / methylaluminoxane ] was fixed on the MT-Si surface by a simple method . after ethylene polymerization , two classes of nanofillers ( clay layers and silica nanoparticles ) were dispersed concurrently in the PE matrix and PE / clay - silica nanocomposites were obtained . exfoliation of the clay layers and dispersion of the silica nanoparticles were examined with transmission electron microscopy . physical properties of the nanocomposites were characterized by tensile tests , dynamic mechanical analysis , and DSC . the nanocomposites with a low nanofiller loading ( < <nUm> wt % ) exhibited good mechanical properties . the nanocomposite powder produced with the supported catalyst had a granular morphology and a high bulk density , typical of a heterogeneous catalyst system . 
five new CpTiCl2(OR) alkoxyl-substituted half - sandwich complexes , where r was methoxyethyl ( 1 ) , methoxypropyl ( 2 ) , methoxyisopropyl ( 3 ) , o-methoxyphenyl ( 4 ) , or tetrahydrofurfuryl ( 5 ) , were synthesized , characterized , and tested as catalyst precursors for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene . these precursors were more active than (e5-cyclopentadienyl)trichlorotitanium ( CpTiCl3 ) . the different structures of the alkoxyl ligands affected the activity slightly . when the polymerization was carried out in bulk , all the complexes ( 1-5 ) exhibited high activities , even at the low molar ratio of Al / Ti = <nUm> . the syndiotactic polystyrene ( s-PS ) percentage of the polymer produced by alkoxyl-substituted complexes was much higher than that of CpTiCl3 . the really active center might be described as [CpTiMe]+ · [MAOX]- · nMAO ( where MAO is methylaluminoxane ) . the normal active species [CpTiMe]+ made up the core and the anion mass [MAOX]- · nMAO surrounded the core and constituted the outer shell circumstance . they activated the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene as a whole . for a high concentration of MAO , the function of the alkoxyl group was weak because of the limited proportion in the outer shell . for a low concentration of MAO , the proportion of alkoxyl ligands in the outer shell increased greatly , and their influence also became significant , as reflected in a higher s-PS percentage of the obtained polymer . the existence of the additional oxygen atom in the alkoxyl ligand stabilized the active species more effectively ; this was reflected in the higher temperature of the maximum activities . 
ethylene polymerizations with catalytic systems Me2SiCp*NtBuZrX2 ( 1 ) [ cp* = C3H4 ; x = Cl ( 1Cl ) , me ( 1Me ) ] , triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) , perfluorophenylborate CatB(C6F5)4 [ cat = CPh3 ( 3 ) , Me2NHPh ( 4 ) ] , or Me2SiCp2ZrX2 [ x = Cl ( 2Cl ) , me ( 2Me ) ] / TIBA / <nUm> ( 4 ) were performed within a wide range of ethylene pressures of different Al / Zr ratios , and Zr / B = <nUm> . catalytic systems 1Cl(2Cl) / TIBA / <nUm> led to the formation of very high linear molecular weight polyethylene ( PE ) of me ∼ ; <nUm> with low activity . the replacement of both chlorine ligands in the precatalyst for the methyl ones led to the formation of active species producing low molecular weight PE with high activity . chain transfer to ethylene was shown to be the main reaction controlling PE chain propagation : kp / ktr ∼ 20-30 for 1Me / TIBA / <nUm> and kp / ktr ∼ 350-500 for 2Me / TIBA / <nUm> . it was suggested that TIBA was present in the active center first in the form of a neutral heterobimetallic Zr-Al bridged complex followed by the formation of a partially polarized Zr - Al(Cl)R2 ( r = iBu ) or an unreactive Zr - AlR3 cationic complex by abstraction of the alkyl ligand under the action of borate . it was concluded that AlR3 from the latter cationic complex may be easily reversibly replaced under the specific coordination of ethylene or accumulated a-olefin , giving rise to highly labile and sterically accessible cationic species . experiments on ethylene polymerization with the catalytic systems 1Cl(1Me) / TIBA / <nUm> / Ph2NH , 1Cl(1Me) / TIBA / <nUm> , 2Cl(2Me) / TIBA / <nUm> / Ph2NH , and 2Cl(2Me) / TIBA / <nUm> were performed to confirm the suggestion . catalytic systems derived from dichloride complexes in the presence of a s-donor substrate also produced low molecular weight EsP with molecular weight characteristics similar to those of products obtained with the dimethylated precatalysts . the specific feature of active species derived from 2Me complexes to isomerize coordinated a-olefin into trans-vinylene polymer chains was also revealed . the catalytic behavior of the ternary catalytic system based on 2Me relative to 2Me or 2Cl precatalysts activated with polymethylaluminoxane at different Al / Zr ratios was compared . 
an investigation of the catalytic behavior of the dimethylated zirconocenes Me2SiCp* NtBuZrMe2 [ cp* = C3H4 ; 1Me ] , Me2SiCp2ZrMe2 ( 2Me ) , Cp2ZrMe2 ( 3Me ) , Ind2ZrMe2 ( 4Me ) , Me2SiInd2ZrMe2 ( 5Me ) , Et(2-MeInd)2ZrMe2 ( 6Me ) , and Me2Si(2-MeInd)2ZrMe2 ( 7Me ) with the combined activator triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) / CPh3B(C6F5)4 ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ; B / Zr = <nUm> ) in ethylene polymerizations at increased monomer pressures ( 5-11 bar , <nUm> ° C ) was carried out . sterically opened zirconocenes in ternary catalysts gave rise to active species effective in the formation of low molecular weight polyethylenes ( EsP ) . these active species tended to increase the PE molecular weight [ 1Me ( 2100 ) < 2Me ( 20,000 ) < 5Me ( 89,000 ) < 3Me ( 94,500 ) ] under similar conditions . PE obtained with 4Me showed a bimodal gel permeation chromatography curve with a <nUm> % peak area [ weight - average molecular weight ( mw ) = <nUm> ] and a <nUm> % peak area ( mw = <nUm> ) . the increase in sterical demands from the zirconocenes was also demonstrated by the reduction of the chain transfer to monomer , the reinsertion of vinyl-ended PE chains , and their ability for isomerization . these reactions were most pronounced for the zirconocenes 1Me and 2Me . the active species responsible for the formation of low molecular weight EsP deactivated quickly . the zirconocenes 6Me , 7Me , and (2-PhInd)2ZrMe2 ( 8Me ) bearing substituent at the 2-position of the indenyl ring was activated with TIBA alone , yielding active species effective in ethylene and propylene polymerizations . EsP formed with 6Me-8Me complexes activated with TIBA had high molecular weights . an increase in the Al / Zr ratio in the catalytic system 8Me / TIBA from <nUm> to <nUm> led to an enhancement of the molecular weight of polypropylene ( PP ) samples from oligomeric products to an viscosity - average molecular weight of <nUm> . the increase in the molecular weights of PPs with an increase in the propylene concentration was also observed . an analysis of the catalytic performance of the 8Me / TIBA system showed first - order dependency of the initial polymerization rates on the TIBA concentration and close to second - order dependency on propylene . the second - order dependency on the monomer concentration is explained in terms of the monomer participation in the initiation step of the polymerization reaction . 
the use of functional groups bearing silica / poly(styrene-co-4-vinylpyridine) core - shell particles as a support for a zirconocene catalyst in ethylene polymerization was studied . several factors affecting the behavior of the supported catalyst and the properties of the resulting polymer , such as time , temperature , Al / N ( molar ratio ) , and Al / Zr ( molar ratio ) , were examined . the conditions of the supported catalyst preparation were more important than those of the ethylene polymerization . the state of the supported catalyst itself played a decisive role in both the catalytic behavior of the supported catalyst and the properties of polyethylene ( PE ) . IR and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to follow the formation of the supports . the formation of cationic active species is hypothesized , and the performance of the core-shell-particle - supported zirconocene catalyst is discussed as well . the bulk density of the PE formed was higher than that of the polymer obtained from homogeneous and polymer - supported Cp2ZrCl2 / methylaluminoxane catalyst systems . 
benzyl cyclopentadienyl titanium trichloride ( BzCpTiCl3 ) was synthesized from benzyl bromide , cyclopentadienyl lithium , and titanium tetrachloride and used in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene . kinetic measurements of the polymerization were carried out at different temperatures . the polymerization with BzCpTiCl3 / MAO differs from the polymerization with cyclopentadienyl titanium trichloride in its behavior toward the Al / Ti ratio . In addition , high activities are observed at high Al / Ti ratios . by analyzing the polymerization runs and the physical properties of the polymers with differential scanning calorimetry , 13C NMR spectroscopy , wide - angle x-ray scattering measurements , and gel permeation chromatography , we found that the phenyl ring coordinates to the titanium atom during polymerization . other known substitutions of the cyclopentadienyl ring ( V. scholz , dissertation , university of hamburg , <nUm> ) in principle influence the polymerization activity . the physical properties of the polymers produced by the catalysts already known are nearly identical . BzCpTiCl3 is the first catalyst that leads to polystyrene obviously different from the polystyrene produced by other highly active catalysts . 
the copolymerization of propylene with 1-hexene , 1-octene , 1-decene , and 1-dodecene was carried out with silica - supported rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 as a catalyst . the copolymerization activities of the homogeneous and supported catalysts and the microstructures of the resulting copolymers were compared . the activity of the supported catalyst was only one - half to one - eighth of that of the homogeneous catalyst , depending on the comonomer type . the supported catalyst copolymerized more comonomer into the polymer chain than the homogeneous catalyst at the same monomer feed ratio . data of reactivity ratios showed that the depression in the activity of propylene instead of an enhancement in the activity of olefinic comonomer was responsible for this phenomenon . we also found that copolymerization with a-olefins and supporting the metallocene on a carrier improved the stereoregularity and regioregularity of the copolymers . the melting temperature of all the copolymers decreased linearly with growing comonomer content , regardless of the comonomer type and catalyst system . low mobility of the propagation chain in the supported catalyst was suggested as the reason for the different polymerization behaviors of the supported catalyst with the homogeneous system . 
the initial active site concentrations , [C*]0 , have been determined with CH3OT radiolabeling for the Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO and CpZrCl3 / MAO catalysts ( cp = e5 : cyclopentadienyl , MAO = methyl aluminoxane ) . almost all the Zr are found to be catalytically active in <nUm> ° C ethylene polymerizations ; [C*]0 = [Zr] and [C*]0 = 0.8[Zr] at Al / Zr ratios of <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . lowering the temperature to <nUm> ° C and Al / Zr to <nUm> × <nUm> reduces [C*]0 to 0.2[Zr] . the rate constant of propagation at <nUm> ° C was calculated to be <nUm> × <nUm> ( m s)-1 for both catalysts at Al / Zr = <nUm> × <nUm> ; the values are decreased fivefold and tenfold , respectively , for the CpZrCl3 and Cp2ZrCl2 systems . the usage of 14CO to determine the propagating Zr – P species was investigated . with regard to the time of reaction of 14CO with the polymerization mixture , the initial phase is attributed to reversible CO complexation and reversible migratory insertion . the second slower phase may be due to the formation of enediolate . during the course of a batch polymerization the 14C radioactivity incorporated is small compared to the number of active sites found by CH3OT determination ; it is only ca. <nUm> % of [C*]0 at maximum rate of polymerization . therefore , 14CO radiolabeling can not be used to count C* . the initial active site concentrations , [C*]0 , have been determined with CH3OT radiolabeling for the Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO and CpZrCl3 / MAO catalysts ( cp = e5 : cyclopentadienyl , MAO = methyl aluminoxane ) . almost all the Zr are found to be catalytically active in <nUm> ° C ethylene polymerizations ; [C*]0 = [Zr] and [C*]0 = 0.8[Zr] at Al / Zr ratios of <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . lowering the temperature to <nUm> ° C and Al / Zr to <nUm> × <nUm> reduces [C*]0 to 0.2[Zr] . the rate constant of propagation at <nUm> ° C was calculated to be <nUm> × <nUm> ( m s)-1 for both catalysts at Al / Zr = <nUm> × <nUm> ; the values are decreased fivefold and tenfold , respectively , for the CpZrCl3 and Cp2ZrCl2 systems . the usage of 14CO to determine the propagating Zr – P species was investigated . with regard to the time of reaction of 14CO with the polymerization mixture , the initial phase is attributed to reversible CO complexation and reversible migratory insertion . the second slower phase may be due to the formation of enediolate . during the course of a batch polymerization the 14C radioactivity incorporated is small compared to the number of active sites found by CH3OT determination ; it is only ca. <nUm> % of [C*]0 at maximum rate of polymerization . therefore , 14CO radiolabeling can not be used to count C* . copyright 
the ethylene polymerization by Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO ( cp = e5 : cyclopentadienyl ; MAO = methyl aluminoxane ) and CpZrCl3 / MAO have been studied . the MW and PD ( = mw / mw ) of polymers obtained after 2.5-60 min are the same , which indicate short chain lifetime . the values of rate constants for Cp2ZrCl2 at <nUm> ° C are : kp = <nUm> − <nUm> ( m s)-1 and ktrA1 = 0.012-0.81 s-1 depending upon [Zr] and [MAO,] ktrb = <nUm> s-1 , and ktrH = <nUm> M-1 torr-1 / <nUm> s-1 . these chain transfer rate constant values are two to three orders of magnitude greater than the corresponding values found for Cl2Mg supported titanium catalysts . one significant difference between the heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts is that the former decays according to an apparent second order kinetics , whereas the latter decay is simple first order at <nUm> ° C and biphasic first order at higher temperatures . the productivity of the catalysts depends weekly on temperature while the MW decreases strongly with increase of temperature above <nUm> ° C . all the active species were formed upon mixing Cp2ZrCl2 with MAO while it took up to <nUm> min for the CpZnCl3 / MAO system . the productivity of the former increase more strongly with the decrease of [Zr] than the latter . otherwise , the two catalyst systems have all their kinetic parameters differing less than a factor of two . the ethylene polymerization by Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO ( cp = e5 : cyclopentadienyl ; MAO = methyl aluminoxane ) and CpZrCl3 / MAO have been studied . the MW and PD ( = mw / mw ) of polymers obtained after 2.5-60 min are the same , which indicate short chain lifetime . the values of rate constants for Cp2ZrCl2 at <nUm> ° C are : kp = <nUm> − <nUm> ( m s)-1 and ktrA1 = 0.012-0.81 s-1 depending upon [Zr] and [MAO,] ktrb = <nUm> s-1 , and ktrH = <nUm> M-1 torr-1 / <nUm> s-1 . these chain transfer rate constant values are two to three orders of magnitude greater than the corresponding values found for Cl2Mg supported titanium catalysts . one significant difference between the heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts is that the former decays according to an apparent second order kinetics , whereas the latter decay is simple first order at <nUm> ° C and biphasic first order at higher temperatures . the productivity of the catalysts depends weekly on temperature while the MW decreases strongly with increase of temperature above <nUm> ° C . all the active species were formed upon mixing Cp2ZrCl2 with MAO while it took up to <nUm> min for the CpZnCl3 / MAO system . the productivity of the former increase more strongly with the decrease of [Zr] than the latter . otherwise , the two catalyst systems have all their kinetic parameters differing less than a factor of two . copyright 
the kinetic parameters have been measured for octene-1 solution polymerization at <nUm> ° C catalyzed by zirconocene with the cocatalyst methylaluminoxane . the polymerizations were performed in an attenuated total reflectance ( ATR ) reaction cell . the progress of the reactions were followed by observing the disappearance of octene-1 using the <nUm> cm-1 band measured by FT-IR spectroscopy . the dependence of the reaction rate , rp , on catalyst concentration and cocatalyst / catalyst ratio was examined . the catalyst deactivation mechanism was studied by fitting the experimental data to mathematical models involving second-order propagation and either first or second order catalyst deactivation . second-order catalyst deactivation provided a much better fit . the calculated deactivation rate constant , kd , is <nUm> (Ms)-1 . this model is used to determine the propagation rate constant for Al / Zr = <nUm> × <nUm> as kp = <nUm> ( m s)-1 . A decrease in Al / Zr = <nUm> × <nUm> lowered the propagation rate constant , kp , to <nUm> ( m s)-1 indicating that less than <nUm> % of the initial Zr is active at this Al / Zr ratio . the kinetic parameters have been measured for octene-1 solution polymerization at <nUm> ° C catalyzed by zirconocene with the cocatalyst methylaluminoxane . the polymerizations were performed in an attenuated total reflectance ( ATR ) reaction cell . the progress of the reactions were followed by observing the disappearance of octene-1 using the <nUm> cm-1 band measured by FT-IR spectroscopy . the dependence of the reaction rate , rp , on catalyst concentration and cocatalyst / catalyst ratio was examined . the catalyst deactivation mechanism was studied by fitting the experimental data to mathematical models involving second-order propagation and either first or second order catalyst deactivation . second-order catalyst deactivation provided a much better fit . the calculated deactivation rate constant , kd , is <nUm> (Ms)-1 . this model is used to determine the propagation rate constant for Al / Zr = <nUm> × <nUm> as kp = <nUm> ( m s)-1 .

MgCl2-supported Cl3Ti catalysts , with and / or without electron donor modifier ( internal Bi or external Be ) , were compared with rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) activated with either MAO or the cation forming agent , triphenyl carbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( 2 ) , with triethylalumium ( TEA ) . the activities of the heterogeneous catalysts depend on the presence or absence of the lewis base , were relatively insensitive to the temperature of polymerization , and produce poly(hexene) with molecular weights up to <nUm> . the <nUm> / MAO catalyst has about five times higher activity at <nUm> ° C but is almost inactive at − <nUm> ° C ; the overall activation energy is <nUm> kcal mol-1 . In contrast , the activity for hexene polymerization by the <nUm> / <nUm> / TEA catalyst is actually slightly greater at lower temperature . the MW 's of poly(hexene) obtained with the zirconocenium catalysts are only in the tens of thousands because of rapid b-hydride elimination by the electrophilic cationic Zr center . 
the purpose of this research was to selectively alter the rate of surface degradation of linear aliphatic polyesters without adversely affecting their bulk properties by way of functional group transformation , where the surface ester linkages would be converted to vinyl ether functionalities with dimethyltitanocene . it has been observed that dimethyl titanocene causes surface degradation of poly ( glycolic acid ) without adversely affecting its bulk properties , such as mv , bursting strength , and thermal properties the vinvl ether resulting from the conversion of the PGA ester groups was unstable under ambient conditions , and further reacted by polymer chain scissioning , as was observed from measurements of molecular weight . 
propylene was polymerized with rac-ethylene-bis (1-e5-indenyl)dichlorozirconium / methylaluminoxane in solvents of different polarity . the poly ( propylene ) formed was separated by solvent extraction ; 13C-NMR and DSC measurements were made on the polymer fractions . the poly(propylene) in each solvent fraction has its characteristic molecular weight steric pentad distributions , melting transition temperature , and enthalpy for fusion irrespective of the polymerization medium . the results suggest that the medium dielectric constant does not affect the polymerization rate or the intrinsic stereoselectivity , propagation and chain transfer rates a given catalytic species but can alter the occurrence of steric insertion errors through shifting of distributions of the propagating species producing poly(propylenes) of different stereoregularities . 
propylene was polymerized by binary zirconocenium catalysts derived from rac-ethylenebis(1-e5-indenyl)dimethylzirconium and cation forming agents (C6H5)3C+(C6F5)4B- and BC18F15 . polymerizations were also performed with the ternary systems of Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 , Et3Al , and the cation forming agents . the catalyst systems , with the inert noncoordinating counter-ion , (C6F5)4B- , have much higher activity and stereoselectivity than the ones with the CH3B-(C6F5)3 counter-ion . much less active still are catalysts having BF4- or (C6H5)4B- counter-ions . similar but smaller effects of counter-ion structure on ethylene polymerization were observed . 
the syndiospecific propylene polymerizations catalyzed by isopropylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl)- and (2,2-dimethylpropylidene)(cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl)-zirconocenium ( 1+ and 2+ ) have been investigated theoretically and compared with experimental observations . with the ab initio calculated structures for the transition state ( TS ) of 1+(M)P and 2+(M)P ( m = propylene , P = 2-methylpentyl ) , their steric energies ( e ° ) have been computed using MM2 force-field . the difference between steric energies e ° ( m ) and e ° ( r ) for the meso and racemic enchainment of propylene , respectively , is defined as the stereocontrol energy [ dE ° ( m − r ) ] for syndiotactic propagation . the dE ° ( m − r ) for the TS of 1+ (M)P is about <nUm> kcal / mol , the value is <nUm> kcal / mol greater for 2+(M)P . the observed steric pentad distributions of the syndiotactic poly(propylene) obtained by these catalysts are consistent with smaller effective stereocontrol energy , which is about two-third as large as dE ° ( m − r ) values calculated for the MM2 optimized structure . syndiotactic enchainment is favored over isotactic enchainment for all combinations of site configurations in the catalyst . a-Agostic interaction seems to enhance syndioselectivity , whereas g-agostic interaction changes the stereoselectivity to meso enchainment . the mirror plane symmetry of the syndiotactic propagating species renders the stereoselectivity of the polymerization insensitive to reaction conditions . these catalysts are also highly regiospecific . 
propene was polymerized at <nUm> ° C and 2-bar propene in toluene using methylalumoxane ( MAO ) activated rac-Me2Si(Benz[e]Indenyl)2ZrCl2 ( BI ) and rac-Me2Si(2-Me-Benz[e]Indenyl)2ZrCl2 ( MBI ) . catalyst BI / MAO polymerizes propene with high activity to afford low molecular weight polypropylene , whereas MBI / MAO is less active and produces high molecular weight polypropylene . variation of reaction conditions such as propene concentration , temperature , concentration of catalyst components , and addition of hydrogen reveals that the lower molecular weight polypropylene produced with BI / MAO results from chain transfer to propene monomer following a 2,1-insertion . A large fraction of both metallocene catalyst systems is deactivated upon 2,1-insertion . such dormant sites can be reactivated by h2-addition , which affords active metallocene hydrides . this effect of h2-addition is reflected by a decreasing content of head-to-head enchainment and the formation of polypropylene with n-butyl end groups . both catalysts show a strong dependence of activity on propene concentration that indicates a formal reaction order of <nUm> with respect to propene . MBI / MAO shows a much higher dependence of the activity on temperature than BI / MAO . At elevated temperatures , MBI / MAO polymerizes propene faster than BI / MAO . 
Bis(1-indenyl)-di[1'S , 2'R , 5'S)-methoxy]silane ( 1 ) was converted into a mixture of corresponding ansa-diastereomeric zirconocenes . further purification afforded a single dia-stereomer , di[(1'S , 2'R , 5'S)-methoxy ] silylene-bis[e5-1(R , r)-(+)-indenyl ] dichlorozirconium ( 2 ) , which is optically active and hydrocarbon soluble . extremely rapid ethylene , propylene , and ethylene-hexene polymerizations were observed both in toluene and n-heptane solutions ; for instance , at <nUm> ° C , activity for ethylene polymerization reaches ∼ <nUm> × <nUm> ( g of PE / ( ( mol of Zr ) · [C2H4] · h ) . the “ bare ” zirconocenium ion generated from <nUm> / TIBA / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 exhibits unusual polymerization behaviors ; the polymerization activity increases monotonically with temperature of polymerization ( tp ) up to a conventional polymerization condition ( <nUm> – <nUm> ° C ) , and the 13C NMR study shows that the isotactic poly-propylene obtained has fairly high [mmmm] methyl pentad distributions at high tp ( 25 ° C with [mmmm] ∼ <nUm> – <nUm> ) and a perfect stereoregularity at low tp ( 0 ° C with [mmmm] > <nUm> ) . the catalyst precursors <nUm> and Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 3 ) supported on silica by different approaches produced poly(olefins) of different molecular weights and stereoregularities , and a methylaluminokane and Ph3CB(C6F5)4 free silica-supported zirconocene system was found to be activated by triisobutylaluminum . 
copolymerization of styrene ( st ) and st - terminated poly(ethylene oxide ) macromonomer ( SEOM ) with CpTiCl3 / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) catalyst in toluene was investigated . the copolymerization of st and SEOM proceeded easily to give a graft copolymer consisting of syndiotactic polystyrene as the main chain and hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide ) as the side chain . A number of side chains in the graft copolymer could be controlled by the amount of SEOM in the feed . the reactivity of SEOM was determined from copolymerization of st and SEOM with the CpTiCl3 / MAO catalyst , and the reactivity of SEOM depended on the molecular weight of SEOM . the thermal properties of the graft copolymer such as the melting temperature were influenced by the introduction of SEOM . 
the study of ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization with the zirconocene catalyst , bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl <nUm> ) / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , anchored on a MgCl2(THF) <nUm> support was carried out . the influence of 1-hexene concentration in the feed on catalyst productivity and comonomer reactivity as well as other properties was investigated . additionally , the effect of support modification by the organoaluminum compounds [ ( MAO , trimethlaluminum ( AlMe3 ) , or diethylaluminum chloride ( Et2AlCl ) ] on the behavior of the ClMg 2(THF)2 / Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst in the copolymerization process and on the properties of the copolymers was explored . immobilization of the Cp2ZrCl2 compound on the complex magnesium support MgCl2(THF)2 resulted in an effective system for the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene . the modification of the support as well as the kind of organoaluminum compound used as a modifier influenced the activity of the examined catalyst system . additionally , the profitable influence of immobilization of the homogeneous catalyst as well as modification of the support applied on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the copolymers was established . finally , with the successive self - nucleation / annealing procedure , the copolymers obtained over both homogeneous and heterogeneous metallocene catalysts were heterogeneous with respect to their chemical composition . 
statistical copolymers of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) with n-butyl- , s-butyl , t-butyl- , n-hexyl- , decyl- , stearyl- , allyl- , trimethylsilyl- and trimethylsilyloxyethyl methacrylate were prepared by zirconocene - catalyzed copolymerization . the reactivity ratios of MMA copolymers with butyl- , hexyl- , and stearyl methacrylate were estimated using the finemann - ross , the inverted finemann - ross , and the kelen - tudos graphical methods . structural parameters of the copolymers were obtained from the calculated dyad sequences , derived by using the reactivity ratios . the effect of the nature of the methacrylate ester group and the catalytic system used on the copolymer structure is discussed . the glass - transition temperature ( tg ) values of MMA copolymers with butyl- and hexyl methacrylate were measured and examined in the frame of several theoretical equations , allowing the prediction of these tg values . the best fit was obtained using barton and johnston equations , taking the monomer sequence distribution of the copolymers into account . 
metallocene and other transition metal complexes activated by methylaluminoxane are highly active catalysts for the polymerization of olefins , diolefins , and styrene , which was discovered at the university of hamburg about <nUm> years ago . these catalysts allow the synthesis of polymers with a highly defined microstructure , tacticity , and stereo - regularity , as well as new copolymers with superior properties such as film clarity , tensile strength , and lower extractables . A better understanding of the mechanism of olefin polymerization leads to findings of other new single site catalysts . the development of the metallocene / MAO - catalysts from their discovery to their present state of the art is presented . 
the copolymerization of propylene and 3-buten-1-ol protected with alkylaluminum [ trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) or triisobutylaluminum ] was conducted with an isospecific zirconocene catalyst [ rac-dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl) zirconium dichloride ] , combined with methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst , in the presence of additional TMA or H as the chain - transfer reagent if necessary . the results indicated that endhydroxylated polypropylene was obtained in the presence of the chain - transfer reagents because of the formation of dormant species after the insertion of the 3-buten-l-ol - based monomer followed by chain - transfer reactions . the selectivity of the chain - transfer reactions was influenced by the alkylaluminum protecting the comonomer and the catalyst structure . 
the copolymerization of ethylene and n-(vinylphenyl)carbazole ( VPC ) was carried out with constrained geometry catalysts ( CGC ) and isopropylidene-bridged zirconocene catalyst . the copolymerization of ethylene and styrene was successfully achieved with half - sandwiched titanocene catalysts which include bridged cyclopentadienyl and amino ligands . it was observed that the copolymer exhibited semicrystalline / rubbery , amorphous rubbery and amorphous / glassy features with increasing styrene content . the results show that the electronic interaction between VPC and the active species affected the reactivity of VPC rather than the steric factor of the active species . 
A series of titanium complexes Cp*TiCl((OCH(R)CH2) 2NAr ) ( cp* = C5Me5 , r = H , Ar = phenyl ( 2a ) ; r = H , Ar = 2,6-dimethylphenyl ( 2b ) ; r = me , Ar = phenyl ( 2c ) ) was prepared by the reaction of corresponding N,N-diethoxylaniline derivatives , with Cp*TiCl3 in the presence of excessive triethylamine . all the titanium complexes display higher catalytic activities towards the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene in the presence of modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) as a cocatalyst , and produce higher molecular weight polystyrenes with higher syndiotacticity and melting temperature than their mother complex Cp*TiCl3 . the catalyst activities and polymer yields as well as polymer properties are considerably affected by the steric and electronic effect of the tridentate ligands . 
temperature ( T ) effects on the microstructure of polypropylene made with metallocene catalysts have been investigated with the theoretical framework originally developed by coleman and fox and extended to the stereospecific polymerization of propylene with two - state ansa and fluxional metallocene catalysts . T effects on the polymer microstructure are mainly due to factors other than changes in the intrinsic stereoselectivity of the two states . the model has been applied to the stereosequence distributions of polypropylene prepared with the C 1-symmetric me 2Si(Ind)(Flu)ZrCl <nUm> complex , activated with methyl aluminoxane , over a range of T and monomer concentration ( [M] ) values . the use of these two variables , in combination with the coleman - fox model ( or a kinetic model ) , allows more reliable estimates of fundamental parameters , especially when the microstructure is a weak function of one of these variables at a constant value of T ( e.g. , [M] ) . 
through the diels - alder reaction between cyclopentadiene groups attached to polystyrene in the presence of zirconocene , novel polystyrene - supported metallocene catalysts were prepared . A novel method for immobilizing metallocene catalysts was investigated , and the resultant polystyrene - supported metallocene for olefin polymerization was studied . the results of olefin polymerization showed that different crosslinking degrees of support in the catalyst system had significant effects on the catalytic behavior . the influence of the [Al] / [Zr] molar ratio and the temperature on the (co)polymerization activity was studied . when 1-hexene and 1-dodecene were used for copolymerization with ethylene , an obvious positive comonomer effect was observed . 
A highly reactive catalyst system , which induces the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene with high activity , has been found by the combination of cyclo-pentadienyl ( cp ) complexes of group IIA or group IIIA elements with titanium alkoxides . the 1H NMR monitoring of these reactions reveals the occurrence of a novel cp - transfer reaction that leads to the generation of cp - containing titanium complexes as catalysts for promoting the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene . detailed in situ 1H NMR studies reveal that the rate of the cp - transfer reaction is highly dependent on the steric bulkiness of the titanium alkoxide complexes , the structures of the cp complexes of group IIA or group IIIA elements , and the polymerization temperature . styrene polymerization studies also reveal that a more effective cp - transfer reaction can typically lead to the generation of a more highly reactive catalyst for sPS polymerization . this study provides a convenient method for the in situ generation of variable structures of cp / titanium alkoxide complexes , which are difficult to synthesize by other methods . most importantly , the mixture of a catalyst precursor can be directly used as an sPS polymerization catalyst without isolation and purification of cp / titanium complexes . 
investigation of the characteristics and performance in propylene polymerization of silica - immobilized methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , in combination with a moderately and a highly isospecific zirconocene catalyst , has revealed that a simple impregnation of silica with MAO at ambient temperature is insufficient to obtain uniform distribution of MAO throughout the support particle . homogeneous Al distribution throughout the support , giving increased catalyst activity , was achieved by a more rigorous impregnation of silica with MAO at elevated temperatures . the highest catalyst activities were obtained by precontacting the MAO with the zirconocene to generate the activated species before immobilization on silica . polymer particle morphology was strongly dependent on the characteristics of the silica used for catalyst immobilization . 
the polymerization behavior of cyclohexyl methacrylate and trimethyl-silyloxyethyl methacrylate with the catalytic system cp 2ZrMe2 / BC18F15 / ZnEt <nUm> was examined . block copolymers of these bulky methacrylates with methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) , having high molecular weights and relatively narrow molecular weight distributions , were prepared . n-Butyl acrylate and tert-butyl acrylate were polymerized with various catalytic systems based on zirconocene complexes . these polymerizations seemed to proceed to a nonquantitative yield , producing polymers with high molecular weights and relatively low polydispersities . this behavior indicated the presence of termination reactions in the initiation step , which appeared to be faster than the propagation step . block copolymers of these acrylates with MMA were synthesized with the catalytic system rac-Et(Ind)2ZrMe2 / [ B(C6F 5)4]-[Me2NHPh]+ / ZnEt <nUm> , starting from the polymerization of MMA . the block copolymers produced were well defined in most cases , as indicated by size exclusion chromatography , NMR , and differential scanning calorimetry measurements . 
ethylene and propylene polymerization using Ind2ZrCl2 and Ind2Zr(CH3)2 / MAO catalytic systems modified by the sterically demanding bridged alicyclic alcohols , adamantan-1-ol , adamantan-2-ol , 2-methyladamantan-2-ol , and fenchyl alcohol , was investigated . lower alcohols like isopropanol completely deactivate the system , whereas in the case of catalysts modified by these voluminous alcohols only a slight decrease in the catalytic activity proportional to alcohol / metallocene molar ratio was observed . the addition of the modifiers gives rise to polymers with higher molecular weights than the nonmodified systems , but no structural changes in the polyethylenes were observed . the addition of the sterically demanding alcohols to the reaction medium changes the regioregularity of polypropylenes , but does not significantly influence their stereoregularity , at <nUm> ° C . propylene-ethylene copolymers containing up to <nUm> % of ethylene units derived from 1,3-insertion and significant amount of rr - centered pentads were obtained by single - monomer polymerization of propylene with Ind2ZrCl <nUm> / MMAO / adamantan-1-ol , at <nUm> ° C . 
In recent years , research on cylindrical polymer brushes ( or molecular bottle - brushes ) has received significant attention . In this article , we discuss various strategies for their synthesis and the unique properties arising from their regular multibranched structure . some recent advances in the application of cylindrical polymer brushes are highlighted . amphiphilic core- shell cylindrical polymer brushes , for example , have been successfully used as single molecular templates for inorganic nanoparticle formation . 
styrene / ethylene copolymerization was performed by longo et al. with the use of a cyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride ( CpTiCl3 ) / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) system with various aluminum / titanium ratios and various monomer compositions . the obtained polymer consisted of a mixture of an ethylene-styrene pseudorandom copolymer , polyethylene , and poly(styrene-block- ethylene ) with a syndiospecific styrene - styrene unit ( SPS-b-PE ) . In this work , from the whole polymer obtained with the CpTiCl3 / MAO catalyst system , the SPS-b-PE copolymer was separated with the temperature rising elution fractionation method , and the structure was specified by 13C NMR . the polymer obtained from the trivalent titanium catalyst , which was thought to be the active species of syndiotactic polystyrene , included both a styrene - styrene sequence and a styrene-ethylene-ethylene-styrene sequence . however , neither the styrene-ethylene-styrene sequence nor the long chain of . polyethylene was included . 
the ligand effect and the reaction conditions for the living radical polymerization of styrene initiated by epoxide radical ring opening was investigated in a series of piano-stool , Ti(IV) scorpionate and , half - sandwich metallocenes ( LTiCl <nUm> ; L = tp , cp* , ind and cp , where tp = hydrotris(pyrazol-1-ylborato) , cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl , ind = indenyl and cp = cyclopentadienyl ) . the polymerization is mediated by the reversible termination of the growing chains with Ti (III) species derived from Zn reduction of parent Ti(IV) derivatives . A poor performance was observed for TpTiCl <nUm> because of probable over-reduction . the strong electron donating effect of cp* accounts for a strong C-Ti chain end bond and consequently , a living - like process is observed only at T > <nUm> ° C . however , both ind and cp ligands provide a linear dependence of m n on conversion and narrow polydispersity over a wide range of experimental conditions . investigation of the effect of temperature and reagent ratios generates an optimum for epoxide / CpTiCl <nUm> / Zn = <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> at 70-90 ° C . on the basis of a combination of steric and electronic properties , the ligands rank as cp ≥ ind « cp* » tp . this trend is different from coordination polymerization , and in conjunction with our previous results on cp 2TiCl <nUm> , further supports a radical mechanism . 
bisketonate and alkoxide Ti (III) complexes derived from Zn reduction of Ti(IV) precursors were evaluated as catalysts for the living radical polymerization ( LRP ) of styrene initiated by Ti - catalyzed epoxide radical ring opening and mediated by reversible termination with Ti (III) . No polymerization occurred with tris(2,2,6 , 6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)titanium ( III ) , whereas dichlorobis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)titanium ( IV ) affords only a free radical polymerization . preliminary living features were displayed by ( iPrO ) 2TiCl <nUm> . investigations of the effect of epoxide / Ti / Zn ratios , temperature , and nature of the epoxide demonstrated that ( iPrO ) 3TiCl provides a linear dependence of m n on conversion over a wide range of conditions with an optimum for [Sty] / [ epoxide group ] / [Ti] / [Zn] = <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> at <nUm> ° C . however , the polydispersity could not be reduced below <nUm> - <nUm> , with an initiator efficiency of <nUm> . these results were rationalized in terms of a combination of decreased Ti oxophilicity and ligand exchange . the lowered oxophilicity decreases the initiation rate and broadens m w / m n . the fast alkoxide exchange promotes a weak dependence of the polymerization on reaction conditions and generates macromolecular Ti species with reduced ability to mediate LRP . thus , while monofunctional epoxides provide homogeneous polymerizations and narrower m w / m n , difunctional initiators may lead to gel formation at high conversion . nonetheless , all polymerizations were light gray to colorless and afforded white polymer . 
cobalt complexes 1-4 bearing N,O - chelate ligands based on condensation products of 1-phenyl-3-methyl-4-benzoyl-5-pyrazolone with aniline , o-methylaniline , a-naphthylamine , and p-nitroaniline , respectively , were synthesized , and the structures of <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by single - crystal x-ray diffraction analyses . the bis(b-ketoamine) cobalt complexes could act as moderately active catalyst precursors for norbornene polymerization with the activation of methylaluminoxane . this catalytic reaction proceeded mainly through a vinyl-type polymerization mechanism . 1H NMR and IR showed that in all cases , a small amount of double bonds raised from ring - opening metathesis polymerization ( ROMP ) was present in the polymerization products . the variation of the polymerization conditions affected the ROMP unit ratio in the polynorbornenes . 
the effects of the reaction conditions and nature of the initiator were investigated in the cp 2Ti(III)Cl - catalyzed living radical polymerization of styrene initiated by benzoyl peroxide ( BPO ) , tert-butyl peroxide ( TBPO ) , tert-butyl peroxybenzoate ( TBPOB ) , dicumyl peroxide ( CPO ) , and tert-butylperoxy 2-ethylhexyl carbonate ( TBPOEHC ) . the reversible termination of the growing chains with cp 2Ti(III)Cl affords a linear dependence of molecular weight on conversion over a wide range of temperatures ( 60-120 ° C ) with an optimum in polydispersity ( m wM n < <nUm> ) for st / BPO / cp 2TiCl <nUm> / Zn = <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> at 60-90 ° C . the similarity of the kinetic parameters from polymerizations initiated by peroxides with vastly different half - life times ( t <nUm> / <nUm> BPO , <nUm> ° C = <nUm> h , t <nUm> / <nUm> TBPO , <nUm> ° C = <nUm> h ) and the minimum peroxide / Ti = <nUm> / <nUm> ratio required for a living process indicate that initiation occurs primarily by the redox reaction of the peroxide with cp 2Ti(III)Cl rather than peroxide thermal decomposition . this is consistent with one Ti equivalent consumed in the redox initiation and the second one utilized in the reversible termination of the growing chains . qualitatively , based on the livingness of the process , these initiators ranked as BPO > TBPOB ∼ TBPO > CPO > TBPOEHC . 
the ligand effect and reaction conditions for the living radical polymerization of styrene initiated by epoxide radical ring opening were investigated in a series of substituted sandwich metallocenes : L 2Ti(IV)Cl <nUm> [ L = cyclopentadienyl ( cp ) , EtCp , iPrCp , tBuCp , pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ( cp* ) , or indenyl ( ind ) ] , cp 2TiX <nUm> ( x = F , Cl , Br , or CO ) , tBuCp 2TiMe <nUm> , and PcTiCl <nUm> ( pc = phthalocyanine ) . the polymerization was mediated by the reversible termination of growing chains with Ti (III) species derived from the Zn reduction of the Ti(IV) precursors . with the exception of Ti derivatives with cp* , pc , F , CO , and me ligands , which could not be reduced , all other complexes catalyzed a living radical process with a linear dependence of the number - average molecular weight on the conversion and a narrow polydispersity at 70-90 ° C . A relatively weak dependence ( RCp : r = H ∼ et ∼ iPr ∼ tBu > ind ) of the polymerization on the nature of the cp substituent was observed . this was provisionally rationalized as a result of the constant balance between electronic and steric effects with increasing substituent size . by contrast , the apparent Cl > Br > > and L 2TiCl <nUm> > LTiCl <nUm> trend qualitatively paralleled the decrease in the lewis acidity with a decreasing number of Cl ligands and the increased electron donation and steric effects of the metallocene ligands . thus , sandwich metallocenes are better suited for this polymerization than Ti bisketonates , alkoxides , and half - sandwich derivatives . 
the polymerization of norbornene has been investigated in the presence of different bis(salicylaldiminate)nickel(II) precursors activated by methylaluminoxane . these systems are highly active in affording nonstereoregular vinyl-type polynorbornenes ( PNBs ) with high molecular weights . the productivity of the catalytic systems is strongly enhanced ( up to <nUm> kg of PNB / mol of Ni × h ) when electron - withdrawing nitro groups are introduced on the phenol moiety . on the contrary , the presence of bulky alkyl groups on the n-aryl moiety of the ligand does not substantially affect the activity or characteristics of the resulting PNBs . the catalytic performances are also markedly influenced by the reaction parameters , such as the nature of the solvent , the reaction time , and the monomer / Ni and Al / Ni molar ratios . 
copolymerization of ethylene with styrene , catalyzed by 1,4-dithiabutane-diyl-linked bis(phenolato) titanium complex and methylaluminoxane , produced exclusively ethylene-styrene copolymers with high activity . copolymerization parameters were calculated to be rE = <nUm> for ethylene and rS = <nUm> for styrene , with rE r S = <nUm> indicating preference for alternating copolymerization . the copolymer microstructure can be varied by changing the ratio between the monomers in the copolymerization feed , affording copolymers with styrene content up to <nUm> % . the copolymer microstructure was fully elucidated by 13C NMR spectroscopy revealing , in the copolymers with styrene content higher than <nUm> % , the presence of long styrene - styrene homosequences , occasionally interrupted by isolated ethylene units . 
the effects of solvents , additives , ligands , and solvent in situ drying agents as well as catalyst and initiator concentrations have been investigated in the cp 2TiCl - catalyzed radical polymerization of styrene initiated by epoxide radical ring opening . on the basis of the solubilization of cp 2Ti(III)Cl and the polydispersity of the resulting polymer , the solvents rank as follows : dioxane ≥ tetrahydrofuran > diethylene glycol dimethyl ether > methoxybenzene > diphenyl ether > bulk > toluene ≫ pyridine > dimethylformamide > 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone > dimethylacetamide > ethylene carbonate , acetonitrile , and trioxane . alkoxide additives such as aluminum triisopropoxide and titanium(IV) isopropoxide are involved in alkoxide ligand exchange with the epoxide - derived titanium alkoxide and lead to broad molecular weight distributions , whereas similarly to strongly coordinating solvents , ligands such as bipyridyl block the titanium active site and prevent the polymerization . by contrast , softer ligands such as triphenylphosphine improve the polymerization in less polar solvents such as toluene . although mixed hydrides such as lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride , sodium borohydride , and lithium aluminum hydride react with bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium dichloride to form mixed titanium hydride species ineffective in polymerization control , simple hydrides such as lithium hydride , sodium hydride , and especially calcium hydride are particularly effective as in situ trace water scavengers in this polymerization . 
the effects of the reducing agent , temperature , and epoxide / Ti and Ti / Zn ratios were investigated for the cp 2TiCl - catalyzed living radical polymerization of styrene initiated by epoxide radical ring opening . No reduction of bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium dichloride occurred with Cu , devarda 's alloy , Ni , Ce , Cr , Sn , Mo , and ascorbic acid , whereas Al , lithium nitride , Mn , Sm , and Fe led to free - radical or poorly controlled polymerizations . the best results were obtained with Zn alloy , powder , or nanoparticles . Nano-Zn provided the lowest polydispersity index values , highest initiator efficiency ( IE ) , and fastest reaction rate while maintaining a well - defined living polymerization . progressively lower polydispersity was obtained with an increasing excess of Zn with an optimum at cp 2TiCl / Zn = <nUm> / <nUm> . this was rationalized through the heterogeneous nature of Zn and its possible involvement in the reversible termination step . the polymerization was insensitive to light or dark conditions , and a linear dependence of m n on the conversion was observed at all temperatures in the 60-130 ° C range with an optimum at 70-90 ° C . A stoichiometric <nUm> / <nUm> epoxide / Ti ratio provided low polydispersity ( weight - average molecular weight / number - average molecular weight < <nUm> ) and high IE , whereas increasing the epoxide / Ti ratio to <nUm> / <nUm> maintained a low polydispersity index but decreased the IE . 
an investigation of the polymer particle growth characteristics and polymer molecular weight and composition distributions in ethylene homopolymerization and ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization has been carried out with a catalyst comprising a zirconocene and methylaluminoxane immobilized on a silica support . the presence of 1-hexene leads to higher productivity and easier fragmentation of the support during particle growth . crystallization analysis fractionation and gel permeation chromatography analysis of ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers prepared at different polymerization times reveals a broadening of the chemical composition distribution with increasing polymerization time as a result of the gradual formation of a relatively high-molecular-weight , ethylene-rich fraction . the results are indicative of significant monomer diffusion effects in both homopolymerization and copolymerization . 
the formulation of the 4-butenyl end group in zirconocene with catalyzed propulene polymerization , was analyzed . the olefin polymerization with metallocene catalysts has attracted much academic and industrial research interest . the analysis of polymer chain ends provides key structural information for the determination of the chain transfer mechanisms in olefin polymerization . the catalyst solution was prepared in an inert atmosphere adding <nUm> mmol of RhCl(PPh <nUm> ) <nUm> in <nUm> ml of dry toluene . the evaluation of the intensity of unsaturated groups shows the percentage of 4-butenyl increases with respect to 2-butenyl in the treatment of the polymer with the hydride complex derived from RhCl(PPh <nUm> ) <nUm> . the results show that the mechanism of the formation of 4-butenyl chain ends may be the isomerization of cis 2-butenyl catalyzed by a zirconocene hydride complex formed in situ during polymerization . 
C1 - symmetric diastereoisomers of a zirconocene dichloride , SiMe2(3-benzylindenyl)(indenyl)ZrCl2 , known as catalyst precursors used to produce polypropy - lenes with similar molecular weights and tacticities , have been investigated in ethylene polymerization . activated by methylaluminoxane , they produce microstructurally different polymers : high - density polyethylene and linear low - density polyethylene , the latter characterized by the presence of ethyl branches . the formation of branches is relevant in the complex having a sterically more crowded ( inward ) site . A comparison with the complex without substituents , meso-SiMe2(indenyl) 2ZrCl2 , show that the presence of a benzyl group on only one of the two indenyl moieties can regulate the number of branches and the molecular weight of the macromolecule . actually , the unsubstituted complex is able to give double the number of branches and lower molecular weights , whereas the ci - symmetric disubstituted complexes previously reported generally give linear polyethylene . 
the impacts of propylene prepolymerization on ethylene / 1-hexene and ehylene / 1-octene copolymerization studies carried out with a catalyst comprising a zirconocene and MAO immobilized on a silica support were analyzed . the copolymerization of samples , following the prepolymerization , was carried out by the charging of the desired amount of the comonomer to the reactor , along with n-heptane and an ethylene pressure applied . the catalyst used was prepared by the impregnation of a silica support with a mixture of MAO and rac - et / ( ind ) 2ZrCl2 . results show that the application of a propylene prepolymerization was significantly increased in the subsequent ethylene polymerization . also , the prepolymerization of a silica - supported metallocene catalyst with propylene before ethylene / 1-hexene or ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization can lead to a narrowing of the CCD in the resulting copolymers . 
copolymerizations of norbornene with styrene were carried out with a catalytic system of anilido-imino nickel complex ( ArN = C7H2 4NAr)NiBr ( Ar = 2,6-dimethylphenyl ) and methylaluminoxane in toluene . the influence of the comonomer feed content and polymerization temperature on the conversion and composition of the copolymers with ( ArN = C7H2 4NAr)NiBr / methylaluminoxane was investigated . an increase in the initial styrene feed content led to an increase in the incorporated styrene content of the resulting copolymer . the determination of the reactivity ratios showed a much high reactivity for norbornene ( reactivity ratio for styrene = <nUm> , reactivity ratio for norbornene = <nUm> ) , which was consistent with a coordination mechanism . NMR analysis of the end groups further confirmed that the chain was initiated through a styrene secondary insertion or a norbornene insertion into Ni - H and terminated through b-H . elimination from an inserted styrene unit . 
this study was directed toward the cationic polymerization of tetrahydroindene ( i.e. , bicyclo[4.3.0]-2,9-nonadiene ) , a bicyclic conjugated diene monomer , with a series of lewis acids , especially focusing on the synthesis of high-molecular-weight polymers and subsequent hydrogenation for novel cycloolefin polymers with high service temperatures . EtAlCl2 or Cl4Sn induced an efficient and quantitative cationic polymerization of tetrahydroindene to afford polymers with relatively high molecular weights ( number - average molecular weight > <nUm> ) and 1,4-enchainment bicyclic main - chain structures . the subsequent hydrogenation of the obtained poly(tetrahydroindene) with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide resulted in a saturated alicyclic hydrocarbon polymer with a relatively high glass transition ( glass - transition temperature = <nUm> ° C ) and improved pyrolysis temperature ( <nUm> % weight loss at <nUm> ° C ) . the new diene monomer was randomly copolymerized with cyclopentadiene at various feed ratios in the presence of EtAlCl <nUm> to give novel cycloolefin copolymers , which were subsequently hydrogenated into alicyclic copolymers with variable glass - transition temperatures ( 70-220 ° C ) . 
the copolymerization of propylene and disubstituted diallylsilanes [ ( CH2 = CH-CH2-)2R2Si ( r = CH <nUm> or C6H5 ) ] was investigated with isoselective and syndioselective zirconocene catalysts with methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst . the syndioselective catalyst showed a higher reactivity for disubstituted diallylsilanes than the isoselective catalysts . diallyldimethylsilane was incorporated into the polymer chain via cyclization insertion preferentially and formed 3,5-disubstituted dimethylsilacyclohexane units in the polypropylene main chain . In the copolymerization with diallyldiphenylsilane , diallyldiphenylsilane was copolymerized via both cyclization insertion and 1,2-insertion , which formed a pendant allyl group . the structures of isolated silacyclohexane units , determined by 13C NMR and distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer spectroscopy , proved that the 1,2-insertion of diallylsilanes proceeded with enantiomorphic site control ; however , the diastereoselectivity of the cyclization reaction was independent of the stereoselectivity of the catalysts used , and cis-silacyclohexane units were mainly formed . 
vinylcyclohexane ( VCH ) was copolymerized with ethene and propene using methylaluminoxane - activated metallocene catalysts . the catalyst precursor for the ethene copolymerization was rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)ZrCl2 ( 1 ) . propene copolymerizations were further studied with Cs - symmetric isopropylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl)ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , C 1-symmetric ethylene(l-indenyl-2-phenyl-2-fluorenyl)ZrCl2 ( 3 ) , and " meso " -dimethylsilyl[3-benzylindenyl)(2-methylbenz[e]indenyl) ]ZrCl2 ( 4 ) . catalyst <nUm> produced a random ethene - VCH copolymer with very high activity and moderate VCH incorporation . the highest comonomer content in the copolymer was <nUm> mol % . catalysts <nUm> and <nUm> produced poly(propene-co- vinylcyclohexane ) with moderate to good activities [ up to <nUm> and <nUm> kg of polymer / ( mol of catalyst × h ) for <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ] under similar reaction conditions but with fairly low comonomer contents ( up to <nUm> and <nUm> % for <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ) . catalysts <nUm> and <nUm> , both bearing a fluorenyl moiety , gave propene - VCH copolymers with only negligible amounts of the comonomer . the homopolymerization of VCH was performed with <nUm> as a reference , and low-molar-mass isotactic polyvinylcyclohexane with a low activity was obtained . 
In this paper , the synthesis of isotactic polypropylenes ( i-PP ) modified with -OH groups in sides ( iPP-OH ) , by combination of polyinsertion awso - metallocene catalysis and ring opening of propene oxide ( PO ) , is described . i-PP sequences interrupted by isolated ethylene / p-methylstyrene units forms the backbone . this enchainment is obtained by controlled copolymerization of propene with ethylene and p-methylstyrene comonomers in the presence of rac-ethylenebis(1-indenyl)zirconium-dichloride / methylalumoxane system . the metallation reaction of the p-methyl group with sec-BuLi generates an anionic center that can be reacted with PO . the iPP-OH is the result of the monoaddition reaction of PO followed by hydrolysis with acidified methanol . by changing experimental conditions in the backbone synthesis , a tuned number of the functionalizable sites as well as polypropylene sequence lengths can be obtained . As a consequence , iPP samples with a different number of - OH groups for the backbone can be synthesized after the PO monoaddition reaction . 
this article reports a synthetic method for a norbornene-ethylene-styrene ( N-E-S ) terpolymer , which has not been well investigated so far , via incorporation of styrene ( S ) into vinyl-type norbornene-ethylene ( N-E ) copolymers catalyzed by a substituted ansa-fluorenylamidodimethyltitanium [Me2Si(3,6-t(Bu2Flu)(tBuN)]TiMe2 catalyst ( I ) activated with a [Ph3C][B(C6F5) <nUm> ] / Al(iBu)3 cocatalyst at room temperature in toluene . the resulting terpolymerization product contained the targeted N-E-S terpolymer and the contaminated homopolymers , which were then able to be completely removed by solvent fractionation techniques . while homopolystyrene was easily extracted by fractionation with methylethylketone as a soluble part , homopolyethylene and a trace amount of homopolynorbornene could be perfectly separated by fractionation with chloroform as insoluble parts . the detail characterizations of a chloroform - soluble polymer with gel permeation chromatography , nuclear magnetic resonance , and differential scanning calorimetry analyses proved that it contained a true N-E-S terpolymer with long N-E sequences incorporated with isolated or short styrene sequences . the homogeneity of the morphology together with a single glass transition temperature that proportionally decreased with the increase of the styrene contents indicated that the N-E-S terpolymer obtained in this work is a random poly-mer with an amorphous structure . 
the ring - opening polymerization of e-caprolactone ( e-CL ) and d-valerolactone ( d-VL ) using nine catalytic systems consisting of a combination of three C2V zirconocene complexes and three borate cocatalysts is discussed . the polymerizations proceed in a well - controlled manner , producing polymers with relatively high molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions . kinetic experiments of the polymerization of e-CL with the catalytic system Cp2ZrMe2 / B(C 6F5)3 ( 1 ) showed a linear dependence between polymerization yield and molecular weight with time , as well as between the molecular weight with the molar ratio of the monomer over the catalyst [e-CL] / [Zr] , indicating sufficient control of the polymerization reaction . the catalytic system ( 1 ) was utilized for the synthesis of well - defined block copolymers of MMA with e-CL and d-VL . all samples were characterized by size exclusion chroma - tography , nuclear magnetic resonance , and differential scanning calorimetry . 
the 2-[benzyl-(2-hydroxy-2-phenylethyl)-amino]-1-phenylethanol ligand ( 1-H2 ) prepared as a diastereomeric mixture or in racemic and meso forms , from known procedure , has been disodiated and complexed with ClZr <nUm> . the precatalysts ( mix-1-ZrCl2 , rac-1-ZrCl2 , and meso-1-ZrCl2 ) were used in combination with methylaluminoxane and found to be active for the polymerization of 1-hexene and 1-octene . the high molecular weight polyhexenes ( PHs ) and polyoctenes ( OsP ) thus obtained were isotactic in nature and showed a negligible amount of end groups arising from the chain termination reactions . In PHs and OsP , there was linear correlation in the modified arrhenius plot ( the natural logarithm of the number - average molecular weight vs. the reciprocal of the temperature ) , indicating the presence of a single active species . the enantiomerically pure titanium precatalyst (R,R)-1-TiCl2 ) , when employed for the polymerization of 1-hexene , was found to be active and the modified arrhenius plot showed linear dependence demonstrating presence of a single active species . the analogous titanium precatalysts { mix-1-TiCl2 , rac-1-TiCl2 , and meso-1-TiCl2 ) obtained from known procedures were also found to be active for the polymerization of 1-octene . the rac-1-TiCl2 precatalyst demonstrated a sigmoidal behavior in the modified arrhenius plot for the OsP and the mix-1-TiCl2 precatalyst showed an exponential type of behavior . the obtained OsP seemed to have small amounts of chain termination via b-hydride elimination alone . 
polymerization of vinyl chloride ( VC ) with titanium complexes containing Ti - OPh bond in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) catalysts was investigated . among the titanium complexes examined , Cp*Ti(OPh) <nUm> / MAO catalyst ( cp* ; pentamethylcyclopentadienyl , ph ; C 6H5 ) gave the highest activity for the polymerization of VC , but the polymerization rate was slow . from the kinetic study on the polymerization of VC with Cp*Ti(OPh)3 / MAO catalyst , the relationship between the Mn of the polymer and the polymer yields gave a straight line , and the line passed through the origin . the m w / Mn values of the polymer gradually decrease as a function of polymer yields , but the mw / Mn values were somewhat broad . this may be explained by a slow initiation in the polymerization of VC with Cp*Ti(OPh)3 / MAO catalyst . the results obtained in this study demonstrate that the molecular weight control of the polymers is possible in the polymerization of VC with the Cp*Ti(OPh)3 / MAO catalyst . 
mesoporous aluminas with average pore sizes of <nUm> - <nUm> nm were prepared by anodization of an aluminum film ( AAO ) , and by a sol - gel templating method ( TPL ) . In addition to a commercial alumina and sulfated TPL , the aluminas were used as supports for cyclopentadienyl zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl <nUm> ) and trimethyl(e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium ( Cp*ZrMe3 ) and tested in the polymerization of ethylene . the metallocenes supported on the alumina prepared with the templating method and its sulfated modification exhibited polymerization activities of <nUm> and <nUm> kgPE / ( molZr × h × bar ) , respectively , comparable to that obtained with silica - supported metallocenes ( <nUm> kg PE / ( molZr × h × bar ) ) . the acid site distribution of the aluminas was studied with FTIR and temperature programmed desorption ( TPD ) of pyridine , and also the amount of medium and strong acid sites was determined gravimetrically from the adsorption of pyridine . relative to the surface area , AAO with the highest amount of acid sites ( <nUm> mmolPY / mAAO2 ) adsorbed cp 2ZrCl2 and Cp*ZrMe3 the most . study of the polymers ' morphology with a scanning electron microscope revealed polyethylene nanofibers in all the polymer samples , also in those obtained from the reference polymerizations with homogeneous Cp2ZrCl2 and Cp*ZrMe3 . this finding suggests that a catalyst support with a tubular pore structure is not a prerequisite for the formation of polymer nanofibers . 
norbornene polymerizations proceeded in toluene with bis(jS-ketoamino) nickel (II) ( Ni[CH3C(O)CHC(NR)CH3J2 [ r = phenyl ( 1 ) or naphthyl ( 2 ) ] ) complexes as the catalyst precursors and the organo-Lewis compound tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [ BC6F5 <nUm> ] as a unique cocatalyst . the polymerization conditions , such as the cocatalyst / catalyst ratio ( B / Ni ) , catalyst concentration , monomer / catalyst ratio ( norbornene / Ni ) , polymerization temperature , and polymerization time , were studied in detail . both bis(ss-ketoamino)nickel(II) / B(C6F 5)3 catalytic systems showed noticeably high conversions and activities . the polymerization activities were up to <nUm> x <nUm> g of polymer / mol of Ni h for complex <nUm> / ( BC18F15 and <nUm> x <nUm> g of polymer / mol of Ni h for complex <nUm> / B(C 6F5)3 , and very high conversions of 90-95 % were maintained ; both polymerizations provided high-molecular-weight polynorbornenes with molecular weight distributions ( weight - average molecular weight / number - average molecular weight ) of <nUm> - <nUm> . the achieved polynorbornenes were confirmed to be vinyl-addition and atactic polymers through the analysis of fourier transform infrared , 1H NMR , and 13C NMR spectra , and the thermogravimetric analysis results showed that the polynorbornenes exhibited good thermal stability ( decomposition temperature > <nUm> ° C ) . 
poly(propylene-ran-1,3-butadiene) was synthesized using isospecific zirconocene catalysts and converted to telechelic isotactic polypropylene by metathesis degradation with ethylene . the copolymers obtained with isospecific C2 - symmetric zirconocene catalysts activated with modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) had 1,4-inserted butadiene units ( 1,4-BD ) and 1,2-inserted units ( 1,2-BD ) in the isotactic polypropylene chain . the selectivity of butadiene towards 1,4-BD incorporation was high up to <nUm> % using rac-dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( Cat-A ) / MMAO . the molar ratio of propylene to butadiene in the feed regulated the numberaverage molecular weight ( Mn ) and the butadiene contents of the polymer produced . metathesis degradations of the copolymer with ethylene were conducted with a CI6W / SnMe4 / propyl acetate catalyst system . the 1H NMR spectra before and after the degradation indicated that the polymers degraded by ethylene had vinyl groups at both chain ends in high selectivity . the analysis of the chain scission products clarified the chain end structures of the poly(propylene-ran-1,3-butadiene) . 
the influence of ligand structure on copolymerization properties of metallocene catalysts was elucidated with three C1 - symmetric methylalumoxane ( MAO ) activated zirconocene dichlorides , ethylene(1-(7 , 9)-diphenylcyclopenta-[a]-acenaphthadienyl-2-phenyl-2-cyclopentadienyl)ZrCl <nUm> ( 1 ) , ethylene(1-(7 , 9)-diphenylcyclopenta[a]-acenaphthadienyl-2- phenyl-2-fluorenyl)ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , and ethylene(1-(9)-fluorenyl-(R)1- phenyl-2-(1-indenyl)ZrCl2 ( 3 ) . polyethenes produced with <nUm> / MAO had considerable , ca. <nUm> % amount of trans-vinylene end groups , resulting from the chain end isomerization prior to the chain termination . when ethene was copolymerized with 1-hexene or 1-hexadecene using <nUm> / MAO , molar mass of the copolymers varied from high to moderate ( 531-116 kg / mol ) depending on the comonomer feed . At <nUm> % comonomer feed , ethene / 1-olefin copolymers with high hexene or hexadecene content ( around <nUm> % ) were achievable . In the series of catalysts , polyethenes with highest molar mass , up to <nUm> kg / mol , were obtained with sterically most crowded <nUm> / MAO , but the catalyst was only moderately active to copolymerize higher olefins . catalyst <nUm> / MAO produced polyethenes with extremely small amounts of trans-vinylene end groups and relatively low molar mass 1-hexene copolymers ( from <nUm> to <nUm> kg / mol ) with similar comonomer content as <nUm> . these results indicate that the catalyst structure , which favors chain end isomerization , is also capable to produce high molar mass 1-olefin copolymers with high comonomer content . In addition , an exceptionally strong synergetic effect of the comonomer on the polymerization activity was observed with catalyst <nUm> / MAO . 
norbornene polymerization using the commercially available and inexpensive catalyst system , cyclopentadienylzirconium trichloride ( CpZrCl3 ) and isobutyl-modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) , were carried out over a wide range of polymerization temperatures and monomer concentrations . for the CpZrCl <nUm> catalyst system activated by aluminoxane with a <nUm> mol % methyl group and a <nUm> mol % isobutyl group ( MMAO40 / <nUm> ) , the polymerization temperature and monomer concentration significantly affected the molecular weight ( m n ) of the obtained polymer and the catalytic activity . with an increase in the polymerization temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C , the catalytic activity and Mn increased , but these values dramatically decreased with the increasing polymerization temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C , meaning that the most suitable temperature was <nUm> ° C the CpZrCl 3ZMMAO40 / <nUm> ( [AlMZr] = <nUm> ) catalyst system with the [NB] of <nUm> mol L-1 at <nUm> ° C showed the highest activity of <nUm> kg molzr <nUm> h-1 and molecular weight of <nUm> g mol-1 . the polymerization using the CpZrCl3 / MMAPO <nUm> / <nUm> catalyst system proceeds through the vinyl addition mechanism to produce atactic polynorbornene , which was soluble in chloroform , toluene , and 1,2-dichlorobenzene , but insoluble in methanol . 
A novel catalyst system based on nickel (II) tetraphenylporphyrin ( Ni(II)TPP ) and methylaluminoxane for styrene polymerization was developed . this catalyst system has a high thermal stability and show fairly good activity . the obtained polystyrene ( PS ) was isotactic - rich atactic polymer by 13C NMR analysis , and its molecular weight distribution was rather narrow ( m w / Mn ≈ <nUm> , by GPC analysis ) . ESR revealed that Ni(II)TPP π cation radicals were formed in the polymerization and could remain in the resulting PS stably . the mechanism of the polymerization was discussed and a special coordination mechanism was proposed . the PS product containing Ni(II)TPP π cation radicals can be used as a potential functional material . 
C2 - symmetric group <nUm> metallocenes based catalysts ( rac - [ CH 2(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 ( 1 ) , rac-[CH2(1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 ( 2 ) and rac - [ CH 2(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]TiCl2 ( 3 ) ) are able to copolymerize styrene and 1,3-butadiene , to give products with high molecular weight . In agreement with symmetry properties of metallocene precatalysts , styrene homosequences are in isotactic arrangements . full determination of microstructure of copolymers was obtained by 13C NMR and FTIR analysis and it reveals that insertion of butadiene on styrene chain - end happens prevailingly with 1,4-trans configuration . In the butadiene homosequences , using zirconocene - based catalysts , the 1,4-trans arrangement is favored over 1,4-cis , but the latter is prevailing in the presence of titanocene ( 3 ) . diad composition analysis of the copolymers makes possible to estimate the reactivity ratios of copolymerization : zirconocenes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) produced copolymers having r1 × r2 = <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ( where <nUm> refers to styrene and <nUm> to butadiene ) ; while titanocene ( 3 ) gave tendencially blocky styrene-butadiene copolymers ( r1 × r2 = <nUm> ) . the copolymers do not exhibit crystallinity , even when they contain a high molar fraction of styrene . probably , comonomer homosequences are too short to crystallize ( ns <nUm> , in the copolymer at highest styrene molar fraction ) . 
ethylene-styrene ( or 4-methylstyrene ) co-oligomerization using various bis(diphenylphoshino)amine ligands in combination with chromium is discussed . GC analysis of the reaction mixture shows that various phenyl-hexene and phenyl-octene isomers are formed either through cotrimerization or cotetramerization . it seems that the more bulky ligands display lower selectivity to co-oligomerization and favor ethylene homo-oligomerization . subsequent copolymerization of the oligomerization reaction mixture using a metallocene polymerization catalyst results in a copolymer with a branched structure as indicated by crystaf and 13C NMR analysis . assignments of the 13C NMR spectrum are proposed from an APT NMR experiment combined with calculated NMR chemical shift data using additivity rules . an indication of the ability of the different co-oligomerization products to copolymerize into the polyethylene chain could be established from these assignments . unreacted styrene and the more bulky isomers , 3-phenyl-1-hexene and 3-phenyl-1-octene , are not readily incorporated while branches resulting from the other isomers present in the co-oligomerization reaction mixture are detected in the NMR spectrum . 
we inclusively investigated polymerization behavior and structure of co-polymer in the copolymerization of propylene and alkylaluminum - protected polar allyl monomers . the control of the arrangement of polar group in the copolymer was discussed . it was proved that the location of polar group could be controlled by zirconocene catalyst and a kind of polar monomer . the indenyl or the 2-methylindenyl ligands of zirconocene were favored to produce end - functionalized polymers . it was also found that the trimethylaluminum- protected allylamine and triisobutylaluminum - protected allylmercaptan had superior ability in the synthesis of end - functionalized polypropylene . on the other hand , the 2-methyl-4-phenylindenyl ligand produced the copolymers containing both the end - polar unit and inner - polar unit at the polymer chains . terpolymerization of propylene , polar allyl monomer , and 5-hexen-1-ol was also conducted . the NMR study of the terpolymer revealed that both the 5-hexen-1-ol and the polar allyl monomer were incorporated into the polymer chain . it has also become apparent that the polar allyl monomer units predominantly occupied the chain end , while the 5-hexen-1-ol units were located at the inner of main chain . consequently , we have achieved the synthesis of functionalized polypropylene in which the arrangement of polar group was precisely controlled . 
A series of substituted benzaldehydes were investigated as initiators for the living ring - opening polymerization ( LROP ) of e-caprolactone ( CL ) mediated by titanium alkoxides obtained from the Cp2TiCl - catalyzed single electron transfer ( SET ) reduction of the carbonyl group following the in situ reduction of Cp2TiCl2 with Zn . the aldehyde initiation was demonstrated ( NMR ) by the presence of the initiator derived fragment on the polycaprolactone ( PCL ) chain end . the effect of the nature of the aldehyde functionality ( R-Ph-CHO , r = H , Cl , PhCH2O , NMe <nUm> , CH3O , NO2 , and CHO ) , reagent ratios ( [CL] / [aldehyde] = <nUm> / <nUm> to <nUm> / <nUm> , [aldehyde] / [Cp2TiCl2] = <nUm> / <nUm> to <nUm> / <nUm> , and [Cp2TiCl2] / Zn ] = <nUm> / <nUm> to <nUm> / <nUm> ) , and temperature ( T = 75-120 ° C ) was investigated over a wide range of values to reveal a living polymerization in all cases with an optimum observed at <nUm> ° C with typical stoichiometric ratios of [CL] / [aldehyde] / [ Cp2TiCl <nUm> ] / [Zn] = <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> . 
6-Benzimidazolylpyridyl-2-carboximidic half - titanocene complexes , Cp'TiLCl ( cp' = CH , MeC5H <nUm> , C5Me5 , L = 6-benzimidazolylpyridine-2- carboxylimidic , C1 - C13 ) , were synthesized and characterized along with single - crystal x-ray diffraction . the half - titanocene chlorides containing substituted cyclopentadienyl groups , especially pentamethylcyclopentadienyl groups were more stable , while those without substituents on the cyclopentadienyl groups were easily transformed into their dimeric oxo-bridged complexes , (CpTiL)2O ( C14 and C15 ) . In the presence of excessive amounts of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) , all half - titanocene complexes showed high catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization . the substituents on the cp groups affected the catalytic behaviors of the complexes significantly , with less substituents favoring increased activities and higher molecular weights of the resultant polye thy lenes . effects of reaction conditions on catalytic behaviors were systematically investigated with catalytic systems of mononuclear C1 and dimeric C14 . with C1 / MAO , large MAO amount significantly increases the catalytic activity , while the temperature only has a slight effect on the productivity . In the case of C14 / MA0 catalytic system , temperature above <nUm> ° C and Al / Ti value higher than <nUm> were necessary to observe good catalytic activities . In both systems , higher reaction temperature and low cocatalyst amount gave the polyethylenes with higher molecular weights . 
A series of 6-(benzimidazol-2-yl)-N-organylpyridine-2-carboxamide were synthesized and transformed into 6-benzimidazolylpyridine-2-carboxylimidate as dianionic tridentate ligands . bis(2-(6-methylpyridin-2-yl)-benzimidazolyl) titanium dichloride ( C1 ) and titanium bis(6-benzimidazolylpyridine-2- carboxylimidate ) ( C2-C8 ) were synthesized in acceptable yields . these complexes were systematically characterized by elemental and NMR analyses . crystallographic analysis revealed the distorted octahedral geometry around titanium in both complexes C1 and C4 . using MAO as cocatalyst , all complexes exhibited from good to high catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization . the neutral bis(6-benzimidazolylpyridine-2-carboxylimidate)titanium ( C2-C8 ) showed high catalytic activities and good stability for prolonged reaction time and elevated reaction temperature ; however , C1 showed a short lifetime in catalysis as being observed at very low activity after <nUm> min . the elevated reaction temperature enhanced the productivity of polyethylenes with low molecular weights , whereas the reaction with higher ethylene pressure resulted in better catalytic activity and resultant polyethylenes with higher molecular weights . At higher ratio of MAO to titanium precursor , the catalytic system generated better activity with producing polyethylenes with lower molecular weights . 
ethylene / styrene copolymerizations using Cp'TiCl2(O-2,6- iPr2C6H3 ) [ cp' = cp* ( C5Me5 , <nUm> ) , 1,2,4-Me3C5H2 ( 2 ) , tert-BuC5H4 ( 3 ) ] - MAO catalyst systems were explored under various conditions . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> exhibited both high catalytic activities ( activity : 504-6810 kg - polymer / mol-Ti h ) and efficient styrene incorporations at <nUm> , <nUm> ° C ( ethylene <nUm> atm ) , affording relatively high molecular weight poly (ethylene-co-styrene)s with unimodal molecular weight distributions as well as with uniform styrene distributions ( mw = <nUm> - <nUm> × <nUm> , mw / Mn = <nUm> - <nUm> , styrene <nUm> - <nUm> mol % ) . by - productions of syndiotactic polystyrene ( SPS ) were observed , when the copolymerizations by 1-3-MAO catalyst systems were performed at <nUm> , <nUm> ° C ( ethylene <nUm> atm , SPS <nUm> - <nUm> wt % ) ; the ratios of the copolymer / SPS were affected by the polymerization temperature , the [styrene] / [ethylene] feed molar ratios in the reaction mixture , and by both the cyclopentadienyl fragment ( cp' ) and anionic ancillary donor ligand ( L ) in Cp'TiCl2(L) ( L = Cl , O-2,6-iPr2C 6H3 or N = CtBu2 ) employed . co-presence of the catalytically - active species for both the copolymerization and the homopolymerization was thus suggested even in the presence of ethylene ; the ratios were influenced by various factors ( catalyst precursors , temperature , styrene / ethylene feed molar ratio , etc. ) . 
half titanocenes (CpCH2CH2O)TiCl2 ( 1 ) , (CpCH2CH2OCH3)TiCl3 ( 2 ) , and CpTiCl3 ( 3 ) , activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) were tested in copolymerization of ethylene with internal olefins such as cyclopentene . all the catalysts were able to give incorporation of cyclopentene in polyethylene matrix . 13C NMR analysis of obtained copolymers showed that the catalytic systems have low regiospecificity . In fact , in ethylene-cyclopentene copolymers , cyclic olefin inserts with both <nUm> and 1,3-enchainment . x-ray powder diffraction analysis of these copolymers confirmed that <nUm> inserted cyclopentene units are excluded from crystalline phase , whereas 1,3cyclopentene units are included , giving rise to expansion of unit cell of crystalline polyethylene . titanium - based catalysts were investigated also in the copolymerization of ethylene with e and z-2-butene . only complex ( 1 ) was able to give copolymers and 13C NMR analysis of products showed 2-3 , 1-3 , and 1-2 insertion of 2-butene . differential scanning calorimetry analysis displayed that ethylene-cyclopentene , as well as ethylene-2-butene , copolymers are crystalline and their melting point decreases by increasing the comonomer content . 
highly filled polyethylene (PE)-based nanocomposites were obtained by in situ polymerization technique . an organically modified montmorillonite , cloisite ® <nUm> A ( C15A ) , was previously treated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) to form a supported cocatalyst ( C15A / MA0 ) before being contacted with a zirconocene catalyst . the main features of C15A / MA0 intermediates were studied by elemental analysis , TGA , TGA - FTIR , WAXD , and TEM . MAO reacts with the clay , replaces most of the organic surfactant within the clay galleries and destroys the typical crystrallographic order of the nanoclay . the catalytic activity in the presence of C15A / MAO is higher than in ethylene polymerization without any inorganic filler and increases with MAO supportation time . this indicates that part of the polymer chains grows within the clay galleries , separates them , and makes it possible to tune the final morphology of the composites . the polymerization results and the influence of C15A pretreatment and polymerization conditions on thermal and morphological properties of the hybrid PE / C15A nanocomposites are presented . 
the copolymerization of ethylene ( e ) and norbornene ( NB ) was investigated using the commercially available and inexpensive catalyst system , cyclopentadienylzirconium trichloride (CpZrCl3)Zisobutyl-modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) , at a moderate polymerization temperature in toluene . for the CpZrCl3 catalyst system activated by aluminoxane with a <nUm> mol % methyl group and a <nUm> mol % isobutyl group ( MMAO ) , the quantities of the charged NB and the polymerization temperature significantly affected the molecular weights , polydispersities , and NB contents of the obtained copolymers and the copolymerization activities in all the experiments . As the charged NB increased and thereby the NB / e molar ratio increased , the NB content in the copolymer increased and reached a maximum value of <nUm> mol % . the CpZrCl <nUm> / MMAO ( [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> ) catalyst system with the [NB] of <nUm> mol L-1 and ethylene of <nUm> MPa at <nUm> ° C showed the highest activity of <nUm> kg molZr.-1 h-1 and molecular weight of <nUm> g mol-1 . the 13C NMR analysis showed that the CpZrCl3 / MMAO catalyst system produced the E-NB random copolymer with a number of NB homosequences such as the NN dyad and NNN triad . 
A series of imino-indolate half - titanocene chlorides , Cp'Ti(L)Cl <nUm> ( C1-C7 : cp' = CH , MeC 5H4 , C5Me5 , L = imino-indolate ligand ) , were synthesized by the reaction of Cp'TiCl3 with sodium imino-indolates . all complexes were characterized by elemental analysis , 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy . moreover , the molecular structures of two representative complexes C4 and C6 were confirmed by single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . on activation with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , these complexes showed good catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization ( up to <nUm> × <nUm> g / mol(Ti)h ) and ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization ( up to <nUm> × <nUm> g / mol(Ti ). h ) , producing polyolefins with high molecular weights ( for polyethylene up to <nUm> kg / mol , and for poly(ethylen-co-1-hexene) up to <nUm> kg / mol ) . half - titanocenes containing ligands with alkyl substituents showed higher catalytic activities , whereas the half - titanocenes bearing methyl substituents on the cyclopentadienyl groups showed lower productivities , but produced polymers with higher molecular weights . moreover , the copolymerization of ethylene and methyl 10-undecenoate was demonstrated using the C1 / MAO catalytic system . the functionalized polyolefins obtained contained about <nUm> mol % of methyl 10-undecenoate units and were fully characterized by several techniques such as FT-IR , 1H NMR , 13C NMR , DSC , TGA and GPC analyses . 
A series of amino-pyrrolide ligands ( 1-4a ) and their derivatives aminothiophene ligand ( 5a ) , amino-indole ligand ( 6a ) were prepared . chromium catalysts , which were generated in situ by mixing the ligands with ClCr 3(thf)3 in toluene , were tested for ethylene polymerization . the preliminary screening results revealed that the tridentate amino-pyrrolide ligands containing soft pendant donor , 3a , 4a / ClCr 3(thf)3 systems displayed high catalytic activities towards ethylene polymerization in the presence of modified methyaluminoxane . the electronic and steric factors attached to the ligand backbone significantly affected both the catalyst activity and the polymer molecular weight . complex 4b was obtained by the reaction of CrCl3(thf)3 with one equivalent of the lithium salts of 4a , which was the most efficient ligand among the tested ones . the effect of polymerization parameters such as cocatalyst concentration , ethylene pressure , reaction temperature , and time on polymerization behavior were investigated in detail . the resulting polymer obtained by 4b display wax - like and possess linear structure , low molecular weight , and unimodal distribution . 
this communication reports the development of an efficient three - component visible light sensitive photoinitiator system for the cationic ring - opening photo - polymerization of epoxide monomers and epoxide functional oligomers . the photoinitiator system consists of camphorquinone in combination with a benzyl alcohol to generate free radicals by the absorption of visible light . subsequently , the radicals participate in the free radical chain induced decomposition of a diaryliodonium salt . the resulting strong bronsted acid derived from this process catalyzes the cationic ring - opening polymerization of a variety of epoxide substrates .

structurally well - defined end - functionalized syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) can be prepared by conducting a simultaneous selective chain transfer reaction during the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene in the presence of vinylsilanes . the production of vinylsilane end - capped sPS involves a unique selective chain transfer pathway via the incorporation of a terminal vinylsilane unit at the polymer chain end by 2,1-insertion . this unusual insertion pattern situates the bulky silyl functional group at a closer b-position from the active catalyst center , thus deactivating the propagating chain by a steric jam between the vinylsilane end group and the active catalyst . subsequently , chain releasing by hydrogen addition ( in the presence of H ) or by b-elimination ( in the absence of H ) can take place , which leads to the production of end - functionalized sPS with precise controls of stereoregularity and of the location of functionality .

A new approach for facilitating microstructural controls for syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) , in which , styrene polymerization is conducted in the presence of cyclic olefins and hydrogen , is proposed . detailed structural analyses revealed that cyclic olefins are not incorporated into the polystyrene main chain ; instead , they are capable of interrupting the chain propagation processes by binding onto the active catalyst to form a cyclic - olefin - coordinated active site . thus , in the presence of hydrogen , chain transfer by hydrogen addition occurs selectively , which leads to the generation of drastically lower molecular weight sPS with a narrower range of molecular weight distribution . chain end structural analyses of the resulting polymers revealed that styrene polymerization under theses conditions involves a selective chain transfer pathway for providing styrene polymers with uniform chain end structures . A unique method for inducing a selective chain transfer reaction by using non-incorporated cyclic olefins to regulate the chain reaction mechanism is demonstrated .

A series of poly(ethylene-co-octadecene) and poly(ethylene-co-norbornene) copolymers were prepared , and their properties were characterized by NMR , differential scanning calorimetry , and mechanical analysis . the results show that this system produced poly(ethylene-co-octadecene) copolymers with a branching content of about <nUm> mol % . however , upon increasing the comonomer concentration , a drastic reduction in the Mn of the product is observed concomitant with an increase in comonomer incorporation . this leads to a gradual decrease in young 's modulus and stress at break , indicating an increase in the " softness " of the copolymer . In the case of copolymerizations of ethylene and norbornene , the catalytic system ( <nUm> / MAO ) shows a substantial decrease in reactivity in the presence of norbornene and generates copolymer chains in which 5-10 mol % norbornene is in blocks . we also observe that ethylene norbornene copolymers exhibit a high degree of alternating insertions ( close to <nUm> % ) , as determined by NMR spectroscopy . 
the free radical promoted cationic polymerization cyclohexene oxide ( CHO ) , was achieved by visible light irradiation ( uinc = 430-490 nm ) of methylene chloride solutions containing thioxanthone - fluorene carboxylic acid ( TX - FLCOOH ) or thioxanthone-carbazole ( TX-C ) and cationic salts , such as diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate ( Ph2I+PFa6- ) or silver hexafluorophosphate ( Ag+PFa6- ) in the presence of hydrogen donors . A feasible initiation mechanism involves the photogeneration of ketyl radicals by hydrogen abstraction in the first step . subsequent oxidation of ketyl radicals by the oxidizing salts yields bronsted acids capable of initiating the polymerization of CHO . In agreement with the proposed mechanism , the polymerization was completely inhibited by 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1- oxy and di-2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine as radical and acid scavengers , respectively . additionally polymerization efficiency was directly related to the reduction potential of the cationic salts , that is , Ag+PF 6- ( eared1 / <nUm> = + <nUm> V ) was found to be more efficient than Ph2I+PF6- ( ered <nUm> / <nUm> = <nUm> V ) . In addition to CHO , vinyl monomers such as isobutyl vinyl ether and n-vinyl carbazole , and a bisepoxide such as 3,4-epoxycyclohexyl- 3',4'-epoxycyclohexene carboxylate , were polymerized in the presence of TX - FLCOOH or TX-C and iodonium salt with high efficiency .

A series of heteroligated (salicylaldiminato)(b-enaminoketonato) titanium complexes [ 3-tBu-2-OC6H3CH = N(C 6F5 ) ] [ PhN = C(CF3)CHCRO]TiCl2 [ 3a : r = ph , 3b : r = C6H4Cl(p) , 3c : r = C6H 4OMe(p) , 3d : r = C6H4Me(p) , 3e : r = C 6H4Me(o) ] were synthesized and characterized . molecular structures of 3b and 3c were further confirmed by x-ray crystallographic analyses . In the presence of modified methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst , these unsymmetric catalysts displayed favorable ability to incorporate 5-vinyl-2-norbornene ( VNB ) and 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene ( ENB ) into the polymer chains , affording high - molecular weight copolymers with high - comonomer incorporations and alternating sequence under the mild conditions . the comonomer concentration in the polymerization medium had a profound influence on the molecular weight distribution of the resultant copolymer .

DFT computations have been performed to investigate the mechanism of H - assisted chain transfer strategy to functionalize polypropylene via Zr - catalyzed copolymerization of propylene and p-methylstyrene ( pMS ) . the study unveils the following : ( i ) propylene prefers 1,2-insertion over 2,1-insertion both kinetically and thermodynamically , explaining the observed 1,2-insertion regioselectivity for propylene insertion . ( ii ) the 2,1-inserion of pMS is kinetically less favorable but thermodynamically more favorable than 1,2-insertion . the observation of 2,1-insertion pMS at the end of polymer chain is due to thermodynamic control and that the barrier difference between the two insertion modes become smaller as the chain length becomes longer . ( iii ) the pMS insertion results in much higher barriers for subsequent either propylene or pMS insertion , which causes deactivation of the catalytic system . ( iv ) small H can react with the deactivated [Zr]-pMS-PPn facilely , which displace functionalized pMS - PPn chain and regenerate [Zr]H active catalyst to continue copolymerization . the effects of counterions are also discussed .

copolymerization of ethylene and isoprene ( ip ) catalyzed by Cl4Ti / MgCl2-Al(i-C4H9)3 catalyst was systematically studied . homopolymer of ethylene and ip were synthesized under the same conditions for making comparisons . proton nuclear magnetic resonance was employed to characterize chain structure of the copolymer . influences of ip concentration , molar ratio of cocatalyst to Ti and reaction temperature on the copolymerization activity and copolymer chain structure were investigated . the copolymerization activity was evidently lowered by increasing ip concentration , and the ip content in copolymer was rather low under reaction conditions leading to higher activity . insertions of ip in polymer chain showed rather high regioselectivity for 1,4-connections ( > <nUm> % ) and medium to high stereoselectivity for trans-1,4 - isomer ( > <nUm> % ) under typical conditions , but the regio and stereoselectivities tended to decrease with decrease in ip concentration and increase in Al / Ti ratio . melting temperature of the copolymer decreased with increase of ip content , indicating incorporation of ip units in most of the copolymer chains . this work has proved feasibility of introducing small amount of ip units with high trans-1,4-stereoselectivity into ethylene / isoprene copolymer chains by catalyzed copolymerization with Cl2Mg - supported ziegler – natta catalysts . the copolymer is expected to be a promising candidate of easily degradable film or packaging materials . © <nUm> wiley periodicals , inc.

polyethylene ( PE ) fibers were prepared by ethylene extrusion polymerization with an MCM-41 - supported titanocene catalyst . the morphological and mechanical properties of these nascent PE fibers were investigated . three levels of fibrous morphologies were identified in the fiber samples through an extensive scanning electron microscopy study . extended - chain PE nanofibrils with diameters of about <nUm> nm were the major morphological units present in the fiber structure . the nanofibrils were parallel - packed into individual microfibers with diameters of about 1-30 mm . the microfibers were further aggregated irregularly into fiber aggregates and bundles . In comparison with commercial PE fibers and data reported in the literature , the individual microfibers produced in situ via ethylene extrusion polymerization without posttreatment exhibited a high tensile strength ( <nUm> - <nUm> GPa ) , a low tensile modulus ( <nUm> - <nUm> GPa ) , and a high elongation at break ( 8.5-20 % ) at <nUm> ° C . the defects in the alignment of the nanofibrils were believed to be the major reason for the low modulus values . it was also found that a slight tensile drawing could increase the microfiber strength and modulus . 
A procedure is developed for modeling differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) melting curves of linear polyethylene and ethylene / a-olefin copolymers produced with single - center and multicenter polymerization catalysts . the modeling demonstrates that the use of the statistical description of random copolymers and the introduction of several assumptions about the crystallization pattern of long ethylene blocks in ethylene copolymers are sufficient for the representation of most characteristic features of DSC melting curves of the polymers . this type of modeling can be applied to ethylene / a-olefin copolymers containing up to <nUm> mol % of an a-olefin . the approach is , in principle , similar to modeling the results of other analytical techniques used for the characterization of copolymer heterogeneity , such as tref and crystaf . 
ethylene polymerization was performed with the O2Ti nanotube supported metallocene catalytic system . the effects of Al / Zr molar ratio and time in polymerization on the catalytic behavior of the catalysts and the morphologies of the polyethylene were investigated . the nanofibers , floccules and nanosheets of polyethylene were obtained by controlling the polymerization conditions . because the nanotubes confined the direction of propagation of the polyethylene chains , nanofibers were attained by extrusion polymerization , while the amount of floccules increased with extended polymerization time and nanosheets were mainly produced at high Al / Zr molar ratios . the possible correlation between the polymerization conditions and polyethylene morphologies was elucidated . ethylene polymerization was performed with the O2Ti nanotube supported metallocene catalytic system . the effects of Al / Zr molar ratio and time in polymerization on the catalytic behavior of the catalysts and the morphologies of the polyethylene were investigated . the nanofibers , floccules and nanosheets of polyethylene were obtained by controlling the polymerization conditions . because the nanotubes confined the direction of propagation of the polyethylene chains , nanofibers were attained by extrusion polymerization , while the amount of floccules increased with extended polymerization time and nanosheets were mainly produced at high Al / Zr molar ratios . the possible correlation between the polymerization conditions and polyethylene morphologies was elucidated . copyright 
solid state 1H NMR line - shape analysis and ( double quantum ) DQ 1H NMR experiments have been used to investigate the segmental and polymer chain dynamics as a function of temperature for a series of thermosetting epoxy resins produced using different diamine curing agents . In these thermosets , chemical crosslinks introduce topological constraints leading to residual stresses during curing . materials containing a unique ferrocene - based diamine ( FcDA ) curing agent were evaluated to address the role of the ferrocene fluxional process on the atomic - level polymer dynamics . At temperatures above the glass transition temperature ( tg ) , the DQ 1H NMR experiments provided a measure of the relative effective crosslink and entanglement densities for these materials and revealed significant polymer chain dynamic heterogeneity in the FcDA - cured thermosets . © <nUm> wiley periodicals , inc.

KGaA , WeinheimDynamic and static behavior of the intramolecular π – π interactions between ethylene moieties in diethanodihydronaphthalene ( <nUm> a ) and the derivatives ( <nUm> a – <nUm> a ) are elucidated by employing QTAIM - DFA ( QTAIM dual functional analysis ) , which we proposed recently . total electron energy densities hb(rc) are plotted versus hb(rc) – vb(rc) / <nUm> at bond critical points ( BCPs ) for the interactions in question in QTAIM - DFA , where vb(rc) are potential energy densities at BCPs . after analysis of the plots , the π – π interactions in <nUm> a – <nUm> a are all classified by the pure closed shell interactions and characterized to have the vdW nature with MP2 / 6-311G(d) , except for those in <nUm> a – <nUm> a , where the ethylene moieties in <nUm> a are replaced by benzene moieties . the character in <nUm> a – <nUm> a is predicted to have the typical-HB ( hydrogen bond ) nature without covalency , although that in <nUm> a and <nUm> a seems close to the border area between the two . indeed , the twisted structures were predicted for <nUm> a – <nUm> a with MP2 / 6-311G(d) , but the observed non-twisted structures of <nUm> a – <nUm> a were better reproduced with MP2 / 6-311G(3d) . the typical-HB nature without covalency was additionally predicted for the interactions between ethylene and benzene moieties in <nUm> a with MP2 / 6-311G(3d) , maybe due to somewhat shorter C … C distances predicted for the interactions in question . the interaction in TS is also discussed exemplified by <nUm> a ( c2v ) .

KGaA , weinheim the interaction of the titanadihydrofuran metallacycles Cp2Ti[e2-C(SiMe3) = C(Ph)-C(Me)2O ] ( 1 ) and Cp2Ti[e2-C(SiMe3) = C(Ph) - CH(Ph)O ] ( 2 ) with iBu2AlH in n-hexane at <nUm> ° C yields <nUm> : <nUm> complexes Cp2Ti[e2-C(SiMe3) = C(Ph)-C(Me)2O](iBu2AlH) ( 4 ) and Cp2Ti[e2-C(SiMe3) = C(Ph)-CH(Ph)O](iBu2AlH) ( 5 ) respectively . according to x-ray diffraction data , the iBu2AlH molecule in <nUm> is coordinated by its aluminium centre with the oxygen atom whereas the hydride hydrogen atom of the iBu2AlH forms a bridge with the titanium . As a result of the complexation with iBu2AlH , the Ti − O and Ti - C(SiMe3) bonds of the starting <nUm> are strongly elongated . an analogous <nUm> : <nUm> adduct ( 11 ) is formed in the interaction of iBu2AlH with the zirconadihydrofuran derivative Cp2Zr[e2-C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3)-C(Me)2O ] ( 3 ) . like the Ti − O and Ti - C(SiMe3) bonds in <nUm> , the Zr − O and Zr - C(SiMe3) bonds in <nUm> are considerably elongated as a result of the coordination with iBu2AlH . the reaction of <nUm> with EtAlCl2 gives a complex , Cp2Ti[e2-C(SiMe3) = C(Ph)-C(Me)2O](EtAlCl2) ( 8 ) , in which the organoaluminium compound is also coordinated by its aluminium centre with the oxygen atom . this leads to a strong elongation of the Ti − O bond . the C − O bond of the metallacycle in <nUm> is noticeably elongated as well but the Ti - C(SiMe3) bond length even somewhat shortens . complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> are capable of catalysing ring - opening polymerization of [?]-caprolactone . the highest activity is exhibited by complexes <nUm> and <nUm> .

KGaA , Weinheim.In the presence of Me3SiCl , Ti(OR)4 or CpTiX3 ( x = O-i-Pr or Cl ) is reduced by Mg powder in THF to gradually generate a specific low - valent titanium ( LVT ) species that mediates several synthetic reactions . the LVT - catalyzed C-O bond - cleaving reactions of allyl and propargyl ethers and esters generate parent alcohols and carboxylic acids , respectively . o-allyl and propargyl carbamates are also readily deprotected by the LVT to afford parent amines . In addition , the respective reductive N-S or O-S bond cleavage of sulfonamides or sulfonyl esters mediated by the LVT was developed as a novel facile deprotection method . the reagent catalyzes intra- and intermolecular alkyne or alkyne / nitrile cycloaddition to produce substituted benzenes and pyridines , while epoxides and oxetanes are reduced to alcohols via an LVT - mediated homolytic ring opening . the McMurry coupling of aryl aldehydes and ketones proceeds with the LVT under homogeneous and mild reaction conditions and is effective for the polymerization of aromatic dialdehydes , generating conjugated polymers . finally , imino-pinacol coupling of imines is mediated by the LVT to provide 1,2-diamines .

polymerization of vinyl chloride ( VC ) with a Cp*Ti(OPh) <nUm> / MAO catalyst in toluene was investigated . the polymerization rate was lower than that in CCl2H2 , and the mm triad concentration of the PVC obtained in toluene was somewhat higher than that of the PVC obtained in CCl2H2 . As the polymerization in toluene proceeded at a considerable rate , a kinetic study of this polymerization was undertaken . the polymer yield increased with reaction time , and the molecular weight of the polymer increased with increasing polymer yield . the mw / Mn ratio of the polymer decreased with increasing polymerization temperature . the initiator efficiency of the catalyst was low at the initial stage of the polymerization in toluene , but it reached nearly <nUm> % when the polymerization was carried out for more than <nUm> h . the control of both the molecular weight of PVC and its main - chain structure was found to be possible in the polymerization of VC with the Cp*Ti(OPh)3 / MAO catalyst in toluene . 
branches are an important aspect of the structure of real polyethylene . branches can be short ( me , et ) or longer ; long - chain branches ( LCB , > <nUm> carbons ) , in particular , are important because they can have a dramatic effect on polymer properties . In this review , we summarize mechanistic information from organometallic and computational chemistry and use this to examine the most probable sources of each type of branch . short branches can be introduced deliberately by copolymerization with an a-olefin ( possibly formed in situ from ethene ) . me branches may be formed by one-carbon chain walking and propagation , and / or from insertion of an oligomer / macromer in an M-Me bond formed via chain transfer to the cocatalyst [ me 3Al or methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) ] . et branches are most likely formed through b-hydrogen transfer to ethene , followed immediately by reinsertion of the newly formed macromer . LCBs have usually been ascribed to reinsertion of macromers . however , certain catalysts exhibit LCB formation patterns that are hard to reconcile with this model , and a ' two - monomer ' model was recently proposed to explain the observations for these systems . In this review , we present an alternative explanation ( chain walking ) that would fit the same facts for these catalysts .

A series of supported zirconocenes was prepared by grafting sequentially Cp2ZrCl2 ( cp = cyclopentadienyl ) and (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 on to silica . the addition order and molar ratio of the two catalysts were varied . the grafted metal content was shown to be coherent between the two techniques and was between <nUm> and <nUm> wt % Zr / O2Si . the steric effect played by the ligand influences the final zirconocene grafted content . No influence of the grafting order was observed . nevertheless , catalyst systems in which (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 was either immobilized in the first place or at a higher molar ratio were shown to be more active in ethylene polymerization . extended x-ray absorption fine structure analysis in the Zr - edge showed that systems bearing cp 2ZrCl2 and (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 in a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio afforded a more disoriented system . according to electron probe microanalysis , the metal distribution in the catalyst particle was more uniform than that resulting from the immobilization of solely ( nBuCp ) 2ZrCl2 on silica . metal contents in supported zirconocene catalysts were comparatively determined by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and rutherford backscattering spectrometry .

the effect of the structure and surface properties of support material on metallocene ( zirconocene chloride ) adsorption and catalyst activity in ethene polymerization was studied . commercial grace silica , mesoporous silicate , MCM-41 , and aluminium - modified MCM-41 were used as supports . the highest amount of zirconocene dichloride was adsorbed on Al - modified MCM-41 ( Si / Al = <nUm> ) , providing the most reactive sites for attachment of the active component on the support surface . the 13C-CPMAS NMR studies proved that Cp2ZrCl2 is bound to the support surface . also the highest activity in ethene polymerization was obtained using this support . 
we studied a ZSM-5 zeolite as metallocene support for ethylene polymerization . we transformed the Na-ZSM-5 into H-ZSM-5 . after the cation exchange , the zeolite was calcined at three different temperatures . characterization of the material indicated that by means of the calcination procedure it is possible to produce dealuminization with an increase in extraframework aluminum ( EFAL ) . we prepared zirconocene - supported catalysts on zeolitic supports using two preparation methods . the higher activity was observed with the zirconocene supported on ZSM-5 pre-treated at <nUm> ° C . we think that the dealuminization process generates an increase in EFAL . this EFAL is responsible for the higher activity .

while a growing body of literature describes FLP adducts of diamagnetic unsaturated substrates such as alkenes , alkynes and heterocumulenes such as carbon dioxide , capture of the diatomic radical nitric oxide ( NO ) by intramolecular phosphane / borane FLPs gives a newfamily of radical frustrated lewis pair adducts.Capture ofNO results in heterocycleswith newP-NandB-Nbonds featuring a spin densityUmpolung of NO to give FLP-NO species that possess significant O - centered radical reactivity . use of these radical FLP-NO species in C-H functionalization chemistry via H - atom abstractsion / radical recombination sequences as well as deployment in nitroxide mediated polymerization of alkenes indicates a rich and diverse chemistry for FLP-NO species . an alternative , complementary strategy to generate radical FLPs involves the use of transition metal centers with unpaired electrons as the lewis acid component of an FLP in conjunction with a tethered but hindered lewis base .

In the late 1980s , our research on the functionalization of polyolefins was inspired by the development of homogeneous , single - site metallocene catalysts that showed excellent copolymerization capabilities and a well - controlled polymerization mechanism . we were curious to know how to apply this newly available technology to the direct polymerization ( in-reactor ) process to circumvent the inevitable deactivation of the transition metal cationic active site by functional ( polar ) groups containing basic O , N , and halides . throughout the past two decades , we have developed an effective approach that is centered on specially designed " reactive " comonomers and chain transfer agents . these can deliver three essential properties during the polymerization process : ( 1 ) stability ( no side reaction ) of the active site ; ( 2 ) solubility in the polymerization media for effective incorporation ; and ( 3 ) versatility for interconversion to desirable functional groups under mild reaction conditions after polymerization ( preferably a one - pot process ) . with the conjunction of suitable metallocene catalysts , a broad range of polyolefins with " reactive " sites in the side chains or chain end were prepared , and the incorporated reactive groups were interconverted into functional groups to form side-chain-or chain - end - functionalized polyolefins . some active sites were also transformed into " living " radical or anionic initiator to initiate graft-from polymerization of polar monomers to obtain polyolefin graft and block copolymers ( such as PP-g-PMMA and PP-b-PMMA ) . the resulting functional polyolefins show many desirable properties and applications . this chapter focuses on applications in the area of energy storage . specifically , I will discuss the usage of new functional polypropylene polymers in the formation of dielectric thin films in capacitors that show significantly higher energy and power densities . 
the development of ansa - metallocene catalysts is considered along several lines of interest-ansa-metallocene complexes with different ligand frameworks , insights gained with regard to relevant reaction intermediates and contributions of ansa - metallocene catalysts to industrial polymer production - with a view toward the present state of the art in these fields of catalysis research . 
this chapter covers the discovery that enabled , for the first time , the manufacturing of high molecular weight , highly stereoregular syndiotactic polypropylene polymers with narrow molecular weight distribution via the new class of metallocene molecules with bridged cyclopentadienyl-fluorenyl ligands . first , the salient crystal structural features of the neutral metallocene molecules and the crystal structure of the corresponding mono-alkyl- zirconocenium cation is introduced . then , by employing the structural and geometrical data , a realistic working model for the active site precursor is developed and presented . the stereochemistry of the catalytic propylene poly-insertion reaction and the formation of syndiotactic polypropylene according to the enantiomorphic site control mechanism at the enantiotopic cationic active sites , formed after the activation of the prochiral metallocene dichloride with methylaluminoxane , MAO , is reviewed and further delineated . In the following sections , the impact of the introduction of substituents with proper size and composition at some selected positions of the ligand is discussed and the methods for increasing the molecular weight and stereoregularity of syndiotactic polypropylene polymers are elaborated . with the aid of computational calculations on real and hypothetical catalyst systems with substitutionally altered ligand structures , it is shown that the degree of enantioselectivity of syndiospecific catalyst systems can be determined and / or predicted for these systems quantitatively and with high precision . the calculations confirm that the introduction of substituent ( s ) reinforcing the preferential conformational orientation of the polymer chain enhances the overall enantioselectivity of the active site , and to certain extends stereoselectivity in general , by affecting the site epimerization processes . the computational calculations reveal that to account correctly for the frequency of the site epimerization - dependent m - type stereo - errors it is essential to include the counter-ion , as an integrated part of the catalyst system , into the calculations . the relevance of the symmetry and stereorigidity of the metallocene structure for the syndiospecificity of the final catalyst is debated by presenting a few " non-conforming " catalyst examples . finally , the challenges involved in the manufacture of syndiotactic polypropylene in commercial scale continuous production processes are highlighted as well as the polymer 's unique structural , physical , mechanical and rheological properties . 
the use of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst for the polymerization of olefins and some other vinyl compounds has widely increased the possibilities for more precisely controlling the polymer composition , polymer structure , tacticity , and special properties . highly active catalysts are obtained by different transition metal complexes such as metallocenes , half - sandwich complexes , and bisimino complexes combined with MAO . these catalysts allow the synthesis of polyolefins with different tacticities and stereoregularities , new cycloolefins and other copolymers , and polyolefin composite materials of a purity that can not be obtained by ziegler - natta catalysts . the single - site character of metallocene / MAO or other transition metal / MAO catalysts leads to a better understanding of the mechanism of olefin polymerization . 
spontaneously formed fibers are formed from a number of metal - containing polymers when synthesized employing the interfacial polymerization system . this topic is reviewed with emphasis on group IVB and organotin - containing polymers . over <nUm> organotin polymers were surveyed for fiber formation . it is believed that fiber formation is favored when the backbone is rigid . the fibers have aspect ratios over <nUm> . their use as fibers in composites is encouraged . 
zirconocenes have been used for a long time in the field of olefin polymerization using MAO as cocatalyst . the equivalent hafnocenes were seldom used due to a lack of productivity while using MAO activation . In the last few years borane and borate activation has come into the focus of research for olefin polymerization . A variety of different hafnocenes were used to investigate the polymerization mechanism and the different cocatalysts . differences in the polymer microstructures prepared with MAO and borate as cocatalysts are especially noted . while using TIBA / borate for building the active species , activities increase dramatically . activities exceeded those of comparable Zr / MAO systems , obtaining high and ultrahigh molecular weight polypropylenes with molecular weights of up to <nUm> g mol-1 and tacticities of 10-80 % depending on the structure of the catalyst . <nUm> springer - verlag berlin heidelberg . 
the application of polymers in modern technology , of concentration and isolation of metal ions from solution , water preparation , water purification , processes of removal , concentration , and separation of metal ions ( including heavy ) , and catalysis , is determined to a great extent by the ability of metal ions to form stable contacts with functional groups of macromolecules as sorbents . they appear as a result of the creation of a system of electrovalent and coordination bonds between metal ions and certain groups of polymers , with formation of new polymer systems – macromolecular metal complexes(MMC) . 
due to their unique yet tunable properties , " ionic liquids " are widely used as solvent and / or catalysts in many organic reactions . from the past two decades , there are increasing literature reports on the usage of ionic liquids ( ILs ) even in the polymerization chemistry as solvent , cosolvent , initiator , catalyst , or metalcomplexing ligand . IL - mediated polymerization offers faster rates , higher molecular weight polymers , good yields , easy separation of products , and recovery and reuse of catalyst over conventional organic solvent - mediated polymerization process . In this chapter , we discussed various ILs ( literature reported ) that were employed as solvents and / or catalysts in different kinds of polymerization reactions and their advantages , influence on polymer properties , recovery , and polymerization kinetics . 
twentytwo new substituted metallocene Cp1Cp2MCl2 ( m = Ti , Zr or Hf ) dichlorides have been prepared and the catalytic activity of some of them in alkene polymerization has been primarily evaluated . 
the cp < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ClZr < inf > <nUm> < / inf > / C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > AlCl < inf > <nUm> < / inf > system ( cp = p-cyclopentadienyl ) was found to be an active catalyst for polymerization of alkynes . both internal and terminal alkynes were polymerized by this homogeneous catalytic system . spectroscopic observation of a zirconacyclopentadiene compound in the above reaction led to the investigation of zirconacyclopentadienes as possible reaction intermediates . the zirconacyclopentadiene on reaction with phenylacetylene produced larger zirconacycles and poly-(phenylacetylene) . apparently , the mechanism of polymerization of alkynes is by successive insertion of the alkyne into the zirconium-carbon bond , producing expanded zirconacycles , elimination of which results in the formation of a polyalkyne . 
propene was polymerized with ethylene bis(-1-indenyl)-dichlorozirconium ( Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) and methylalumoxane ( MAO ) at <nUm> ° C . the polymer was fractionated by solvent extraction ; there was no hexane insoluble material . the pentane insoluble , hexane soluble ( C5iC6s ) fraction contains <nUm> % mmmm pentads . it has x-ray crystallinity of <nUm> % comprised of <nUm> % g-phase , and no NMR detectable misinsertions . however , 1,3-insertion was found in the more soluble fractions . 
polymerization of ethylene and copolymerization of ethylene-propylene proceeded smoothly by using homometallic binuclear zirconium complex <nUm> or heterometallic binuclear zirconium - titanium complex <nUm> / methylaluminoxane catalyst system . the molecular weight distributions of polymers obtained by the binuclear zirconium complexes were broader than that produced by mononuclear zirconium complex . 
the catalytic performance ( activity and polymer properties ) of metallocenes with different symmetries in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) in the polymerization of propylene has been investigated at different temperatures , under standardized reaction conditions . the zirconocene rac-ethylene ( e5-1-indenyl ) zirconium ( IV ) dichloride , with C2 symmetry , produces isotatic polypropylene and isopropylidene(e5-cyclopentadienyl ( e5-9-fluorenyl ) zirconium ( IV ) dichloride , with CS symmetry , syndiotactic polypropylene . the degree of the tacticity of these polymers increases with decreasing polymerization temperature . only atactic polypropylene was formed with the unbridged zirconocenes bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl) zirconium ( IV ) dichloride and bis(e5-indenyl zirconium ( IV ) dichloride at any temperature investigated ( 10-60 ° C ) . 
the comparison of the copolymers obtained with the Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO and Cp2HfCl2 / MAO catalyst systems showed that the catalyst having hafnocene was much more reactive towards 1-octadecene than zirconocene . the comonomer concentration had to be three times higher in the zirconocene copolymerization than in the hafnocene copolymerization when the level of <nUm> mol- % was reached . although the hafnocene catalyst was more reactive towards 1-octadecene , the molecular weights were higher than in the copolymers obtained with the zirconocene catalyst . the total activity of the zirconocene was <nUm> times higher than with the hafnocene catalyst . with the zirconocene catalyst the activity towards ethylene was constantly increasing by increasing the comonomer concentration but stayed nearly constant with the hafnocene catalyst . it seemed that there is no rate enhancement effect upon comonomer addition with the hafnocene catalyst . 
three ethylene-bridged unsymmetric zirconocene dichlorides bearing a cyclopentadienyl unit together with either a tetraphenylcyclopentadienyl- ( 8 ) , a 7,9-diphenylcyclopent[a]-acenaphtha-dienyl-(9) or a fluorenyl group ( 10 ) were used for propene polymerization after activation with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) at <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> ° C . whereas <nUm> is inactive at all , <nUm> produces atactic polypropene waxes with high activity . the polypropene products of <nUm> are syndiotactic with stereoregularities depending on the polymerization temperature as well as on monomer and on MAO concentration . 
polymerization of propylene was carried out at <nUm> ° C in the presence of methyl methacrylate(MMA) or ethyl benzoate(EB) using rac-Et(Ind)2ZrMe2 or rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrMe2 / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 as catalyst , which resulted in highly isotactic poly(propylene) with [mmmm] > <nUm> % , Tm = 160-161 ° C and very few 1,3- or <nUm> regioirregular units . with the use of an achiral zirconocene Cp2ZrMe2 , a polymer with Tm = <nUm> ° C was resulted as well . base on these experimental fact that the zirconocene can form a C1 - symmetrical complex with a lewis base . 
the norbornene / ethene copolymerization was investigated by using two CS - symmetric ( [Me2C(Fluo)(Cp)]ZrCl2III , [Ph2C(Fluo)(Cp)]ZrCl2IB ) and two C2 - symmetric ( [Me2Si(Ind)2]ZrCl2I , [Ph2Si(Ind)2]ZrCl2II ) catalysts with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst . this investigation focussed not only on the different polymerization behavior , like catalyst activity , but also considers the material properties of the synthesized copolymers . it was found , that the CS - symimetric catalysts are very well suitable to yield amorphous copolymers with glass transition temperatures above <nUm> ° C and molecular weights > <nUm> g / mol . these copolymers could be used as potential starting materials for optical discs and fibers . 
A new class of polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane ( POSS ) copolymers has been developed by incorporating into a polymer backbone the POSS disilanol macromer , (c-C6H11)8Si8O11(OH)2 , along with a variety of inorganic comonomers . these new inorganic cluster - based copolymers were synthesized using a condensation polymerization approach , with formation of metal oxygen bonds and climination of ClH ( as HNEt3 Cl ) or CH4 driving the reaction . the polymers thus formed are isolated as amorphous powders but do not display any observable glass transition ; they decompose without melting at over <nUm> C under nitrogen . especially interesting is the formation of a zirconocene - bridged copolymer which is stable to both air and methanol . 
ethylene polymerizations by Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO ( MAO = methyl-alumoxane ) and Cp2HfCl2 / MAO catalysts are compared . the Hf catalysts have about two - thirds the activity of the Zr catalysts . this difference may be attributed to the greater number of active centers present in the Zr catalyst . the Hf catalyst shows a smaller dependence of : ( 1 ) polymer MW on temperature and ( 2 ) polymerization activity on transition metal concentration than the Zr catalyst . 
heterometallic hydride titanocene - aluminum complexes Cp2Ti(n-H)2AlH(X) and (Cp2Ti)2AlH4X are highly efficient homogeneous catalysts for acetylene polymerization . the binuclear complex of the composition Cp2Ti(m-H)2AlH2 at <nUm> - <nUm> m concentrations in ether - toluene solutions exhibits the maximum activity in this reaction . it is believed that the mechanisms of the isomerization of olefins and the polymerization of acetylene are similar and , correspondingly , the compositions and structures of the active sites in both processes are close to each other . the polyacetylene formed with hydride catalysts ( mostly the cis-isomer ) after doping with iodine has an electrical conductivity of <nUm> - <nUm> · <nUm> ohm-1 cm-1 . 
poly(methylsilane) and poly(vinylsilane) were synthesized using a titanocene catalyst , and their pyrolytic conversion to ceramics was followed using a combination of thermal analysis and infrared spectroscopy . the two polymers have distinctly different backbone structures , as determined by29Si NMR ; methylsilane polymerizes to a polysilane , while vinylsilane polymers have a predominately polycarbosilane backbone , with some polysilane structure as well . the pyrolysis path and char yield were dependent primarily on backbone structure , with little influence of polymer molecular weight . the majority of the weight loss on conversion occurs below <nUm> ° C , although bond rearrangement continues to <nUm> ° C . poly(vinylsilane) produced a carbon - rich Si-C ceramic in which the carbon was dispersed on a sufficiently fine level to show resistance to oxidation on heating in air to <nUm> ° C . copolymerization of methyl- and vinylsilane produced stoichiometric CSi ; however , polymers of methylsilane were sensitive to oxygen incorporation and sometimes pyrophoric . polymerization of vinylsilane with disilylethane permitted control of rheology and imparted thermoset behaviour . 
Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and the MAO co-catalyst , which polymerize ethylene and propylene , were heterogenized on partially dehydroxylated davison silica <nUm> , following the method of equilibrium adsorption . the dispersion of these catalyst components on the silica support was investigated by measuring the spatial concentration profiles of Si , Al , and Zr using a micro-PIXE technique . these components were found to be uniformly distributed over the support irrespective of the variation in the heterogenization procedures and the experimental conditions used . the Si : Al ratios determined by the micro- PIXE technique were similar to those measured by the spectrophotometric method . however , the Al : Zr ratios measured by the former were somewhat lower than those determined by the latter . Micro-PIXE measurements confirmed the presence of several trace impurities such as K , Ca , Ti , Fe , Ni , Cu , and Zn which may potentially poison the resulting catalyst . 
comparative analysis of catalytic activity of substituted bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichlorides with the general formula ( r n cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( MeCp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( Pr i cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( Pr i <nUm> cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( bu n cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( bu i cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( bu t cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , cp* <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( cp* = me <nUm> C <nUm> ) , ( me <nUm> SiCp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( cyclo-C <nUm> H <nUm> cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , and [ ( cyclo-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> cp ] <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ) in ethene polymerization using polymethylalumoxane as the cocatalyst was performed . the molecular mass characteristics of the polyethylene samples obtained were determined . A linear correlation of the specific activity of the catalysts and the turnover number with the electronic and steric characteristics of substituents at the cp ring of the complexes was established for the first time . analysis of the polymerization kinetics and the obtained correlation between the specific activity of the complexes and molecular mass characteristics of the polyethylene samples suggest that alkyl substituents participate in reactions responsible for the restriction of the polymer chain growth and regeneration of the active center . these interactions most likely involve associates of AlMe <nUm> with polymethylalumoxane molecules . 
A DFT study of ethylene polymerization by zirconocene catalysts was carried out . stationary points corresponding to intermediates and transition states were located on the potential energy surface of the [ cp <nUm> CZr <nUm> H <nUm> ] + + C <nUm> H <nUm> model system . three possible reaction mechanisms involving the formation of b-agostic complexes were considered . the energy and thermodynamic characteristics for different reaction pathways were calculated . corresponding activation energies lie in the range <nUm> - <nUm> kcal mol <nUm> . 
the catalytic properties of the zirconium complex with " constrained geometry " Me2SiCp*NBu1ZrX2 ( cp* = C5Me4 , x = Cl ( 1a ) , me ( 1b ) ) and bridged bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconocene Me2SiCp2ZrX2 ( x = Cl ( 2a ) , me ( 2b ) ) during their activation with triisobutylaluminum / perfluorophenyl borates ( TIBA / LB(C6F5)4 , L = CPh3 ( 3 ) , Me2HNPh ( 4 ) ) in ethylene polymerization under a monomer pressure of 2-20 atm were studied by comparison . both dichloride complexes exhibit moderate activity under the action of the combined TIBA / <nUm> activating agent and give linear high-molecular-weight polyethylene ( PE ) . the interaction of the dimethyl complexes with TIBA / <nUm> afford active sites in which the growing polymeric chain is intensely transferred to the monomer , due to which low-molecular-weight PE is formed . the dichloride complexes affected by TIBA / <nUm> also afford low-molecular-weight PE . analysis of the structure of the polymeric products ( 1H NMR spectrometry , IR spectroscopy ) , molecular - weight parameters of the PE samples ( gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) ) , and kinetics of polymerization suggested that the active site contains AlBu13 as a heteronuclear bridged cationic complex . the influence of various basic substrates ( the products of chain transfer with the terminal vinyl groups , the dimethylaniline fragment of borate <nUm> or other amine specially introduced into the reaction mixture ) on the catalytic properties of the Zr-Al site was revealed . the polymerization rate and molecular - weight parameters of PE as functions of the reaction temperature , ethylene pressure , and modifying additives were studied . 
polymerization of ethylene on zirconocene catalysts was studied with the density functional theory . the approach proposed previously for the model system cp <nUm> ZrEt + + C <nUm> H <nUm> was extended to substituted zirconocene catalysts ( RCp ) <nUm> ZrEt + , which allowed us to compare the results of calculations with the experimentally found rate constants of chain propagation . the ethyl fragment was demonstrated to be an adequate model for a growing polymer chain . the order of decrease in the activation energy of chain propagation calculated for compounds with r = H , me , Pr n , and bu n is in qualitative agreement with the experimental data . however , the quantitative description gave underestimated theoretical rate constants of chain propagation compared to the experimental values . In the case of polyalkyl-substituted zirconocenes ( r = 1,2-Me <nUm> or me <nUm> ) , no correlation between the calculated and experimental characteristics was observed . the results were explained using the simplest model reaction of the replacement of the MeMAO - counterion by an ethylene molecule accompanied by displacement of the former to the outer coordination sphere of the Zr atom . this step was demonstrated to control the kinetics of the process . it was concluded that the isolated - cation model used in early investigations is not adequate and calls for modification with regard to the effect of the counterion . 
the mixtures of non-conjugated dienes , 4-methyl-1,4-hexadiene and 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene ( MHD ) , were successfully synthesized by the reaction of isoprene with ethylene using Fe (III) - based catalyst in toluene . the conversion was over <nUm> mol % on the basis of the initial amount of isoprene used . the production yield for MHD was nearly <nUm> mol % , the other was polyisoprene . the mixtures were successfully copolymerized with ethylene by using zirconium - based metallocenes . the products were characterized by the combinations of gas chromatography , high temperature gel permeation chromatography , 1H NMR , 13C NMR , high temperature 1H NMR , UV / visible spectroscopy , and differential scanning calorimetry . it was found that 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene was active enough to be incorporated into the copolymer chain but the corresponding isomeric material , 4-methyl-1,4-hexadiene , was inactive in metallocene - catalyzed copolymerizations . specifically , in the zirconocene - catalyzed copolymerizations of ethylene with MHD , ansa - structure catalysts seem to be more efficient than non-bridged type zirconocene . the degree of incorporation of MHD in the resulting copolymers was able to be controlled by the amount of non-conjugated dienes used initially . 
the catalytic activities of five bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complexes of group IV metallocenes in the dehydrocoupling reaction of various 1,2-disubstituted hydrodisilanes were investigated . the reactions were monitored by GC / MS analysis in the early stages , and the polymers were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography . 
acyclic diene metathesis ( ADMET ) polymerization techniques and methodologies developed over the past five years are reviewed . through constant catalyst development and further understanding of catalytic activity and side reactions , metathesis has solved a number of synthetic problems through the mild carbon-carbon bond - forming reaction . polymerization of functionalized a,o-dienes has afforded strictly linear copolymers of ethylene and various polar monomers that are unattainable through chain polymerization methodology . telechelic preparation via ADMET allows the synthesis of reactive polymers as starting points for block and segmented copolymers . application of ADMET to materials synthesis has yielded novel amino acid and peptide polymers as well as silicon - based materials . 
this textbook is intended to give an understanding of the basic principles that constitute the field of non-conventional polymers containing inorganic and organometalic units as the repeating units . each chapter will be self - explanatory with a good background so that it can be easily understood at the senior undergraduate level . the principles involved in the preparation of these polymers , their characterisation and their applications will be discussed . basic inorganic chemistry required for the understanding of each topic is presented so that the content of the chapter is readily understood . all the major inorganic and organometallic polymers such as polyphosphazenes , polysilanes , polysiloxanes , poly-thiazyl , poly-ferrocenes and other polymers containing main group elements will be dealt with . all rights are reserved . 
reaction mechanisms of both propagation and termination steps in homogeneous polyolefin catalysis are investigated at DFT level . starting from existent catalysts , we propose the design of a new ti-bis(enolato-azo) catalytic family . we considered a number of hydrogenated or fluorinated models in aromatic group and chelating ring . fluorination in the aromatic rings is able to control the propagation steps by activating the metal site , while hydrogenation of the ligand can inhibit the termination transfers . so , we have optimized the structure of the catalyst to give it the highest reactivity towards polymerization and the lowest one towards termination , by means of the meta-F substitutions in the aromatic group , and – C2F3H2 on the chelating ring . thus , the developed bis(enolato-azo) models seem to be interesting for experimental investigations as new living catalysts . 
the homo- and copolymerization of styrene ( S ) with p-methylstyrene ( p-MeS ) and p-tert-butylstyrene ( p-ButS ) has been tested using initiator systems of the Ph2Zn-metallocene-MAO type . the metallocenes used were CpTiCl3 , IndTiCl3 , (n-BuCp)2TiCl <nUm> , Ind2ZrCl2 and Et(Ind)2ZrCl <nUm> . the Ph2Zn-metallocene-MAO systems homopolymerize styrene , p-methylstyrene and p-tert-butylstyrene , producing syndiotactic polymers in the case of the titanocenes and amorphous polymers in the case of the zirconocenes . the S / p-MeS and S / p-ButS copolymers obtained with the Ph2Zn-titanocene-MAO systems are enriched in the comonomer with respect to the initial feed . 
polymers having conjugated enyne moieties in the main chain ( 3 ) were prepared by the polymerization of diynes ( 2 ) using a low - valent titanocene catalyst ( 1 ) generated from Cp*2TiCl2 and i-PrMgBr . the reactivity of the enyne - containing polymers ( 3 ) was demonstrated by the thermal cross-linking reaction at <nUm> ° C . 
copolymerizations of ethylene with 1-decene were carried out with a series of stereospecific metallocene compounds , rac - (EBI)Zr(NMe2) <nUm> [ <nUm> , EBI = ethylene-1,2-bis(1-indenyl) ] , rac - (EBI)Hf(NMe 2)2 ( 2 ) , rac-Me2Si(1-C5H 2-2-Me-4-tBu)2Zr(NMe2)2 ( 3 ) , ethylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)ZrMe2 [ <nUm> , Et(Flu)(Cp)ZrMe2 ] and isopropylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl) ZrMe2 [ <nUm> , iPr(Flu)(Cp)ZrMe2 ] , combined with Al(i-Bu) <nUm> / [CPh3][B(C6F5)4] cocatalyst . all catalyst systems showed very high copolymerization rates and the 1-decene reactivity decreased in the order of <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> ∼ <nUm> > <nUm> . the reactivity product of ethylene and 1-decene ( rE x rD ) was below <nUm> except <nUm> catalyst , corresponding to random copolymer structures with an alternating character . the melting point ( Tm ) , crystallinity ( xc ) , intrinsic viscosity ( [e] and density of the 1-decene / ethylene copolymers decreased markedly with an increase in the 1-decene content , regardless of the type of catalytic system . 
propylene copolymerization with 1-hexene and 4-methyl-1-pentene in liquid propylene medium in presence of MAO - activated C2 - symmetry ansa - zirconocene rac-Me2Si(4-Ph-2-MeInd)2ZrCl2 was studied . random copolymers of propylene with 1-hexene and 4-methyl-1-pentene content up to 7mol[?] % were obtained at <nUm> ° C . general kinetic characteristics of propylene / higher a-olefin copolymerization were evaluated . the distinct feature of propylene copolymerization with 1-hexene and 4-methyl-1-pentene in liquid propylene medium - the proximity of comonomer relative reactivity ratios ( r1 r21 ) that indicates azeotropic nature of copolymerization processes in studied conditions . synthesized copolymers were characterized with the use of IR , 13C NMR , GPC , WAXD , DSC techniques , and uniaxial tensile testing . 
the novel half - titanocene catalyst bearing reactive functional amino group , e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyltri(p-amino-phenoxyl) titanium [ cp *Ti(p-OC6H4NH2)3 ] , was easily synthesized by the reaction of e5- pentamethylcyclopentadienyltrichloride titanium ( cp *TiCl3 ) with p-amino phenol in the presence of triethyl amine ( NEt3 ) . Cp*Ti(p-OC6H4NH2)3 covalently anchored on Cl2Mg / AlEtn(OEt)3-n support obtained from the reaction of triethylaluminium ( AlEt3 ) with the adduct of magnesium chloride ( Cl2Mg ) and ethanol ( EtOH ) , has been investigated and used to catalyze syndiospecific polymerization of styrene . influences of the support structure , cocatalyst , and the molar ratio of Al in methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and Ti ( AlMAO / Ti ) on catalytic activity , syndiotacticity and molecular weight of the resultant polystyrene were investigated . compared with the corresponding Cp*Ti(p-OC6H 4NH2)3 homogeneous catalyst , a considerable increase in activity and molecular weight of syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) was observed for the Cp*Ti(p-OC6H4NH2) 3-MgCl2 / AlEtn(OEt)3-n supported catalyst even at a relatively low AlMAO / Ti ratio of <nUm> , and the kinetics of polymerization was stable during the reaction process . 
this article reveals the dependence of crystalline phases in titania on the intrinsic activity during in situ polymerization of ethylene / 1-hexene using the zirconocene / dMMAO catalyst to produce LLDPE / O2Ti nanocomposites . first , the O2Ti nanoparticles having different crystalline phases were employed as the nanofillers by impregnation with dMMAO to obtain dMMAO / O2Ti then , copolymerization of ethylene / 1-hexene using zirconocene catalyst was performed in the presence of dMMAO / O2Ti . it was found that the catalytic activity derived from the anatase O2Ti ( A ) was about four times higher than that obtained from the rutile OTi <nUm> . ( r ) . this was likely due to higher intrinsic activity of the active species present on the TiO2(A) . In addition , increased [Al]dMMAO / [Zr]cat ratios apparently resulted in enhanced activities for both O2Ti ( A ) and tio ( r ) . however , the O2Ti ( r ) showed less deactivation upon increased [Al]dMMAO / [Zr]cat ratios . this can be attributed to strong interaction between dMMAO and O2Ti . ( r ) as proven by the TGA measurement . the microstructure of the LLDPE / O2Ti obtained was found to be random copolymer for both O2Ti ( A ) and O2Ti ( r ) . 
the copolymerization of styrene with isoprene ( ip ) has been tested using combined zirconocene-methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) initiating system . both '' halfsandwich '' and real zirconium - based metallocenes were used . regardless of the metallocene employed , conversion to copolymer was much influenced by the proportion of ip in the initial feed . As the proportion of ip is enriched , conversion to copolymer decreases substantially . results of NMR and DSC analyses indicate that the products obtained were truly copolymers and not a mixture of both homopolymers . the studied zirconocene - MAO initiating system produces atactic polystyrene . A small amount of ip in the initial feed substantially diminishes the conversion and at best traces of poly(isoprene) were detected in the homopolymerization of ip with these initiating systems . 
1-(2-Phenylethyl)-3-methylimidazolium and 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium chloroaluminates , [Ph-C2mim][AlCl4] and [Bzlmim][AlCl <nUm> ] , were applied as media of the Cp2TiCl2 catalyst for biphasic ethylene polymerization . the studied aralkyl ionic liquids ensure greater stability of the catalyst at higher temperatures and more regular morphology of the produced polyethylene than analogous 1-n-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium chloroaluminates . the alkylaluminium compound participates in the termination reaction of the polymer chain . the catalyst is stable and enables recycling of the ionic liquid phase in the consecutive polymerization reactions . the [Ph-C2mim][AlCl4] ionic liquid and AlEt2Cl alkylaluminium compound turned out to be the most suitable for the biphasic process . the influence of the kind of ionic liquid , alkylaluminium compound ( AlEt2Cl and AlEtCl2 ) , activator / catalyst molar ratio , reaction temperature , reaction time and catalyst recycling on the polymerization performance as well as polyethylene properties such as molecular weight ( m w ) , polydispersity , melting temperature , crystallinity degree , bulk density and particle size is presented . 
the polymerization of norbornene has been investigated in the presence of two novel bispyrazolylimine dinickel(II) complexes bis-2-(C3HN 2Me2-3,5)(C(Ph) = N(4-RC6H4)Ni 2Br4 ( complex <nUm> , r = H ; complex <nUm> , r = CH3O ) activated by methylaluminoxane . the two catalytic systems show high activity ( up to <nUm> × <nUm> gPNBE / ( molNi*h ) ) for norbornene polymerization and provide polynorbornene ( PNBE ) with higher molecular weights ( m w = <nUm> × 105-11.57 × <nUm> g / mol ) and narrower molecular weight distributions about <nUm> . the electron - donating of methoxyl group in complex <nUm> could enhance the catalytic activity for norbornene polymerization , however , the molecular weights of polymers were decreased . the influences of polymerization parameters such as polymerization temperature , Al / Ni molar ratio , reaction time and catalyst concentration on catalytic activity , and molecular weight of the BEsNP were investigated in detail . the obtained BEsNP were characterized by means of 1H NMR , FTIR , and thermogravimetric analyses . the analyses results of PNBE indicated that the norbornene polymerization is vinyl-type polymerization rather than ring - opening metathesis polymerization . 
the spherical zirconia modified with BCl3 , Cl4Si , and glycerol was used as the support for rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst to catalyze the copolymerization of ethylene / 1-hexene . it is aimed to investigate the modification effects from different modifiers on copolymerization behaviors and compare the results with the unmodified system . the modified supports show higher activity than the unmodified one . especially , the Cl4Si modification exhibited the highest activity and produced copolymer with the largest 1-hexene insertion . this can be attributed to stronger interaction between the support and MAO along with the presence of Cl4Si as a spacer group resulting in the absence of induction period . the modification did not affect the copolymers microstructure and the random copolymers were obtained from all supported systems . the narrower molecular weight distribution can be obtained from the modified supports . besides , BCl3 modification presents the highest molecular weight of polymer probably due to BCl3 suppressing chain transfer reactions . 
the copolymerization of styrene with cyclohexene , 1-methyl-1-cyclohexene , and norbornene using ethenylbisindenylzirconium dichloride and methylaluminoxane , Et(Ind)2ZrCl2-MAO , initiating systems has been tested . the results obtained with each styrene-cycloalkene couple , except styrene / norbornene , indicate a less effective polymerization process compared to styrene homopolymerization , in agreement with the electronic and steric effects present in each comonomer . the electronic I+ effects of substituent groups , depending on their placement , largely improve the polymerization process , while bulky groups on or near the vinyl carbon double bond of styrene decrease its effectiveness . the present study shows that the copolymers obtained are amorphous and their composition showed a lower abundance of comonomer units with respect to the initial feed . for comparison , the results of the copolymerization of styrene / ( 1-octadecene ) using the same initiator system and polymerization process are included , a polymerization that indicates a more reactive process , and as the proportion of octadecene in the initial feed increases , it showed a crystalline fusion temperature as well as a tg in the styrene region which can be attributed to the formation of block styrene / octadecene copolymers . 
ethylene homo polymer and ethylene-styrene copolymers were synthesized using Cp2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) / methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) and rac-silylene-bis ( indenyl ) zirconium dichloride ( 2 ) / MAO catalyst systems by varying styrene concentration and reaction conditions . crystallization analysis fractionation ( CRYSTAF ) , DSC , FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy were used for characterizing the synthesized polymers . interestingly , styrene was able to increase the activity of <nUm> / MAO and <nUm> / MAO catalyst systems at low concentrations , but at higher concentrations the activity decreases . the <nUm> / MAO system at low and high pressure was unable to incorporate styrene , and the final product was pure polyethylene . on the other hand , with <nUm> / MAO polymerization of ethylene and styrene yielded copolymer containing both styrene and ethylene . results obtained from CRYSTAF and DSC reveal that on using <nUm> / MAO system at high pressure , the resulting polymer in the presence of styrene has similar crystallinity as the polymer produced without styrene . using both <nUm> / MAO at low pressure and <nUm> / MAO leads to decrease in crystallinity with increase in styrene concentration , even though the former does not incorporate styrene . 
In this research work , a zirconocene / MAO complex was used as a catalyst for the copolymerization of 1-hexene and ethylene in the presence of nano titania doped with <nUm> % of manganese ( O2Ti / Mn ) , which was used as a drop in filler . it was investigated from the 13C NMR analysis that 1-hexene incorporation increases with the addition of nano filler . the degree of crystallinity ( DOC ) , catalytic activity and molecular weight of the nanocomposites were studied by a differential scanning calorimeter ( DSC ) , yield analysis and gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) , respectively . it was found that DOC , catalytic activity , molecular weight and molecular weight distribution were strongly influenced by the addition of nano filler due to the increase of 1-hexene incorporation . As a result , an increase in catalytic activity and a decrease in DOC were observed due to the addition of nano filler . the non-isothermal crystallization kinetics of the produced copolymer was studied using a model proposed by ozawa and Mo et al. it was observed that the crystal growth rate is slowed by the nano filler . the activation energy ( EA ) was determined by the kissinger method , and it was found that EA is increased incrementally with the loadings of the nano filler , confirming a slower crystallization process . 
isobutylalumoxanes have been obtained by hydrolysis of triisobutylaluminium ( TIBA ) with water in the form of vapour ( 1 ) or ice particles ( 2 ) at AlTIBA / H2O = <nUm> mol / mol . 1H NMR spectra of hydrolyzates showed the presence of unreacted TIBA indicating the formation of alumoxanes larger than iBu2Al-O-AliBu2 which one can expect based on the molar ratio of reagents . alumoxanes <nUm> and <nUm> demonstrate high activating ability for rac-Et(2-MeInd)2ZrMe2 in copolymerization reactions of ethylene with propylene and terpolymerization of ethylene with propylene and 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene . alumoxane <nUm> demonstrates high structural and chemical stability during long - term storage ( for <nUm> year ) that results in consistent activating ability and similarity of molecular weight characteristics of polymer formed . alumoxane <nUm> is much less structurally stable which is manifested in considerable changes of 1H NMR spectra of the product even after several days of storage . it essentially loses activating ability after <nUm> months ’ storage . the alumoxanes with high activating ability have been also obtained by in situ TIBA hydrolysis with water intentionally incorporated into toluene ( ~ <nUm> × <nUm> − <nUm> mol / l ) prior to polymerization also at AlTIBA / H2O = <nUm> mol / mol . the differences of catalytic systems with different activators are also reflected in differences in microstructure , molecular - weight , thermal - physical characteristics and physical - mechanical properties of copolymers formed . 
the polymerization of styrene using the combined system diphenylzinc-bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl)titanium dichloride-methylaluminoxane , Ph2Zn-(n-BuCp)2TiCl2-MAO , in toluene at <nUm> ° C , produced highly syndiotactic polystyrene , confirming that Ph2Zn-titanocene-MAO are good initiator systems for the stereoregular polymerization of styrene . the syndiotacticity of PS was established by its insolubility in chloroform , benzene or toluene , and after continuous extraction in boiling butanone . DSC analysis showed endotherm signals corresponding to the melting temperature , Tm , of syndiotactic polystyrene . 
allylbenzene was polymerized in the presence of two types of homogeneous zirconocene catalysts ( co-catalyst methylaluiminoxane ) . selective chain termination through ss-hydride elimination or chain transfer to aluminum was observed depending upon the catalysts employed . the rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 , and rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 , catalysts gave the polyallylbenzenes with saturated end groups due to chain transfer to aluminum , while the Cp2ZrCl2 catalyst gave the polyallylbenzenes with vinylidene end groups due to ss-hydride elimination . 
lewis acidic sites ( LAS ) of silica , modified with TMA and MAO samples differed by TMA content , have been characterized by IR spectroscopy ( CO adsorption as probe molecule at <nUm> K ) . two types of LAS were found on the surface of silica modified with MAO and TMA : m LAS of moderate strength ( vCO = 2204-2212 cm-1 ) and weak W LAS ( vCO = <nUm> cm-1 ) . the concentration of these acidic sites has been estimated . it was shown by IRS study CP2ZrMe2 interacts both with W LAS and m LAS . correlation between the amount of m LAS and the activity of ethylene polymerization has been found . 
A visible light photoinitiating system for cationic polymerization of cyclic ethers such as cyclohexene oxide ( CHO ) and vinyl monomers such as n-butyl vinyl ether ( BVE ) and n-vinyl carbazole ( NVC ) has been developed , using a fluorinated titanocene free radical photoinitiator , irgacure <nUm> , together with an onium salt , such as diphenyl iodonium hexafluoro antimonate and n-ethoxy-2-methyl-pyridinium hexafluoro-antimonate . based on the reported photochemistry of fluorinated titanocenes , a mechanism for generating cationic species is proposed based on electron transfer between photoproducts of titanocene and onium salt . evidence against the incorporation of an aromatic titanocene moiety in the resulting polymers is presented . inhibition by a specific proton scavenger suggests that protons may initiate the polymerization . 
thirteen differently substituted long - chain amide- and amine - functional alkenes were synthesised and used as comonomers in zirconocene / methylaluminoxane - catalysed copolymerizations with ethylene and propylene . characterization of the prepared copolymers showed the formation of functionalized copolymers with isolated comonomer units . the incorporation level of the comonomers ranged from <nUm> to <nUm> mol % with ethylene and from <nUm> to <nUm> mol % with propylene . the molar masses of the copolymers were lower than those of the corresponding homopolymers . end group analysis of the copolymers by NMR suggested that the dominant chain termination mechanism was chain transfer to aluminium . 
synthesis and activity of bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride catalyst supported on unconventional silica - type material obtained in sol - gel process and activated by organoaluminium co-catalyst were studied . the effect of support modification conditions ( thermal dehydration and / or modification by organoaluminium compound ) and a type of co-catalyst on an activity of the catalytic system in ethylene polymerization and properties of resulting polymers were investigated and compared with results obtained earlier for vanadium catalysts supported on mentioned sol - gel carrier . the most appropriate method of the sol - gel silica - type support preparation is thermal pre-treating ( <nUm> ° C ) followed by modification with AlEt2Cl . metallocene catalyst supported on such sol - gel product and activated by MAO appeared to be most active among studied systems . studied Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO supported on silica - type sol - gel carrier allow to obtain polyethylene ( at <nUm> ° C polymerization temperature ) with yield up to 30*106 g / ( molZr*h ) , molecular weight below <nUm> <nUm> and MWD = 2-4 . 
ethene was homo- and copolymerized in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO)-activated zirconocenes comprising (Me5Cp)2ZrCl2 ( cp* ) and racemic dimethylsilylene-bis[-2-methyl-indenyl] - bridged zirconocene dichloride where the ligand framework was varied by benzannelation ( MBI ) , 4-phenyl ( MPI ) , and 4-naphthyl ( MNI ) substitution . zero shear viscosity and shear thinning of the ethene homopolymers increased as a function of the catalyst system with MNI · MPI > MBI » cp* and were correlated with the presence of long chain branches formed via reinsertion of vinyl-terminated polymer chains . the ranking was confirmed using the reduced vanGurp palmen plot ( σ vs. IG*I / GN0 ) being less sensitive on molecular weight for polyolefin materials . poly(ethene-co-propene)s ( EP ) containing <nUm> and <nUm> wt.- % propene were long chain branched as reflected by pronounced viscosity build-up at low angular frequency and increased shear thinning at higher angular frequency , whereas with propene comonomer content exceeding <nUm> wt.- % EP was essentially linear . 
synthesis and activity ofbis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride catalyst supported on unconventional silica - type material obtained in sol - gel process and activated by organoaluminium co-catalyst were studied . the effect of support modification conditions ( thermal dehydration and / or modification by organoaluminium compound ) and a type of co-catalyst on an activity of the catalytic system in ethylene polymerization and properties of resulting polymers were investigated and compared with results obtained earlier for vanadium catalysts supported on mentioned sol - gel carrier . the most appropriate method of the sol - gel silica - type support preparation is thermal pre-treating ( <nUm> ° C ) followed by modification with AlEt2Cl . metallocene catalyst supported on such sol - gel product and activated by MAO appeared to be most active among studied systems . studied Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO supported on silica - type sol - gel carrier allow to obtain polyethylene ( at <nUm> ° C polymerization temperature ) with yield up to 30*106 g / ( molZr*h ) , molecular weight below <nUm> <nUm> and MWD = 2-4 . 
photocatalytic activity of CdS and Cd × zn1- × S nanoparticles in the polymerization of acrylamide and acrylic acid in aqueous solutions has been found . it has been shown that the most probable way of the photogeneration of primary radicals is the reduction of an adsorbed monomer by the conduction band electrons of the semiconductor nanoparticles , a monomer oxidation by the valence band holes and atomic hydrogen addition to a monomer being complementary photoinitiation routes . A correlation between the composition of Cd × zn1- × S nanoparticles and their photocatalytic activity in the acrylamide polymerization has been established . it has been shown that an increase in the quantum yield of the photopolymerization in a sequence CdS < Cd × zn1- × S < CdS × zn1- × S < Cd3S10Zn7 originates from a concurrent increase of the conduction band potential of the semiconductor nanoparticles . A kinetic equation of the photocatalytic acrylamide polymerization has been derived . quantum yields of the photoinitiation have been found to be as small as 10-4 to 10-3 . 
A new titanium(IV) complex [TiLCl2] { LH2 = 2-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-benzylamino)-4-methysulfanyl-butyric acid } having S- , N- , and O - bearing phenoxy-amine backbones has been synthesized and investigated for its efficient role in aqueous emulsion polymerization of polar olefins , methylacrylate and methylmethacrylate at ambient temperature . the catalyst microstructure has been supported by elemental analysis , 1H and 13C NMR , IR , and UV – visible spectroscopy . the catalyst is easy to synthesize and found to be moderately stable in water . upon activation with BPh4 − , the activity of the complex as single - site catalytic species has been found to be high ( in the order of <nUm> g mol-1 h-1 ) producing syndiotactic rich high molecular weight polymers with low molecular weight distribution ( PDI values in the range of <nUm> – <nUm> ) . structure and molecular properties of the synthesized polymers were determined by 1H NMR , 13C NMR , gel permeation chromatography , and DSC analysis . DSC analysis reveals that the polymer product obtained is semi-crystalline with sharp melting temperature at <nUm> ° C ( Tm ) . kinetic parameters such as rate constant and activation energy of polymethylmethacrylate have also been studied , and the value of eapp has been found to be <nUm> kJ mol-1 only . the lower value can be interpreted as a consequence of a high catalytic activity of the complex .

the present study characterizes changes in the electronic structure of reactants during chemical reactions based on the combined charge and energy decomposition scheme , ETS - NOCV ( extended transition state - natural orbitals for chemical valence ) . decomposition of the activation barrier , DE # , into stabilizing ( orbital interaction , DE orb , and electrostatic , DE elstat ) and destabilizing ( pauli repulsion , DE pauli , and geometry distortion energy , DE dist ) factors is discussed in detail for the following reactions : ( I ) hydrogen cyanide to hydrogen isocyanide , HCN ; → ; CNH isomerization ; ( II ) diels - alder cycloaddition of ethene to 1,3-butadiene ; and two catalytic processes , i.e. , ( III ) insertion of ethylene into the metal - alkyl bond using half - titanocene with phenyl-phenoxy ligand catalyst ; and ( IV ) B-H bond activation catalyzed by an Ir - containing catalyst . various reference states for fragments were applied in ETS - NOCV analysis . we found that NOCV - based deformation densities ( dr i ) and the corresponding energies DE orb(i) obtained from the ETS - NOCV scheme provide a very useful picture , both qualitatively and quantitatively , of electronic density reorganization along the considered reaction pathways . decomposition of the barrier DE # into stabilizing and destabilizing contributions allowed us to conclude that the main factor responsible for the existence of positive values of DE # for all processes ( I , II , III and IV ) is pauli interaction , which is the origin of steric repulsion . In addition , in the case of reactions II , III and IV , a significant degree of structural deformation of the reactants , as measured by the geometry distortion energy , plays an important role . depending on the reaction type , stabilization of the transition state ( relatively to the reactants ) originating either from the orbital interaction term or from electrostatic attraction can be of vital importance . finally , use of the ETS - NOCV method to describe catalytic reactions allows extraction of information on the role of catalysts in determination of DE # .

bent metallocenes are a class of organometallic compounds that are widely used as catalysts in olefin polymerization procedures . we found a linear relation between the relative stability of bent titanocenes and the average delocalization index ( DI ) for Ti-C ( from the cyclopentadienyl ring ) atomic pairs within the evaluated compounds . As a consequence , the stability of the bent titanocenes can be estimated from their topologies . however , secondary interactions between the ligands of some of the bent titanocenes reduce the coefficient of determination for the average DI-stability relation .

we report electrochemical studies on the influence of a small concentration of chloride ions on the electroactivity of the polymer matrix of polypyrrole ( PPy ) , poly(N-methylpyrrole) [p(N-MePy)] and a poly(titanocene-propyl-pyrrole) derivative , p(Tc3Py) [ C7H10NTc ; Tc = CpCpTiCl2 ; cp = CH ; cp' = C 5H4 ] in acetonitrile ( AN ) , tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) and N,N-dimethylformamide ( DMF ) . the polymer films were obtained on Pt disc electrodes from AN solutions of the monomers containing <nUm> m tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate ( TBAPF6 ) as the supporting electrolyte and then transferred to the corresponding monomer - free solution . studies in Cl -- containing solutions have shown that the p(Tc3Py) matrix is very sensitive to the presence of cl- ions in all the above solvents , namely that it was subjected to electrochemical degradation at potentials above <nUm> V vs. a Ag / <nUm> m ag+ in AN reference electrode . degradation of the p(Tc3Py) matrix was also observed in chloride - free DMF+ TBAPF6 solutions . addition of chloride ions to the AN solution containing pyrrole , n-methylpyrrole or Tc3Py inhibits the deposition of the polymer films . on the other hand , we have found that PPy and p(N-MePy) matrices after their deposition in chloride - free AN solutions show much more stable redox responses in contact with chloride and / or DMF solutions . possible mechanisms of these effects are discussed . 
we have studied for the first time the ability of a conducting polymer film , p(Tc3Py) , representing a polypyrrole matrix with covalently attached titanocene dichloride ( Cl2Tc ) centers , to serve as an intermediator for the electron charge transport between the electrode and the reaction sites of solute reactants . the standard potential of the first of these electroactive species , ferrocene ( fc ) , is in the range where the polymer matrix is in its slightly oxidized state so that solute fc species give a reversible response at the surface of this modified electrode . another solute reactant , ClTc <nUm> , was studied in solutions in which it demonstrates a (quasi)reversible behavior at bare electrode surfaces , THF+ TBAPF6 and AN + TEACl . the standard redox potential of this species belongs to the range of the electroactivity of immobilized Cl2Tc centers ( where the matrix is in its non-conducting state ) so that the electron charge has to be transported via stepwise redox reactions between neighboring centers inside the film . the combination , solute reactant + film , results in a greater CV current compared to the response of the film in background solution or of the solute species at the bare electrode surface . this current for THF solution even exceeds the sum of separate currents for the film and the reactant . this finding is attributed to a catalytic effect of solute species as redox intermediators for the transformation of immobilized electroactive centers leading to a greater degree of the film reduction . the presence of solute Cl2Tc species results in a much greater stability of immobilized centers ( compared to the corresponding reactant - free solution ) , both in the course of CV with the passage of the range of their response and in experiments with the film holding at the potential within this range . this holding leads to an almost constant current related to the reaction of solute species at the film / solution interface . our estimate shows that immobilized centers undergo above <nUm> reversible transformations ( without an observed tendency to the degradation ) to ensure the passage of this current . the conclusion has been drawn that immobilized Cl2Tc centers are able to serve as sufficiently stable redox intermediators for the electron charge transport across the film , a prerequisite for the catalytic applications of such films . 
three tantalocene dichloride complexes , Cp*(Cp-R)Ta(IV)Cl <nUm> , with one pentamethylated cyclopentadienyl ligand , cp* = η 5-C 5Me <nUm> , me = CH <nUm> , and one monosubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligand , Cp-R , cp = η 5-C 5H <nUm> , r = H , SiMe <nUm> or ( CH <nUm> ) 3NC 4H <nUm> , have been studied in acetonitrile solutions with cyclic voltammetry in the ranges of the Ta(IV) oxidation to Ta (V) or of its reduction to Ta (III) . the former transition is reversible , while the latter one gives an irreversible wave due to the dissociation of the reduced complex with the loss of one chloride ligand . the redox transformation from the initial state of complex Cp*CpSiMe 3TaCl <nUm> to its oxidized state , Cp*CpSiMe 3TaCl <nUm> + , and back was monitored by spectroelectrochemical measurements in a thin - layer acetonitrile solution . kinetic data for the evolution of the UV - visible spectrum of the system in the course of the double potential step experiment were treated on the basis of two theoretical models as the reactant diffusion across the solution layer without or with taking into account ohmic losses . the values of the diffusion coefficients of the complex in its initial and oxidized ( cationic ) states have been estimated . it was demonstrated that this complex in each of two oxidation states , Ta(IV) or Ta (V) , is represented by a single molecular form . an attempt to deposit a conducting polymer film by oxidation of the tantalocene complex containing a pyrrole group attached to the cp ring , Cp*Cp(CH <nUm> ) 3PyTaCl <nUm> , led to a thin insulating layer at the electrode surface because of an inhibiting effect of chloride anions . 
the morphologies of PEDOTh films deposited on platinum electrodes , using different electrochemical modes but conditions selected to obtain layers with similar electroactivities , have been analysed by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . ex situ AFM showed a fibber - like topography for the potentiodynamically synthesised films , contrasting to the granular character of those formed at constant potential . In situ contact mode AFM , used to examine the initial stages of the polymer growth and the surface morphology evolution , disclosed the development of long segments with the number of potential cycles , and the formation of identical globular nodules , which diameter increases with the growth charge . the morphological changes imparted by the switching process revealed to be more marked in films grown at constant potential . thickness measurements performed on oxidised and reduced films unveiled the swelling / shrinking of the polymers during the ingress / egress of the perchlorate anions , with film volume changes of ca. <nUm> % upon oxidation . 
electrochemical copolymerization of 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene and 3-methylthiophene was successfully achieved in boron trifluoride diethyl etherate by direct anodic oxidation of the monomer mixtures . the structure and properties of the copolymers were investigated with ultraviolet - visible , fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , 1H nuclear magnetic resonance , fluorescence spectra , and thermal analysis . the novel copolymers had the advantages of both poly(9,10-dihydrophenanthrene) and poly(3-methylthiophene) , such as good electrochemical behavior , good mechanical properties , and high electrical conductivity . fluorescence spectroscopy studies revealed that the copolymers had good fluorescence properties , and the emitting properties of the copolymer could be parameters by changing the feed ratio of the monomer mixtures during the electrochemical polymerization . 
we apply chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry to trace the effect of the deposition potential on morphological and redox properties of N - substituted polypyrrole films on platinum and ITO in acetonitrile solutions . the goal of these experiments is to check whether certain principle trends observed in the course of the film growth can be used to monitor the deposition process and to control the features of the fabricated polymer . we use STM for morphology characterization , and estimate the film thickness from its redox response in background solution . for titanocene - substituted pyrrole , we compare current transients data on the anodic electropolymerization and the monomer reduction , in order to estimate the mass transport contribution to the polymerization current within various time domains ( <nUm> ms-1,000 s ) . on the basis of all these observations , we conclude on the existence of four characteristic regions of deposition current transients and assign them to certain steps in the oligomers formation and the film growth . the region of the current growth is discussed as well in terms of traditional nucleation models . 
the discovery or , in a certain extent , rediscovery of polymers possessing high electronic conductivity launched a new field of research about <nUm> years ago . electrochemistry has played a significant role in the preparation and characterization of these novel materials , which has served as a basis for many advanced applications in different areas spanning from the energy technologies to the health care . In this paper is intended to give a short summary of the history of this field , and based on the achievements until now - knowing the present limitations and opportunities - the tasks for the future are also discussed . In such a recapitulation , it is appropriate to mention the researchers who substantially contributed to the development of our present knowledge on conducting polymers during the past decades . 
electrochemical and mechanical properties of thin poly(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene ) films deposited on gold have been investigated in aqueous sulfuric acid and sodium - sulfate solutions . it has been shown that at sufficiently positive electrode potentials , overoxidation of the polymer takes place . In some cases , only small changes could be observed in the shape of cyclic voltammograms taken in the " stability region " before and after overoxidation . In contrast to this , the impedance spectra recorded after overoxidation differed considerably from the impedance spectra of a freshly made electrode . morphological changes of the polymer caused by overoxidation ( degradation ) could be detected by using the bending beam method . 
neodymium chloride isopropanol complex ( NdCl33iPrOH ) activated by modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) was examined in isoprene polymerization in hexane , with regards to Nd compounds , aluminum ( Al ) compounds , [Al] / [Nd] ratio , polymerization temperature and time . Cl33Nd iPrOH exhibited high activity producing polymers featuring high cis-1,4 stereospecificity ( > <nUm> % ) , very high molecular weight ( Mn > <nUm> × <nUm> ) and fairly narrow molecular weight distribution ( MWD , mw / Mn < <nUm> ) simultaneously . In comparison , neodymium isopropoxide also showed high activity providing polymers with narrow MWD ( mw / Mn = <nUm> ) , but somewhat low cis-1,4 content ( ca. <nUm> % ) , while neodymium chloride had no activity under present polymerization conditions . the Al compounds affected the polymer yield in the order of al(i- bu)3 > MMAO > Al(i-Bu)2H . MMAO as cocatalyst afforded polyisoprene with high Mn over <nUm> × <nUm> , whereas as stronger chain transfer agent than MMAO , Al(i-Bu)3 and Al(i-Bu)2H yielded polymers with low Mn ( <nUm> × 105-8.0 × <nUm> ) . Cl33Nd iPrOH / MMAO catalyst showed a fairly good catalytic activity even at relatively low [Al] / [Nd] ratio of <nUm> , and the produced polymer remained high cis-1,4 content of <nUm> % along with high Mn over <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> even at elevated temperatures up to <nUm> ° C . the polymerization rate is of the first order with respect to the concentration of isoprene . the mechanism of active species formation was discussed preliminarily . 
A series of half - titanocene chloride 2-(benzimidazol-2-yl)quinolin-8-olates C1-C6 were synthesized by treating the lithium salts of the ligand with CpTiCl3 . all the complexes were characterized by 1H - NMR , 13C - NMR and elemental analyses , and the crystal structure of C3 and C6 was measured by x-ray . these half - titanocene complexes showed moderate catalytic activities toward ethylene polymerization ( up to <nUm> kg*mol-1(Ti)*h-1 ) when activated with MMAO , affording the high molecular weight polymers . and they also exhibited good activity for copolymerization of ethylene and a-olefin with low content of co-monomer . 
A series of half - sandwich group IV metal complexes with tridentate monoanionic phenoxy-imine arylsulfide [O-NS] ligand [ 2-Bu t 4-Me-6-((2-(SC6H5)C6H <nUm> N = CHC6H2O)]- ( La ) and dianionic phenoxy-amine arylsulfide [O-N-S] ligand [ 2-Bu t 4-Me-6-((2-(SC6H5)C6H 4N-CH2C6H2O)]2- ( lb ) have been synthesized and characterized . lb was obtained easily in high yield by reduction of ligand La with excess AlH4Li in cool diethyl ether . half - sandwich group IV metal complexes CpTi[O-NS]Cl2 ( 1a ) , CpZr[O-NS]Cl2 ( 1b ) , CpTi[O-N-S]Cl ( 2a ) , CpZr[O-N-S]Cl ( 2b ) and Cp*Zr[O -N-S]Cl ( 2c ) were synthesized by the reactions of La and lb with CpTiCl3 , CpZrCl3 and Cp*ZrCl3 , and characterized by IR , 1H - NMR , 13C - NMR and elemental analysis . In addition , an x-ray structure analysis was performed on ligand lb . the title group IV half - sandwich bearing tridentate [O,N,S] ligands show good catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as co-catalyst up to <nUm> × <nUm> g-PE*mol-Zr-1*-1 . the good catalytic activities can be maintained even at high temperatures such as <nUm> C exhibiting the excellent thermal stability for these half - sandwich metal pre-catalysts . 
the copolymerizations of ethylene with 1-hexene or 1-octene by using Cl4Ti / Cl2Mg / THF catalysts modified with different metal halide additives ( Cl2Zn , Cl4Si , and the combined Cl2Zn - Cl4Si ) were investigated based on catalytic activity and copolymer properties . it was found that the catalyst modified with mixed Cl2Zn - Cl4Si revealed the highest activities for both ethylene / 1-hexene and ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization . the increase in activities was due to the formation of acidic sites by modifying the catalysts with lewis acids . based on the FTIR measurements , the characteristic C ? O ? C peaks of the catalysts modified with metal halide additives were slightly shifted to lower wavenumber when compared to the unmodified catalyst . this showed that the modified catalysts could generate more acid sites in the Cl4Ti / Cl2Mg / THF catalytic system leading to an increase in activities as well as comonomer insertion ( as proven by 13C - NMR ) . however , lewis acidmodifications did not affect the microstructure of the copolymers obtained . by comparison on the properties of copolymers prepared with the unmodified catalyst , it was found that polymers with Cl2Zn and / or Cl4Si modification exhibited a slight decrease in melting temperature , crystallinity and density . it is suggested that these results were obtained based on the different amount of a-olefins insertion , regardless of the types of lewis acids and comonomer . 
the example of the preparation of nano- and micro-scaled , coral - shaped and core - shell topological morphology of copolyethylene particles promoted by the novel heterogeneous non-metallocene catalyst (m-CH3PhO)TiCl3 / carbon nanotubes ( CNTs ) was reported . mass fraction of titanium component of the catalyst was <nUm> wt % determined by ICP analysis . the catalyst system can effectively catalyze polymerization of ethylene and copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene . morphological examination of the obtained polymer particles was carried out by scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) and high resolution transmission electron microscope ( HR - TEM ) technique . the results revealed that the morphology of the nascent copolyethylene particles looked like coral shape with size in micro-scaled and featured the core - shell structure consisting of CNTs as the core and copolyethylene as the shell . 
half - titanocene complexes bearing dibenzhydryl-substituted aryloxide ligands ( 2a-2d ) were prepared . among them , 2c adopted a three - legged distorted tetrahedral geometry evidenced by x-ray crystallography . the poly-1,3-butadiene with high molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution was obtained by using these complexes as the catalysts activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the catalytic activities of the complexes depended on their structures . the Ti ― O ― C bond in the complexes with large angle afforded them with higher activity , while cp* - based complexes exhibited lower activities than the cp - based analogues . the activity of complex increased with increasing the polymerization temperature while the selectivity remained no change , indicating the high thermal stability . furthermore , the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene catalyzed by 2a / MAO at <nUm> ° C has been found in a living fashion . 
several novel mono(b-enaminoketonato) vanadium complexes bearing constrained cyclic skeleton , including [ C13H8O = C(CH2)nCH = N-Ar]VCl2(THF)2 ( v3a : n = <nUm> , Ar = C6H5 ; v4a : n = <nUm> , Ar = C6H5 ; v4b : n = <nUm> , Ar = C6F5 ; v4c : n = <nUm> , Ar = C12H17 ; v5a : n = <nUm> , Ar = C6H5 ) , were synthesized and their structure and properties were characterized . the structures of v4c and v5a in solid - state were further confirmed by x-ray crystallographic analysis . density functional theory ( DFT ) results indicated that these complexes showed enhanced steric hindrance around the metal center as compared with the acyclic analogues . upon activation with Et2AlCl and in the presence of ethyl trichloroacetate as a reactivator , all of the complexes exhibited high catalytic activities ( <nUm> gPE / ( molV*h ) ) toward ethylene polymerization , and the obtained polymers exhibited unimodal distributions ( mw / Mn = <nUm> – <nUm> ) even produced at elevated temperatures ( <nUm> – <nUm> ° C ) and prolonged reaction time . when MAO was employed as a cocatalyst , they only showed moderate catalytic activities ( <nUm> gPE / ( molV*h ) ) , but the resulting polymers had higher molecular weights ( <nUm> – <nUm> kg / mol ) . these vanadium complexes with cyclic skeleton also showed high catalytic activities toward ethylene / norbornene copolymerization . the produced copolymers displayed approximate alternating structure at high in-feed concentration of norbornene . the catalytic capabilities of these complexes could be tuned conveniently by varying ligand structure . furthermore , the cyclic voltammetry results also proved that these complexes exhibited better redox stabilities than the complexes bearing linear skeleton . 
copolymerizations of ethylene and 1-dodecene were conducted with a series of ansa-fluorenylamidodimethyltitanium complexes , [t-BuNSiMe2Flu]TiMe2 ( 1a ) , [t-BuNSiMe2(2,7-tBu2Flu)]TiMe2 ( 1b ) , and [(1-adamantyl)NSiMe2(2,7-tBu2Flu)]TiMe2 ( 1c ) activated by modified methylaluminoxane . the activity increased by the introduction of the alkyl groups on the fluorenyl and amido ligands , and 1c produced the highest molecular weight copolymers . complex 1c also promoted copolymerization of ethylene and iBu3Al protected 10-undecen-1-ol with high activity ( ~ <nUm> kg*mol-1*h-1 ) , affording hydroxy-functionalized ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene . the hydroxy content of the copolymers obtained was controllable by changing comonomer feed ratio . the introduction of a small amount of hydroxy group can alter the surface properties of polyethylene . 
the syndiotactic polymerization of styrene ( st ) and the copolymerization of st with ethylene ( e ) were carried out by using a series of chiral half - sandwich rare - earth metal dialkyl complexes ( cpx* ) as the catalysts . the complexes are Ln(CH2SiMe3)2(THF) ( <nUm> − <nUm> : ln = Sc ( 1 ) , ln = Lu ( 2 ) , ln = Y ( 3 ) , ln = Dy ( 4 ) ) bearing chiral cyclopentadienyl ligand containing bulky cylcohexane derivatives in the presence of activator and AliBu3 . for the st polymerization , a high activity up to <nUm> × <nUm> g of polymer molLn -1*h-1 and a high syndiotactic selectivity more than <nUm> % were achieved . the resulting syndiotactic polystyrenes ( sPSs ) have the molecular weights ( Mn ) ranging from <nUm> g*mol-1 to <nUm> g*mol-1 and the molecular weight distributions ( mw / Mn ) from <nUm> to <nUm> . As for the copolymerization of st and e , the activity was up to <nUm> × <nUm> g of copolymer molSc-1*h-1*MPa-1 , giving random St-E copolymers containing syndiotactic polystyrene sequences with different st content in the range of <nUm> mol % − <nUm> mol % . these results demonstrate that the bulky cyclopentadienyl ligands of the chiral half - sandwich rare - earth metal complexes effectively inhibit the continued insertion of st monomers into the (co)polymer chain to some extent in comparison with the known half - sandwich rare - earth metal complexes . 
four C <nUm> -symmetric ansa - metallocene complexes , C <nUm> H <nUm> (Ind)(2,7- t bu <nUm> -Flu)ZrCl <nUm> ( 4 ) , C <nUm> H <nUm> (3-Bn-Ind)(2,7- t bu <nUm> -Flu)ZrCl <nUm> ( 5 ) , C <nUm> H <nUm> (3-Bn-Ind)(3,6- t bu <nUm> -Flu)ZrCl <nUm> ( 6 ) , and C <nUm> H <nUm> (3-Bn-Ind)(2,7- t bu <nUm> -Flu)HfCl <nUm> ( 7 ) , were synthesized and characterized . the structures of complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were further determined via x-ray diffraction studies . upon activation with modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) or Al i bu <nUm> / [ ph <nUm> C][B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( TIBA / TrB ) , most of these complexes showed high efficiency in catalyzing propylene oligomerization / polymerization to afford products dominantly with allyl terminals via selective b-methyl transfer ( b-Me transfer ) . the introduction of 3-benzyl group on the indenyl ring of the complexes was found to be crucial in enabling highly selective b-Me transfer during the polymerization process , leading to selectivities up to <nUm> % obtained by zirconocene complexes <nUm> and <nUm> , and up to <nUm> % obtained by hafnocene complex <nUm> . detailed chain - end analysis by <nUm> H - NMR , <nUm> C - NMR , and MALDI - TOF mass spectroscopy revealed that the allyl chain - ends of the polymeric products resulted from a selective b-Me transfer process after two successively primary insertions of the monomer . further studies concerning the dependence of chain release selectivity as well as the molecular weight of products on monomer concentration suggested that both b-Me transfer ( major ) and b-hydrogen transfer ( b-H transfer ) ( minor ) mediated by <nUm> / MMAO and <nUm> / MMAO systems may mainly operate in a bimolecular pathway . 
the bimodal polyethylene obtained from O2Ti - supported zirconocene / MAO catalyst was observed during polymerization of ethylene and ethylene / 1-hexene . by means of XPS , it revealed that O2Ti consisted of ti3+ ( BE = <nUm> eV ) and ti4+ ( BE = <nUm> eV ) . the dual catalytic sites were attributed to the presence of ti3+ and Ti 4+ in O2Ti .

In the presence of diethylaluminum chloride , both complexes <nUm> and <nUm> are highly active for ethylene oligomerization . the olefinic products can be easily separated from the catalytic ionic liquid phase by simple decantation , and the nickel catalysts can be reused in successive ethylene oligomerization cycles . GC-MS analyzes showed that the obtained oligomers contained mainly C4 , C6 , and C8 olefins .

based on the reaction between Cp2TiCl2 and substituted salicylic acids in the presence of b-cyclodextrin polymer ( b-CDP ) , three four - coordinated titanocene complexes [ ( e5- C5H5)2Ti(S,O')(OCC6H 4)*(C6H6)0.5 ] ( 1 ) , [ (e5-C5H5)2Ti{(O,O')(3,5- Cl2-OCC6H2 ) } ] ( 2 ) and [ ( e5- C5H5)2Ti{(O,O')(3,5-(NO2) 2-OCC6H2 ) } ] ( 3 ) were synthesized in high yields and their crystal structures have been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . the structure of <nUm> has a monoclinic space group P21 / c with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° and z = <nUm> . the structure of <nUm> has a monoclinic space group P21 / c with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° and z = <nUm> . the structure of <nUm> has a triclinic space group P-1 with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° and z = <nUm> . each of the complexes exhibits a three - dimensional framework constructed through weak interactions , which are hydrogen bonding , p-p stacking and C-H ⋯ π interactions . it was found that the variation of the substituted salicylate ligands affect the weak interactions as well as the specific framework structure that forms . graphical abstract : three four - coordinated titanocene complexes [ ( e5-C 5H5)2Ti(S,O')(OCC6H 4)*(C6H6)0.5 ] ( 1 ) , [ (e5-C5H5)2Ti{(O,O')(3,5- Cl2-OCC6H2 ) } ] ( 2 ) and [ ( e5- C5H5)2Ti{(O,O')(3,5-(NO2) 2-OCC6H2 ) } ] ( 3 ) were synthesized in high yields , each of the complexes exhibits a three - dimensional framework constructed through weak interactions . it was found that simple variation of the substituted salicylate ligands affect the weak interactions as well as the specific framework structure that forms . 
metallocenes , a class of organometallic compounds in which metal atoms are bonded to aromatic ring structures in a " p-bond " ( most commonly : pp-dp ) fashion have for the past half - century come to play a pre-eminent part in theoretical and applied research . ferrocene , di(e5- cyclopentadienyl)iron(II) , has undisputedly been the most outstanding representative of the class . this organoiron compound owes its leading position in a good measure to the unique electron occupancies and energies of its highest occupied molecular orbitals , permitting the ferrocene - ferricenium couple to interact with its chemical and physical environment via unusual oxidation - reduction and electron exchange reactions . on account of these outstanding redox properties , the ferrocene - ferricenium system , both monomeric and polymeric , proved its value in years gone by as a pivotal role player in rocket technology , and more recently it has found its most rewarding function in the biosciences . recognition in this laboratory of the significant antiproliferative and antineoplastic activities displayed by some water - soluble ferrocene derivatives , and , more particularly , by water - soluble ferricenium salts , set into operation a development program leading to the synthesis of macromolecular ferrocene conjugates in which the metallocene is bioreversibly connected to water - soluble , biocompatible and biodegradable carrier polymers . carrier - drug conjugates of this type are specifically designed to act as prodrugs , providing enhanced therapeutic effectiveness through increased drug bioavailability at the target site , a feature of pre-eminent value in the chemotherapy of cancerous diseases . the synthesized conjugates are of two types . the first type comprises polymers characterized by tertiary amine side group terminals as hydrosolubilizing entities , while the second contains conjugates with hydroxyl-terminated side chains serving that same purpose . cell culture tests , still ongoing , have been performed on conjugates of both types against the HeLa cell line commonly regarded as a drug - sensitive human cancer , and against the human colo , LNCaP , and caco lines representative of cancers distinguished by moderate to strong resistance to common anticancer drugs . some preliminary results are now available . the general conclusion to be drawn from those findings is that all tested conjugates irrespective of structural particulars are remarkably active antiproliferative agents . most outstanding are the results for the group of polymers possessing amine - type hydrosolubilizing units ( as against those with hydroxyl functionality ) , which indicate activities equal or superior to those of cisplatin co-tested for comparison . the data , in addition , permit the conclusion that for each conjugate the activity findings hardly change as one goes from the sensitive HeLa to the remaining resistant lines . comparing HeLa with colo results specifically , one observes , in fact , a trend of ever so slightly increasing activity values in that direction , suggesting the tested conjugates in toto to show a propensity , however moderate , for overcoming resistance problems . conjugates with amide - linked ferrocene as a group are superior performers in comparison with the ester - linked analogs . this trend could be associated in part with the preponderant fraction of hydroxyl-type solubilizing groups in the molecule , although the ester link must be implicated as well by some as yet unexplained mechanism . the findings here summarized show that the monomeric , neutral ferrocene compound , unable as such to achieve cell entry and exert cytotoxicity , will undergo efficient endocytosis in the carrier - bound state . liberated from the carrier in the lysosomal - endosomal compartment , it will cause eventual cell death , most probably after lysosomal oxidation to the ferricenium state . although the precise cytotoxic mechanism is not known , there is reasonable consensus to suggest that the affected cell 's nuclear DNA is not , in fact , attacked by the ferricenium cation directly but rather by secondary , catabolically generated reactive oxygen species , such as the aggressive hydroxyl free radical . what next ? which specific research goals should be defined for the subsequent phase of development of these conjugates ? how would one optimize their biological performance and prepare the way for eventual clinical trials ? the immediate project goal must be the design , synthesis , and in vitro screening of a considerably enlarged number of carriers and conjugates . this will include variations of polymer backbone and side chain structures with a view to increasing basicity ( for facilitated cell entry ) , protein repellence ( for enhanced conjugate inertness and half - life during serum residence ) , and , most importantly , ease of drug release ( e.g. by introduction of pH - sensitive cleavage sites in the drug - binding tether ) . biological evaluation efforts , initially restricted to in vitro testing , will focus on the determination of cytotoxic activities against a number of additional human cancer cell lines , notably those derived from moderately to strongly drug - resistant intestinal and metastatic neoplasias . also included should be cell cultures that are available both as sensitive parent lines and their drug - resistant sublines . In follow-on work further down the screening path , laying the foundation for combination therapies , leading ferrocene conjugate structures will be tested in combination with polymeric conjugates of other drug models , such as selected platinum compounds , methotrexate , 5-fluorouracil , or ARA-C . the results of such combination screens will form the basis for synthesis and bio-evaluation projects directed at macromolecular compounds in which ferrocene is co-conjugated to the same carrier together with other drug species . this will serve to create a unified pharmacokinetic pathway for the agents involved , leading to enhanced co-bioavailability . the ultimate goal of future programs , providing the preconditions for clinical trials , must logically be the determination of in vivo performance of selected conjugates and co-conjugates , including biodistribution studies , toxicological evaluation , and antineoplastic activity screening against explanted human cancers . the biological in vitro results available at this time augur exceptionally well for the future performance profile of ferrocene polymers in the fight against cancer .

polymers in general and metal - containing polymers in particular are often sparingly soluble or insoluble , in contrast to small molecules . thus , special significance is attached to characterization techniques that can be applied to the materials as solids . here , three techniques are discussed that give structural information gained from the solid material . mossbauer spectroscopy is a powerful technique that may give information on the structure about the metal - containing moiety for about <nUm> different nuclei . its use in describing the structure of the product obtained from organotin dichlorides and the unsymmetrical ciprofloxacin is presented along with the reaction implications of the results . solid state NMR is also a useful tool in describing the structure of metal - containing polymers and its use is briefly described . finally , MALDI MS can be used to gain structural information . for many metals it is particularly useful because of the presence of different isotopes that allow the identification of units through comparison of these isotope abundances with ion fragment clusters . each of these tools can provide important structural characterization information .

In comparison with other metal / camphoric acid polymers , the metallocene polymers exhibit low EC50 to the nanogram / ml range , and CI50 values greater than one thousand for the hafnocene and zirconocene products . if this trend continues , the emphasis should be on the group IVB metallocenes with respect to efforts to create anticancer drugs . 
organotin polyesters were synthesized from d-camphoric acid . since d-camphoric acid is a natural product , this is part of the green chemistry initiative . further , synthesis occurred employing commercially available reactants and the interfacial system which is used industrially to synthesize aramids and polycarbonates . thus , scale-up is straightforward . polymers were synthesized employing the interfacial reaction between various organotin dihalides and the salt of d-camphoric acid . reaction was rapid occurring in <nUm> s and less . product yield was good except for the product from dioctyltin dichloride . the products are polymeric with chain lengths from <nUm> to <nUm> . structural characterization with infrared spectrometry and MALDI MS are consistent with the formation of organotin polyesters containing the camphoric acid moiety within its backbone .

polyethylene nanocomposites were prepared by in-situ polymerization technique by using highly active metallocene catalyst zirconocene ( cp 2ZrCl2 ) in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the influence of different concentrations ( <nUm> , 0.6,0.83,1.6 and <nUm> wt. % ) of nano calcium zirconate on catalytic activity and polymer properties was investigated . there was a steep increase in the activity of zirconocene catalyst ( from <nUm> to 185[?] × [?]10-3 g-PE / mol h bar , ) by addition <nUm> wt. % of the nanofiller the results of differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , crystallization analysis fractionation ( CRYSTAF ) and wide angle x-ray diffraction ( WAXD ) show that the percentage crystallinity was influenced with respect to the nanofiller concentration . microcalorimeter was used to study the effect of nanofiller on the pyrolysis of polyethylene . the fibrils morphology appearing on the fractured surface was reduced significantly with the addition of nanofiller as is evident from SEM morphology . 
A series of n-n-alkylpyridinium chloroaluminate ionic liquids [ C < inf > n < / inf > -py][AlCl < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ] ( where n-alkyl = n-butyl , n-hexyl , and n-octyl ) was applied as a medium of the cp < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ClTi < inf > <nUm> < / inf > catalyst , activated by AlEtCl < inf > <nUm> < / inf > or AlEt < inf > <nUm> < / inf > Cl , to evaluate the influence of the studied ionic liquids on the performance of the biphasic ionic liquid / hexane ethylene polymerization and the properties of the produced polyethylene ( PE ) . the best results were obtained using n-n-butylpyridinium chloroaluminate . the polyethylene obtained in the biphasic polymerization have the high crystallinity , which was confirmed by DSC , WAXS and PALS methods , as well as the bulk density comparable to commercial HDPE . these unique properties results from the biphasic mode of the ethylene polymerization where the ionic liquid is used to immobilize the catalyst , and polyethylene is produced in the ionic liquids phase . 
A series of six mono b-diiminato titanium complexes with varying fluorine - substitution patterns on the iminophenyl moiety were designed and synthesized , and the ethylene polymerization activities were studied with modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) as cocatalyst . the introduction of fluorine substituents significantly increased the catalytic activity of the b-diiminato titanium complexes compared with their alkyl-substituted counterparts . furthermore , both the position and the amount of fluorine substitution greatly influenced the catalytic behavior . the activity was increased when the ortho-positions of the n-aryl were substituted by fluorine , and the more ortho-positions were substituted , the higher the activity . all of the three o-fluoro substituted complexes ( 2a , 2e and 2f ) exhibited very high activity ( up to <nUm> gmol-1 h-1 atm-1 ) ; whereas the m- and p-fluoro derivatives ( 2b and 2c ) were much less active . the high activity of the o-fluoro-substituted complexes is suggested to be due to the formation of non-covalent interactions between the o-fluorine atom and the ethylene monomer , which may assist in the enrichment and coordination of ethylene to the central metal , thus increase the catalytic activity . 
A new titanium ( IV ) complex , dichlorobis(salicylato)titanium(IV) [TiL2Cl2] ( 1 ) { LH = salicylic acid } has been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis , 1H NMR , 13C NMR , IR and UV - visible spectroscopy . As a post-metallocene complex it 's olefin polymerization activity has been investigated at room temperature in aqueous emulsion . In presence of tetraphenylborate as cocatalyst , it has been found to exhibit moderate to high activity in the range of <nUm> in homopolymerization and copolymerization of styrene and methyl methacrylate to produce syndiotactic rich , ultrahigh molecular weight polymers with low molecular weight distribution . the polymer latex produced has been analyzed by DLS , HRTEM and FESEM which revealed that the latex is highly stable and contains polymer particles having size around <nUm> nm . the microstructures , molecular weights and thermal properties of the polymers have also been determined by 1H - NMR , 13CNMR , GPC and DSC analysis . the polymers have also been characterized by 1H - NMR , 13C - NMR , GPC and DSC analysis . 
the successive self - nucleation / annealing technique ( SSA ) by differential scanning calorimetry has been applied to study the heterogeneity of ethylene-hexene-1 copolymers produced with supported catalytic systems of different compositions : highly active supported ziegler - natta ( Z-N ) catalysts - a titanium - magnesium catalyst Cl4Ti / Cl2Mg ( TMC ) and a vanadium - magnesium catalyst Cl4V / Cl2Mg ( VMC ) , a supported zirconocene catalyst Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 / OSi <nUm> ( MAO ) , and a chromium - oxide catalyst CrO3 / OSi <nUm> . comparative data by SSA technique with the same temperature program were obtained for copolymers differed by MWD from narrow to very broad ( mw / Mn = 2.4-54 ) and short chain branching distribution from narrow ( zirconocene catalyst ) to very broad ( TMC and chromium oxide catalysts ) . it is demonstrated that copolymers produced with the zirconocene catalyst have the narrowest melting range and do not contain thick lamellae . the widest lamella thickness distribution has been found for a copolymer produced with the chromium - oxide catalyst . copolymers produced with the supported Z-N catalysts are ranked in the middle with a more narrow lamella thickness distribution for copolymer prepared with VMC as compared with the one produced with TMC . the SSA results are compared with the data on copolymer fractionation by TREF . it is shown that these methods give a good correlation for copolymers with narrow short - chain branching distribution produced with the supported zirconocene catalyst . In the case of copolymers produced with TMC , TREF yields a higher content of the high - branched fractions . 
the heterogenized reaction products of the partial hydrolysis of the organoaluminum compounds AlMe3 and Al(i-Bu)3 with water as a constituent of highly hydrated supports , zeolite ( ZSM-5-H2O ) and montmorillonite ( MMT-H2O ) , have been synthesized . the thermal degradation of the resulting heterogenized methylalumoxane compound and methylalumoxane ( MAO ) in a solid state is studied by temperature - programmed desorption with the mass - spectrometric analysis of liberated gaseous products , and the structural identity of the above compounds is found . alkylalumoxanes prepared immediately on the surface of a support form heterogenized complexes with the metallocenes Cp2ZrCl2 and Et(Ind) 2ZrCl2 . these heterogenized complexes exhibit high activity in the reactions of ethylene and propylene polymerization . for this reason , MAO can be replaced by AlMe3 or Al(i-Bu)3 and the additional introduction of MAO or another alkylaluminum for zirconocene activation is unnecessary . it has been found that , upon the immobilization of commercial MAO on dehydrated O2Si , the MAO molecule loses a portion of its most reactive methyl groups and , as a result of this , becomes incapable of activating metallocenes . 
solid - phase synthesis has contributed to a significant portion of combinatorial libraries made to date . among many advantages of solid - phase organic synthesis , one unique property is the pseudo-dilution effect . In reality , polymer support is a dynamic system and its structural mobility is controlled by many intrinsic and external factors such as cross-linking , load , solvent , temperature and incoming reagent concentrations . site - site interaction can often occur and affect the direction of the intended reaction . 
the mechanism of the cycloaddition of CO2 with propylene oxide to afford propylene carbonate catalyzed by a highly active trans- dichlorotetrapyridineruthenium [trans-Ru(py)4Cl2] complex and tetrabutylammonium chloride ( TBAC ) has been studied by means of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( ESI-MS ) , structural characterization of trans-Ru(py)4Cl2 , catalyst activity tests and so on . further experiments demonstrated that the tributylamine formed in situ was involved in the catalysis and that addition of butyl chloride to re-convert the tributylamine into TBAC resulted in the inhibition of the reaction . the mechanistic study explains the reported early experimental observations well and provides a clear profile for the cycloaddition of carbon dioxide with propylene oxide using trans-Ru(py)4Cl2 as catalyst . the mechanism also fully explains the role of the TBAC by providing a role for the in situ generated tributylamine in activating the carbon dioxide . 
the reactions of components of the catalytic systems C20H20Zr – MAO and C20H20Ti – MAO in the absence and in the presence of the monomer were studied in order to obtain information on the mechanism of polymerization and copolymerization of ethylene . it was shown that the reactions accompanied by a change in the coordination mode of the ligands in the metallocene complex , a change in the coordination number of the transition metal , and the reduction of the transition metal can occur in these systems . A mechanism for the interaction of components in the indicated catalytic systems was proposed on the basis of our results obtained by various physicochemical methods and literature data . 
supported catalysts Al2O3 / Cp2ZrX2 and Al2FO3 / Cp2ZrX2 ( x = me , Cl ) for the ethylene polymerization were synthesized by anchoring zirconocene on alumina and alumina , modified with <nUm> – <nUm> wt % fluorine ( Al2FO3 ) . the study revealed that Al2FO3 / Cp2ZrMe2 catalysts are active in ethylene polymerization in the absence of organoaluminum cocatalyst , whereas Al2FO3 / Cp2ZrCl2 catalysts are active in the presence of triisobutylaluminum as a co-catalyst . the metallocene complex was strongly anchored on the support . active component leaching was not observed during polymerization . the acid – base properties of Al2FO3 were studied by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed probe molecules : CO , pyridine and CDCl3 . A maximum activity of the catalysts was observed in the case of the Al2O3(5 % F ) support , containing lewis acid sites with absorption bands ( nCO ) at <nUm> – <nUm> cm-1 , bronsted acid sites with a proton affinity ( PA ) of <nUm> kJ / mol , and weak basic sites with PA <nUm> and <nUm> kJ / mol . “ cationic - like ” complexes formed on the lewis acid sites with absorption bands at <nUm> − <nUm> cm-1 are inactive at ethylene polymerization . 
A new procedure was developed for the synthesis of a broad range of ansa - zirconocenes containing bis(2-methyl-4-arylindenyl)dimethylsilane ligands . the method is based on the palladium - catalyzed reaction of halogen - substituted bis(indenyl)dimethylsilanes with various organozinc compounds . the aryl-substituted bridging ligands thus prepared serve as the starting compounds for the synthesis of ansa - zirconocenes , which can be used as components of promising catalysts for propylene polymerization . 
isobutylalumoxanes of different composition were synthesized by the hydrolysis of triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) with crystalline hydrate CuOS 4*5H2O and water taken as cooled ice or as vapor . the composition of the formed alumoxanes and the degree of water participation in their formation was monitored by 1H NMR . the hydrolysis of TIBA on CuSO4*5H2O is rather selective method of synthesis of alumoxanes . the synthesized alumoxanes were used for the activation of dimethylated zirconocenes rac-Me2Si(2-Me,4-PhInd) 2ZrMe2 and rac-Et(2-MeInd)2ZrMe2 in propylene polymerization at the molar ratios Al / Zr = 50-750 . it was concluded that the hydrolysis afforded several products with different structures and different activating ability . the systems with oligomeric forms of isobutylalumoxanes , especially those obtained by TIBA hydrolysis with water , showed the highest activity . 
metallacycles of transition metals are generally of great interest because of their multifaceted structural chemistry and they are often discussed as key intermediates in multiple catalytic processes , whereupon recent studies are dealing with the participation of metallacycles in polymerization as well as oligomerization reactions . synthesis and characterization of the titanocene bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complex cp < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ti(e < sup > <nUm> < / sup > -Me < inf > <nUm> < / inf > CSi < inf > <nUm> < / inf > SiMe < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) paved the way towards the discovery of three - membered metallacyclopropenes of group <nUm> metals ( titanium , zirconium , and , later , hafnium ) having their own history which is strongly connected with the names of m . E. volpin and his co-workers . starting from these compounds the very unusual ring - strained " all-C " -five-membered metallacyclocumulenes , metallacyclopentynes , and metalla-cycloallenes of group <nUm> metals were obtained and characterized having all their roots in volpins chemistry . this mini review gives an overview of these unusual molecules as well as some more common molecules like metallacyclopentanes , metallacyclopentenes , and metalla-cyclopentadienes . very recently instead of these " all-C " -metallacycles the analogous heteroring systems ( with N , S , O atoms instead of C ) as well as the smaller four - membered metallacycles became the focus of our interest . 
an efficient mediated electrosynthesis of the spherical ( <nUm> nm ) nanocomposite material Pd @ p(MVCA8+-co-St) was carried out in an aqueous medium . ultrasmall palladium nanoparticles ( <nUm> — <nUm> nm ) are stabilized in nanocapsules of water - soluble nanoparticles of the copolymer p(MVCA8+-co-St) consisting of tetraviologen calix[4]resorcinol ( MVCA8+ ) with styrene ( st ) . the role of the mediator is played by viologen units of a polymer nanoparticle at potentials of the MV2+ / MV[?]+ redox couple . the high catalytic activity of the nanocomposite material in the reduction of nitrophenol with sodium borohydride is shown . 
A series of symmetric and nonsymmetric tetrahydroindenyl zirconium complexes was obtained by the reaction of Cl4Zr or (CpTMS)ZrCl3 with lithium salts of the corresponding tetrahydroindenes . activated with methylalumoxane , these complexes exhibit high activity in polymerization of ethylene ( up to 6.8[?]106 g PE ( mol Zr h ) – <nUm> ) , as well as in copolymerization of ethylene and hex-1-ene ( up to 8.6[?]106 g PE ( mol Zr h ) – <nUm> ) . 
the role of Ti (II) sandwich complex , [ cp <nUm> Ti ] , generated by the combination of [ cp <nUm> ClTi <nUm> ] and two equivalents of n BuLi , in situ , in toluene has been investigated theoretically for the release of H <nUm> from a series of liquid organic hydrogen carriers ( LOHCs ) , mainly alcohols or diols of low molecular weights . the compounds with hydroxyl functionality considered here are methanol , ethanol , isopropanol , methanediol , and ethylene glycol . satisfactory results have also been obtained on applying the same mechanism to two other compounds with amino functionality , viz. , methanediamine and ethylene diamine . the exploration has been carried out using density functional theory ( DFT ) . our findings reveal that the reaction is initiated with the formation of an adduct of the Ti center of sandwich complex , [ cp <nUm> Ti ] , with O / N atom of the compound under investigation . from the adduct thus formed , H <nUm> - release is possible via two routes . In one of the paths , O / N – H bond breaks first , followed by the cleavage of C – H bond , and in the other path , C – H bond breaking takes place prior to the scission of O / N – H bond . our results show that the second path is thermodynamically and kinetically more preferable for the release of H <nUm> . thus , [ cp <nUm> Ti ] can be highly effective in releasing one equivalent of H <nUm> from alcohols and compounds with amino functionalities , and more importantly , removal of two equivalents of H <nUm> from methanediol is possible using [ cp <nUm> Ti ] , which is significant in terms of hydrogen storage purpose . 
A new tetraoxime ligand , ( 2E , 3E , 9E , 10E)-1 , <nUm> , <nUm> , 11- tetraazacyclotetradecane-2 , <nUm> , <nUm> , 10-tetrone tetraoxime has been prepared by the template condensation of 1,3-propanediamine and cyanogen-di-N-oxide , obtained by treating ( e , e)-dichloroglyoxime in CH <nUm> Cl <nUm> with Na <nUm> CO <nUm> at <nUm> ° C . the coordination chain polymers { [ ( pnngH <nUm> ) <nUm> Ni ] n ( 5 ) and [ ( pncgH <nUm> ) <nUm> Cu ] n ( 6 ) } of two transition metal ions , [ Ni (II) and Cu (II) ] with the vic - dioxime ligand have been prepared . the oxime ligand acts as a polydentate ligand bending through nitrogen atoms in the presence of a base , as do most of the vic - dioximes . In the complexes , the chloride ions coordinate to the nickel and copper ions . the structures of these novel vic - dioxime compounds are proposed on the basis of the elemental analyses , molar conductance data , i.r. , and u.v. - visible are presented . elemental analyses indicate a ligand metal ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> in the coordination polymers . conductivity measurements have shown that mono- and polynuclear complexes are non-electrolytes . In addition , anti-microbial activities of the compounds have been investigated . 
the substituted metallocene compounds Cp2M(OSO 2CF3)2 ( cp = e5-C 5H5 ; m = Ti , Zr , Hf , Nb , Mo ) , CpTi(OSO2CF 3)3 • 0.75(1,2-dimethoxyethane) , and the organo-main group compounds (C6H5)3M'(OSO 2CF3 ) ( M' = Si , Ge ) , ( C6H5 ) 2Sn(OSO2CF3)2 and ( C 6H5)3Sb(OSO2CF3) <nUm> , were synthesized from the corresponding chloride or bromide compounds and silver trifluoromethanesulfonate ( triflate ) and characterized spectroscopically , including a detailed analysis of their IR spectra . triflate coordination is typically monodentate , but CpTi(OSO2CF 3)3 • 0.75(1,2-dimethoxyethane) and the organo-germanium triflate show evidence of bidentate CF3OS <nUm> - ligands and are likely to have polymeric structures . conductance measurements in nitromethane , acetone and acetonitrile have demonstrated the ease of triflate substitution , with a limited kinetic study of acetone solvation of the Ti and Hf compounds supporting an associative pathway . three new catalysts for the polymerization of tetrahydrofuran , cp 2HfCl2 / AgCF3O3S , CpTiCl <nUm> / AgCF3O3S and ( C6H 5)2SiCl2 / AgCF3O3S , are also reported . 
some zirconium compounds containing chelating diamido dipyrrole or tetra-amido tetra-pyrrole ligands were synthesized and used as polymerization catalyst with high polymerization activity of ethylene at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> bar , in presence of MAO or BC18F15 as co-catalyst . the maximum catalytic activity reached <nUm> kg / mol bar h for ethylene polymerization by zr2(octa-phenyl calix[4]pyrrolidine)Cl4 . these results reveal that half - zirconocene like complexes including four terminal chlorine and one calix[4]pyrrolidine in middle with both π and s-interaction have the highest ethylene polymerization turnover ( compounds <nUm> , <nUm> ) . 
group <nUm> bis(phenoxyimine) and related complexes are highly active olefin polymerization catalysts of the post-metallocene family . when activated with methylalumoxane , titanium complexes bearing o-fluoroaryl substituents can conduct living polymerization of ethylene and propylene . In spite of more than 10-year history of such catalysts , the origin of living behavior of such catalysts remains open to questions . this work presents the state of the art of the discussion on the living nature of single - site post-metallocene titanium based catalysts bearing o-fluoroaryl substituents . recent experimental and theoretical results are discussed . 
half - sandwich zirconium complex <nUm> containing tridentate carborane [S,S,O] ligand <nUm> [ (HOC6H2R2-4,6)(CH2) B10CH10S C(Ph)2P = S , r = t bu ] was synthesized by the reaction of CpZrCl3 ( cp = η 5-C 5H5 ) with sodium salt of ligand <nUm> . zirconium complex <nUm> was characterized by elemental and NMR analyses . DFT calculations were also performed on complex <nUm> to analyze the stereochemistry . the results from DFT calculations indicate that structure S1 , in which no sulfur atom bonds to the zirconium atom , exists at the lowest energy level . In the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , complex <nUm> exhibited good catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization and long life - time up to <nUm> h . moreover , the complex <nUm> / MAO system displayed excellent catalytic activities toword ethylene copolymerization with 1-hexene or polar olefins . 
the cyclocopolymerization of 1,6-heptadiene ( HPD ) with ethylene ( e ) by a series of half - sandwich scandium alkyl catalysts bearing various auxiliary ligands have been examined . significant ligand influence on the copolymerization activity and selectivity was observed . In combination with one equivalent of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] , the half - sandwich scandium dialkyl complexes bearing a lewis base THF ( 1 ) or an NHC side arm ( 2 ) yielded the copolymer products together with cross-linked polymers in the copolymerization of HPD with ethylene . In contrast , the THF - free complexes Cp'Sc(CH2C6H4NMe2-o)2 ( <nUm> : cp ' = CH ; <nUm> : cp ' = C5Me4SiMe <nUm> ) and the phosphine oxide side - arm containing complex ( C 5Me4SiMe2CH2(O)PPh 2)Sc(CH2SiMe3)2 ( 5 ) showed excellent activity and selectivity for the cyclocopolymerization reaction , without giving cross-linked products . the 1H and 13C NMR analyses revealed that the resulting copolymers consist of E-E sequences and six - membered ring methylene-1,3-cyclohexane ( MCH ) and five - membered ring ethylene-1,2-cyclopentane ( ECP ) units . the HPD content in the copolymer products could be easily controlled by changing the feeding amount of HPD under <nUm> atm of ethylene . 
the bis(b-diketonato) Zr complexes CpZr(acac)2Cl ( acac = acetylacetonato ) ( 1 ) and Cp*Zr(acac)2Cl ( 2 ) can be synthesized by the reaction of Cp'ZrCl3(Cp' = cp or cp* ) with <nUm> equiv of lithium acetylacetonate . CpZr(acac)2Cl ( 1 ) can be quantitatively prepared by treatment of Cp2ZrCl2 with excess acetylacetone . the tris(b-diketonato) Zr complex CpZr(tfac) <nUm> ( tfac = trisfluoroacetylacetonato ) ( 3 ) has been prepared by treatment of CpZrCl3 with sodium trisfluoroacetylacetonate . the replacement of both chlorine atoms and one cp group from zirconocene dichloride by nonfluorinated diketone , acetylacetone , readily occurs at room temperature in triethylamine medium , offering the tris(b-diketonato) Zr complex CpZr(acac)3 ( 4 ) . the complexes were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopic methods . In addition , the molecular structures of complexes <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined by x-ray diffraction methods . when activated by excess methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , these complexes were active for ethylene polymerization , offering polyethylenes with high molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions . complex <nUm> showed a very high ethylene polymerization activity of up to <nUm> kg PE / mol zr*h at <nUm> atm . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were also active for ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization . 
Nano-TiO <nUm> particles with a range of crystallite sizes were synthesized by a conventional sol - gel method , and then used as nanoparticle substrates in the synthesis of LLDPE / OTi <nUm> nanocomposites via in situ polymerization of ethylene / 1-hexene with zirconocene / MMAO catalyst . it was found that the size of the nano-TiO <nUm> crystallite nanoparticles can influence the catalytic activity in the polymerization system . the larger nano-TiO <nUm> crystallites provided better catalytic activity in the polymerization system due to more space for monomer attack . In addition , by thermo - gravimetric analysis , it can be seen that the larger nano-TiO <nUm> crystallites also exhibited lower interaction with available MMAO . consequently , the MMAO reacted more efficiently with the zirconocene catalyst during the activation process , and enhanced polymerization catalysis . all the polymer nanocomposites products did not have well defined melting temperature indicating non-crystalline polymers . this is due to the high amount of hexene incorporation ( based on 13C NMR ) . the difference in crystallite sizes of the nano-TiO <nUm> also affected how 1-hexene became incorporated into the polymer nanocomposites . the smaller crystallite size of nano-TiO <nUm> allowed greater 1-hexene incorporation due to depression of the reactivity of the ethylene . the contribution of this work helps develop a better understanding of the role of nano-TiO <nUm> in the catalytic activity of the polymerization system and in the microstructure of the polymer composite product . however , this study only considers work on the laboratory scale , so for commercial application of these results , it is necessary to scale up the polymerization process . it is only at this stage , that other physical properties , such as the mechanical properties of these materials can be sensibly determined . 
approaches for control over polymer chain growth under radical initiation polymerization with the use of organometallic compounds are considered . the effect of metallocomplexes on the kinetic parameters of polymerization , the molecular - mass characteristics of macromolecules , and the structure and composition of the copolymers has been analyzed by the example of specific compounds . it has been shown that , in some cases , transition - metal complexes may be regarded as reversible scavengers of radicals and efficient agents of controlled free - radical polymerization . the main pathways of interaction of propagation radicals with organometallic compounds , including the reversible acceptance of macroradicals by metallocomplexes , have been estimated . 
Ansa-Cyclohexyl-bis(4,5,6,7-tertrahydro-1-indenyl) zirconium dichloride ( 5 ) was used as catalyst for propylene and ethylene polymerization together with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) as the cocatalyst . isotactic polypropylene ( PP ) was obtained with the highest activity of <nUm> × <nUm> g PP ( molZr ) -1h-1 . the meso-meso ( mmmmm ) pentads sequence content of PP was determined by 13C NMR spectroscopy . the dependence of the microstructure on the reaction temperature and the Al / Zr molar ratio was examined and the catalytic activity of complex <nUm> was compared with that of the similar ansa - zirconocene <nUm> . the high activity of the new zirconocene <nUm> for propylene isospectic polymerization at high temperature ( <nUm> ° C ) is the result of its unique bridged - group structure . complex <nUm> / MAO displays also high catalytic activity of <nUm> × <nUm> to <nUm> × <nUm> g PE(molZr)-1h-1 in the homo-polymerization of ethylene . the visometric molecular weight of PE ranges from <nUm> × <nUm> to <nUm> × <nUm> g*mol-1 under the given conditions . 13C NMR spectroscopy analysis proves the PE to be linear polyethylene ( LPE ) . 
the condensation of acetylacetone ( C5H6O2 <nUm> ) with benzdine ( H2N-C6H4-C 6H4-NH2 ) yielded diimine ligand <nUm> [ HOC(Me)C(H)(Me)C = N(p-C6H4)(C6H 4-p)N = C(Me)C(H)C(Me)OH ) ] , which was converted into sodium salts . and then the sodium salts reacted with monosalicylaldiminato titanium complex 2{[3,5-di-Bu t -2-(O)C6H2CHN(PH)]TiCl 3(THF) } in dried dichloromethane to give a new benzdine - bridged binuclear complex 3{[3,5-di-Bu t -2-(O)C6H 2CHN(PH)]2[OC(Me)C(H)(Me)C = N(p-C6H 4)-(C6H4-p)N = C(Me)C(H) C(Me)]Ti 2Cl4 . the complex <nUm> was characterize by 1HNMR and elemental analysis . In the presence of MAO(methylaluminoxane) , the complex <nUm> in toluene was effective to catalyze polymerization , affording moderately high catalytic activity <nUm> × <nUm> g PE / (mol*Ti*h)]and high molecular weight polyethylene [ <nUm> × <nUm> g / mol ] . the high temperature gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) curve of polyethylene obtained revealed a single peak , but the molecular weight distribution ( MWD = <nUm> ) is obviously broader than that of the similar mononuclear titanium complex . the melting points of the obtained polyethylene reaches <nUm> ° C , indicating that the polyethylene is of high crystallinity . 
effects of structural variations of the diimine ligand on catalyst activities for vinyl polymerization of norbornene ( NB ) have been investigated by a series of Ni (II) a-diimine catalysts of the general formula : [ { ArN = AcC - AcC = NAr}]NiBr2 ( Ac = acenaphthyl ) ( Cat(H) , Ar = C 6H5 ; Cat(2,6-Me) , Ar = 2,6-C6H3Me <nUm> ; Cat(2,6-Et) , Ar = 2,6-C6H3Et2 ; cat(2,6- i Pr ) , Ar = 2,6-C6H3 i-Pr2 ; Cat(2,3-Me) , Ar = 2,3-C6H3Me2 ; Cat(2,4-Me) , Ar = 2,4-C 6H3Me2 ; Cat(2,5-Me) , Ar = 2,5-C6H 3Me2 ; Cat(3,5-Me) , Ar = 3,5-C6H 3Me2 ; Cat(2,4,6-Me) , Ar = 2,4,6-C6H 2Me3 ) . In situ reactions with methylaluminoxane generated the active catalysts , and they showed good activity towards NB polymerizations . As indicated by relatively higher activities of Cat(H) and Cat(3,5-Me) , it can be generalized that catalysts having 2,6-substituents are less active due to steric interaction between monomer and substituents . In addition , electron donating methyl groups at 2- , 4-or 6-position on the n-aryl have a con effect and that at 3,5-position has a pro effect . 
three types of nanoporous silica support were modified by methylaluminoxane MAO and characterized by using BET , SEM , XRD and TGA . dimethylsilyl (N-tert-butylamido)(tetramethylcyclopentadienyl) titanium dichlride was synthesized and immobilized on modified support . the prepared complex was then used as a reactive catalyst for ethylene polymerization . the effect of immobilization conditions on catalyst performance was studied . the results revealed elevated temperature grafting , decrease in precatalyst loading . also , increasing of immobilization reaction time showed an increase in activity to <nUm> kg poly / mol ti.h.bar . the effects of polymerization temperature and [Al] / [Ti] ratio on the catalyst behavior , namely activity and bulk density , were investigated . according to the results , the activity of single - site catalyst depends on condition of immobilization and structure of nanoporous silica support . 
conventional UV - curable formulations consist of photoinitiators , multifunctional monomers and oligomers , reactive diluents , pigments , and additives . while photoinitiators are the key components of the formulations and responsible for the absorption of light and relevant performances ( e.g. , cure speed , high - percent conversion , etc. ) , the final properties of the cured coating are governed by the other high - volume components . with recent advances in the use of nanomaterials like metals , metal oxides , and silicates in coatings , it is now possible to prepare nanocoatings with enhanced physical , chemical , and biological properties . this is due , in part , to the difference in surface area per unit of volume at the nanoscale . nanocoatings are usually prepared by UV irradiation of formulations containing dispersed nanoparticles . however , the homogeneous dispersion of these nanoparticles is a key challenge due to their easy agglomeration arising from their high surface - free energy . it is often difficult to obtain well - dispersed formulations providing good transmission of light for a complete cure . In this article , we report several synthetic methodologies for the preparation of epoxy and (meth)acrylate - based nanocoatings containing clay or metal nanoparticles . In the former case , photolysis of intercalated photoinitiator within the layers of montmorillonite clay in the presence of monomers resulted in the in situ formation of exfoliated structures . for the preparation of metal nanocoatings , the formation of silver or gold nanoparticles and crosslinking are accomplished simultaneously by photoinduced electron transfer and polymerization processes . the nanoparticles are homogenously distributed in the network without macroscopic agglomeration . applicability to both free radical and cationic systems is demonstrated . moreover , a novel photochemical route for grafting from the self - assembled monolayers on gold is presented . 
this review is mainly devoted to the chiral - optical behavior in the solid state of racemic synthetic polymers , which are able to form co-crystalline phases with low molecular mass guest molecules and whose chirality is induced by non-racemic ( also temporary ) guest molecules . the article starts with the description of chiral features relevant for the synthesis of stereoregular polymers . subsequently , the chirality of chain helicity and the related phenomena of macromolecular amplification of chirality , both in solution and in the solid state , are discussed . the final part of the article describes the recent achievement of robust chiral - optical films being constituted by a racemic commercial host polymer and achiral guest chromophores . 
the development of the homogeneous metallocene / methylaluminoxane catalyst for the polymerization of olefin has widely increased the possibilities in controlling the polymer composition , polymer structure , tacticity and special properties with high precision compared to the heterogeneous ziegler – natta and phillips catalysts . metallocene catalysts allow the synthesis of isotactic , isoblock , syndiotactic , stereoblock or atactic polymers , as well as polyolefin composite materials with superior properties and low content of extractables . the homogeneous character of metallocene - based catalysts leads to a better understanding of the mechanism of the olefin polymerization and allows the synthesis of optically active olefin oligomers using chiral transition metal complexes . these single - site catalysts are able to copolymerize ethene and propene with short- and long - chained a-olefins , cyclic olefins , or polar vinyl monomers such as ethers , alcohols or esters . such copolymers are suitable for blends of polyolefins with polyethers and other polar polymers because of an excellent adhesion of the two polymers . In the future , polyolefin nanocomposites and tailored copolymers open up the approach to new classes of materials with great property combinations such as improved stiffness , high gas barrier properties , significant flame retardancy , and high crystallization rates . 
V.The synthesis of poly(norbornene ester)s by using a ( e3-substituted allyl ) palladium ( N - heterocyclic carbene ( NHC ) ) complex as catalyst was performed and the relationship between chemical structure and glass transition temperature or refractive index of poly(norbornene ester)s was investigated . norbornene ester monomers were synthesized via esterification of 5-norbornene-2-methyl alcohol and aromatic carboxylic acids . the polymerization catalyst , ( e3-substituted allyl ) palladium ( NHC ) complex , was synthesized according to a published procedure . 1H - NMR spectroscopy was performed to determine chemical structure of monomers and polymers . the molecular weight of the polymers was measured via gel permeation chromatography and the thermal properties were analyzed via thermogravimetric analysis and dynamic mechanical analysis . refractive indices of polymer films were measured using a prism coupler . polymers with the highest Mn ( between <nUm> kg / mol and <nUm> kg / mol ) were synthesized when the ratio of monomer to catalyst was <nUm> : <nUm> . the glass transition temperature of synthesized polymers was about <nUm> ° C lower than that of conventional norbornene polymers . among the six polymers of different chemical structures , four polymers exhibited a refractive index of <nUm> or more at a wavelength in the visible light region . 
the effect of three group IV metals ( titanium , zirconium and tin ) on the growth , morphology and chemical composition of the freshwater diatom synedra acus subsp. radians ( kutzing ) skabichevsky was studied and compared with germanium . the elements in their highest oxidation states were introduced into the culture medium in the form of hydroxides . germanium was found to be toxic at ≥ <nUm> mol . % of the total Ge-Si content in the culture medium . In the presence of other elements , a slight decrease in the cell division rate was observed independent of the element within 1-15 % content interval . the analysis of the obtained biomass and silica valves revealed the presence of all the added elements within the cells . however , only germanium was incorporated into the valves in considerable amounts . S. acus cultivation with the addition of <nUm> % group IV elements resulted in cells having the following aberrations in the structure of the silica valves : changes in valve shape , thickening of valves , alterations of the areolae rows , irregularity or absence of the areolae and a decrease in the mechanical strength of valves . moreover , the effect of group IV elements on silica formation was simulated in vitro using a synthetic polymer bearing polyamine and phosphate groups found in silaffines ( proteins from diatom frustules ) . the studied elements were observed to provoke the formation of unstable silica particles in solution . we propose that the observed effects of germanium , titanium , zirconium and tin on diatom growth and structure are due to uncontrollable silica condensation .

V.Abstract : rice husk is an agricultural waste abundantly available from rice production . it was due to the high content of silica ( O2Si ) inside rice husk , burning it under the control condition provides ash with the silica content up to <nUm> % which can be simultaneously or consequently extracted to obtain rice husk - derived silica ( RHS ) . In order to valorize the RHS , in this study it was used as a support for zirconocene / MMAO catalyst in ethylene polymerization , compared with commercial silica ( CMS ) . it was found that rice husk - derived silica ( RHS ) has a larger surface area and lower amount of impurities than CMS . after immobilizing MMAO cocatalyst onto the silicas , it was observed that both silicas exhibit good distribution of MMAO all over the particles , but RHS has a higher content of MMAO . when using both silicas in the polymerization systems , it was observed that RHS gave a higher catalytic activity to the polymerization system than CMS ( <nUm> and <nUm> kg pol / mol Zr h ) . this is due to RHS having the lower amount of impurities especially Na2O which remains only in CMS from the production of commercial silica . the polymer obtained from the polymerization system with RHS has a good morphology suggesting that RHS still retains the advantage of providing a polymer with a good morphology as same as the conventional silica supports . graphical abstract : [ figure not available : see fulltext . ] 
the ziegler - rauk bond - energy decomposition analysis was performed for the frontside ( FS ) and backside ( BS ) transition states of ethylene insertion in the processes catalyzed by half - titanocenes with phenoxy ligands to rationalize the origin of the energetic preference of the backside insertion observed for the complexes with monosubstituted phenoxide(Type <nUm> catalysts ) . the final preference of the backside or frontside transition state comes as a balance between the electronic preference of the former , and the steric preference of the latter . the unique energetic preference of the backside insertion observed for type <nUm> catalysts appears to be a result of reduced steric crowding . the openness near the metal center and conformational flexibility leads to enhanced catalytic activity of those systems . In addition , car - parinello molecular dynamic simulations were carried out to examine the influence of entropic effects on the preference of the insertion mechanism . for type <nUm> catalysts , the spontaneous frontside insertion was observed . therefore , at the free - energy level , frontside insertion becomes viable due to entropic destabilization of the backside transition state .

syndiotactic polystyrene-graft-polydimethylsiloxane copolymers were synthesized using a two - stage process and characterized . first , the syndiotactic polystyrene copolymer , poly(styrene-co-p-methylstyrene) was prepared by the copolymerization of styrene and p-methylstyrene with cyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride / methylaluminoxane catalyst . the obtained copolymer was grafted with polydimethylsiloxane by the anionic ring - opening polymerization of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane with a metallation reagent . the effect of the solvent on the degree of grafting in the obtained copolymers was investigated . 1H NMR , 13C NMR , FTIR spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetery ( DSC ) were used to examine the structure and thermal behavior of the copolymers . the degree of graft was higher in THF . the melting , crystallization and glass - transition temperatures of the graft copolymers decreased with increasing degree of graft in the copolymers . 
nanofiller based on graphene and AlMg layered double hydroxides ( g / LDHs ) were synthesized successfully by co-precipitation method with varying graphene contents . the in situ polymerization of ethylene was conducted using 1-hexene as comonomer , zirconocene as a catalyst , MAO as co-catalyst , and g / LDHs as drop-in nanofiller . an increase in catalytic activity was recorded due to the addition of nanofiller . furthermore , a maximum catalytic activity was observed for the nanofiller containing <nUm> mg of graphene . however , nanofiller containing higher amount graphene reduced the activity due to agglomeration of the graphene nanoparticles . moreover , the degree of crystallinity decreased due to the addition of short chain branching in the copolymers . the thermal stability of the copolymers was analyzed using TGA . the effective activation energy ( EA ) was calculated using the friedman method . the EA profiles thus obtained have revealed that the polymer nanocomposites having <nUm> mg of graphene have highest thermal stability than the neat copolymers . 
OZn nanoparticle was used for preparing supported catalyst , which was applied in copolymerization of ethylene and 1-octene to obtain LLDPE / OZn nanocomposite . there were two different impregnation methods ( in situ and ex situ ) in preparing the nano-ZnO supported catalyst . the investigation to compare both methods was conducted by employing various 1-octene initial concentrations in copolymerization . it was found that a heterogeneous catalytic system comprised a supported catalyst , prepared by in situ impregnation , provided higher catalytic activities and 1-octene incorporations compared to those of ex situ impregnation under similar condition perhaps due to closer similarity to a homogeneous system . for the ex situ impregnation , it was found that when zirconocene was directly impregnated onto the support , the catalytic activity decreased . this was due to zirconocene close vicinity to the supports and even deep into the support structure proved by XPS and TGA measurements . therefore , it was more inaccessible to monomer attack and reducing the catalytic activity . the separate study on each catalytic system relating to the comonomer effect was also conducted by applying initial comonomer concentrations varied between <nUm> and <nUm> mmol . the increase in catalytic activity with increasing comonomer concentration can be considered as a positive comonomer effect , and the opposite was true for a negative comonomer effect . it was found that both positive and negative comonomer effects occurred in in situ impregnation and ex situ impregnation systems with Zn / ( Al ? Zr ) support , whereas only positive comonomer effect was found in an ex situ impregnation system with Zn / Al support . this suggested that the comonomer effect was varied according to the nature of each system . the polymer properties , such as relative crystallinity and thermal properties were also investigated and found to alter with 1-octene concentration . 
In this study , polyethylene / coir dust hybrid filler was synthesized by in situ polymerization using a zirconocene / MAO catalytic system . the obtained hybrid filler was then used for the production of natural rubber biocomposites . the synthesis process of the filler was investigated with variation of coir dust loadings . it was found that increasing the amount of coir dust decreased the catalytic activities due to negative supporting effects . after introducing the PE / coir dust hybrid filler into natural rubber , SEM micrographs showed that the PE / coir dust filler were more compatible with the natural rubber matrix than the pure coir dust . this is owing to the hydrophobicity of the polyethylene in the hybrid filler . the results from a dynamic mechanical analysis showed that the natural rubber biocomposites with the hybrid filler provided a greater storage modulus than that with the pure coir dust . this suggests that the enhanced stiffness of the natural rubber biocomposites is probably due to the strong interaction between the hybrid filler and the natural rubber matrix . the strong interaction in the biocomposite can be confirmed by the low value of a loss factor ( tan δ ) , which indicates a low degree of molecular mobility of the polymer chains , resulted from good adhesion on the filler surfaces . 
In this study , preparation of high - density polyethylene ( HDPE ) / clay nanocomposite by in situ polymerization of ethylene using a zirconocene catalyst ( bis-(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) ) was investigated . to obtain higher efficiency , nanoclay particles ( Na - montmorillonite ) were modified by ammonia ( H3N ) , H3N / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , H3N / dodecylamine ( DDA ) , and H3N / MAO / DDA systems . the results showed that the activity of the catalyst supported on the nanoclay particles modified by H3N / MAO ( <nUm> gp / mmol ( Zr ) t [atm] ) was higher than that of the one supported on the unmodified nanoclay as well as the other prepared modified nanoclay - supported catalyst systems . the catalyst activities versus MAO concentration in H3N / MAO treatment system and versus DDA concentration in H3N / DDA system showed a maximum . unexpectedly , a very low catalyst activity ( <nUm> gp / mmol(Zr) t [atm] ) was obtained using H3N / MAO / DDA system . x-ray diffraction patterns showed that the HDPE / clay nanocomposites prepared by H3N / MAO / DDA treatment system had less intercalated structure . fourier transform infrared ( FTIR ) spectroscopy confirmed that water molecules of the nanoclay particles were reduced by H3N modification . DSC results revealed that crystallinity of the HDPE / clay nanocomposites increased with the modification of the nanoclay particles . the maximum degree of crystallinity of <nUm> % was obtained for HDPE / clay nanocomposites prepared by the nanoclay modified by H3N . In addition , nanoclay modification with H3N , H3N / MAO , and H3N / DDA systems resulted in higher thermal decomposition temperature ( ~ <nUm> ° C higher than <nUm> ° C of the unmodified one ) . such increase was not observed for the H3N / MAO / DDA treatment system . dynamic mechanical analysis showed an increase in the elastic modulus of the nanocomposite samples prepared by modified nanoclay particles , as well . meanwhile , modification of the nanoclay particles by H3N led to the highest elastic behavior compared to the other modification systems . it was about <nUm> GPa which was <nUm> % higher than the elastic modulus of the nanocomposite prepared by unmodified nanoclay particles . 
A novel type of copper - based regulating agents was first applied in radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate and acrylonitrile . it was shown that systems based on copper complex with redox - active bis(acetonaphthene) ligand (dpp-BIAN-CuCl)2 , carbon tetrachloride and different activating agents such as ascorbic acid or amines ( tert-butylamine , diethylamine , triethylamine and pyridine ) were capable to initiate polymerization of the above monomers in wide temperature range from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C . the amine structure and basicity were found to make great impact on polymerization and molecular weight parameters of the obtained products . the systems developed are capable of conducting polymerization up to high monomer conversions in a wide temperature range leading to polymers with rather low molecular weight and moderate polydispersity . the most efficient system in terms of controlling the molecular weight characteristics of poly(methyl methacrylate ) among others is the system based on (dpp-BIAN-CuCl)2 and diethylamine , which makes it possible to obtain polymer with a polydispersity index of <nUm> – <nUm> . In case of acrylonitrile polymerization , the highest polymer yield is achieved using a copper complex and triethylamine . the results of MALDI TOF mass spectroscopy measurements showed the presence of chlorine atoms at the chain ends of macromolecules . the formation of “ living ” chains during polymerization of methyl methacrylate was confirmed by the synthesis of block - copolymers with styrene . 
this paper gives an introduction to photopolymerchemistry with special emphasis to photopolymerzations using organometallic initiators . photopolymers are used in various processes for the manufacturing of printed circuit boards ( PCBs ) and for integrated circuits in microelectronic applications . organometallic compounds have a great potential as photoinitiators for free - radical initiated ( vinyl-group - bearing compounds , i.e. acrylates ) and cation initiated ( epoxides or vinyl ethers ) polymerizations . two new photoinitiators from our research laboratories , titanocenes and iron arenes shall demonstrate the usefulness of organometallic chemistry for imaging systems . the bis-cyclopentadienyl-titanium-bis-pentafluorophenyl shows high sensitivity in radical initiated processes and has exceptional stability in acrylic resist formulations . trapping experiments of the titanocene under exposure with the stable radical TMPO gave a Cp(C6F5)Ti(TMPO)2 and a pentafluorophenyl-cyclopentadienyl . the observed primary photoproduct is assigned to a mono-hapto-cyclopentadienyl derivative which has free coordination sites for the addition of i.e. acrylates . from (e5-cyclopentadienyl)(e6-benzene)Fe(II)hexafluorophos phate a lewis acid is generated under exposure with the loss of the benzene ligand . the free coordinatior sites can be captured by nucleophiles , i.e. epoxides , which react to cyclic polyethers with ethylene oxide , bis-[12]crown-4-iron-bishexafluorophosphate is formed . two new preparation procedures are described for the synthesis of iron arene complexes . starting from ferrocene , iron arene complexes can be synthesized in the presence of an aromatic compound , AlCl3 and Cl4Ti in high yields . beside the iron sandwich compound , also titanocene-dichloride is formed . thermal ligand exchange reactions with thermally labile iron arene complexes allow to synthesize new derivatives with heterocyclic ligands or functionalized aromatics . 
polymerizations of ethylene and propylene were conducted with catalysts based on titanium compounds ( ClTi <nUm> or CpTiCl <nUm> ) modified by trimethylsilanol ( TMS ) . the convenient conditions of catalyst preparation and polymerization were investigated such as ageing time , Si / Ti mole ratio , catalyst concentration , type of alkylaluminum compound used as cocatalyst and Al / Ti mole ratio . the influence of these parameters on the homopolymerization of ethylene and propylene is then described in detail . the polymerization activities were found to be strongly dependent upon catalyst preparation and polymerization conditions . electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) analyses were conducted with different Al / Ti mole ratios for elucidating the influence of the Ti oxidation state on the catalyst properties . this work reports a plausible mechanism for the polymerization on the basis of these results .

the reaction of zirconocene dichloride with acetylene dicarboxylic acid in the two - phase systems H2O / CCl2H2 and H2O / CCl3H gives the polymeric compounds [Cp2Zr(m-OCOCCOCO)]n ( 1 ) and [ Cp2Zr(m-OCOCCOCO) · CHCl3]n ( 2 ) in crystalline form . x-ray structure investigations show that in both compounds the polymer chains have <nUm> symmetry and are packed parallel to each other in the crystals . the dicarboxylato bridges act as ( <nUm> + <nUm> ) - dentate ligands , such that each Zr atom has three ligation O atoms in addition to its cp ligands and thus has an 18-electron configuration . 
polymerization of Me3SiSiHMe2 , Me2HSiSiHMe2 and MeH2SiSiH2Me takes place readily in the presence of Cp2MR2 catalyst ( CP = CH ; m = Ti , Zr ; r = me , nBu ) in the absence of a solvent ( " polymerization in bulk " ) to give a mixture containing trisilanes , tetrasilanes , pentasilanes , higher oligosilanes and polysilanes . depending on the reaction conditions different proportions of linear oligo- and poly-silanes are obtained . MeH2SiSiH2Me also yields branched oligo- and poly-silanes . polymerization of MeH2siSiH2Me " in bulk " in the presence of a catalytic amount of Cp2MR2 ( CP = CH ; m = Ti , Zr ; r = me , nBu ) leads to a new type of polysilane polymer , poly(methylsilane) , (MeSiHx)n , which is thought to be the first organosilicon " living polymer " . MeH2SiSiH2Me is also polymerized in inert solvents in the presence of Cp2MR2 ( CP = CH ; m = Ti , Zr ; r = me , nBu , ph ) catalysts . 
the interaction of zirconocene dichloride derivatives with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) was studied in toluene medium under argon and ethylene atmospheres by IR , 13H , 13C , 27Al and 29Si NMR spectroscopy . data relating to polymerization of ethylene on these catalysts are given . 
A series of differently - substituted bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanaindan complexes has been prepared , characterized , and employed as transition metal components of homogeneous titanocene / alumoxane ziegler - type catalysts for propene polymerization reactions . the titanaindan systems 3a and 3b were synthesized via an aryne titanocene intermediate by means of thermolysis of Cp2TiPh2 ( 1a ) or (H3CC5H4)2TiPh2 ( 1b ) in the presence of ethylene . the analogous reactions of 1a , b with propene , 1-pentene or 1-decene gave the corresponding 3-substituted 1,1-bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanaindan systems ( 4a-d ) . the t-butyl cp - substituted diphenyltitanocene complexes [(H3C)3CC5H4]CpTiPh2 ( 1c_ and [H3C)3CC5H4]2TiPh2 ( 1d ) reacted in a different way . their thermolysis proceeded cleanly by means of intramolecular CH activation at the t-butyl substituent by the reactive aryne ligand to give the metallacyclic systems (CH2CMe2C5H4)Ti(RC5H4)Ph ( 5 ) ( a : r = H ; b : r = CMe3 ) . the titanaindan complex 3a has been characterized by x-ray diffraction . 
the mono- and bis-cyclopentadienyl compounds 1-(Cp'')-4-(CH3)C6H4 ( 1 ) and <nUm> , 4-(Cp'')2C6H4 ( 2 ) ( cp'' = 3,4-dimethylcyclopenta-1,3-diene-1-yl ) have been synthesized . the reactions of the lithium salts of <nUm> and <nUm> with CpZrCl3 · dme ( dme = dimethoxyethane ) and Cp*ZrCl3(CP* C2H3 ) yielded the mono- and bi-nuclear bridged zirconocenes 1-(Cp''ZrCpCl2)-4-(CH3)C6H4 ( 3 ) , 1,4-(Cp''ZrCpCl2)2C6H4 ( 4 ) and 1,4-(Cp''ZrCp*Cl2)2C6H4 ( 5 ) . when activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , the mono- and bi-nuclear zirconocenes <nUm> and <nUm> catalyse the polymerization of propene . the influence of the catalyst composition on the polymerization kinetics and molecular weight is discussed . 
Methyl(N-pyrrolyl)zirconocene ( 8a ) reacts with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane selectively by transfer of the heterocyclic ligand to give the methylzirconocene cation , which is an active ethylene polymerization catalyst when generated in situ in toluene . In contrast , (diethylamido)methylzirconocene ( 8b ) undergoes only transfer of the methyl group when treated with the B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> lewis acid , to five the (diethylamido)zirconocene cation ( 10b ) . the [ ( et <nUm> N)ZrCp <nUm> + MeB(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> - ] salt is not stable and rapidly reacts at room temperature with methane elimination and formation of a cationic ( η <nUm> -iminoacyl)metallocene system . the resulting [ cp <nUm> zr(e <nUm> -MeC = NEt ) + HB(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> - ] species ( 11b ) is isolated with an <nUm> % yield . Methyl(N-piperidyl)zirconocene ( 8c ) reacts similarly when treated with B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> to give the ( η <nUm> -iminoacylium)zirconocene ( 11c ) via the intermediate 10a . 
reaction of indenyllithium with 1,1-dichlorosilacyclobutane gave a mixture of diastereomeric isomers of 1,1-bis(10ineenyl)-1-silacyclobutane ( 1 ) , and the product was in turn converted into diastereomeric (1,3-propanediyl)silylene-bis(1-indenyl)dichlorozirconium complexes ( 2 ) in a <nUm> : <nUm> racemic : meso ratio . complex <nUm> was activated with either methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) or Ph3CB(C6F5)4 to perform ethylene and propylene polymerization over a very board range of temperature of polymerization ( <nUm> ° C ≤ tp ≤ <nUm> ° C ) . variations of the polymerization activity ( A ) and molecular weight ( MW ) with tp were investigated as well as the isotactic yield ( IY ) in the case of propylene polymerizations . comparisons of those results with other closely related ansa - zirconocene precursors were also made .

Molecular-Mechanics-Calculations were carried out . 
two series of group <nUm> bent metallocene complexes bearing cholestanol - derived substituents at their cp - rings have been prepared . 5a-Cholestan-3 a-ol was converted to the 3a-mesylate . nucleophilic substitution with CpNa , followed by deprotonation and treatment with ZrCl4(THF)2 gave bis[e5-(5a-cholestan-3b-yl)cyclopentadienyl]zirconium dichloride 3b-5 . 5a-Cholestan-3-one <nUm> was converted to the corresponding fulvene , methyl lithium was added and deprotonation and addition to ZrCl4(THF)2 furnished bis[e5-(3b-methyl- 5a-cholestan-3a-yl)cyclopentadienyl]zirconium dichloride ( 11b ) . treatment of the chiral cp - substituted zirconocene dichlorides with a large excess of methyl alumoxane gave homogeneous ziegler catalysts . propene polymerization proceeded with overall stereochemical chain end control to give partly isotactic polypropylene . 
complexes [(C5H5-nMen)2Ti(m-H)2]2Mg ( n = 3-5 ) separate from the (C5H5-nMen)2TiCl2-2TiCl2-Bu2Mg ( bu = butyl ) systems in toluene for Mg - to - Ti molar ratios 1-4 as crystalline materials . crystal structure of complexes ( n = <nUm> ( 1 ) : triclinic ; P1 ( z = <nUm> ) ; a = <nUm> A ̊ , b = <nUm> A ̊ and c = <nUm> A ̊ ; α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° and γ = <nUm> ° ) ( n = <nUm> ( 2 ) : monoclinic ; C2 / c ( z = <nUm> ) ; a = <nUm> A ̊ , b = <nUm> A ̊ and c = <nUm> A ̊ ; β = <nUm> ° ) ( n = <nUm> ( 3 ) : triclinic ; P1 ( z = <nUm> ) ; a = <nUm> A ̊ , b = <nUm> A ̊ and c = <nUm> A ̊ ; α = <nUm> ° β = <nUm> ° and γ = <nUm> ° ) revealed a linear MgTi2 arrangement with a pseudotetrahedral coordination of hydrogen atoms around the central magnesium atom . all the compounds show nearly identical electron spin resonance triplet - state spectra at g = <nUm> with d = <nUm> - <nUm> cm-1 and e = <nUm> , in accordance with a nearly constant Ti(III)Ti(III) distance of <nUm> - <nUm> Å . the complexes do not induce the polymerization of ethylene on the time scale of a month at room temperature . 
A variety of new silylene-bridged fluorenyl-containing ligands has been synthesized with good yields via a convenient synthetic route . two dimethylsilylene-bridged (e5-indenyl)(e5-fluorenyl)(1) and (e5-cyclopentadienyl)(e5-fluorenyl) ( 2 ) zirconocene dichlorides with C1 and Cs molecular symmetry have also been prepared . upon activation with methyl aluminoxane , the former produced a polypropylene of high molecular weight , but with low activity and isotacticity . the latter catalyzed non-stereospecific propylene polymerization without any syndiotactic tendency , but with <nUm> and <nUm> times greater ethylene and propylene activity respectively than the former catalytic system . 
the synthesis , crystal structure and propene polymerization behaviour of four bridged zirconocene dichlorides is presented . all catalysts are capable of isotactic propene polymerization . methyl substitutions at the 2- , 4- and 7-positions of the bridged bis(indenyl)zirconocene dichlorides were introduced . the methyl substituent in the 7-position of the idenyl ring induces a significant steric interaction with the bridging group . on comparison of the 2,4,7-methyl substituted catalysts with their unsubstituted counterparts , only the ethylidene bridged catalyst rac-1,2-ethylidene-bis(2,4,7-trimethyl-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 4 ) is forced into the optimum geometry for isotactic propene polymerization . owing to the steric bulk at the bridge catalyst <nUm> is very rigid with respect to the movement of the idenyl rings and the metal centre thus produces highly isotacic polypropene even up to high polymerization temperatures . molecular mechanics calculations and temperature - dependent NMR measurements demonstrate that catalyst <nUm> is not able to equilibrate between the λ and δ conformational state as the corresponding rac-1,2-ethylidene-bis(-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 3 ) catalyst does . In the case of the catalyst isopropyliden((3-tert-butyl)cyclopentadienyl-9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride (6)_the substitution in the 3-position changes the symmetry from Cs to C1 . this catalyst produces isotactic polypropene but with a decreased polymerization activity . 
A study was made of the polymerization of ethylene involving the use of a series of [e4-4-RC6H4C(NSiMe3)2]2ZrCl2 as precatalysts ( r = H ( 1 ) ; CH3 ( 2 ) ) . the benzamidinate zirconium dichloride complexes were prepared from Cl4Zr and the corresponding 4-RC6H4C(NSiMe3)2Li* TMEDA ligand . the structure of complex <nUm> was determined by a low - temperature x-ray diffraction study . " cationic " ethylene polymerization catalysts were generated from <nUm> and <nUm> with methylalumoxane . the polymerization activity and the molecular weights of the polymers are strongly dependent on the catalyst and cocatalyst concentrations . the polymerization activity increases drastically with increase in pressure and temperature and decreases when electron - releasing groups are attached to the aromatic ring . 
A series of Cp'(C5H5)ZrCl12 and Cp2'ZrCl12 precatalysts ( cp' = C5Me4H , C4Me4P , C5Me5 ) together with C10Cl12H10Zr has been investigated in terms of steric and electronic variations and their catalytic activities in combination with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) towards the polymerization of ethylene are compared . the changes in the steric environment were evaluated on the basis of the structural data available and supplemented by theoretical structural studies on the semiempirical ( ZINDO , EHMO ) and density functional ( DF ) level . the x-ray structures of (C5Me4H)2ZrCl2 ( 3 ) and (C4Me4P)(C5H5)ZrCl2 ( 4 ) have been determined ( <nUm> : orthorhombic , cmcm , a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> c = <nUm> A ̊ , z = <nUm> ; <nUm> : monoclinic , P21 / c , a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> A ̊ β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> . 91Zr NMR data for the above series has been measured and is correlated to changes in the HOMO-LUMO gap available from electronic structure calculations . under mostly homogeneous polymerization conditions , at very low zirconium concentrations the order of the catalytic activity found for ethylene polymerizations is C10Cl2H10Zr > (C5Me4H)(C5H5)ZrCl2 > (C5Me5)(C5H5)ZrCl2 > (C4Me4P)(C5H5)ZrCl2 > (C5Me4H)2ZrCl2 > (C5Me5)2ZrCl2 > (C4Me4P)2ZrCl2 , which for the most part is inversely proportional to the steric demand of the ring ligands in the metallocene precatalysts except for the phospholyl systems . the lower activities of the phospholyl vs. the tetra- and penta-methylcyclopentadienyl compounds might imply an electronic effect such that the electron withdrawing phosphorus substituent decreases the activity , although further studies are needed to clarify this situation . emphasis is placed on the control of the polymerization conditions and evaluation of the time - activity profiles . At higher zirconium concentrations an increased precipitation of polyethylene takes place during the course of polymerization and results in a transfer to the heterogeneous phase with a diffusion controlled reaction rate thereby invalidating any activity - comparing studies . 
propylene was polymerized in the presence of the cation bis(O-acetyl-(R)-mandelate) ( 1+(S) ) of (S)-ethylenebis[4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-e5-indenyl]zirconium and ( 1+(R / S ) ) of a mixture of diastereomers . under the same experimental conditions the polymers obtained with the latter exhibit abundant non-homosteric methyl 13C NMR pentads as well as 2,1-and 1,3-misinsertion resonances ; these stereo - and regioirregularities are absent in the poly(propylenes) formed by the enantiomeric 1+(S) . the stereoselectivity of catalysis by <nUm> ( r / S ) can be significantly raised either by reducing its concentration , lowering the polymerization temperature , or immobilizing it in a silica support ; the stereoselectivity of catalysis by 1(S) is not similarly affected . these results are consistent with the interchange of polymer chains of opposite b-carbon configuration bound to different chirality metal centers of the racemic mixture causing steric inversions . In the case of catalysis by 1(S) , the same process does not introduce stereoerror because the growing chains are of the same configuration . maximum isotactic specificity of an ansa - zirconocene precursor is obtained either with a pure enantiomer of the precursor or with a racemic mixture of the zirconium complex which is adequately immobilized on a support . 
four possible structures of C2 - symmetric bis(fluorenyl)zirconium complexes are presented . three bis(fluorenyl)zirconocene complexes have been prepared and tested for the polymerization of propylene and ethylene . rac / meso-Dichloro[e10-(1,2-ethanediyl)bis (7H-benzo[c]fluoren-7-ylidene)zirconium ( <nUm> / <nUm> * ) seems to be the most active polymerization catalyst for ethylene . 
the reaction of (e5-C5H5)2Zr{P(SiMe3)2}2 with C4NiO4 yields the heterodinuclear phosphido-bridged complex (e5-C5H5)2Zr{m-P(SiMe3)2}2Ni(CO)2 ( 1 ) . <nUm> was characterised spectroscopically and by x-ray structure determination . the central four - membered NiP2Zr ring is slightly puckered ( dihedral angle between planes P2Zr / NiP2 = <nUm> ° ) . the Zr-P bond lengths are equivalent ( Zr-P1 <nUm> , Zr-P2 <nUm> Å ) , as are the Ni-P bond lengths ( Ni-P1 <nUm> , Ni-P2 <nUm> Å ) . the long Zr ⋯ Ni distance of <nUm> Å indicates the absence of a metal - metal bond . the heterodinuclear phosphido- and arsenido-bridged complexes (e5-C5H5)2Zr{m-E(SiMe3)2}2M(CO)n [ e = P ; M(CO)n = C2NiO2 ( 1 ) or C4MoO4 ( 2 ) ; and e = As , M(CO)n = C4CrO4 ( 3 ) ] react rapidly with methylaluminoxane , yielding catalytically active complexes which rival the known cationic systems for the polymerization of ethylene . 
the first tin - bridged zirconocenes [ C7H10Sn 2]Zr[N(CH3)2]2 ( 3 ) and Sn{(C5H4)2Zr{N(CH3) 2]2}2 ( 4 ) have been obtained from tetrakis(dimethylamido)zirconium ( 1 ) and the CH-acidic ligands C12H16Sn ( 2a ) and C20H20Sn ( 2b ) , respectivily . the ansa - zirconocene <nUm> is formed in quantitative yield , <nUm> in <nUm> % yield . the bi- and trimetallic complexes <nUm> ( SnZr ) and <nUm> ( SnZr2 ) polymerize ethylene more efficiently than the well - known silicon - bridged analogue of <nUm> ( Si instead of Sn ) . 
chiral ansa - zirconocene complexes with a trimethylene link between the Si bridge atom and an a-position of each C5 ring ligand were prepared ; two representatives , with i-propyl and t-butyl groups as b-substituents , were structurally characterized . the properties of these complexes with respect to MAO - activated propene polymerization were studied in comparison with those of their Me2Si - bridged analogs . the t-butyl-substituted spirosilane complex gives a polymer with relatively high content of 3,1-insertions . these increased regioirregularities appear to be associated with decreased coordination gap aperture and increased lateral extension angles of the spirosilane - bridged zirconocene complexes ; this notion is supported by a molecular - mechanics analysis of alternative olefin - insertion transition states . 
one unbridged and three bridged zirconocene complexes , each of them bearing a cyclopentadienyl , fluorenyl , a-olefin and a PMe <nUm> ligand have been prepared and characterized by <nUm> H , <nUm> C and <nUm> P NMR spectroscopy . these model compounds illustrate the mechanism of olefin coordination and insertion at the active sites of syndiospecific homogeneous catalysts for the polymerization of propylene and 1-butene . 
Bis(2-N,N-dimethylamino-indenyl) zirconium dichloride , (2-(CH3)2N-C9H6)2ZrCl2 , and dimethylsilyl-bridged bis(2-N,N-dimethylamino-indenyl) zirconium dichloride , (CH3)2Si(2-(CH3)2N-C9H5)2ZrCl2 , were prepared by reaction of the corresponding ligand lithium salts with Cl4Zr in toluene . diffractometric structure determinations reveal C2 - symmetric complex geometries for both complexes . an increased electron density at the Zr center of the dimethylamino-substituted complexes is indicated by reduction potentials which are <nUm> - <nUm> V more negative than those of their unsubstituted analogs . when activated with methyl aluminoxane in toluene solution , (CH3)2Si(2-(CH3)2N-C9H5)2ZrCl2 catalyzes the polymerization of propene to polymers with a microstructure comparable with that of polymers produced with other me2 Si - bridged bis(indenyl)ZrCl2 complexes , but with a substantially increased fraction of i-propyl end groups derived from alkyl exchange between Zr - polymer and Al-Me species . 
the complex Cp2ZrMe(C6H4C ≡ CSiMe3 ) ( 4 ) has been synthesized by reaction of Cp2ZrMeCl and C7H4Li ≡ CSiMe3 ( generated in situ from reaction of nBuLi with BrC7H4 ≡ CSiMe3 at <nUm> ° C ) . thermolysis of <nUm> in THF afforded an unsaturated , organometallic polymer [ Cp2Zr(C6H3C = CSiMe3)]n ( 7 ) in ca. <nUm> % yield ( mw / Mn = <nUm> / <nUm> ) . polymer <nUm> was investigated as a synthon for other unsaturated polymers . it reacts with hydrochloric acid to form a new phenylene-1,1-vinylene polymer [ -C( = CHSiMe3)-1,4-C6H4-]n ( 8 ) , and with sulfur dichloride to give poly(1-trimethylsilyl-2-benzo[b]thiophene) ( 9 ) . thermolysis of two similar compounds , Cp2ZrMe(C6H4C ≡ C2H3 ) ( 5 ) and Cp2ZrMe(C6H4C6H4C ≡ CSiMe3 ) ( 6 ) , did not give polymers . 
the use of ' cation - like ' metallocene combination catalysts ( Cp'2MCl2-2BuLi-B(C6F5)3 ; cp' = e5-cyclopentadienyl , or substituted e5-cyclopentadienyl ; m = Ti , Zr , Hf , U ) for dehydropolymerization of silanes significantly improves the polymer molecular weight . for example , under the same conditions a Cp(C5Me5)ZrCl2-2BuLi catalyst gives Mn = <nUm> , while a Cp(C5Me5)ZrCl2-2BuLi-B(C6F5)3 gives Mn = <nUm> . the influence of various factors ( steric and electronic effects of the cyclopentadienyl ligands , the nature of the metal , temperature , solvent , concentration and structure of silane ) on the build-up of polysilane chains are systematically analyzed . 
attempts at polymerizing methacrylate using metallocenes are reported . polymerization is successful using ferrocene in a ketone solution , but not in benzene or without a solvent . ketones are effective in the order : methyl ethyl ketone < cyclohexanone < cycloheptanone . carbon tetrachloride has an accelerative effect on the polymerization in benzene and methyl ethyl ketone solutions , but no effect in cyclohexanone solution . some binary systems , which consist of ferrocene and higher valence compounds such as cobalt trisacetylacetonate , are effective redox initiators . cobaltocene polymerizes methyl methacrylate in the presence of carbon tetrachloride ; zirconocene dichloride induces polymerization of methyl methacrylate in a cyclohexanone solution ; whereas neither nickelocene nor titanocene dichloride are effective . styrene and acrylonitrile were not polymerized by the metallocenes examined . 
six kinds of heterogeneous catalysts were prepared by supporting iPr(Flu)(Cp)ZrCl2 ( 1 ) and Cp2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) on Al2O3 , Cl2Mg and O2Si , and propene polymerization was conducted with these supported catalysts using a common alkylaluminium , AlC3H9 , as cocatalyst . the <nUm> Al2O3 and <nUm> Cl2Mg catalysts gave highly syndiotactic polypropylene whereas the <nUm> Al2O3 and <nUm> Cl2Mg catalysts gave atactic polypropylene in fairly good yields . In contrast , the O2Si - supported catalysts were found to be inactive for propene polymerization . 
A full , two - level factorial experimental design with temperature and concentrations of zirconocene dichloride and methylaluminoxane as variables was employed to study the polymerization of ethylene . rate of polymerization and molecular weight data were used to develop a kinetic model and estimate the kinetic parameters . the polymerization rate was continuously recorded from a semi-batch reactor and molecular weights were measured at the end of each experimental run . the analysis of the data suggests the presence of two kinds of active species . one kind of species is produced from the other via a pseudo-first-order reaction . 
non-bridged zirconocene complexes activated with methylalumoxane can polymerize monoalkenes to high polymers with very high activity . the main control of molecular weight in these systems is due to b-H transfer from the growing chain , the effect becoming very remarkable in the case of substituted ethylene monomers and with increasing temperature . this work is mainly devoted to test the real capacity of the subject catalyst to produce structurally controlled oligomers from ethylene or ethylene / a-olefin mixtures in good yield by investigating the influence of different reaction parameters . on the basis of the relevant results obtained , conditions were identified favouring the cooligomerization of ethylene with propylene and higher a-olefins versus the formation of high molecular weight macromolecules . the role of reaction conditions ( catalyst , cocatalysts , temperature , pressure , structure of comonomer and presence of hydrogen ) on products structure and yield is discussed with reference to previously proposed chain propagation and chain transfer mechanisms . non-bridged zirconocene complexes activated with methylalumoxane can polymerize monoalkenes to high polymers with very high activity . the main control of molecular weight in these systems is due to b-H transfer from the growing chain , the effect becoming very remarkable in the case of substituted ethylene monomers and with increasing temperature . this work is mainly devoted to test the real capacity of the subject catalyst to produce structurally controlled oligomers from ethylene or ethylene / a-olefin mixtures in good yield by investigating the influence of different reaction parameters . on the basis of the relevant results obtained , conditions were identified favouring the cooligomerization of ethylene with propylene and higher a-olefins versus the formation of high molecular weight macromolecules . the role of reaction conditions ( catalyst , cocatalysts , temperature , pressure , structure of comonomer and presence of hydrogen ) on products structure and yield is discussed with reference to previously proposed chain propagation and chain transfer mechanisms . copyright 
the ab initio method at the hartree - fock level has been used on two zirconocene systems , the unbridged Cp2ZrCH+ <nUm> and the bridged (Si(CH3)2)Cp2ZrCH+ <nUm> compounds . for each complex the insertion of an ethylene molecule has been followed from reactant to product through the corresponding transition states . the calculated activation energies are of the order of magnitude of those obtained experimentally , explaining the higher activity found for the unbridged catalytic complex compared to the bridged . the geometries are in agreement with other studies and comparable with those derived by crystallographic methods . the a-agostic interaction observed in the reactants as well as in the transition states and resulting products confirms that the brookhart - green mechanism is followed for the polymerization reaction . the ab initio method at the hartree - fock level has been used on two zirconocene systems , the unbridged Cp2ZrCH+ <nUm> and the bridged (Si(CH3)2)Cp2ZrCH+ <nUm> compounds . for each complex the insertion of an ethylene molecule has been followed from reactant to product through the corresponding transition states . the calculated activation energies are of the order of magnitude of those obtained experimentally , explaining the higher activity found for the unbridged catalytic complex compared to the bridged . the geometries are in agreement with other studies and comparable with those derived by crystallographic methods . the a-agostic interaction observed in the reactants as well as in the transition states and resulting products confirms that the brookhart - green mechanism is followed for the polymerization reaction . copyright 
A kinetic study has been made of the homo- and copolymerization of ethylene with vinylcyclohexane , using catalytic systems based on methylalumoxane and bis-(tert-butylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride and bis-(trimethylsilycyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride . the effective rate constants were determined in the interval from 20-70 ° C for the homo- and copolymerization reactions , and the observed activation energies and the copolymerization constant were obtained . some properties of the resultant polymers were investigated . 
pyridine-pendent siloxane polymers containing a backbone modified with a zirconocene moiety were synthesized through the hydrolysis-condensation reaction of the mixed precursor solutions of the b-trimethoxysilylethyl-2-pyridine sol in liquor medium and the zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) dissolved in tetrahydrofurane . this polymer , in terms of the polyzirconocenesiloxane-2-pyridine ( PZSP ) , was then evaluated for use as thin coating films ( thickness , <nUm> - <nUm> mm ) , which provides excellent protection of aluminum ( Al ) alloys against ClNa - caused corrosion . the PZSP films deposited by simple dip - withdrawing coating methods to Al displayed the impedance of > <nUm> Ω cm2 after exposure for <nUm> days in <nUm> N ClNa solution at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> h salt - spray resistance . 
the current development of the metallocene - based ziegler - natta catalysts has been reviewed . the discovery of these catalysts has offered the opportunity to obtain a deeper insight into the mechanism of ziegler - natta polymerizations . In this review , some mechanistic models for polymerization and stereoregulation , as well as the factors which affect the activity and stereospecificity of the catalysts , have been discussed . the technology of olefin polymerization with the metallocene - based catalysts is in the early stage of commercialization . using these catalysts , a large number of novel polymers with special properties have been obtained . 
cyclopolymerization of nonconjugated dienes provides a route to a number of stereochemically complex poly(methylene-1,3-cycloalkanes) . the stereochemistry of these polymers derives from both tacticity and cis / trans stereochemistry of the carbocyclic rings . A unique feature of isotactic polymers with a predominance of trans rings is that they contain no mirror elements of symmetry and are thus chiral by virtue of their main - chain stereochemistry . the enantioselective cyclopolymerization of 1,5-hexadiene in the presence of optically active precursors such as (-)-(R)-ethylene-bis(tetrahydroindenyl) zirconium (R)-binaphtholate ( [a]435 = <nUm> ° ) and a methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) co-catalyst yields optically active poly(methylene-1,3-cyclopentane) ( PMCP ) with a molar optical rotation [Ph]28405 of + <nUm> ° ( c = <nUm> , CCl3H ) . since the enantioface selectivity of the chiral zirconocene catalyst with propene is known , the absolute stereochemistry of the polymer can be tentatively assigned if an analogous enantioface selectivity with 1,5-hexadiene is assumed . the enantioselective cyclopolymerization of symmetrical dienes requires both a high enantioface selectivity for olefin insertion and a high diastereoselectivity for olefin cyclization in order to obtain a chiral macromolecular architecture . 
metallocenes in combination with methylalumoxane as cocatalyst form extremely active catalysts for olefin polymerization and have become a research topic of growing interest in recent years . meanwhile a great number of symmetric and chiral zirconocenes have been synthesized to give totally different structures of isotactic , syndiotactic , stereoblock , or isoblock polymers . the isotactic sequence length of polypropylene is influenced by the nature of the ligands of the metallocenes . it has become possible to polymerize cyclic olefins like cyclopentene , norbornene , or dimethanooctahydronaphthalene with different chiral zirconocenes without any ring opening reaction . the crystalline polycycloalkenes show extremely high melting points which are between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C . copolymers of cyclo-alkenes with ethene are amorphous and transparent with a glass transition temperature between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C and they can be used as materials for optical discs and fibers . 
A series of (e5-C5H4R)2ZrCl2 ( r = H , me , et , iPr , tBu , SiMe3 , Me2Ph , ) complexes have been used in combination with ethylalumoxane to copolymerise ethene with a-olefins ( C5C14 ) under constant conditions ( P = 9-12 bar ; T = 50-80 ° C ) . activity decreased substantially for olefin > C8 . variations of the 1-hexene concentration ( (CpEt)2ZrCl2 as catalyst ) revealed rate enhancement at a 1-hexene / ethylene ratio of <nUm> . copolymer incorporation was low ( < <nUm> % ) as detected by melting points and 13C NMR spectroscopy . A statistically designed approach ( <nUm> factorial ) was used to investigate the influence of P,T and [1-hexene] on copolymer formation with (CpR)2ZrCl2 ( r = H , tBu ) . complex interaction between the variables was detected but the results ( r = tBu ) were dominated by [1-hexene] . 
the microstructure in terms of molecular mass distribution ( MMD ) and chemical comonomer distribution ( CCD ) of linear low density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) is greatly influenced by the catalytic system and process conditions . furthermore , the 1-olefin insertion in the polymer chain can be distinguished between intramolecular and intermolecular distribution . to investigate the intermolecular CCD and the MMD , four LLDPEs ( ethylene-1-butene copolymers ) from different catalytic systems based on Ti Cl2Mg catalysts , a zirconocene complex and a vanadium compound , are studied . the microstructure of the whole polymers and of their fractions are examined by size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , and 13C NMR analysis . further information about CCD is also obtained by DSC analysis on the whole samples by applying a particular thermal treatment , named thermal fractionated crystallization ( TFC ) , based on isothermal crystallization of the polymers from the melt at fixed temperatures . the results obtained with the different analytical techniques show that the examined polymers have a very distinct microstructure depending on the catalyst type . 
hydrooligomerizations of norbornene were carried out using C2 , Cs and c2v symmetric zirconocenes with methylaluminoxane as catalysts . the structures of the hydrodimers and -trimers were investigated and correlated to the symmetry of the metallocene . the polymerization of norbornene is shown to proceed by cis-exo insertion . the mechanisms of polymerization and stereocontrol are closely related to the ones observed in the polymerization of a-olefins . thus the C2 symmetric metallocene features erythrodiisotactic structures , while erythrodisyndiotactic products are observed in case of the Cs symmetric one . this is caused by enantiomorphic site control , while stereospecificity in the hydrooligomerization using Cp2ZrCl2 MAO is determined by chain end control mechanism . 
efficient polymerization of acetylene is achieved by using titanocene alkyne complexes as precatalysts . the in situ generated titanocene ' Cp2Ti ' is the catalytically active species which induces acetylene polymerization . A mechanism including an exo-allylidene metallacyclobutene complex for the catalytic formation of polyacetylene is proposed . 
binuclear zirconocene cartons are observed by 1H - NMR in C6D6 solutions containing BC18F15 and an excess of a zirconocene dimethyl complex . the CH3 - bridged cation [((C5H5)2ZrCH3)2(m-CH3)]+ , solvent- separated from the anion H3C-B(C6F5)3 / - , is present in equilibrium with C12H16Zr and the mononuclear ion pair [ ( C11H13Zr / +***H3C-B(C6F5)3 / - ] ; in more concentrated solutions , a binuclear ion pair [ ((C5H5)2ZrCH3)2(m-CH3)+***H3C- BC18F15 / - ] is the dominant species . similar equilibria are observed in C6,D6 solutions containing BC18F15 and C18H26Zr , C14H20SiZr or rac-(CH3)2Si(indenyl)2Zr(CH3)2 . complexes with sterically more demanding ligands , such as C22H36Zr or rac-(CH3)2Si(2-methyl benz[e]indenyl)2Zr(CH3)2 do not form any binuclear species under these conditions . In the catalyst system rac- (CH3)2Si(indenyl)2Zr(CH3)2 / Bu3NH+B(C6F5)4 / - , activities for the polymerization of propene increase with excess of the dimethyl zirconocene complex . this effect is due in part to a sacrifice of some dimethyl zirconocene for the removal of impurities from the catalyst system and in part to a stabilization of the catalyst in the form of the binuclear cation [((CH3)2Si(indenyl)2ZrCH3)2(m-CH3)]+ . the latter appears to act , in the presence of propene , as a source of the mononuclear cation [(CH3)2Si(indenyl)2ZrCH3(C3H6)]+ , rather than as a polymerization catalyst by itself . 
upon irradiation of a C2 - symmetric rac - isomer of an ansa - zirconocene dichloride , an interconversion into the C ( s ) - symmetric meso-form is observed until a photostationary state between the two diastereomers is reached . the final rac / meso-proportion and the interconversion rate depend on the structure of the different metallocenes . results of a-olefin polymerization catalyzed by [ Me2Si(2-Me-4,6-(i)Pr2 Ind)2]ZrCl2 rac and meso , respectively , and methylalumoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst are reported . In propene polymerization the rac - diastereomer shows the higher activity whereas in pentene , hexene , and octene polymerization the meso-isomer is significantly more active . for all polymers a lower molecular weight is found using the meso-diastereomer as catalyst .

this review summarizes the present state of investigations concerning the synthesis of graft or comb - shaped macromolecules . the three main approaches " grafting onto " , " grafting from " and " grafting through " are discussed extensively . emphasis is given to controlled polymerization processes which enable preparation of well - defined species , i.e. to samples with a low dispersity in molecular weight , of satisfactory homogeneity in composition , and in which the molecular structure is defined unambiguously by the conditions of preparation . ionic polymerization techniques revealed efficient for a number of systems . an increasing number of graft copolymers of well - defined structural characteristic are designed by controlled free radical polymerization techniques or by combination of two polymerization methods .

this chapter deals with the synthesis and assembly chemistry of the novel inorganic polymers known as polyphosphazenes . they can form the hybrid systems of organic and inorganic polymers including blends and copolymers with stepped-up excellent properties . most of the organic polymers are not suitable for applications at extreme temperatures . they become very brittle at low temperatures while oxidative at high temperatures . organic polymers are normally easy to burn because of their flammability . their main limitation is that the basic petroleum feed stocks do not last forever . however , organic polymers are so diverse in terms of their structure and property that it 's possible to find new types of polymeric systems with completely different properties by combining with inorganic compounds . organic polymers could be prepared in a number of ways taking advantage of the rich functional group chemistry of organic molecules . but almost all of the inorganic polymers require more difficult and different synthetic strategies . among inorganic polymers , the polymers based on silicon element are well known for their superior properties , rigorous monomers , and hard preparation . phosphazenes are the intriguing substrates having chemical structures based on -P = n-repetitive units from low - molecular weight cyclic derivatives to more than <nUm> molecular weight polymers . more interesting is that the two substituent groups are attached to the phosphorus atoms , thereby producing a series of new materials that are able to cover an unbelievably large number of practical applications .

As carborane science has grown in complexity , and applications have advanced steadily in areas such as medicine , nanostructured and electroactive materials , catalysis , polymers , and others , the need for a monograph covering the entire area in a unified treatment has become increasingly apparent . this volume has two principal objectives , the first of which is to provide a readable and concise introduction to the basic principles underlying the synthesis , structures , reactivity , and applications of carboranes and metallacarboranes at a level suitable for readers in industry and academe who are not trained in boron chemistry but find themselves working with , or lecturing about carboranes . secondly , the book furnishes a trove of detailed information for workers active in carborane science and associated technologies . to that end , it incorporates tables listing thousands of specific compounds keyed to literature references ( supplemented by additional information available on a website ) , together with more than <nUm> molecular structure drawings that illuminate the accompanying discussion . thorough treatment of the synthesis , structures , and reactions of carboranes , heterocarboranes , and metallacarboranes in the first <nUm> chapters is followed by four chapters detailing advances in practical applications in polymer science , catalysis , medicine , and other areas . 
the use of reactive polymers enables manufacturers to make chemical changes at a late stage in the production process - these in turn cause changes in performance and properties . material selection and control of the reaction are essential to acheive optimal performance . the second edition of reactive polymers fundamentals and applications introduces engineers and scientists to the range of reactive polymers available , explains the reactions that take place , and details applications and performance benefits.Basic principles and industrial processes are described for each class of reactive resin ( thermoset ) , as well as additives , the curing process , and applications and uses . the initial chapters are devoted to individual resin types ( e.g. epoxides , cyanacrylates , etc. ) ; followed by more general chapters on topics such as reactive extrusion and dental applications . material new to this edition includes the most recent developments , applications and commercial products for each chemical class of thermosets , as well as sections on fabrication methods , reactive biopolymers , recycling of reactive polymers , and case studies . injection molding of reactive polymers , radiation curing , thermosetting elastomers , and reactive extrusion equipment are all covered as well . 
A new titanocene dichloride derivative in which one cyclopentadienyl ligand ( cp ) is functionalized with a pyrrolyl ring , Tc3Py ( Cl2TiCpC5H4(CH2) 3NC4H4 ) , has been synthesized and characterized with NMR . its redox properties have been studied by CV in acetonitrile ( AN ) , tetrahydrofurane ( THF ) and dichloromethane ( DCM ) , in comparison with unsubstituted titanocene dichloride ( Tc ) and pyrrole . Ti(IV / III ) transition observed within the negative potential range is a quasi-reversible reaction in THF and DCM ( but without a complete recuperation of the initial reagent in the back scan ) while the reoxidation peak in AN is strongly shifted in the positive direction . these results are interpreted within the framework of a ' square scheme ' where the electrochemical reduction step is accompanied by the rapid substitution of one chloride ligand by the solvent molecule . the back electron transfer follows the same reaction path for weakly coordinating media ( THF , DCM ) whereas this process is shifted to a more positive potential in the case of strongly coordinating solvents ( AN ) . In the positive potential range , the derivative , Tc3Py , is irreversibly oxidized ( similar to pyrrole ) in AN or DCM so that one can deposit a conducting polymer film with the use of different electrochemical regimes . redox properties of its polymer matrix resemble alkyl-modified polypyrroles . the redox activity of pendant Tc groups is restricted in AN since only a thin layer of the film near the electrode surface can be reduced . A more pronounced response of immobilized Tc is observed in DCM for films polymerized in AN. reduction peak current and reduction charge of the film depend on the potential scan rate . for sufficiently thin films and slow potential sweeps , one can reach an almost complete redox transformation of titanocene groups inside the film as evidenced by the theoretically expected ratio of polymer matrix and titanocene redox charges . possible reasons of ' prepeak ' appearance are discussed . 
this paper describes ethylene polymerization using four kinds of zirconocene with different substitutionary groups in cp ring as catalysts and aluminoxane as cocatalyst . their polymerization activities and me of resultant polyethylene were compared . it was found basically that in tp = <nUm> ° C and Al / Zr = <nUm> , polymerization activities were of the following order : A2 > B2 > A1 > B1 [ A1 : ( CH2 double bond CH-CH2-CH2-Cp)2ZrCl2 ; B1 : ( CH2 double bond CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-Cp)2ZrCl2 ; A2 : { CH2 double bond C(CH3)-CH2-Cp}2ZrCl2 ; B2 : { CH3(CH3)-C double bond CH-CH2-Cp}2ZrCl2 ] . polymerization activities were affected greatly by polymerization conditions . the influences of catalyst concentrations on polymerization activities were discussed . the possible effect mechanism of different substitutionary groups in cp ring on polymerization activities was investigated . 
A novel heterodinuclear catalyst , ethylene bridged samarocene and titanocene chloride ( Sm-Ti ) , was used both as a single component catalyst ( cat . ) and also by activation with triisobutyl aluminum ( TIBA ) to polymerize methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) . the binary catalyst demonstrated higher activity than the single component , but the molecular weight of the resultant PMMA is lower . ultrahigh molecular weight PMMA ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) was obtained at an attractive conversion ( <nUm> % ) without any cocatalyst . the effects of polymerization parameters , such as temperature , time , molar ratios of Al(i-Bu)3 / cat . and MMA / cat. , were studied in detail . the results showed that the catalytic activity had a rather different dependence on the polymerization temperature with / without TIBA . high molecular weight PMMA was much more easily prepared in a bulk system than in toluene solution . the polymer yielded with about <nUm> % syndiotacticity by 1H NMR and <nUm> % by IR spectroscopy , but its stereoregularity did not change too much with polymerization temperature and the concentration of TIBA . 
propylene polymerization and propylene / 1-octene copolymerization were studied using rac-Me2SiInd2ZrCl2(1) / MAO or rac-Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 / ( MAO + TIBA ) as catalyst ( methyl aluminoxane , MAO ; AliBu3 , TIBA ) . the structure distribution of the polymers was characterized by temperature gradient extraction fractionation or precipitation fractionation , as well as by DSC analysis of the thermal segregated samples . by comparing the structure distribution of polypropylene and propylene-1-octene copolymer synthesized by <nUm> / MAO and <nUm> / ( MAO + TIBA ) , it is found that adding TIBA in the catalyst system increase the blockiness of the polymer chain , especially in the copolymerization system . it is assumed that , when iso-butyl is incorporated in the aluminoxane , ion pair of the active center and the aluminoxane counter ion may exist in different states that show different catalytic behaviors , resulting in the formation of polymers with block structure . 
A novel carrier of ultradispersed diamond black powder ( UDDBP ) was used to support metallocene catalyst . Al2O3 was also used as carrier in order to compare with UDDBP . supported catalysts for ethylene polymerization were synthesized by two different reaction methods . one way was direct immobilization of the metallocene on the support , the other was adsorption of MAO onto the support followed by addition of the metallocene . four supported catalysts Cp2ZrCl2 / UDDBP , Cp2ZrCl2 / Al2O3 , Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO / UDDBP and Cp2ZrCl2 / Al2O3 / MAO were obtained . the content of the zirconium in the supported catalyst was determined by UV spectroscopy . the activity of the ethylene polymerization catalyzed by supported catalyst was investigated . the influence of Al / Zr molar ratio and polymerization temperature on the activity was discussed . the polymerization rate was also observed . 
the Cl2Mg - supported CpTiCl3 catalysts with different Ti content were prepared and used for syndiospecific polymerization of styrene . these catalysts were investigated by means of electron spinning resonance ( ESR ) spectroscopy . it is found that there exist two kinds of active species in this catalytic system . one is a specific active site and can not be removed into the solution by MAO . the other one is readily removed into the solution during the interaction with MAO , and the same active site as that in the CpTiCl3 - MAO homogeneous system is formed . the Cl2Mg supported CpTiCl3 catalyst was also compared with the O2Si / CpTiCl3 - MAO system . the data show that the CpTiCl3 supported on the Cl2Mg surface is more difficult to be removed by MAO than the active site immobilized on the O2Si surface , leading to the lower activity of Cl2Mg / CpTiCl3 - MAO system and lower syndiotacticity of obtained polystyrene . 
the syndiotactic polymerization of styrene with methoxyethylcyclopentadienyl titanium trichloride ( 1 ) , 2-tetrahydrofurfurylcyclopentadienyl titanium trichloride ( 2 ) , cyclopentadienyl dichloroisopropoxy titanium ( 3 ) and methylaluminoxane was studied . substituted half - sandwich titanocene ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) exhibited low activity and syndiotacticity , while the alkoxy derivative of cyclopentadienyl titanium trichloride exhibited high activity and syndiotacticity . possible reasons for the differences are discussed . 
the amino-functionalized metallocene (C5H4CH(Me)NMe2)2ZrCl <nUm> , [(CpN)2ZrCl2] was synthesized by salt metathesis of Cl4Zr and <nUm> equiv. of C5H4CH(Me)NMe2Li . the metallocene was obtained in good yield as a mixture of rac and meso diastereomers as established by NMR spectroscopy . the addition of <nUm> equiv. of n-BuLi to the metallocene (CpN)2ZrCl2 produced a co-catalyst system which was active , at a <nUm> mol % loading , in the dehydropolymerization of PhSiH3 to poly(phenylsilane) , P2Si . the P2Si was obtained as a <nUm> : <nUm> linear - cyclic mixture ( mw = <nUm> , Mn = <nUm> ) as established by GPC analysis ; 29Si{1H} NMR spectroscopy revealed an atactic polymer microstructure .

V . 
films with a polypyrrole matrix and pendant titanocene dichloride centers , p(Tc3Py) , have been obtained by potentiostatic electropolymerization of the titanocene - pyrrolyl derivative , Tc3Py = C4H6NTc 4H4 ( Tc = Cl2TiCpCp' , cp = C 5H5 , cp' = C5H4 ) , in acetonitrile ( AN ) solutions on a Pt surface . the redox activity has been studied after the transfer of the film - coated electrode into the monomer - free solution of the same electrolyte , TBAPF6 , in THF . contrary to the case of AN or dichloromethane solutions , one can achieve a stable redox activity of the immobilized Tc centers in THF solutions during a series of cycles . A parallel between the redox properties of the Tc complex in solution and inside the film for different solvents has been established . various ' memory ' effects have been observed , i.e. the dependence of the film response on the previous treatment of the film : ( a ) a prepeak at the onset of the polymer matrix oxidation ( observed earlier for other functionalized conducting polymer films ) ; ( b ) an ' enhanced plateau ' within the range of the polymer matrix electroactivity ; ( c ) a strong increase of the current within the reduction peak of titanocene centers after the previous passage through the range of the matrix electroactivity ( compared to the response when the potential variation is limited to the titanocene potential range ) ; ( d ) a shift of all oxidation waves in the positive direction as a result of the film exposure to sufficiently high negative potentials as well as their backward shift if the film is held at a potential in the ' window ' between the two ranges of electroactivity . possible interpretations of this phenomenon have been discussed . A non-equilibrium origin of this phenomenon has been proven . an attribution of the observed effects to redox processes in the polymer matrix and immobilized titanocene centers has been proposed .

the rate of hydrogenolytic alkane liberation from permethylzirconocene neopentyl halide compounds , (C5(CH3)5)2Zr(X)CH2C(CH3)3 , x = F , Cl , Br ) , is greatly reduced if the ring ligands are interconnected by an ethylene bridge , as in C2H4(C5(CH3)4)2Zr(X)CH2C(CH3)3 . hydrogenolysis of the corresponding permethylzirconocene neopentyl hydride compounds ( x = H ) , on the other hand , is too fast for kinetic measurements at room temperature , even with the ethylene-bridged derivative . these observations , and the inverse kinetic isotope effect observed for reaction with D2 , are interpreted with the assumption that H - induced alkane liberation from permethylzirconocene alkyl halides proceeds via an indirect ring - mediated hydrogen transfer reaction which is feasible only with freely rotating ring ligands ; hydrogenolysis of permethylzirconocene alkyl hydrides , on the other hand , apparently occurs without such limitation , by direct H - to - alkyl hydrogen transfer .

using 1H- and 13C - NMR spectroscopies , cationic intermediates formed by activation of L2ZrCl2 with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) in toluene were monitored at Al / Zr ratios from <nUm> to <nUm> ( L2 are various cyclopentadienyl ( cp ) , indenyl ( ind ) and fluorenyl ( flu ) ligands ) . the following catalysts were studied : (Cp-R)2ZrCl2 ( r = me , 1,2-Me2 , 1,2,3-Me3 , 1,2,4-Me3 , me4 , me5 , n-Bu , t-Bu ) , rac-ethanediyl(Ind)2ZrCl <nUm> , rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 , rac-Me2Si(1-Ind-2-Me)2ZrCl2 , rac-ethanediyl(1-Ind-4,5,6,7-H4)2ZrCl2 , (Ind-2-Me)2ZrCl2 , Me2C(Cp)(Flu)ZrCl <nUm> , Me2C(Cp-3-Me)(Flu)ZrCl2 and Me2Si(Flu)2ZrCl2 . correlations between spectroscopic and ethene polymerization data for catalysts ( Cp-R ) 2ZrCl2 / MAO ( r = H , me , 1,2-Me2 , 1,2,3-Me3 , 1,2,4-Me3 , me4 , me5 , n-Bu , t-Bu ) and rac-Me2Si(Ind)2 Cl2Zr were established . the catalysts (Cp-R)2 Cl2Zr / AlMe3 / CPh3+ B(C6F5)4- ( r = me , 1,2-Me2 , 1,2,3-Me3 , 1,2,4-Me3 , me4 , n-Bu , t-Bu ) were also studied for comparison of spectroscopic and polymerization data with MAO - based systems . complexes of type (Cp-R)2ZrMe+-Me -- Al ≡ MAO ( IV ) with different [Me-MAO]- counteranions have been identified in the (Cp-R)2ZrCl2 / MAO ( r = n-Bu , t-Bu ) systems at low Al / Zr ratios ( 50-200 ) . At Al / Zr ratios of 500-1000 , the complex [L2Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2] +[Me-MAO]- ( III ) dominates in all MAO - based reaction systems studied . ethene polymerization activity strongly depends on the Al / Zr ratio ( Al / Zr = 200-1000 ) for the systems (Cp-R)2 Cl2Zr / MAO ( r = H , me , n-Bu , t-Bu ) , while it is virtually constant in the same range of Al / Zr ratios for the catalytic systems (Cp-R)2ZrCl2 / MAO ( r = 1,2-Me2 , 1,2,3-Me3 , 1,2,4-Me3 , me4 ) and rac-Me 2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO . the data obtained are interpreted on assumption that complex III is the main precursor of the active centers of polymerization in MAO - based systems . V . 
zirconocene dichloride complexes with substituents containing aliphatic end groups at the aromatic ligands react with two equivalents of n-butyllithium to give metallacyclic zirconocene complexes via aliphatic CH - activation reactions . As well as o-alkenyl substituted zirconocene dichloride complexes with terminal aliphatic groups as zirconocene dichloride complexes with purely aliphatic substituents are suitable for the synthesis of such metallacycles . In combination with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , these metallacycles are excellent catalysts for ethylene polymerization . their activities can be three and a half times higher than the activities of the corresponding zirconocene dichloride educts . the catalyst <nUm> / MAO is able to produce <nUm> kg PE g-1 Zr h ( <nUm> ° C , pentane solution , <nUm> bar ethylene pressure ) . V . 
density - functional theory has been used to study the first few steps of ethene polymerization with the single - site catalyst Cp2ZrCH3 + ( biscyclopentadienyl methyl zirconium cation ) . insertion of the first monomer yields a g-agostic product Cp2ZrC3H7 + which can transform into a more stable b-agostic conformation with an activation barrier of <nUm> kJ mol-1 . the interaction of the b-agostic structure with a second monomer leads to chain termination ( front - side attack ) or insertion ( back - side attack ) with barriers of about 35-40 kJ mol-1 . A more likely step appears to be insertion directly into the g-agostic Cp2ZrC3H7 + , to form the g-agostic product Cp2ZiC5H11 + with a barrier of only <nUm> kJ mol-1 . A . 
A convenient new one - pot synthesis makes accessible CH2 - and CHR - bridged ligand precursors of the general formula C13H9-n,R'nCHRC5H5 ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ; r = H , alkyl ; R' = H , alkyl , hal ) . from these the syndiospecific zirconocene catalysts (C13H8-nR'nCHR-C5H4)ZrCl2 ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ; r = H , me ; R' = H , Br ) for the polymerization of propylene can be prepared .

zirconocene dichloride was reacted with either 2,6-di-tert-butyl-or 2,6-diisopropyl phenol to form bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl) zirconium(IV) monochloride complexes <nUm> and <nUm> respectively . A bisphenoxy derivative of Cp2ZrCl2 , <nUm> , was formed , when sterically less demanding 2,6-dimethyl phenol was utilized . the ability of the complexes <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> in ethylene polymerization with MAO as cocatalyst was examined . polymer analysis indicates that , regardless of which complex was used , only one kind of catalytically active metal center is formed and polymer properties resemble those obtained with the Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO system . the solid state structure of bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl) zirconium(IV) 2,6-di-tert-butyl-phenoxy monochloride ( 1 ) is reported . A . 
the synthesis and characterization of two new silicon-carbon bridged ansa - bis(fluorenyl) and ansa-bis(octahydrofluorenyl) zirconocene complexes , (Flu-CH2-SiMe2-Flu)ZrCl2 ( 3 ) and (FluH8-CH2-SiMe2-FluH8)ZrCl2 ( 4 ) is reported . complex <nUm> , in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , forms an active catalyst system for homogeneous polymerization of ethylene . the molecular structure of <nUm> reveals a large Centroid-Zr-Centroid angle ( <nUm> ° ) and an unusually small Cl-Zr-Cl angle ( <nUm> ° ) . the Zr-C bond distances range from <nUm> to <nUm> Å . A . 
the unbridged complex [bis(e5-7,9-diphenylcyclopenta[a]acenaphthadienyl)] zirconium dichloride ( 8 ) and two asymmetric ethylene bridged metallocenes { bis[1,2-(e5-7,9-diphenylcyclopenta[a]acenaphthadienyl)-1-phenyl] ethane } zirconium dichloride ( 9 ) and { [1-(e5-7,9-diphenylcyclopenta[a]acenaphthadienyl)-2-phenyl-2-(e5-9-fluorenyl)] ethane } zirconium dichloride ( 10 ) were prepared and used as catalysts for ethene and propene homopolymerization after activation with MAO . whereas zirconocenes <nUm> and <nUm> , that bear two acenaphthyl substituted cp - rings , have only moderate activity , <nUm> produces polyethene with high activity and high molecular weight . In propene polymerization only atactic polymer was formed and the chain termination occurred mainly via b-methyl elimination . the solid state structures of compounds <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> were determined by means of x-ray diffraction analysis . A . 
A novel method for the preparation of heterogeneous metallocene catalysts is described that can be applied for the polymerization of olefins starting with homogeneous metallocene complexes . for this purpose zirconocene dichloride complexes have been prepared containing alkenyl or alkynyl substituents . these complexes can be activated with methyl alumoxane ( MAO ) and then are incorporated as comonomers into the formed polyolefin chain . the homogeneous metallocene catalysts become self - immobilizing under the reaction conditions and the further formation of the polyolefin is then catalyzed heterogeneously . 
zirconocene compounds having ether bonds at the substituent of cyclopentadienyl ligand , [ e5-C5H4(CH2) nOCH2CH2OCH2CH3 ] 2ZrCl2 ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) and [ e5-C5H4CH2CH 2OCH2CH3]2ZrCl2 , were prepared and tested for ethylene polymerization catalysts with methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst . the presence of oxygen atom close to the metal center drastically reduced the polymerization activity . it increased as the distance between zirconium and oxygen atom increased and showed a maximum when n was <nUm> . 
A series of titanocene and zirconocene dichlorides was synthesized bearing ligands that contain a ( chiral ) ether group linked by an ethylene spacer group to the cyclopentadienyl ring . surprisingly , the chiral zirconocenes (e5-C5H4CH2CH2OR)2ZrCl2 with r = isobornyl and menthyl do not show ziegler - natta activity . this is probably caused by attack of the cocatalyst (MeAlO)n on the side chains , causing immobilization of the catalyst . intramolecular coordination of the side chains is provoked by converting the dichlorides to the more lewis-acidic mono and bis triflate complexes . the coordination of the ether chain depends on the size of the terminal group in the chain . In the achiral derivative (e5-C5H4CH2CH2OMe)2Zr(O3SCF3)2 there is a rapid equilibrium between species with one and two intramolecularly - coordinated ether side chains . the monotriflate complex ( e5-C5H4CH2CH2Oisobor nyl)2ZrCl(O3SCF3) decomposes rapidly , because ether coordination results in facile C-O bond cleavage and liberation of camphene . accordingly , the bistriflate ( e5-C5H4CH2CH2Oisobor nyl)2Zr(O3SCF3)2 could not be synthesized . the chiral triflate complexes (e5-C5H4CH2CH2OR)2Zr(O3SCF3)2 with r = menthyl and fenchyl are active diels - alder catalysts , although no optical induction was observed , probably because the chiral ether handles are not sufficiently coordinated during catalysis . 
A series of zirconocene complexes of formula cp <nUm> ZrMe 2-n L n where cp = C <nUm> H - <nUm> , me = methyl , L = pyrazolyl , bis(N,N'-phenylformamidinato) , or substituted aryloxide and n = <nUm> , were synthesized by reaction of cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> and cp <nUm> ZrMe <nUm> with LiL or HL , respectively . the structures of cp <nUm> Zr(2,6-OC <nUm> H <nUm> me <nUm> ) <nUm> , cp <nUm> Zr(2,4,6-OC <nUm> H <nUm> me <nUm> ) <nUm> and cp <nUm> ZrMe{CH(NC <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> } were determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction . the complexes demonstrate appreciable activity for ethylene polymerization when used as cocatalysts with methylaluminoxane and dimethylanilinium tetrafluorophenylborate . A . 
an ansa - zirconocene complex having a vicinally di-tert-butyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand , me <nUm> Si(C <nUm> H <nUm> )(C <nUm> H <nUm> -3,4-t-Bu <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> ( 1 ) , has been synthesized and characterized by x-ray diffraction ( orthorhombic , space group : pbca , a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , V = <nUm> Å <nUm> , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , r w = <nUm> ) . complex <nUm> has a very much twisted structure due to its steric repulsion . In solution , however , the two tert-butyl groups are magnetically equivalent even at <nUm> ° C , indicating very fast oscillation of the bridged cyclopentadienyl unit with respect to the metal center . complex <nUm> and nonbridged zirconocene dichlorides with tert-butyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl ligands , ( C <nUm> H <nUm> -t-Bu ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( 2 ) , ( C <nUm> H <nUm> -1,2-t-Bu <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( 3 ) and ( C <nUm> H <nUm> -1,3-t-Bu <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( 4 ) , have been employed as methylaluminoxane (MAO)-activated catalysts for polymerization of 1-hexene under high pressure conditions ( 100-750 MPa = ca . 1000-7500 atm ) . comparison with some non and methyl-substituted metallocenes are also discussed . 
the ethylene-bridged pseudo-Cs symmetric ansa - zirconocene complexes , (1-fluorenyl-2-cyclopentadienylethane)zirconium dichloride ( 5a ) and (1-fluorenyl-2-tetramethylcyclopentadienylethane)zirconium dichloride ( 5b ) , were synthesized and their molecular structures have been determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction studies . the complex 5a is very active toward propylene polymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , affording polypropylene with good syndiotacticity . In comparison with the known syndiotactic polypropylene catalytic system iPr(fluorenyl)(cyclopentadienyl)ZrCl2 / MAO , 5a / MAO system is better in thermal stability , higher in activity and lower in syndiotacticity under the identical polymerization conditions . on the other hand , 5b / MAO system shows low activity and produces nearly atactic polypropylene with low molecular weight , which could be attributed to the increased electron density and steric bulkiness around the metal center . 
chiral silicon bridged yttrio- and lanthanidocene chlorides [ MeRSi(C <nUm> H <nUm> )(C <nUm> me <nUm> )LnCl ] <nUm> ( r = et ( a ) , ph ( b ) ; ln = Y ( 4a , b ) , La ( 5a , b ) , Sm ( 6a , b ) , Lu ( 7a , b ) ) and zirconocene dichlorides [ MeRSi(C <nUm> H <nUm> )(C <nUm> me <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> ] ( r = et ( 8a ) , ph ( 8b ) ) were synthesized . compounds 4-7 react with sodium acetate yielding the corresponding monomeric acetates [ MeRSi(C <nUm> H <nUm> )(C <nUm> me <nUm> )LnO <nUm> CMe ] ( r = et ( a ) , ph ( b ) ; ln = Y ( 9a , b ) , La ( 10a , b ) , Sm ( 11a , b ) , Lu ( 12a , b ) ) . all compounds were characterized by elemental analysis , <nUm> H and <nUm> C{ <nUm> H } - NMR spectroscopy , and by mass spectrometry . single crystal x-ray structure determinations show a dimer for 6a and a monomer for 8a . the zirconocenes 8a , b are active catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene and propylene in the presence of methylalumoxane ( MAO ) . 
two kinds of fluorenyl containing zirconocene catalysts , supported on polymethylsiloxane micro gels and on silica , were prepared and applied for ethylene polymerizations using methylaluminoxane as cocatalyst . the observed activities were comparable with those of the corresponding silica supported catalysts . the average molecular weights of the obtained polymers differ from those of the corresponding homogeneous catalysts as from those of the silica supported systems . 
In order to further our study of the bis(2-methylbenz[e]indenyl)zirconium dichloride catalyst system , we have synthesized the analogous tetrahydro-2-methylbenz[e]indene ligand ( 4 ) . In the process of synthesizing <nUm> , we have found that the structural isomer tetrahydro-2-methylbenz[f]indene ( 5 ) is also formed . this has been confirmed by the synthesis of a series of dimethyl ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) , methyl-phenyl ( 8 ) , and titanium trichloride derivatives ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) of the parent indenes <nUm> and <nUm> . the new ligand systems <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were converted to the analogous unbridged zirconocene dichloride complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> . the precursors were then activated with either methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( trityl ) and used as catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene and propylene . all zirconocene complexes were highly active for the polymerization of ethylene , and in some cases produced crystalline polypropylene at lower polymerization temperatures . 
the polymethylene bridged dinuclear zirconocenes [ (CH2)n (C5H4)2][(C9H7)ZrCl 2]2 ( n = <nUm> ( 10 ) , <nUm> ( 11 ) , <nUm> ( 12 ) , <nUm> ( 13 ) ) have been synthesised by treating not only the respective disodium salts of the ligands with two equivalents of C9Cl3H7Zr in THF , but also the distannylated derivatives of the ligands with two equivalents of C9Cl3H7Zr in toluene . all complexes are characterised by 1H- and 13C - NMR and mass spectrometry and elemental analysis . it turned out that the values of dd = [dd-dp] , the chemical shift difference between the distal ( dd ) and proximal ( dp ) protons , for the produced dinuclear compounds ( <nUm> for <nUm> and <nUm> , and <nUm> for <nUm> and <nUm> ) were smaller than the dd values of the known polysiloxane bridged dinuclear compounds . the chemical shifts of the bridgehead carbons in these complexes are about <nUm> ppm shifted downfield with respect to the other two resonances at cyclopentadienyl ring ( <nUm> and <nUm> ppm , respectively ) . In order to investigate the catalytic properties of the dinuclear complexes and mononuclear metallocenes , ethylene polymerisation has been conducted in the presence of MMAO . the most important feature is that the polymethylene bridged dinuclear metallocenes represent enormously improved activities compared with the activities from the corresponding mononuclear metallocene as well as the polysiloxane bridged dinuclear zirconocenes . In addition , the influence of both the nature and length of the bridging ligand upon the reactivities of the dinuclear metallocenes has also been observed . A . 
the title complexes Me4Si2(1-C5H3-3-tBu) 2MCl2 ( m = Ti , <nUm> ; m = Zr , <nUm> ) have been prepared by reaction of Li2Me4Si2(C5H3-3- tBu)2 with MC14*2THF in refluxing THF . rac / meso ratio of about <nUm> / <nUm> was obtained for the titanocene complex <nUm> . but for the zirconocene <nUm> , only meso isomer was obtained . the crystal structures of meso-1 and meso-2 were determined . their catalytic properties for ethylene polymerization have also been studied with MAO as a cocatalyst . A . 
boratabenzenes ( 4 ) are six p-electron aromatic anions which can serve as versatile ligands towards Zr(IV) and Zr (II) . the reaction of <nUm> with Cl4Zr affords bis(boratabenzene)zirconium(IV) dichlorides ( 11 ) , which on treatment with BuLi and excess PMe3 give bis(boratabenzene)bis(trimethylphosphine)zirconium(II) ( 27 ) . on activation by excess methylaluminoxane <nUm> are the catalysts for the polymerization or oligomerization of ethylene . bridged boratabenzene zirconium dichlorides <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> , which closely resemble the corresponding ansa - zirconocenes , can be similarly activated for polymerization of ethylene . compound <nUm> reacts with 1,3-diynes to afford zirconacycles <nUm> and with acetylene by ring annulation to afford <nUm> . A . 
A series of complexes Si2Me4L2ZrCl2 ( L = ind ( 1b ) , 2-Me-Ind ( 2b ) , 3-SiMe3-Ind ( 3b ) and Ind-H4 ( 4 ) ) was prepared . the syntheses of 1b , 3b and <nUm> gave predominantly the meso-isomers , whereas a <nUm> : <nUm> meso : rac mixture was obtained for 2b . x-ray analysis of meso-3b revealed large steric hindrance on the metal center ( cp ° -Zr-Cp ° is <nUm> ° ) . the <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of meso-2b and rac-2b ( activated with MAO ) produced a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of elastic atactic and isotactic polypropylene with low activity . A . 
recent labeling experiments have detected stereoerrors in the isotactic polymerization of propene with zirconocenium catalysts , which are characterized by a deuterium transfer from the polymer chain to a methyl group . using Cp2Zr-iso-butyl+ as a model system , two alternative mechanisms leading to the observed products are investigated using fully nonlocal levels of density functional theory ( DFT ) . the direct hydrogen transfer starting from a g-agostic intermediate requires an overall activation relative to the b-agostic resting state in excess of <nUm> kJ mol-1 and can be excluded . the sequential mechanism involves a ( i ) b-elimination to yield an initial iso-butene p-complex ; ( ii ) a subsequent internal rotation of this p-complex ; and ( iii ) reinsertion of the olefin into the Zr-H bond via two consecutive formations of b-agostic interactions , with maximum relative energies along this path between <nUm> and <nUm> kJ mol-1 ( depending on functional and basis sets employed ) . the subsequent steps are the reverse of the first three steps and can lead to an inverted iso-butyl complex with migrated deuterium . although certain barrier heights are somewhat sensitive to the density functional employed ( BP86 vs. B3LYP ) , the sequential mechanism is much more favorable energetically . loss of olefin from the intermediate p-complex is endothermic by 104-114 kJ mol-1 and should therefore not occur . A . 
complexes generated by treating chloro(aryloxy)bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium [ <nUm> ; aryloxy = 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxy ( 3a ) , 2,6-diisopropylphenoxy ( 3b ) , phenoxy ( 3c ) , 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenoxy ( 3d ) , and 2,6-dimethoxyphenoxy ( 3e ) ] with one equivalent of n-BuLi catalyze dehydrocoupling polymerization of arylsilanes <nUm> [ aryl = phenyl ( 1a ) , p-methoxyphenyl ( 1b ) , p-dimethylaminophenyl ( 1c ) , p-methylthiophenyl ( 1d ) ] at room temperature to afford corresponding polysilanes . their catalytic performance was compared with the conventional system generated from dichlorobis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium ( 4 ) and two equivalents of n-BuLi . the reaction of 1a using 3a / n-BuLi , 3b / n-BuLi or 3c / n-BuLi gave high-molecular-weight polysilanes ( mw = <nUm> × <nUm> and Mn = <nUm> × <nUm> with 3a ; mw = <nUm> × <nUm> and Mn = <nUm> × <nUm> with 3b ; mw = <nUm> × <nUm> and Mn = <nUm> × <nUm> with 3c ) . formation of the polysilane was fast in comparison with <nUm> , in particular when the catalyst was ligated by a sterically demanding ( 3a ) or electron - withdrawing ( 3d ) aryloxy group . the time course of the gel permeation chromatography profiles suggested that complex 3a showed faster chain growth than 3d , 3e and <nUm> . the extent of the formation of undesired cyclics was relatively small ( < <nUm> % ) in the sterically demanding 3a / n-BuLi- or 3b / n-BuLi - catalyzed reaction .

the homogeneous homopolymerization of propene was conducted with the two catalyst precursors Me2Si(Ind)2ZrBz2 ( 1 ) and Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2ZrBz2 ( 2 ) and triphenylmethyltetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate [C(CH3)3][B(C6F5)4] ( 3 ) as cocatalyst . after synthesizing the dibenzyl compounds from their dichloride derivatives the catalyst system ( 1 ) / ( 3 ) was optimized in respect to the catalyst / cocatalyst ratio and the amount of tri(isobutyl) aluminum ( TIBA ) . the polymerization behavior of the catalyst system ( 2 ) / ( 3 ) is investigated using a central composite experimental design . In this design the dependence of the polymer properties on temperature , catalyst and monomer concentration are modeled . the dibenzyl compound ( 2 ) shows extremely high catalytic activities of <nUm> <nUm> kg PP / molZr h molp . the polymers produced with this catalyst exhibit very high melting points and molecular weights . 
four supported metallocenes prepared by the sol - gel method were tested by ethylene homopolymerization and in ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization . the effects of A1 / Zr ratio , polymerization temperature and cocatalysts were evaluated . catalyst A2 , produced by TEA and MAO treatments showed the highest activity ( <nUm> × <nUm> kg PE / mol Zr h-1 ) among the tested systems at A1 / Zr = <nUm> . A2 showed thermal stability on polymerization performed at a temperature as high as <nUm> ° C . all the systems exhibited activity in the presence of common alkylaluminum ( TMA , TEA , TIBA ) . comonomer effect was observed in the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene , where the comonomer incorporation is about <nUm> mol % . SAXS measurements of the employed xerogel suggested a weakly branched polymeric texture . metal content in the resulting polymers showed extremely low levels of Zr . 
positron lifetime measurements are reported for linear poly(a-olefin)s from polypropylene to poly-1-eicosene polymerised using zirconocene catalyst . for comparison a low density polyethylene was also studied . four lifetimes are resolved , the longest of them ( t4 ) is attributed to o-Ps annihilation from free - volume holes in the amorphous phase and is used to estimate the mean volume of these holes . it is observed that the hole size increases with increasing separation between the measuring temperature ( T = <nUm> K ) and the glass transition temperature tg , estimated with differential scanning calorimetry . among the poly(a-olefin)s the average hole volume is the largest in poly-1-dodecene ( <nUm> nm3 , tg = <nUm> K ) and the lowest in polypropylene ( <nUm> nm3 , tg = <nUm> K ) . A method for estimation of the glass transition temperature tg from the experimental hold volumes is proposed . from comparison of amorphous and crystalline densities the fractional free volume was calculated . from this the number of holes was estimated to be <nUm> - <nUm> nm-3 . the effect of exposure of the polymers to positron radiation from the source on the o-Ps annihilation parameters was also studied . while lower poly(a-olefin)s show a more or less pronounced exponential decrease of the o-Ps intensity I4 as a function of time , a slight increase is observed in higher poly(a-olefin)s . possible reasons for this behaviour are discussed . 
this study shows that several coumarin or ketocoumarin / additives combinations ( bisimidazole derivative , mercaptobenzoxazole , titanocene , oxime ester ) are able to initiate quite efficiently a radical polymerization reaction . the interactions between the excited states of coumarins or a ketocoumarin and various additives have also been studied by laser absorption spectroscopy , time resolved fluorescence and photoconductivity ; the redox potentials of these different compounds have been measured and allowed the calculation of free enthalpy variations for a possible electron transfer reaction . the whole results explain the interaction mechanism and show that the coumarins are able to form radicals through an electron transfer reaction with the different additives whereas the ketocoumarin leads to an energy transfer with bisimidazole and to an hydrogen abstraction with the benzoxazole derivative . 
copolymerization of propylene and cyclopentene ( CPE ) was carried out using as a catalyst isospecific rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) , rac-dimethylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 2 ) , rac-dimethylsilylenebis(2-methylindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 3 ) , or syndiospecific diphenylmethylene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 4 ) with methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst . isospecific zirconocene catalysts 1-3 produced copolymers having narrow molecular weight distribution , while syndiospecific catalyst <nUm> effected propylene homopolymerization . microstructures of the copolymers were studied by 13C NMR and distortionless enhancement of polarization transfer ( DEPT ) spectroscopy . CPE was found to be incorporated in the copolymer preferentially via 1,2-insertion mechanism in the copolymerization with the catalyst <nUm> . the catalyst <nUm> and <nUm> gave copolymers containing CPE units formed by either 1,2-insertion or 1,3-insertion mechanism . the proportion of 1,3-insertion units increased with increasing CPE content in the copolymers . the isomerization reaction from 1,2-insertion to 1,3-insertion CPE units was discussed on the basis of kinetic parameters . 
the effect of Al content on MAO - modified silicas was evaluated on catalyst activity , on polymer properties and on residual metal content in the resulting polyethylenes . MAO - modified silicas were prepared by impregnating MAO toluene solutions in concentration range between <nUm> and <nUm> wt % Al / O2Si . commercial MAO - modified silica ( witco ) containing <nUm> wt % Al / O2Si was used for comparative reasons . the resulting modified - silicas were employed as supports for grafting (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 . using external MAO as cocatalyst ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) no difference in catalyst activity was observed . nevertheless , for Al / Zr = <nUm> , catalyst activities were shown to be higher for supported zirconocene systems containing <nUm> - <nUm> wt % Al / O2Si range . according to DSC analysis , one Tm peak was detected for polymer obtained with catalyst prepared with <nUm> wt % Al / O2Si ( <nUm> ° C ) , but two Tm peaks were observed for polymers obtained with catalysts prepared with <nUm> wt % Al / O2Si ( <nUm> and <nUm> ° C ) and <nUm> wt % Al / O2Si ( <nUm> and <nUm> ° C ) . 
A computational study of the ethylene-styrene copolymerization with rac-ethylenebis(tetrahydroindenyl)MCl2 [ m = Ti , Zr ] systems using DFT methods is presented . the complexation , coordination and insertion energies for ethylene and styrene monomers as well as for the styrene-ethylene copolymerization steps into the catalytic active site models [Et2(IndH4)2]MCH3 + [ m = Ti , Zr ] were calculated . the goal of this study is to examine the influence of the metal atom [ Ti , Zr ] on the copolymerization activity . it could be concluded that zirconocene catalyst is much more active than the titanocene based catalyst . this could be explained by the higher steric congestion around the Ti as compared to the Zr complex . furthermore , it was found that the primary styrene insertion gives rise to complexes in which the active sites are blocked by the phenyl ring in both metal atoms , so that only the secondary insertion of the styrene is possible . these facts might help to clarify the already published experimental results . 
copolymers of styrene and a styrene derivative having a Cs symmetrical ligand moiety were synthesized and used as the carrier for the synthesis of supported - type zirconocene catalysts . propene polymerization was conducted using the resulting catalyst together with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , which gave syndiotactic polypropene . the productivity of the polymer - supported catalyst ( <nUm> kg PP ( mol zr)-1 for <nUm> h ) was , however , very low compared to that of the corresponding homogeneous catalyst ( <nUm> kg PP ( mol zr)-1 for <nUm> min ) . 
an isospecific heterogeneous zirconocene catalyst was prepared by supporting rac-Cl2SiInd2ZrCl2 on Cl2Mg using an impregnation method . polymerization of propene was conducted over this combined with methylalumoxane as co-catalyst . it was found that the catalyst displayed a fairly high activity to give highly isotactic polypropene at <nUm> ° C . with an increase in the polymerization temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C , the activity increased monotonically accompanied by a decrease in isospecificity . 
stereospecific polymerization of propylene was carried out with rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) ( 1 ) , rac-dimethylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconiurn dichloride ( rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) ( 2 ) and isopropylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( i-Pr(Cp)(Flu)ZrCl2 ) ( 3 ) combined with trialkyl-aluminum ( AIR3 : r = C2H5 , i-C4H9 ) / triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( Ph3CB(C6F5)4 ) ( 4 ) . In isospecific polymerization with <nUm> and <nUm> , the molecular weight of polypropylenes decreased with increase in the molar ratio of AlEt3 ( et = C2H5 ) / Zr , whereas , an effect of AliBu3 ( iBu = i-C4H9 ) concentration on molecular weight was not observed . the microstructures of resulting polypropylenes were studied by 13C n.m.r . and an increase in the molar ratio of ethyl end groups ( derived from chain transfer to AlEt3 ) to n-propyl end groups ( derived from b-hydrogen transfer ) was observed with increase in the molar ratio of AlEt3 / Zr ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) . the chain transfer reactions by both AlEt3 and AliBu3 were also detected in syndiospecific polymerization with <nUm> . the molar ratio of alkyl ( r ) end groups ( derived from chain transfer to AIR3 ) to n-propyl end groups was higher in the polypropylene obtained with AlEt3 than that obtained with AliBu3 . the relative constants ktrA / kp ( ktrA = rate constant of chain transfer to AIR3 , kp = rate constant of propagation ) were determined by kinetic study . 
we have synthesized a series of novel titanocene complexes with liquid - crystalline ( LC ) groups as coordination ligands , with the ultimate aim of developing LC catalytic species available for anisotropic polymerizations of acetylenes . the titanocene complexes were prepared by introducing LC groups into cyclopentadienyl ligands as substituents , (PCH506Cp)2TiCl2 ( 1 ) , or coordinating them to a titanium atom as symmetric and asymmetric ligands , Cp2Ti(PCH5060)2 ( 2 ) and Cp2Ti(PCH5060)Cl ( 3 ) [ where cp = cyclopentadienyl , CH506P = p-(trans-4-n-pentylcyclohexyl)phenoxyhexyl and CH5060P = p-(trans-4-n-pentylcyclohexyl)phenoxyhexyloxy ] . polarizing optical microscope observations and differential scanning calorimetry measurements indicated that the titanocene complexes <nUm> and <nUm> are the first titanium complexes exhibiting LC behaviour . it is found that the titanocene complexes <nUm> and <nUm> can polymerize phenylacetylenes to give poly(phenylacetylene)s with the aid of triethylaluminium ( Et3Al ) as cocatalyst . the molecular weights and degrees of polymerization of the poly(phenylacetylene)s prepared were comparable or superior to those prepared with titanocene dichloride and tetra-n-butoxytitanium [Ti(O-n-Bu)4] catalysts . the LC titanocene complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were also confirmed to have catalytic activities for the polymerization of acetylene . electron spin resonance spectra of the catalyst systems gave signals of trivalent titanium ( ti3+ ) with no hyperfine structure , suggesting that the catalytically active species is a mononuclear complex consisting of ti3+ rather than a binuclear or trinuclear one . 
several types of commercial and developmental aluminoxanes were studied in the semi-batch polymerization of ethylene using bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) . high temperature gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) measurements of polyethylene ( PE ) formed using various types of aluminoxanes approximated flory 's most probable distribution from a single site - type with PE mw / mns approaching <nUm> for polymerization temperatures ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C . the structure and type of aluminoxane co-catalyst were found not to influence the molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) of PE although to influence the activity of the Cp2ZrCl2 catalyst . In general , modified methylaluminoxanes ( MMAOs ) and methylaluminoxanes ( MAOs ) were found to have similar activities , whereas isobutylaluminoxane ( IBAO ) gave a very low activity in the polymerization of ethylene . increasing isobutyl content in the aluminoxane co-catalyst led to a continual decrease in catalyst activity . increasing aluminium / zirconium ( Al / Zr ) molar ratio , by increasing the MAO concentration , led to increasing catalyst activity up to a maximum activity at an Al / Zr molar ratio of <nUm> . like the structure and type of the aluminoxane co-catalyst , the Al / Zr molar ratio was found not to influence the PE MWD . mixing in additional trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) with MAO was found not to alter the MWD but gave lower activity at similar Al / Zr molar ratios than that from MAO itself .

hydrogenolysis is a commonly used method to control the molecular weight or size of polymers obtained by ziegler - natta and related metallocene catalysts . however , the precise mechanism governing these controlling processes is still unknown . it is most accepted that the insertion of hydrogen molecule into the metal - alkyl bond of the catalyst active species competes favorably against the ethylene insertion . thus , the newly formed hydride complex would react with an incoming ethylene starting a new polymer chain . ab initio calculations at the B3LYP / LANL2DZ level of theory have been performed to calculate the reaction profile of both ethylene and hydrogen insertions into the metal-carbon bond of a zirconocene catalyst system . it has been observed that the activation barrier for the hydrogen molecule insertion is lower than that in case of the ethylene insertion ( <nUm> vs <nUm> kcal / mol ) , supporting the idea of a favored hydrogenolysis process controlling the molecular weight of the polymers . In addition , the ethylene insertion into the hydride complex formed after hydrogenolysis was also studied . No barrier for this reaction has been found , indicating that the initiation of a new chain is an easy step from both thermodynamic and kinetic points of view . the energetic data obtained in the present work provide a reasonable explanation for some experimental facts such as broadening of polymer molecular weight distributions and the early consumption of hydrogen present in the ethylene polymerization .

experimental results showing the unique possibilities of modification of catalytic properties of homogeneous metallocene IVB group catalysts in propylene polymerization under the action of triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) or in the presence of small additives of lewis bases ( LB ) are presented . it has been shown that the preactivation of zirconocene dichlorides at low MAO excess ( ∼ <nUm> <nUm> mol / mol ) followed by the activation with TIBA also at low molar TIBA excess to over metallocene ( ∼ <nUm> <nUm> mol / mol ) gives rise to very active homogeneous catalysts for olefin polymerization . the approach allows a 10-100-fold decrease of MAO charges . monomethylated zirconocene complexes with MAO as catalytic intermediates formed under preactivation conditions and the mixture of tetraisobutylalumoxane / polyisobutylalumoxane as cocatalysts formed at nearby stoichiometric amounts of TIBA and MAO were recognized as the key components of the analyzed catalytic systems . it has been shown for the first time that purposeful introduction of almost stoichiometric amounts of ternary amines to the L <nUm> MMe <nUm> / h <nUm> CB(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> / TIBA catalytic systems ( L <nUm> MMe <nUm> = ph <nUm> CCpFluMMe <nUm> ( m = Zr , Hf ) , rac-Me <nUm> SiInd <nUm> ZrMe <nUm> ) can result in an extremely high increase in the catalyst activity , the effect being most pronounced for hafnocenes in the presence of NPh <nUm> . it was also shown that TIBA in these catalytic systems acts as the reagent reducing stereoselectivity of the catalyst leading to the formation of stereoblock polypropylenes for C s -symmetry catalysts . the reasons for the effects observed are discussed .

cyclic olefins like cyclobutene , cyclopentene , and norbornene can be polymerized to give isotactic polymers with chiral metallo - cene / aluminoxane catalysts , especially with et(bisindenyl)zir-coniumdichloride / methylalumoxane . the polycycloalkenes show extremely high melting points which are <nUm> ° C for polycyclopentene , <nUm> ° C for polycyclobutene and over <nUm> ° C for polynorbornene , which is more than the decomposition temperature . 13C - NMR spectroscopy provides information about the structure of the highly crystalline homopolymers . to lower the melting points , copolymerization with ethene or propene is carried out . the co-polymerization parameter r1 of the olefins ethene / cyclopentene increases with temperatures from <nUm> ( − <nUm> ° C ) to <nUm> ( <nUm> ° C ) . even when in solution the copolymers obtained using one enantiomer of the chiral zirconocene show a small optical rotation . polymers of rigid cycloalkenes like dimethanooctahydronaphthalene with ethylene are amorphous and feature high tg values . they could be used as starting materials for optical discs . the information about aging reactions between zirconocene and aluminoxane sheds more light on the mechanism of homogeneous olefin catalysts . 
<nUm> . studies by 1H NMR on equilibria between contact ion pairs such as Cp2ZrCH3d + … H3C-B(C6F5)3d- and binuclear alkyl zirconocene cations of the type (Cp2ZrCH3)2(m-CH3) + lead to the conclusion that these binuclear species must generally be considered as participants in all homogeneous ziegler - natta systems . <nUm> . different polypropene chain lengths , which are obtained from cis- and trans-1D - propene with the catalyst en(thind)2ZrCl2 / MAO , show that exchange of a-H with a-D atoms affect the rate of chain growth by a large kinetic isotope effect ; this supports the notion that an a-agostic interaction facilitates the olefin insertion step . <nUm> . A strong increase in polymer chain lengths , which is caused by the presence of a-methyl groups in ansa - zirconocene catalysts , is shown , by the effects of propene pressure on MW , to be due to the suppression of the otherwise predominant direct b-H - transfer to a coordinated olefin molecule by these a-substituents .

addition of small amounts of ethylene or hydrogen leads to significant productivity increase in propylene polymerization catalyzed by fluxional bis(2-arylindenyl)zirconocenes . to test if this phenomenon is related to the reactivation of dormant species formed as a result of regioirregular propylene insertions , we have reinvestigated the regioregularity of these catalysts . approximately <nUm> - <nUm> mol % of 2,1-misinsertions were found in polymers synthesized by these catalysts . the presence of these regioirregular insertions could account for the ethylene and hydrogen effects observed but does not rule out formation of other catalyst dormant sites .

four metallocene catalysts were prepared using two indenyl-containing aerogels as supports , treated under different conditions ( triethylaluminum ( TEA ) , methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and butyllithium ) . the catalysts were characterized by complementary spectroscopic techniques : ultraviolet - visible spectroscopy ( UV - vis ) , x-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy ( XPS ) , matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization time - of - flight mass spectroscopy ( MALDI-TOF-MS ) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and electron probe microanalysis ( EPMA ) . the highest metal content ( <nUm> mmol Zr / g-cat . ) was achieved in the case of xerogel treated with TEA prior to metallocene synthesis . after MAO leaching , such content is reduced to <nUm> mmol-Zr / g-cat. , exhibiting the highest activity in ethylene polymerization among the four developed catalysts . A relationship between catalyst activity and binding energy of Zr 3d(5 / <nUm> ) core level could be evidenced . the most active catalyst system showed a better Zr distribution , being the catalyst grain covered by aluminum cocatalyst . depth profile monitoring by XPS measurements showed that , in fact , MAO leaches the zirconocene low binding energy species , being deposited in the uttermost surface of the grains .

eight zirconocene dichloride complexes are described that contain an alkyl or silylalkyl substituent with a fluorenyl end group on the cyclopentadienyl ring . also , a bridged cyclopentadienyl indenyl metallocene complex with a fluorenyl terminated alkyl substituent is reported . these complexes were activated with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) and used for catalytic ethylene polymerization .

the synthesis and characterization of <nUm> new , unbridged metallocene dichloride complexes of the type (L)(Ind)ZrCl2 ( L = o-phenylalkyl substituted cyclopentadienyl or 1-phenylsilyl substituted indenyl ; ind = indenyl ) and (L')(Flu)ZrCl2(L ' = 1-benzyl substituted indenyl or 2-benzyl substituted indenyl ; flu = fluorenyl ) are reported . after activation with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) , these complexes are highly active catalysts for homogeneous ethylene polymerization . the influence of various substituents on the catalyst activities and the polymer properties are discussed . V . 
ethylene polymerization was carried out by using the zirconocene catalysts supported on MCM-41 ( or Al-MCM-41 ) , which had a uniform hexagonal array of linear channels constructed with a honeycomb - like silica matrix , and about <nUm> Å d-spacing . the zirconocene catalysts supported directly on silicious MCM-41 ( Cp2ZrCl2 / MCM-41 ) did not show any activity in ethylene polymerization . on the other hand , the activities of the zirconocene catalysts supported directly on Al-MCM-41 ( Cp2ZrCl2 / Al-MCM-41 ) were comparable to those of homogeneous zirconocenes , and much higher than the activities of those supported on Al-MCM-41 modified by methylaluminoxane ( Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO / Al-MCM-41 ) . the lewis acidity in Al-MCM-41 seemed to play an important role for anchoring the zirconocenes , such that lower value of Si / Al ratio resulted in higher catalytic activity . modification with MAO must have reduced the role of acidity . the difference in the catalytic activity among the supported zirconocenes was discussed through the surface species models on the interaction between zirconocene and lewis acids in Al-MCM-41 .

1H and 13C NMR studies of the reactions between two b-alkyl-substituted aluminoxanes obtained from the in situ reaction between Al(i-Bu)3 , Al(i-Oct)3 and H2O with two metallocenes Cp2ZrCl2 and cp2 / (*)ZrCl2 ( cp = cyclopentadienyl , and cp(*) = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ) have been performed . the b-branched aluminoxanes were obtained from the in situ reaction between Al(i-R)3 and H2O at Al / H2O molar ratio of <nUm> ( r = i-Bu ( TIBAO ) , r = i-Oct ( TIOAO ) ) . A comparison of the Cp2ZrCl2 and cp2 / (*)ZrCl2 reactivity with MAO , as the reference point for aluminoxanes , as well as with their parent aluminum alkyls AlMe3 ( TMA ) , Al(i-Bu)3 ( TIBA ) , and Al(i-Oct)3 ( TIOA ) has been made . cp2 / (*)ZrCl2 , because of steric hindrance , is less reactive than Cp2ZrCl2 towards all aluminium compounds considered . the cp2 / (*)Zr-i-BuCl and cp2 / (*)Zr-i-OctCl produced appear to be more stable than Cp2Zr-i-BuCl and Cp2Zr-i-OctCl due to the cp* steric hindrance , which inhibits b-hydrogen eliminations . the lower reactivity of cp2 / (*)ZrCl2 along with the higher stability of the zirconium alkyls produced has allowed us to produce evidence of the greater capacity of TIOAO with respect to TIBAO for yielding alkylated ion pairs . these results explain the polymerization activities yielded by metallocenes when combined with the above aluminoxanes , that is , the Cp2ZrCl2 activity only with MAO , and the high polymerization activities of substituted metallocenes when b-alkyl-substituted aluminoxanes are used as cocatalysts .

all - electron DFT ( B3LYP ) calculations with a split - valence basis set of double- and triple-x quality have been used to study the reaction paths of the first and second step insertion as well as of the s-bond metathesis for the reaction of acetylene with (C5H5)2ZrCH3+ . geometry optimizations of the reactants , intermediates , transition states and products were carded out without symmetry constraints . the nature of the particular points on the potential energy surfaces was verified by the analytical calculation of the hessian matrices . the relative electronic energies are corrected for ZPVE , entropic and thermal contributions , and correspond to the gibbs free energies ( DDG298 ) . it is shown that the propagation step of acetylene polymerization is a facile process from kinetic and thermodynamic point of view , and that the investigated insertion reactions are kinetically and thermodynamically favoured over the s-bond metathesis reaction . the calculated energetics and structures of either reaction are compared with available theoretical and experimental data of relevant complexes of group ill and IV transition metals .

under certain conditions ( <nUm> ° C , C2H4P = <nUm> MPa ) , the oligomerization of ethylene catalyzed by Cp2ZrCl2 / EAO ( ethylaluminoxane ) , Et3Al or (i-Bu)3Al afforded methylenecyclopentane ( MCP ) along with chain oligomers . the nature of cocatalysts and the Al / Zr ratios as well as the hydrolysis extent of Et3Al have tangible effects on the selectivity of the cyclic oligomer . with Et3Al as cocatalyst under optimal conditions , the oligomerization of ethylene gave MCP and C4 - C10 chain olefins in a ratio of <nUm> / <nUm> .

effects of heterogenization parameters on compositional and catalytic properties of Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 supported on silica modified with MAO were evaluated using data on metal loading , catalyst activity in ethylene-propylene copolymerization , and polymer properties . the supported catalysts were prepared according to a <nUm> factorial design for multivariate analysis . the parameters studied were : MAO concentration in impregnation , Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 concentration in grafting , and immobilization temperature for both metallocene and organoaluminum . the grafting solution was monitored by UV - VIS spectroscopy , while the resulting catalyst systems were characterized by inductively - coupled plasma - optical emission spectroscopy ( ICP - OES ) , diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy ( DRIFTS ) , and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) . At high statistical significance , both MAO and Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 concentrations during preparation affected the determination of the final A1 / Zr ratio on silica . the catalyst systems were tested in ethylene-propylene copolymerizations using external MAO as cocatalyst . relationships were observed between ( i ) catalyst activity and the binding energy of Zr 3d5 / <nUm> electrons and ( ii ) Al / Zr ratio on silica and the average ethylene incorporation . the polymer samples presented narrow molecular weight distribution , but according to differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , and cross-fractionation chromatography ( CFC ) data , catalyst systems with given Al / Zr ratios might yield different crystallites , suggesting a plural distribution of chemical composition .

four alkoxyl ligand substituted indenyl titanium dichloride complexes , IndTiCl2(OR) ( r = me ( 2 ) , et ( 3 ) , iPr ( 4 ) , cyclohexyl ( 5 ) ) were prepared , and evaluated as catalysts for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene when activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . alkoxyl ligand substituted complexes showed higher catalytic activities than IndTiCl3 ( 1 ) except for complex <nUm> . when r = et , the catalyst <nUm> showed the highest activity . A study of the steric and electronic effects of alkoxyl ligand revealed that the more electron - donating and less steric bulky r group was more suitable for the improvement of the catalytic activity . when the polymerization was carried in solution at high molar ratio of Al / Ti = <nUm> , the s-PS % of obtained polymer were in the range of <nUm> - <nUm> % . the highest melting point of <nUm> ° C was obtained by using <nUm> as catalyst . the influence of polymerization temperature was also investigated . the maximum polymerization activities were found at <nUm> ° C for all of the above complexes , but the percentages of s-PS were insensitive to the polymerization temperature .

this work presents the results of theoretical and experimental characterization of supported (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 on organosilanes pre-treated O2Si . several possibilities are analyzed and considered as an attempt to explain the observed zirconocene loadings , catalyst performance in ethylene polymerization and resulting polymer properties of these supported zirconocenes . the effect of silica pre-treatment with Ph3SiCl , Me3SiCl and Me2HSiCl on the immobilization of (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 was modeled . the main considered aspects were the role of the surface concentration of the organosilanes , the presence or absence of residual chlorine and the possibility of interactions between the organosilanes and the zirconocene . all these facts might afford different surface species at the impregnation step prior to the MAO activation during the polymerization reaction . V . 
the different elementary steps in the racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 activation process by commercial methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) are studied by UV - VIS spectroscopy technique and correlated with hexene polymerization kinetics . after monomethylation of the zirconocene dichloride ( λ = <nUm> nm ) , abstraction of Cl ligand by MAO at low Al : Zr ratios ( Al : Zr = <nUm> ) yields tight ion pairs , [racEt(Ind)2ZrMe]+ , [MAOCl]- with an absorption band centered at λ = <nUm> nm , inactive towards hexene polymerization . addition of MAO in large excess ( Al : Zr = <nUm> ) is therefore required to form active species identified as TMA separated ion pairs , [ racEt(Ind)2Zr+ (m-Me)2AlMe2 ] , [ MAO ∼ cl]- ( λ = <nUm> nm ) . the activation of racEt(Ind)2ZrMe2 by MAO reveals much easier and is complete at low Al : Zr ratios ( Al : Zr = <nUm> ) , yielding directly active ion pairs [racEt(Ind)2ZrMe]+ , [MAOMe]- , absorbing at λ = <nUm> nm . these data underline the negative role of [MAOCl]- as a counter-anion in the activation process of zirconocene dichloride precursor for olefin polymerization . In the same conditions , the use of TMA - depleted MAO allows the direct formation , at low Al : Zr ratio , of active tight ion pairs λ = <nUm> nm ) . V . 
the activation process by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) of various zirconocene precursors of the type racEt(Ind)2ZrX2 , with different extractable x ligands ( x = Cl , me , NMe2 , CH2Ph ) , was investigated both by means of UV - VIS spectroscopy and through hex-1-ene polymerization kinetics . the different elementary steps yielding olefin polymerization active species , i.e. methylation and cationization of the transition metal could be readily discriminated . unlike racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 precursor for which high amount of MAO ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) is required to form catalytic species active towards olefin polymerization , the complete activation of other racEt(Ind)2ZrX2 tested ( with x = me , NMe2 , CH2Ph ) is readily achieved at relatively low Al / Zr ratios ( Al / Zr = 40-50 ) . the corresponding zirconocenium species exhibit different catalytic activity according to the nature of the extracted x ligand , showing the important role of the formed [MAO-X]- counter-anion in the activation process and more particularly , its ability to still coordinate with the metal center and compete with the incoming olefin . V . 
A series of supported metallocene catalysts were prepared by immobilizing (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 and Cp2NbCl2 on bare and on MAO - modified silica . both metallocenes were sequentially grafted on silica under different combinations . metal loading ( Zr , Nb and Al ) was determined by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy ( XRF ) . final metal content was shown to be dependent on passivation of silica with MAO , and on the grafting sequence . higher metal contents ( <nUm> wt. % Nb / O2Si and <nUm> wt. % Zr / O2Si ) were achieved when the metallocene was grafted onto MAO - modified silica . Cp2NbCl2 derivatives were not active in polymerizing ethylene using MAO as co-catalyst ( Al / Nb = <nUm> ) . all the systems containing zirconocene derivatives showed high catalyst activity . nevertheless , higher activities were achieved immobilizing (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 on silica that was previously modified with MAO and Cp2NbCl2 . some immobilization protocols led to catalyst systems which were even more active than the homogenous counterpart . effects of support structure and chemical modification on the catalyst performance are presented and discussed . V . 
heterogeneous metallocene catalysts avoid reactor fouling in olefin polymerisations . for technical use the metallocene catalysts must be fixed on carriers . silica is one of the favoured inorganic carriers . but the activities of heterogeneous metallocene catalysts on silica in ethylene and propylene polymerisation are often lower than those of comparable homogeneous catalyst systems . we tested the clay minerals kaolin and montmorillonite as inorganic carriers for the polymerisation of ethylene and propylene with commercially available titanocenes and zirconocenes and also with new types of titanocenes . the heterogeneous catalysts on kaolin were less active in ethylene polymerisation as comparable homogeneous catalysts and they were not active in propylene polymerisation . In contrast the heterogeneous catalysts on montmorillonite are often more active in ethylene or propylene polymerisation than comparable homogeneous systems . As cocatalysts trimethylaluminium ( AlMe3 , TMA ) and triisobutylaluminium ( Al(iBu3) , TIBA ) were used for heterogeneous polymerisations . As catalysts commercially available titanocenes and zirconocenes and also four titanocenes with unusual structures were tested which lang et al. had synthesised . the high activities in ethylene or propylene polymerisations with montmorillonite may be due to the special structure of the montmorillonite carrier . V . 
we treated silica with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane , BC18F15 , to create borane - functionalized support , SiO2-B(C6F5)3 which was then used as a support and co-catalyst for the in situ activated dichloro-zirconocene ( Cp2ZrCl2 / TIBA ) and dimethyl-zirconocene catalyst systems ( Cp2Zr(CH3)2 ) for ethylene polymerization . the surface modifications of SiO2-B(C6F5)3 was investigated by SEM - EDX , FTIR and XPS to determine the distribution of fluorine and boron atoms on the silica surface as a measure of the presence of BC18F15 and interaction with the siloxane groups of the silica support . catalytic performances are presented in the form of ethylene consumption rate profiles . the results show that the independent of the time dedicated to the in situ activation of the metallocene , all pre-activated systems showed activity decay . In contrast , the in situ activated systems either showed little or no activity decay . the presence of TIBA was adequate to make an active MAO - free catalyst system . the pre-activated and in situ activated metallocene systems produced polyethylene with slightly different molecular weights ( MWs ) and molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) . MWDs were quite narrow ∼ <nUm> . the bulk density of polyethylene product is highest for the in situ activated metallocenes , but there is no difference between the products of dichloro- and dimethyl-zirconocenes . pre-activated and in situ activated catalysts show no reactor fouling .

A series of aryl-substituted tetramethylcyclopentadienyl zirconocenes (C5Me4C6H4X-4)Cp' MCl2 [ CP' = CH , x = H ( 5 ) , me ( 6 ) , Cl ( 7 ) or OMe ( 8 ) ; cp' = ind , x = H ( 9 ) , me ( 10 ) or Cl ( 11 ) ; cp' = 2-Ph-Ind , x = H ( 12 ) ] and (C5Me4C6H4X-4)2 Cl2Zr [ x = H ( 13 ) , me ( 14 ) , Cl ( 15 ) ] , with different substituents at the 4-position of phenyl , have been prepared by the reaction of the corresponding ligands ( C5Me4HC6H4X-4 ) [ x = H ( 1 ) , me ( 2 ) , Cl ( 3 ) or OMe ( 4 ) ] with n-BuLi , Cl4Zr and Cp'Li or with n-BuLi and Cl4Zr . ethylene polymerization with these complexes in combination with MAO has been studied . the electron donor ( me ) at the 4-position of phenyl led to an increase in catalytic activity while the electron - withdrawing group ( Cl ) and the strong π donor ( OMe ) led to its decrease . complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> exhibited very high activities , but 13-15 showed much lower activities due to the bulky steric effect . the molecular structure of <nUm> has been determined by x-ray diffraction . the relationship between structures of catalysts and catalytic activities were discussed . V . 
the behavior of two differently prepared methylaluminoxanes ( MAOs ) on the activation process of racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 for olefin polymerization was studied . contrarily to commercial product , the two MAOs used are characterized by a low content of free trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) . MAO-A was prepared by pumping off the TMA contained in commercial MAO , whereas MAO-B was obtained by thermal treatment of TMA with benzophenone . the different elementary steps in the zirconocene activation process depending on the amount and nature of added MAO ( commercial and modified ones ) were investigated by UV / visible spectroscopy . In all cases , monomethylation of racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 rapidly takes place after addition of small amounts of MAO . then , abstraction of the second chloride of the metallocene occurs upon addition of larger amounts of MAO ( Al / Zr < <nUm> ) leading to the formation of highly active catalytic species for hexene polymerization . this is characterized by a bathochromic shift of the zirconocene absorption band . the role of TMA is clearly pointed out by comparing the modified MAO / zirconocene systems with the one based on commercial MAO . the influence of structure and composition of MAO on the activation process is also clearly underlined by the very different amounts of activator needed to get metallocene active species in the presence of commercial and modified cocatalysts . V . 
mono , di and tetranuclear ansa zirconocene complexes have been synthesized and characterized . after activation with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) these catalysts were used for the homogeneous and heterogeneous polymerization of ethylene . the properties of the catalysts and the produced polymers were compared . the multinuclear catalysts show a different performance than the corresponding mononuclear derivatives . the tetranuclear catalysts have the lowest activities because of steric crowding . V . 
five new hetero - bimetallic metallocene complexes were synthesized by the reaction of RCpTiCl3 and a Si - bridged zirconocene complex in refluxing toluene . they were all well characterized . these complexes activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) are highly active catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene . the molecular weight ( mw = 28,957-124,089 ) and the molecular weight distribution ( MWD = <nUm> - <nUm> ) of the polymer generated from the bimetallic catalytic system were higher than that obtained by Cp2ZrCl2 . V . 
A series of alkoxyl substituted half - sandwich titanocenes [ CpTiCl2(OR) , CpTi(OR)3 and IndTiCl2(OR) ] were treated with BF3*Et2O , which were employed in situ as catalyst precursors for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene . when activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , the catalyst precursors obtained in situ from the reaction of methoxyl substituted complexes [ CpTiCl2(OMe) , CpTi(OMe)3 ] and BF3*Et2O exhibited increased activities by factors of 2-4 compared with the corresponding original complexes , and provide improved syndiotacticity and higher activity up to a temperature of <nUm> ° C . the catalyst precursor may consist of [ CpTiClF2 and / or CpTiCl2F ] and [ CpTiF2(OMe)*BF3 and / or CpTiF(OMe)2*2BF3 , through conversion from BF3 - coordinated intermediates to fluorinated complexes , respectively , which has properties in polymerization similar to that of CpTiF3 . but in the case of IndTiCl2(OR) and alkoxyl substituted half - sandwich titanocene with bulky OR groups , the activity considerably decrease probably due to the bulky group retarding the conversion from BF3 - coordinated intermediates to fluorinated complexes , which can stabilize catalytic precursor and inhibit reduction from Ti(IV) to Ti (III) . V . 
A newly synthesized catalyst , a pentamethylene bridged dinuclear zirconocene [ CH2 (C5H4)2][(C9H7)ZrCl 2]2 ) , and its in situ supported catalyst were tested in a ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization and their performance was compared with those of Cp2ZrCl2 and rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 . when homogeneous [ CH2 (C5H4)2][(C9H7)ZrCl 2]2 catalyst was used in the copolymerization , its activity decreased with comonomer incorporation ( a negative comonomer effect ) and it produced copolymer with a lower comonomer content than other catalysts , both of which were ascribed to the steric effect of the [ CH2 (C5H4)2][(C9H7)ZrCl 2]2 catalyst . with in situ supported catalysts , the activity did not change much with the increase of 1-hexene content in contrast to the homogeneous catalysts . In situ supported catalysts produced copolymers with higher content of 1-hexene and lower melting point and crystallinity . the changes in the molecular weight and its distribution of the copolymer with in situ supporting were significant and dependant on the nature of the catalyst . V . 
A series of <nUm> dissymmetric dinuclear ansa zirconocene complexes and their ligand precursors have been synthesized and characterized . after activation with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , these catalysts polymerize ethylene with different productivities and polydispersities in homogeneous and heterogeneous media . the tendencies of these series are shown . V . 
the homopolymerization of ethylene was investigated using the catalysts of (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 supported on PMHS - modified silicas ( PMHS = polymethylhydrosiloxane ) . the effect of the amount of the organosilane polymer on the metallocene grafted content was studied in loadings of PMHS from <nUm> to <nUm> wt. % Si / O2Si , in which the grafted Zr content was from <nUm> to <nUm> wt. % Si / O2Si . the metal contents were determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) , while the catalyst stepwise preparation was monitored by diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy ( DRIFTS ) . the chemical environment of the zirconocene surface species were further probed by x-ray spectroscopy ( XPS ) and the metal distribution was studied by electron probe microanalysis ( EPMA ) . these catalyst systems produced polyethylenes with a narrow molecular weight distribution using methylaluminoxane as co-catalyst , and their catalyst activities were three times greater than the one obtained with (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 supported on the bare O2Si . effects of the support structure and the chemical modification on the catalyst performance are presented and discussed . V . 
propylene homopolymerization was carried out with Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 immobilized on commercial MAO - modified silica by the in situ supporting technique . adsorption isotherm determination for this metallocene on silica indicated that the saturation level is reached at <nUm> wt. % Zr / SMAO . catalyst systems were shown to be active in the absence of external MAO , being activated by common alkylaluminum cocatalysts , namely triethylaluminum ( TEA ) , isoprenylaluminum ( IPRA ) and triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) . the effect of the nature and concentration of cocatalyst on catalyst activity and on polypropylene ( PP ) properties was evaluated . best catalyst activity was observed in low concentration of IPRA ( <nUm> kg PP / g cat h ) . the resulting polymers were characterized by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , 13C nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy , and scanning electronic microscopy ( SEM ) . V . 
A series of supported catalysts were prepared by combining ( nBuCp ) 2ZrCl2 and Cp2ZrCl2 sequentially grafted on silica in different ratio ( <nUm> : <nUm> and <nUm> : <nUm> ) and immobilization order . catalyst systems were characterized by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) , diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy ( DRIFTS ) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and electron probe microanalysis ( EPMA ) . grafted metal content remained comprised between <nUm> and <nUm> wt. % Zr / OSi <nUm> . all the systems were shown to be active in ethylene homopolymerization having methylaluminoxane as co-catalyst . catalyst activity was shown to be dependent on the metallocene nature , but not on the addition order or molar ratio . the highest activity was achieved with cp 2ZrCl2 / (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 ( <nUm> : <nUm> ) catalyst system ( ca. <nUm> kg PE ( mmol zrh)-1 ) . resulting polymers were characterized by GPC and DSC . In spite of bearing two catalyst centers , no bimodality was observed in the resulting polymers . V . 
the stereotacticities of a series of polypropylene polymer chains produced with different categories of structurally characterized ansa- zirconocene and hafnocene procatalysts in homogeneous catalysis have been determined by statistical analyses of the methyl pentad signal intensity distributions of their 13C NMR spectra . the polymers microstructural characteristics have been contrasted with the intramolecular parameters of the discrete metallocene molecules obtained from single crystal x-ray diffractions and different 1H NMR measurements . for the first category , by contrasting the polymerization behavior of zirconocene - hafnocene pairs the origin of the stereospecificity differences have been discussed in terms of heavy atom electron configuration , lanthanoid shell contraction and relativistic effects operative on elements belonging to the sixth row of the periodic table . for the second category the observed changes in polymerization behavior for a pair of zirconocene based catalysts with ligand modification of irrelevant steric control have been correlated to the electron density redistribution on different aromatic carbons and the consequent change in flexibility of the catalyst framework , increase of the haptocity of M-C5 bonding and variation of the frontier orbital shape and diffusivity . for the third category , pairs of syndio- and isotactic specific ansa - zirconocene and hafnocenes have been selected in which the organic ligands are constructed with the same aromatic moieties joined with different bridges . the observed catalytic changes have been correlated to combined steric and electronic factors altering orbital energies and hybridizations . finally , by introducing a fourth category , the Hf effect is demonstrated by comparing the catalytic olefin activities of two non-bridged hafnocene- zirconocene pairs . 
ethylene , propylene and 1-butene polymerization kinetics have been investigated in the presence of <nUm> zirconocene and ethylalumoxane derivatives with various molecular masses and a molar ratio of Al / Zr = 23-26 . it was found that zirconocene activity in combination with ethylalumoxanes with molecular weight MW = <nUm> ( an oligomer with -[OAl(C2H5)]- unit number equal to <nUm> ) increases in series : Cp(Acac)2ZrCl < (Fulv)2Cp,Zr,Cl2 < Cp,ZrMe2 < (Fulv)2Cp2Zr2(O)Cl2 < (Ind)2ZrCl2 < (t-Bu2Cp)2ZrCl2 < Cp2ZrCl2 < (t-BuCp)2ZrCl2 < (MeCp)2ZrCl2 < (i-PrCp)2ZrCl2 , where fulv - fulvalene . with methylalumoxane ( MW = <nUm> , ( -[OAl(CH3)]- unit number <nUm> ) the following series of zirconocene activity was established : (MeCp)2ZrCl2 < (EtCp)2ZrCl2 < (PrCp)2ZrCl2 < ( BuCp2ZrCl2 < (i-PrCp)2ZrCl2 < ( cyclo- HexCp)2ZrCl2 . 
the copolymerization of ethylene and 1,5-hexadiene was investigated under high pressure of <nUm> bar using a zirconocene catalyst in the presence of methylaluminoxane . the concentration of the diene was varied over a wide range including the homopolymerization of both ethylene and 1,5-hexadiene . from the amount of polymer formed per unit of time and the catalyst feed the productivity was determined . the resulting polymers were analyzed by DSC , GPC , IR- and 13C-NMR-spectroscopy to evaluate the average molecular weights together with the polydispersity , the crystallinity , the melting point and the structure . the catalyst exhibits a good ability for copolymerization and cyclopolymerization of 1,5-hexadiene in which a predominance of trans ring formation was observed . 
the isoselective propene polymerization using the homogeneous Me2Si(Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst system was investigated . the influence of the concentrations of metallocene and MAO activator on polymerization kinetics and microstructure of the resulting polymer was studied . catalyst activity was found to be independent of zirconocene concentration and only a function of total MAO concentration . polypropene microstructure was not affected by either MAO or zirconocene concentration . the polymerization behavior is compared to that of Me2Si(2-Me Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO . A model is presented to account for the equilibria present in the polymerization medium . this model takes into account the interactions between metallocene cation and excess MAO , thus explaining the influence of MAO concentration on catalyst activity in propene polymerization . 
A modified extended huckel method ( EHMO ) , which includes core - core repulsion terms , was used to study a propylene polymerization heterogeneous catalyst by modeling the adsorption of the ansa - metallocene ethylen-bisindenylzirconium dichloride ( C20Cl2H17Zr from now on EtInd2ZrCl2 ) on O2Si surfaces . the adsorption was considered to occur at two faces of O2Si ( with geminal and isolated OH 's ) and at two different temperatures for O2Si pretreatment ( <nUm> and <nUm> ° C ) . taking into account that the interaction with Al compounds is considered as a way to improve the catalyst performance , specially with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , a local model of aluminoxane ( AlO ) was added to Si-O bond with the subsequent metallocene adsorption . the results show that AlO improves the zirconocene adsorption on O2Si modeled at <nUm> ° C while it inhibits that process at <nUm> ° C . 
the c(s)- and c(2v)-symmetric doubly dimethylsilylene-bridged zirconocene complexes (Me2Si)2{e5-C5H2-4-CHMe2{e5C5H-3,5-(SiMe3)2}ZrCl2 , 6a , and (Me2Si)2{e5C5H-3,5-(CHMe2)2)2ZrCl2 , 6b , have been synthesized by reaction of corresponding dilithio ligand salts with Cl4Zr in CCl2H2 . when activated with methyl aluminoxane , C ( s ) - symmetric zirconocene 6a catalyzes the polymerization of propylene ( liquid propylene , <nUm> ° C ) to yield a syndiotactic polymer of mw = <nUm> and rrrr % = <nUm> . by contrast , c(2v)-symmetric zirconocene 6b displays a low activity and affords an atactic polymer . 
displacement of the anion H3C-B(C6F5)3 from the zirconocene contact - ion pair [ (C5H5)2Zr(CH3)+ *** (m-H3C)-B(C6F5)3- ] by a series of phosphines and formation of a bisphosphine complex by uptake of a second phosphine ligand have been studied by NMR methods in C6D6 solutions . evidence is presented that associated , outer - sphere ion pairs [(C5H5)2Zr(CH3)(PR3)]+ H3C-B(C6F5)3- predominate at zirconocene concentrations up to ca. <nUm> mM ; higher aggregates become apparent at higher zirconocene concentrations . equilibrium constants for the formation of mono- and bis-PMe3 complexes have been determined ; the latter are found to be highly sensitive to steric perturbations . these data , together with density - functional estimates for reaction enthalpies , lead to the following qualitative conclusions with regard to olefin coordination in zirconocene - based polymerization catalysts : ( i ) the olefin substrate displaces the borate anion only from a small equilibrium fraction of the zirconocene alkyl cations present ; ( ii ) the predominant fraction of the resulting zirconocene alkyl olefin cation remains in an outer - sphere association with the counteranion ; ( iii ) mutual displacement of olefin and counteranion from the Zr center is slow compared to typical olefin insertions ; ( iv ) uptake of a second olefin under formation of a cationic zirconocene alkyl diolefin complex is rather unlikely even at elevated olefin concentrations . 
the behavior of (C2B9H11)M(NEt2)2(NHEt2) [ m = Ti ( 1 ) , Zr ( 2 ) ] mono-dicarbollide complexes in olefin and styrene polymerisation has been investigated . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> , when activated by MAO ( Al / m = <nUm> to <nUm> ) , polymerise ethylene with good activity . surprisingly , <nUm> can also be activated with small amounts of triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA , Al / Zr = <nUm> to <nUm> ) . the ethylene polymerisation activity of the <nUm> / TIBA catalyst ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> atm , toluene-chlorobenzene ) is greater than that reported for the CpZrX3 / MAO catalysts but lower by about one or two orders of magnitude than zirconocene - MAO systems ( e.g. Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO , rac-(ethylene-bis-l-idenyl)ZrCl2 / MAO ) . the GPC ( gel permeation chromatography ) curve of the polyethylene sample obtained with <nUm> / TIBA catalyst ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> atm , toluene-chlorobenzene ) is bimodal indicating that at least two species are active in this system and one is more active than the other . the <nUm> / MAO system ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> atm , toluene-chlorobenzene ) slowly polymerises propylene to atactic polymer . under the same experimental conditions 1-pentene does not polymerise at all . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> , activated with MAO , produce syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) with very low activity . attempts to copolymerise styrene with ethylene by the <nUm> / MAO and <nUm> / MAO systems afforded a mixture of the two homopolymers . 
ethene / 1-octene and ethene / 1-butene copolymerization using various methylaluminoxane - activated metallocene catalysts , e.g. silylene-bridged substituted bisindenyl zirconocene systems and halfsandwich titanocene , was performed at <nUm> ° C in toluene . the influence of the ligand substitution on comonomer incorporation , catalyst activity , molar mass , molar mass distribution , degree of polymerization and copolymerization parameters was investigated in ethene / 1-octene copolymerization at constant comonomer ratio and in ethene / l-butene copolymerization as a function of varying ethene / 1-butene feed mass ratios . In ethene / 1-octene copolymerization the highest comonomer incorporation was achieved with MAO - activated Me2Si(Me4Cp)(N-tert-butyl)TiCl2 catalyst . best performance in terms of comohomer incorporation combined with high catalyst activity and molar mass was found for silylene-bridged bisindenylzirconocenes , where 2-methyl substitution promoted high degree of polymerization and benzannelation accounted for improved catalyst activity , comohomer incorporation and randomness of comonomer incorporation . In ethene / 1-butene copolymerization at high 1-butene feed content silylene-bridged substituted bisindenyl systems showed polymerization characteristics similar to that of ethene / 1-octene copolymerization . the influence of 2-methyl substitution on activity and comohomer incorporation was significant only at low 1-butene feed content . storage tooduli and glass transition temperature of the poly(ethene-co-l-butene) copolymers decreased with increasing 1-butene content . 
four newly synthesized bridged bisindenyl zirconocenes which are derivatives of known structures have been tested in polymerizations of liquid propylene with methylaluminoxane as cocatalyst . they include two asymmetric and two binuclear systems which are suitable for isotactic polymerization . surprising differences from the behavior of similar systems ( regiospecificity , chain termination ) are found and discussed . 
the polymerization of propylene was studied with a series of dinuclear early transition metal zirconocene - late transition metal complexes bridged by phosphido and arsenido moieties of general formula [(e5-C5H4R'')2Zr{m-ERR'}2M(CO)(n)] ( e = P , r = r ' = SiMe3 , r '' = H , m = Mo , n = <nUm> ( 1 ) ; e = P , r = r ' = SiMe3 , r '' = H , m = Ni , n = <nUm> ( 2 ) ; e = As , r = r ' = SiMe3 , r '' = H , m = Cr , n = <nUm> ( 3 ) ; e = P , r = H , r ' = 2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2 , r '' = me , m = Mo , n = <nUm> ( 4 ) ; e = P , r = H , r ' = 2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2 , r '' = me , m = Cr , n = <nUm> ( 5 ) ) , as well as with the corresponding monometallic zirconocene precursor complexes of the type [(e5-C5H4R'')2Zr(ERR')2] ( e = P , r = r ' = SiMe3 , r '' = H ( 6 ) ; e = P , r = H , r ' = 2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2 , r '' = H ( 7 ) ) and [(e5-C5H4Me)2Zr(ERR')Cl] ( e = P , r = H , r ' = 2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2 ( 8 ) ) . the active cationic species were generated treating the complexes with an excess of methylalumoxane ( MAO ) . the catalytic activity was found to be strongly dependent on temperature and catalyst / MAO ratio . 
supported catalysts for ethylene polymerization have been prepared by interaction of CP2ZrX2 ( cp = e5-C5H5 , x = Cl or CH3 ) with silica chemically modified by C3ClH9Si ( TMCS ) or trialkylaluminium compounds AlR3 ( r = C2H5 ( TEA ) and (i)C4H9 ( TIBA ) ) . the interactions between the modificators and the silica surface have been examined by 1H solid - state MAS NMR spectroscopy , DRIFTS and chemical analysis . the Cp2Zr(CH3)2 / O2Si - TMCS catalyst showed a fairly high activity in ethylene polymerization ( 30-300 kg PE(mol zr*h*bar)-1 ) even in the absence of any cocatalysts specially added . the addition of the cocatalyst ( MAO or TIBA ) led to a further increase in the activity of the supported catalysts . polyethylene obtained with the C3H6P2Zr / O2Si - TMCS catalyst without any cocatalyst consisted of uniform polymer particles of a spherical shape replicating that of the silica particles , whereas the shapeless aggregates of finely dispersed polymer particles similar to those usually obtained with homogeneous systems were produced with the same supported catalyst in the presence of the MAO cocatalyst . 
the ring - opening metathesis polymerization ( ROMP ) of norbornene ( NBE ) with <nUm> substituted titanocene dichlorides and MeLi as catalysts was studied . the substituent effect showed that the catalytic activity was generally decreased as the substituents were introduced into the cp ring . the more bulky the substituents , the lower the activity and the bis-substituted titanocene appeared to have an even lower catalytic activity . the molecular weight of polynorbornene ( PNBE ) also decreased as substituents are introduced on the cp ring . but the molecular weight distribution and cis structure content have no significant differences compared with non-substituted titanocene complex as catalyst . 
results of our work concerning : ( i ) the elucidation of the role of the ionic species [CP2Ti13CH3]+[Cl · MAO]- and of precursors of alkylidene Cp2Ti = CH2 species in addition alkene polymerization , ( ii ) the synthetical strategies for converting the living active titanacyclobutanes into s-titanocene complexes , and ( iii ) the evidence for the synthesis of polyethylene polynorbornene di-block copolymer are briefly summarized . 13C NMR spectra of ethylene-norbornene copolymers , prepared with addition catalysts based on ansa - zirconocenes and methylaluminoxane as cocatalyst , and assignments of comohomer pentads in ethylene-norbornene ( EN ) copolymers are reported . 
A series of heterogeneous catalyst systems was prepared by the immobilization of bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride , (nBuCP)2ZrCl2 , on silica supports activated at different temperatures . silica dehydroxylation was evaluated in terms of retained metal loading and activity in ethylene homopolymerization . characterization of the catalyst systems was accomplished by rutherford back - scattering spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy . the highest metal loading ( <nUm> wt. % Zr / O2Si ) was achieved with silica treated under vacuum at room temperature ( <nUm> K ) , but the catalyst showed only a minor polymerization activity which may be attributed to a large number of inactive Zr - support bidentate species formed at a high surface density of OH in silica . IR spectroscopic data show that , regardless of support activation temperature , a significant number of isolated OH groups remains after zirconocene fixation . the presence of bulky ligands in the catalyst molecule seems to prevent the remaining OH groups from reacting with additional metallocene complexes , keeping the metal loading around <nUm> wt. % Zr / O2Si for silica activated between <nUm> and <nUm> K . high polymerization activity observed for the system based on <nUm> K - activated silica suggests a role for these OH groups in the generation of active alkylated species when methylaluminoxane and trimethylaluminum ( contained in MAO itself ) are added at the beginning of the polymerization reaction . IR analysis shows that TMA , which is a less sterically demanding compound than MAO , can effectively access the remaining OH groups consuming them thoroughly . practically all the prepared systems presented activity in ethylene polymerization with MAO as cocatalyst , the highest activity ( <nUm> x <nUm> PEg mol-1 Zr h-1 ) having been obtained with silica dehydroxylated at <nUm> K . 
IR spectroscopy has been used to study the interaction of silica with two methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) samples differed by trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) content and with TMA . MAO and TMA have been shown to react with silica in a different way . whereas TMA interacts with terminal hydroxyl groups of silica via the prototysis reaction , MAO mainly adsorbs on the surface hydroxyl groups of silica without noticeable protolytical reaction with them . when silica is treated with commercial grade MAO with significant TMA content , the silica surface hydroxyl groups mainly interacts with TMA and MAO adsorbs on the surface of O2Si / TMA sample . lewis acidic sites ( LAS ) of silica , modified with TMA and MAO samples differed by TMA content , have been investigated by IR spectroscopy ( CO adsorption as probe molecule at <nUm> K ) . two types of LAS were found on the surface of silica modified with MAO and TMA : LAS of moderate strength ( v(CO) = 2204-2212 cm-1 ) and weak LAS ( v(CO) = <nUm> cm- <nUm> ) . the concentration of these acidic sites was estimated . by anchoring of Cp2ZrCl2 on silica , modified with TMA and MAO , the corresponding catalysts O2Si / TMA / Cp2ZrCl2 and O2Si / MAO / Cp2ZrCl2 were prepared and tested at ethylene polymerization . some correlations between the amount and strength of surface LAS of supports , catalysts composition and their activity are discussed . it is proposed that the surface active species are formed at zirconocene interaction with the most strong LAS . 
the ring - opening metathesis polymerization of dicyclopentadiene with dimethyltitanocene and in situ prepared substituted dimethyltitanocenes was studied . the results showed that at low concentration dimethyltitanocene catalyzed the polymerization of dicyclopentadiene to give linear polymer at 70-90 ° C and that the introduction of oxygen - containing substituents on cyclopentadienyl rings decreased catalytic activity due to a steric effect . 
the system EtInd2ZrCH+ / <nUm> is parallel with SiO(*) / <nUm> MAO- was studied theoretically by means of an extended huckel method ( EHMO ) for the propylene adsorption . the adsorption of the different forms of olefins was evaluated on the active site formed by metallocene and silica , in presence or not of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . In this way , it is possible to appreciate the important function of MAO when the active site is modeled considering all components . according to these results the presence of MAO avoids the adsorption of some forms of propylene . 
A new mechanism is proposed to explain the occurrence of primary- growing-chain-end epimerization , and the structure and frequency of olefinic end groups arising from primary b-hydride transfer , in low molecular weight isotactic polypropylenes produced with C2 - symmetric zirconocenes . this mechanism , based on the reversible formation of a zirconocene allyl dihydrogen complex , accounts for both loss of catalyst stereospecificity and decrease of polypropylene molecular weights observed by lowering [propylene] , and accommodates a number of previous and new experimental observations . inter alia : ( i ) the formation of internal vinylidene unsaturations ; ( ii ) the increase of catalyst activity induced by H addition ; ( iii ) the observed deuterium scrambling in the [1-D]propylene and [2-D]propylene polymerizations recently reported by brintzinger . this new mechanism is discussed in the light of the polymerization results from two MAO - activated catalysts : rac- C2H4(Ind)2ZrCl2 and the novel , highly regiospecific rac-Me2C(3-t-Bu- Ind)2ZrCl2 . 
heterogeneous ethylene polymerization catalysts were prepared by supporting tetrakis(dimethylamino)titanium , Ti[N(CH3)2]4 , on chemically modified silica surface . the modification of silica was made using a silane coupling agent , Cp(CH2)3Si(OCH2CH3)3 and atomic layer chemical vapor deposition ( ALCVD ) . titanium amide was also immobilized straight on the silica and on a methyllithium - treated modified silica . the aim of methyllithium treatment was to alkylate the unreacted ethoxy groups of the silane coupling agent on the silica . methyllithium methylates , besides ethoxy groups , also silica surface and surface cyclopentadienyl groups . A model compound for these heterogeneous catalysts was prepared using a reaction of Ti[N(CH3)2]4 with trimethylsilylcyclopentadienyl yielding a monocyclopentadienyl titanium compound , Me3SiCpTi[N(CH3)2]3 . the preliminary results of ethylene polymerization using the prepared heterogeneous and homogeneous titanocene amide complexes and the effect of amount of MAO are presented . 
ethylene polymerization was conducted with bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) and racdimethylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 2 ) combined with trialkylaluminum ( AlR3 ; r = methyl ( me ) , ethyl ( et ) , isobutyl ( iBu ) ) / triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( Ph3CB(C6F5)4 ) or tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane ( BC18F15 ) to study the effect of cocatalysts on polymerization rate ( r(p) ) . when AlMe3 was used , no activity or very low activity was observed with both zirconocenes regardless of the borane compounds used . the replacement of AlMe3 to AlEt3 or AliBu3 with 1-AlR3 / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 caused polymerization and induction time was observed to reach the maximum r(p) . especially in the case of using AlEt3 , it took about <nUm> min to show the activity . when BC18F15 was used , AlEt3 was not effective but AliBu3 gave the highest activity among all the combinations of AlR3 and the borane compounds . In the case of polymerization with <nUm> using Ph3CB(C6F5)4 , high activity was observed with both AlEt3 and AliBu3 without any induction period . when BC18F15 was used instead of Ph3CB(C6F5)4 , very low activity was observed with AlEt3 . on the other hand , high activity was observed with AliBu3 , and the maximum r(p) was found at the beginning of the polymerization . the effect of AlR3 on the formation of active species was discussed based on these results . 
A novel class of heterogeneous ethylene polymerization catalysts , derived from homogeneous metallacyclic zirconocene complexes is described . these complexes can be activated with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) and used for ethylene polymerization . the polymerization reaction begins homogeneously , but the homogeneous metallacycles self - immobilize during the polymerization process . subsequent olefin polymerization is therefore heterogeneously catalyzed . this method of heterogeneous olefin polymerization is compared with a homogeneous and an alternate heterogeneous polymerization technique .

the metallocene (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 was grafted on partially dehydroxilated commercial silica ( grace <nUm> ) whose surface had been chemically modified by wet impregnation of an organosilane ( Ph3SiCl , Me3SiCl , or Me2SiHCl ) aiming at supported catalyst systems with well spaced a-olefin polymerization active centers . final Zr loadings were determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) , and modifications at the silica surface after each preparation step were monitored by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy . these catalyst systems produced polyethylenes with narrow molecular weight distribution when methylaluminoxane was used as cocatalyst , with twice the activity of (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 supported on bare O2Si . effects of support structure and chemical modification on catalyst performance are presented and discussed .

ion pairing is known to play a key role in stoichiometric and catalytic reactions mediated by charged transition metal complexes , especially when they are conducted in low - polar solvents . molecular olefin polymerization catalysis by group IV metal complexes represents a textbook case in this respect , due to the high electrophilicity of the involved cationic active species and the very low relative permittivity ( ~ <nUm> ) of the commonly used hydrocarbon solvents . As a matter of fact , ion pairing has a huge impact on activity and selectivity of olefin polymerization catalysts . ion pairing is strictly related to the activation process , since the cationic active species is usually generated by the reaction of a neutral precursor with a suitable cocatalyst ( activator ) . the counterion generated from the latter reaction has to be weakly coordinating in order to disfavor its competition with the olefin for the occupancy of the coordination vacancy of the active metal center . herein , after having recalled some generalities of olefin polymerization and nature of activators , using ion pairing as a reading key , the main findings concerning with the structure and self - aggregation tendency of ion pairs relevant to olefin polymerization , as deduced by means of advanced NMR techniques , are described . representative examples of structure / activity relationships are then discussed , suggesting some rationale to interpret the different catalytic behavior of various ion pairs . finally , cases in which the activation process , besides providing the expected active ion pair , leads to further layers of complexity ( in situ ligand modification , dimer formation , etc. ) are illustrated . 
titanium is a strong , low - density element with a diverse variety of applications in fields such as the aerospace and automotive industries , biomedical implants , electronics , solar cells , polymerization catalysts , and photocatalysts . In many instances , the local environment of Ti has a substantial influence on the physical and electronic properties of these materials . solid - state NMR ( SSNMR ) is an increasingly popular non-destructive avenue for obtaining rich , detailed information regarding titanium and its surroundings . the two NMR - active isotopes of titanium , <nUm> and <nUm> , have very similar properties , which often leads to overlapping resonances and complicated SSNMR spectra . despite these challenges , many researchers have successfully utilized <nUm> / <nUm> SSNMR experiments to gain a unique molecular - level understanding of the local electronic , magnetic , and structural environment about titanium . Ti NMR parameters are strongly correlated to distinct structural features ( e.g. , O6Ti octahedral distortion ). this review takes the reader on a comprehensive tour of <nUm> / <nUm> SSNMR spectroscopy spanning ca. <nUm> publications , from the first report in <nUm> to the current state of the art in <nUm> . we begin with an introduction to the element of titanium , its properties , isotopes , and impressive range of applications . an introduction to the relevant NMR interactions and their parameters is then provided , followed by a discussion of various pulse sequences and strategies for <nUm> / <nUm> SSNMR signal enhancement , and a breakdown of the various compounds that have been used for <nUm> / <nUm> chemical shift referencing . the main literature review is grouped according to the nature of Ti materials : Ti metal , H2Ti / TiD2 and their stoichiometric derivatives , BaO3Ti and O3SrTi , the three polymorphs of O2Ti ( rutile , anatase , and brookite ) , ATiO3 - type compounds ( A = metal , e.g. , perovskite and ilmenite ) , intermetallic and binary Ti compounds , porous and layered materials , and practical applications of <nUm> / <nUm> SSNMR spectroscopy in recent times . considering the tremendous advances in the field within the last two decades , <nUm> / <nUm> SSNMR spectroscopy shows great promise for routine , detailed characterization of Ti alloys , compounds , and nanomaterials both today and in the future . 
laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry ( LDI-MS ) was performed on selected azaborolinyl zirconium complexes in order to study them as potential industrial polyolefin catalyst compounds . UV - vis absorption data in conjunction with negative and positive ionization analyses revealed the mechanistic workings of the compounds when such single - site catalysts function in olefin polymerization reactions . results presented highlight the many benefits of LDI-MS in the study of single - site zirconium azaborolinyl catalyst complexes including minimal sample preparation , the absence of matrix / pH / solvation effects , a lower degree of fragmentation as compared to EI ionization , high sensitivity and the ability to observe interesting and unique gas phase chemistry including ring slippage , and distinctive metal coordination and oxidation states . the extreme lability of the chlorine ligands was apparent , as well as the reactivity of the resulting zirconium metal center as demonstrated by the appearance of numerous similar four - coordinate zirconium species along with di-chloro-bridged dimers . LDI-MS permits analysis at low molecular weights , improving spectral characterization of these zirconium complexes . V . 
the effects of support calcination temperature , an important catalyst synthesis parameter , on the overall performance of the supported catalyst [ silica ES70 - nBuSnCl3 / MAO / (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 ] , polymerizing ethylene without separately feeding the MAO cocatalyst , were studied . the silica was calcined at <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> ° C for <nUm> h. nBuSnCl3 was used to functionalize the silica . ethylene was polymerized using the synthesized catalysts at <nUm> bar ( g ) in hexane for <nUm> h . No reactor fouling was observed . free - flowing polymer particles with bulk density ( <nUm> - <nUm> g / ml ) and a fairly spherical morphology similar to that of the catalyst particles were obtained . also , the particle size distribution of the polymer resembled that of the catalyst . therefore , the replication phenomenon from catalyst to polymer took place . the narrow PSD span ( 1.41 ) indicates that the resulting polyethylenes are suitable for various mixing - intensive polymer applications . the MAO cocatalyst - free ethylene polymerization instantaneously formed a polymer film around the catalyst particle , which coated / immobilized the catalyst constituents ; this is how leaching was in situ prevented which favored heterogeneous catalysis to occur . the catalysts showed fairly stable polymerization kinetics . the catalyst activity , as a function of the silica calcination temperature , varied as follows : <nUm> ° C > <nUm> ° C > <nUm> ° C > <nUm> ° C . this finding has been explained considering the relevant surface chemistry phenomena . the calcination temperature did not significantly affect the bulk density and the PDI ( <nUm> ≤ PDI ≤ <nUm> ) of the resulting polyethylenes . the low PDI substantiates the retention of single - site catalytic behavior of the experimental supported catalysts . V . 
the relationship between redox characteristics and catalytic activity in ethylene polymerization , with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as the cocatalyst , was evaluated for a series of homogeneous metallocenes ( Cp2ZrCl2 , (MeCp)2ZrCl2 , (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 , (iBuCp)2ZrCl2 , (tBuCp)2ZrCl2 , Cp2TiCl2 , Cp2HfCl2 , Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 , Et(IndH4)2ZrCl2 and MeSi2(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) . catalytic activity is discussed in terms of the coordination sphere and metal center of the metallocene and compared with their electrochemical behavior in the presence of ethylene and MAO . the resulting polyethylenes were analyzed by GPC . the catalytic activity in the ethylene polymerization reaction is discussed in terms of half - life ( t1 / <nUm> ) and electrochemical gap of the metallocene species . V . 
four dinuclear alkylidene-bridged zirconocene complexes were synthesized applying hydrozirconation reaction of a,o-dienes with the " schwartz ' reagent " and tested for the polymerization of ethylene . the polyethylenes obtained with alkylidene-bridged dinuclear complexes showed higher molecular weights mw and polydispersities revealing that more catalytically active species exist in the polymerization system . V . 
styrene polymerization was carried out by a simple half - titanocene complex [ cyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride ] ( CpTiCl3 ) and pentamethyl [ cyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride ] ( Cp*TiCl3 ) combined with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as a cocatalyst . the effects of addition of 2,6-diisopropylphenol on the catalytic activity of the above catalytic systems and the microstructure of the resulting polymer were investigated . the results of the above experiments showed that the addition of the 2,6-diisopropylphenol changed the catalytic performance of the above catalytic systems , in terms of catalytic activity of the metal complexes and microstructure , molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of polystyrene synthesized . the yields of polystyrene of the above polymerization reactions indicated that the 2,6-diisopropylphenol enhanced the catalytic activity of both the CpTiCl3 / MAO and Cp*TiCl3 / MAO catalyst systems . further soxhlet extraction of the polymer was conducted by boiling acetone for <nUm> h to get pure syndiotactic polystyrene . the microstructure of polystyrene obtained by the above polymerization reactions was investigated by 13C NMR , GPC and DSC . results indicated the formation of syndiotactic polystyrene in the absence of phenol and in low concentration of phenol . on the other hand , in the presence of excess phenol , the polystyrene produced was found to be completely atactic in nature . the appearance of monomodal peaks and narrow polydispersity in the GPC results of polystyrenes obtained in all the above polymerizations indicated that the polymerization was only coordination in nature . V . 
supported catalysts consisting of Cp2ZrCl2 and cation - exchanged fluorotetrasilicic mica ( mn+ - mica , mn+ = na+ , mg2+ , fe3+ , co2+ , ni2+ , cu2+ , zn2+ ) were prepared and employed in the ethylene polymerization or ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization in the presence of R3Al . the catalysts consisting of swellable mg2+ - mica and zn2+ - mica ( both calcined at <nUm> ° C ) and Cp2ZrCl2 displayed high activity for the polymerization reaction . by contrast , when mg2+ - mica and zn2+ - mica were calcined above <nUm> ° C , the swellability was lost , and the activities of Cp2ZrCl2 supported on these non-swellable micas were significantly reduced . the relationship between the activity and swellability of mica was clearly observed both in ethylene polymerizations employing (n-BuCp)2ZrCl2 in place of Cp2ZrCl2 and in ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerizations using Cp2ZrCl2 . the role of mn+ - mica for the activation of the metallocene complex was investigated by surface observation using a scanning electron microscope and by XRD measurements of the catalysts after polymerization of ethylene for a short time . the results of the surface observations indicated that polyethylene was produced on the edges of mn+ - mica lamellas at the initial stage of the polymerization . the XRD measurements show that the regularity of the stacked lamellas was immediately lost at this stage . the catalyst prepared by removing free Cp2ZrCl2 ( i.e. , unsupported Cp2ZrCl2 , Cp2ZrCl2 dissolved into the catalyst slurry ) showed extremely low activity , suggesting that the most of the active sites were formed through the reactions of mn+ - mica and free Cp2ZrCl2 . these results indicate that the lamellas of mn+ - mica are peeled off at the initial stage of the polymerization and that exposed metal cations react with free-Cp2ZrCl2 to form additional active species . the swellability of mn+ - mica strongly affects the formation of additional active sites , and therefore the supported catalysts based on non-swellable mn+ - mica displayed only low activities . V . 
silica gels modified by MgO , HLiO , and HNaO , i.e. , O2Si / MgO , O2Si / HLiO , O2Si / HNaO , respectively , were examined as solid supports in the ethylene and propylene polymerization reactions using dimethylsilylene-bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( SHIZ ) as the catalyst and i-Bu3Al as the co-catalyst . all three were found to be equally effective for the former reaction , whereas activity was discrete for the latter reaction , with the order being O2Si / MgO > O2Si / HLiO > O2Si / HNaO . for the O2Si / MgO combination which showed the highest performance , BET and STEM studies indicated that Mg was evenly distributed in the silica gel . acid - base measurements of all three solids indicated that O2Si / MgO had strongly acidic sites whereas the other two did not , and in addition , O2Si / HNaO had strongly basic sites whereas the remaining two had only weakly basic spots . these results suggested that the presence of weakly nucleophilic anionic sites is essential for high reactivity and that strongly acidic sites enhance the reactivity . V . 
the immobilization of Cp2ZrCl2 was performed by entrapment within the binary oxide O2Si - O3W using a non-hydrolytic sol - gel route . the catalyst and oxide matrix were characterized by complementary techniques ( rutherford backscattering spectrometry , ultraviolet - visible diffuse reflectance and infrared transmission spectroscopy , differential pulse voltammetry , adsorption - desorption of N , and x-ray diffraction ) . the catalyst performance in terms of catalytic activity and polymer properties was evaluated by ethylene polymerization . catalyst characterization suggested that the entrapped complex exhibited lower Zr electronic density than the corresponding unsupported metallocene . the polymerization results also revealed that this low Zr electronic density is optimized in terms of complex activation with low MAO concentration ( low [ Al / Zr ] ratio ) and reactivity . this fine tuning results in a catalyst system that is active with a low [ Al / Zr ] ratio and that achieves high catalytic activity . the results demonstrate that the entrapping method allows the generation of a catalyst system in which part of the activation process is attributed to the support . In this sense , the support may partially play MAO functions by stabilizing the active catalytic species . V . 
catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene , which contain rac-Me 2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( BCl2ISZr ) bound to methylalumoxane - pretreated O2Si supports ( O2Si / MAO / BCl2ISZr ) , were studied with respect to leaching of zirconocene and MAO into heptane solutions caused by triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) . the latter is found to solubilize surface - bound MAO and zirconocene components , such that the Al content in the solid catalysts is reduced by 15-40 wt % and their Zr content by 50-60 wt % . consequently , ethylene polymerization with such TIBA - containing catalyst systems occurs both on the surface of the solid catalyst and in the solution phase . polymerization in solution is favored by high MAO contents in the O2Si carrier . polymerization in solution leads to polyethylene ( PE ) products with lower molecular masses than polymerization on the support surface ; this is the main cause of formation of PE with bimodal molecular mass distribution when ethylene is polymerized with O2Si / MAO / BClISZr <nUm> catalysts co-activated by TIBA . it is proposed that the co-activator TIBA interacts with surface - bound MAO to modify MAO in such a manner that it becomes soluble in aliphatic hydrocarbons and capable of solubilizing some active zirconocene component . V . 
silyliminophenolate precursors ( 1-4 ) were prepared by reactions between 3-aminopropyldiethoxymethysilane ( 3-APS ) and salicylaldehyde , 3-methoxysalicylaldehyde , 4-hydroxysalicylaldehyde , and 5-bromosalicylaldehyde in <nUm> : <nUm> mole ratio in ethanol at room temperature , respectively . then these precursors were used in the preparation of the following compounds . the Zr - compounds (SPIMP)2Zr2(OnPr)2O , (MeO-SPIMP)2Zr2(OnPr)2O , (HO-SPIMP)2Zr2(OnPr)2O , and (Br-SPIMP)2Zr2(OnPr)2O were prepared by reaction of zirconium ( IV ) propoxide with silyliminophenolate ( SPIMPH ) , silyliminomethoxyphenolate ( MeO - SPIMPH ) , silyliminohydroxyphenolate ( HO - SPIMPH ) , and silyliminobromophenolate ( Br - SPIMPH ) in n-propanol , respectively . all these compounds ( 1-8 ) were characterized by 1H , 13C NMR , FTIR , mass spectroscopies , elemental , and thermogravimetric analyses . In order to see their ( 5-8 ) catalytic activity over lactides and epoxides these compounds were tested in polymerization of l-lactide ( LLA ) and 3- glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane ( GPTS ) and were effective . Poly-LLA , poly-GPTS , and copolymer of LLA / GPTS were characterized by 1H , 13C NMR , DSC , TGA , MS and gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) . 
the supported ionic liquid ( SIL ) strategy was used for the first time to metallocene and post-metallocene heterogeneous catalysts for olefin polymerization . the metal complexes : Cp2TiCl2 , cp 2ZrCl2 , FI-Ti , and Sal-Ti were immobilized in the 1-(3-triethoxysilyl)propyl-3-methylimidazolium alkylchloroaluminate ionic liquid , anchored on the surface of the mesoporous amorphous silica . the SIL systems were characterized by FTIR , 29Si NMR , N adsorption , EA , AAS , TG , and SEM techniques . the developed supported catalytic systems were found to be active in the ethylene polymerization and produce the polyethylene of various properties . V . 
V.Quaternary ammonium chlorides bound to multi-walled carbon nanotubes as a catalyst for coupling of CO2 and epoxides to produce cyclic carbonates were explored . reaction variables such as the epoxide structure , the length of alkyl substituents in the quaternary ammonium salts and the spacer chain on the catalytic performance were discussed . the yield of the cyclic carbonates varied between <nUm> and <nUm> % after <nUm> h at <nUm> ° C under low pressure ( <nUm> MPa of CO2 ) . the epoxide : catalyst mass ratio was 20-30 , while <nUm> mmol g-1 of the quaternary salt was grafted on the carbon nanotubes . A synergy between carboxyl moiety and ammonium moiety grafted on carbon nanotubes was found , and a strong impact of the length of the spacer group used for grafting of the quaternary ammonium salt on nanotubes was observed . the best performance was achieved with short ( <nUm> carbon atoms ) and long ( <nUm> atoms ) spacer groups , while a middle - sized spacer group ( <nUm> atoms ) was not suitable . the length of the alkyl chain of the substituents of the ammonium salt ( head group ) had a low impact where ethyl and methyl groups performed better than butyl . the reactivity of epoxides was as follows : epichlorohydrin > propylene oxide > styrene oxide . observations were rationalized by a mechanism where bronsted 's sites on the surface of nanotubes play an important role during carboxylation of epoxides . the catalyst can easily be separated by filtration recycled without a significant decrease in the catalytic activity if dried properly between the runs . 
V.The use of transition metal complexes of non – heterocyclic N – donor ligands as olefin oligo / polymerization precatalysts is reviewed . these metal complexes with definite steric and electronic variations offer high catalytic activity resulting in the desired microstructure of the polymer products currently attracting significant attention by the catalysis community . this review primarily discusses the fundamental principles in the design of mononuclear , homodinuclear , heterodinuclear , homomultinuclear and heteromultinuclear transition metal complexes having non – heterocyclic N – donor ligands and their reactivity towards olefins in oligo / polymerization reactions . numerous non – heterocyclic N – donor ligands of the donor types N , NO , NP , NC , N2P , N2O , CN2 , N2S , N3 , NCP , NCp , NOCp , N3Cp , N2O2for mononuclear , N4 , NO , NO , CN3 , NCp2 , N2Cp2 , N2Indene2and N2S2Indene ( cp : cyclopentadiene ) for bimetallic and N8 , N2O , N8O8and N12O4for multinuclear complex formations have been efficiently employed , and the resulting complexes display promising reactivity patterns with a variety of olefins . the majority of these catalytic systems are tethered with appropriate alkyl / aryl / alkyl – aryl substituents to afford the required steric hindrance to the metal center ( s ) , and with functional groups for electronic variations . such systems produce a linear polymer product in most of the cases , any deviation from this behavior resulting in the formation of oligomers . the major focus of this review is on reports published over the last <nUm> years in the research and development of non – heterocyclic , N – donor coordinated transition metal complexes with a variety of spacers . this review article is organized into main sections on the basis of the nuclearity of the transition metal complex ; each subsection deals with complexes starting from late transition metals on the basis of ligand type . 
V . different hybrid silica - encapsulated metallocene catalysts were prepared by a non-hydrolytic sol - gel method and evaluated in ethylene polymerization . the employed organic groups to modify the silica network were methyl , octyl , octadecyl , vinyl , phenyl , chloropropyl , iodopropyl and glycidoxypropil and the encapsulated catalyst was bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconiun IV chloride . the catalysts were characterized in terms of zirconium content , structure and texture via fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , x-ray absorption spectroscopy , nitrogen porosimetry and small angle x-ray scattering and morphology by transmission electronic microscopy . the polymerzation activity results varied in the range of 1650-2850 kg PE / mol zr.p.h , showing an increase for all the hybrid materials if compared to the non-hybrid one . polymers characteristics such as crystallinity , melting temperature and molecular weight were shown to be affected by the nature of the organic moieties present on the catalyst support . these findings highlight the material potentiality for tuning the product characteristics depending on the organosilane present on the catalyst system . 
V.A series of SiMe2 - bridged ansa - zirconocenes LZrCl2 derived from heterocyclic ligands such as cyclopenta[1,2-b:4,3-b']dithiophene , 5,6-dihydroindeno[2,1-b]indole and 5,10-dihydroindeno[1,2-b]indole , called “ heterocenes ” were synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and by x-ray diffraction analysis . these complexes were activated by triisobutylaluminium ( TIBA ) at AlTIBA / Zr ratio ∼ <nUm> and then by MMAO-12 at AlMAO / Zr ratio ∼ <nUm> , and were studied in the polymerization of 1-octene in the absence or presence of molecular hydrogen . In the absence of molecular hydrogen , derivatives of cyclopenta[1,2-b:4,3-b']dithiophene and dihydroindeno[2,1-b]indole demonstrated high catalytic activity , while dihydroindeno[1,2-b]indole complexes catalyzed slow polymerization with the formation of ultrahigh molecular weight poly(1-octene)s . In the presence of molecular hydrogen , derivatives of dihydroindeno[1,2-b]indole showed an order of magnitude increase in the catalytic activity . b-Hydride elimination , b-hexyl elimination and Zr-Al transfer were detected as the main chain release mechanisms depending on the nature of the ligand used . A novel chain termination with selective formation of – C(Me) = C2H3 – unsaturations was detected . it was found that heterocenes maintained a high catalytic activity up to <nUm> ° C . due to their high thermal stability and good hydrogen response , heterocenes are promising catalysts for the oligomerization and hydrooligomerization of a-olefins in the production of high - quality motor oil base stocks . 
A Pd catalyst bearing acetylacetone ligand [ ( CH <nUm> CO ) <nUm> CClHPd <nUm> ] was covalently attracted onto the surface of glass slides , and then these Pd - terminated glass slides were immersed into a toluene solution of norbornene ( NB ) to produce a vinyl-type addition polynorbornene ( PNB ) layer on the surface of glass slides . it was found that the contract angles of the PNB - terminated glass slides surface increased with the increasing of polymerization time , and the thickness of the PNB layers were approximately 0-44.0 mm when the polymerization time was 0.5-24 h . the researching on etching also has been operated . V . 
V . zirconocene catalyst supported on silica gel was prepared for olefin polymerization by surface modification of calcined silica with ClSi <nUm> , and the reaction between the modified silica and cyclopentadienyl sodium and ClZr <nUm> . the catalyst was characterized by using fourier - transform infrared ( FT-IR ) spectrometer , thermogravimetric ( TG ) , and differential scanning calorimetric ( DSC ) analytic spectrometer . it was found that the metallocene structure could be formed and connected on silica surface by chemical bond . initial catalytic tests showed that the supported metallocene was catalytically active ( methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst ) , producing polymer with higher molecular weight than the metallocene just immobilized on the surface of silica gel . 
V . pristine Bi <nUm> WO <nUm> hollow microspheres have been fabricated in ethylene glycol - water system with CTAB as crystal growth director for the first time , hybrid au- Bi <nUm> WO <nUm> hollow microspheres was also obtained by in situ decoration of Au nanoparticles , the formation mechanisms were explored . their photocatalytic activities on photo - reduction of Cr (VI) and photo - degradation of phenol in aqueous solution were investigated under visible light irradiation . hybrid au- Bi <nUm> WO <nUm> hollow microspheres displayed the highest photocatalytic activity , exhibiting a nearly complete reduction of Cr (VI) to Cr (III) within only <nUm> min . the excellent photocatalytic activities of heterogeneous Au-Bi <nUm> WO <nUm> hollow microspheres can be induced by the increased light harvesting efficiency ( due to light multi-scattering effect of hollow architecture ) , high separation of photogenerated electron - hole pairs caused by electron trapping effect and surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) effect of Au nanoparticles . 
V.A molecularly imprinted polymer ( MIP ) was designed and synthesized to serve as a functional material for selective recognition of 6-thioguanine ( 6TG ) , an antitumor drug . for that , the newly synthesized functional monomer , cytosine-bis(2,2'-bithienyl)-(4-carboxyphenyl)methane ester ( Cyt-S4 ) , revealed watson - crick type nucleobase pairing of 6TG . formation of the Cyt-S4 and 6TG complex of the <nUm> : <nUm> stoichiometry was postulated based on the DFT calculations at the B3LYP / 3-21G(*) level and experimentally confirmed by fluorescence titration . the molecularly imprinted polymer ( MIP ) film was deposited by potentiodynamic electropolymerization on a Pt disk electrode as well as on an Au - coated glass slide and on an Au - quartz crystal resonator . the statistical model of formation of this film was successfully simulated by molecular dynamics . completeness of the subsequent 6TG template extraction from MIP was confirmed by the UV - visible spectroscopy . an imprinting factor of <nUm> for the MIP film was determined by piezoelectric microgravimetry using ECQM . the double - layer capacity and alternating current measurements under flow - injection analysis ( FIA ) conditions were selected to transduce the 6TG recognition signal into the change of the double - layer capacity dependence on the 6TG concentration in solution for different supporting electrolyte concentrations . detectability of the resulting chemosensor was <nUm> mM 6TG for the <nUm> m KF carrier solution in FIA . selectivity of the chemosensor with respect to common interferences was high , e.g. , it exceeded <nUm> to 2-amino-6-methylmercaptopurine , a 6TG metabolite . 
A homogeneous dispersion of multi-walled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs ) in syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) is obtained by a simple solution dispersion procedure . MWCNTs were dispersed in n-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone ( NMP ) , and sPS / MWCNT composites are prepared by mixing sPS / NMP solution with MWCNT / NMP dispersion . the composite structure is characterized by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy . the effect of MWCNTs on sPS crystallization and the composite properties are studied . the presence of MWCNTs increases the sPS crystallization temperature , broadens the crystallite size distribution and favors the formation of the thermodynamically stable β phase , whereas it has little effect on the sPS γ to α phase transition during heating . by adding only <nUm> wt. % pristine MWCNTs , the increase in the onset degradation temperature of the composite can reach <nUm> ° C . the electrical conductivity is increased from 10-10 ∼ <nUm> ( neat sPS ) to <nUm> S m-1 ( sPS / MWCNT composite with <nUm> wt. % MWCNT content ) . our findings provide a simple and effective method for carbon nanotube dispersion in polymer matrix with dramatically increased electrical conductivity and thermal stability . 
ethylene polymerization was performed using bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride ( (n-BuCp)2ZrCl2 ) supported on alumina- and titania - based acidic oxides ( Al2O3 , O2Ti , AlO4P , TiO2-Al2O3 , SiO2-Al2O3 , O2Ti - O2Si and H-Y zeolite ) in the presence of triisobutylaluminum . these oxides were also tested in an isopropylbenzene cracking reaction to determine their acid properties . among the catalysts , AlO4P - supported (n-BuCp)2ZrCl2 showed the highest polyethylene productivity , but AlO4P was inactive in the cracking reaction . FT-IR spectra of pyridine-adsorbed AlO4P and Al2O3 indicated that the acid sites do not participate in active - site formation . it is possible that the metallocene is activated on sites formed by the reaction of characteristic OH groups of AlO4P with triisobutylaluminum . V . 
the asymmetric 3-oxa-pentamethylene bridged dinuclear titanocenium complex (CpTiCl2)2 ( e5-C9H6(CH2CH2 OCH2CH2)-e5-C5H3 CH3 ) ( 1 ) has been prepared , characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis , and after activation with MAO tested as a homogenous catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene . the results show that the catalytic activity of <nUm> as well as the molecular weight of the produced polyethylene are higher than those using the alkylidene bridged asymmetric dinuclear metallocenes (CpTiCl2)2 ( e5-C9H6(CH2) n-e5-C5H4 ) , n = <nUm> ( 4 ) , <nUm> ( 5 ) . the molecular weight distribution of polyethylene produced with <nUm> / MAO reaches <nUm> and the HT - GPC curve shows a bimodal distribution . the melting point of the polyethylene obtained by <nUm> / MAO is higher than <nUm> ° C and the 13C NMR spectrum of PE shows only one strong signal at <nUm> ppm for the methylene units indicating a highly linear and crystalline polymer . V . 
calcosilicate ( CAS-1 ) was used for the first time as an effective carrier for simultaneous immobilization of a dual - functional catalytic system consisted of iron - based bis(imino) pyridyl complex ( O ) and zirconocene compound ( C ) to form heterogeneous catalyst precursor ( CAS - <nUm> / O / C ) . the a-olefins formed form O - catalyzed ethylene oligomerization copolymerized in situ with ethylene to linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) under the catalysis of C in CAS - <nUm> / O / C upon addition of cocatalysts as described hereafter . instead of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , triethylaluminum ( TEA ) was employed to activate the copolymerization reaction with high catalytic activities and smooth kinetic process . experimental results reflected that the selectivity for lower a-olefins was improved due to the confinement effect of the layered structures of CAS-1 , hence greatly increasing the incorporation rate of a-olefins into LLDPE main chains and the branching degree accordingly during the in situ copolymerization of a-olefins and ethylene . the layered structure of CAS-1 endowed the resultant LLDPE with improved thermal stability in addition to higher molecular weights ( Mn ) . V . 
the LLDPE / Al2O3 nanocomposites synthesized by the in situ polymerization with dried - modified methylaluminoxane ( d-MMAO ) / zirconocene catalyst were investigated . first , after vacuum heated the Al2O3 nanofiller , the d-MMAO as the cocatalyst was impregnated onto it . then , ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization was carried out with the presence of different amounts of d-MMAO / Al2O3 in a <nUm> mL semi-batch stainless steel autoclave reactor . after filtration , the obtained LLDPE nanocomposite was characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) / energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy ( EDX ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) . it was found that the polymerization activity strongly depended on the [Al]dMMAO / [Zr]cat ratios . the addition of Al2O3 nanofiller apparently resulted in increased melting temperature and molecular weight of LLDPE without any change in molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) . V . 
the bimodal MCM-41 - supported zirconocene / dMMAO catalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity for ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization compared to the unimodal one . the higher activity can be attributed to lesser support interaction . the copolymer having broader MWD was obtained with the bimodal support without any significant changes in MW and polymer microstructure as seen by 13C NMR . V . 
here , the copolymerization of ethylene / 1-octene with zirconocene / dMMAO catalyst using different pore sized silica - based supports was investigated . it revealed that the large pored silica [ O2Si ( LP ) ] exhibited the highest polymerization activity due to both highest amount of available active sites present along with the moderate interaction between dMMAO and the support . the strong interaction between dMMAO and the support as proven by TGA analysis apparently resulted in dramatically decreased polymerization activity for the bimodal pored silica - alumina [ Si-Al ( BP ) ] . the copolymers produced were further characterized by means of DSC and 13C NMR . although they exhibited the similar triad distribution , the degree of 1-octene insertion was different . V . 
carbonaceous materials with different degree of coalification , surface area , nitrogen content as well as electronic nature in their structure have been modified with prescribed amount of MAO and characterized by XPS analysis . syndiospecific styrene polymerizations using half - titanocenes containing aryloxide ligands , Cp'TiCl2(OAr) [ cp' = tBuC5H4 , Ar = 2,6-iPr 2C6H3 ( 1 ) , 2,6-iPr 2-4-tBuC6H2 ( 2 ) ; cp' = cp* , Ar = 2,6-iPr2-4-tBuC 6H2 ( 3 ) ] , have been explored in the presence of various MAO - supported organic materials . these catalyst systems were effective to afford syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) exclusively , and the activity by <nUm> increased at higher temperature ( 25-55 ° C ) . the Mn values in the resultant sPS prepared by <nUm> in the presence of the present supported cocatalysts were not strongly affected by the temperature , whereas the Mn values were highly dependent upon the temperature in the presence of MAO cocatalyst . both , the activity and the Mn values were slightly affected by the nature as well as the chemical character of surface functional groups of the carbonaceous materials employed . the ethylene / styrene copolymerization by Cp*TiCl2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H <nUm> ) afforded the copolymer exclusively with similar degree employed by the homogeneous system . V . 
the novel half - metallocene zirconium ( IV ) bearing quinoline-amino-phenolate tridentate ligand ( zr1 ) was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis , NMR spectroscopy , and x-ray crystallography . the complex zr1 , upon activation with MAO , proved active in the polymerization of ethylene ( 26-2015 kg of PE / mol[Zr]*h- <nUm> ) , yielding high - density polyethylenes with molecular weight varying from <nUm> to <nUm> × <nUm> g*mol- <nUm> . complex zr1 was also tested in the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene affording high molecular weight poly(ethylene-co-1- hexene ) with low comonomer incorporation ( <nUm> - <nUm> % ) .

A series of 1-aryliminoethylpyridine ligands ( L1 - L3 ) was synthesized by condensation of 2-acetylpyridine with 1-aminonaphthalene , 2-aminoanthracene or 1-aminopyrene , respectively . reaction with nickel dichloride afforded the corresponding nickel ( II ) chloride complexes ( ni1 - ni3 ) . all compounds were fully characterized and the molecular structures of ni1 and ni3 are reported . upon activation with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , all nickel complexes exhibit high activities for ethylene polymerization , producing waxes of low molecular weight and narrow polydispersity . the presence of multi-walled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs ) or few layer graphene ( FLG ) in the catalytic medium can lead to an increase of productivity associated to a modification of the polymer structure . V . 
A novel heterogeneous catalyst was prepared by immobilizing salenCrIIICl on a modified poly ( aniline-co-oaminophenol ) ( MPOAP ) . the FT-IR , TEM , XRD , XPS and ICP results indicated that salenCrIIICl was successfully supported on MPOAP . the resulted catalyst ( MPOAP - salenCrIIICl ) exhibited excellent catalytic performance for alternating copolymerization of cyclohexene oxide ( CHO ) with carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) . moreover , the supported catalyst had an obvious effect on the microstructures of the copolymerization and the obtained polymer was found to be a linear alternating copolymerwith narrower molecular weight distribution . the TG and DTG results indicated that the product prepared by the supported catalyst possessed higher decomposition temperature .

titanium - containing mesoporous molecular sieves including periodic mesoporous silicas ( SBA-15 - type ) and organosilicas ( PMO - type ) can be assembled by using mixed inorganic acid - base pairs ( Cl4Ti and tetrabutyl titanate ) or a single inorganic Cl3Ti as the titanium sources and tetraethoxysilane and / or 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane as the silica sources and triblock copolymer as the structure - directing agent in acidic media through the hydrothermal method . characterization using XRD , nitrogen sorption isotherms , UV - vis , FT-IR and NMR techniques reveals that the Ti - containing mesoporous materials possess ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructures , high surface areas ( 421-1070 m2 / g ) , uniform pore sizes ( <nUm> - <nUm> nm ) , large pore volumes ( <nUm> - <nUm> cm3 / g ) , and tetrahedrally incorporated titanium ( IV ) species in the silica network . the maximum incorporated Ti content is about <nUm> wt % for the ordered mesostructure regardless of the titania and silica sources and the initial Si / Ti ratio . V . 
this work exploits the electroless precipitation approach for the incorporation of palladium in polypyrrole ( PPy ) . electrochemical and morphological analysis of PPy films prepared on Pt , under potentiostatic and potentiodynamic control , reveal the influence of the electrosynthesis conditions on the bulk and surface properties of the polymer . it is shown that , besides the pH of the Cl2Pd containing solutions , those PPy characteristics play an important role on the rate of the Pd uptake process . the resulting pd(0) / pdox ratio , size and surface distribution of the metallic particles on the film surface are analysed in detail and correlated to the electrocatalytic activity disclosed by the modified PPy electrodes towards the oxidation of hydrazine in ClK solution . In comparison to palladium thin coatings , a superior behaviour is achieved for PPy rough surfaces able to create uniform dispersions of sub-micron Pd particles , but the employment of polymer films with less coarse surfaces and / or an increasing in the amount and size of the Pd particles is disadvantageous for catalytic purposes .

the efficient catalytic dehydropolymerization of phenylsilane by homogeneous zirconocene bissilanolates ( [ { ( c-C 5H <nUm> ) 7Si 8O 12O } 2Zr(e 5- C 5H <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 1a ) ; [ { ( c-C 5H <nUm> ) 7Si 8O 12O } 2Zr(e 5-C 5H 4Bu ) <nUm> ] ( 1b ) [ { ( c-C 5H <nUm> ) 7Si 7O <nUm> ( OSiMe 3)O 2}Zr(e 5-C 5H <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 4 ) ; [ { ( me 3CO ) 3SiO } 2Zr(e 5-C 5H <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 5 ) ) and chlorosilanolates ( [ { ( c-C 5H <nUm> ) 7Si 8O 12O}ZrCl(e 5-C 5H 4Bu ) <nUm> ] ( 2 ) ; ( [ { ( c-C 5H <nUm> ) 7Si 7O 9O 3}Zr 2Cl(e 5-C 5H <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 3a ) ; [ { ( c-C 5H <nUm> ) 7Si 7O 9O 3}Zr 2Cl(e 5-C 5H 4Bu ) <nUm> ] ( 3b ) ) has been demonstrated . the presence of at least one silanol ligand in the zirconocene moiety was found essential for high catalytic performance . solid state structure of complex 1a was determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . A series of nine zirconocene - siliceous catalysts were prepared by grafting of zirconocene moiety onto silica using three general methods : ( a ) reaction of [ ( η 5-C 5H <nUm> ) 2ZrCl <nUm> ] with silica in the presence of NEt <nUm> ; ( b ) reaction of [ ( η 5-C 5H <nUm> ) 2ZrMe <nUm> ] with silica ; ( c ) reaction of solely [ ( η 5-C 5H <nUm> ) 2ZrCl <nUm> ] with silica . supported catalysts were characterized by ICP-MS , FT-IR , TGA and selected examples by XPS analysis . those catalysts prepared by method ( a ) and ( b ) were found efficient in the phenylsilane polymerization although a higher Zr / monomer ratio had to be used in comparison with homogeneous analogues . the low concentration of residual silanol groups in supported catalysts was found essential for their high catalytic performance . advantageous reusability of supported catalysts was demonstrated using OSi <nUm> / cp 2ZrCl <nUm> / NEt 3(5.8) . the catalytic performance was retained in three consecutive cycles producing polymers with almost identical properties .

we report the synthesis of a multilayer graphene ( MLG ) / polyethylene composite nanosheet via in situ ethylene polymerization with an ( n-BuCp ) 2ZrCl2-adsorbed MLG system . the shape of the MLG / PE composite nanosheet resembles the petal of a chrysanthemum . according to TEM , SEM images and XRD results , the layers of the graphene sheets are exfoliated and peeled from the MLG flake because the PE mass increases on the surface of the graphene sheet during the PE polymerization . the exfoliated graphene / PE nanosheets are sliced into many parts and become petaloid in shape . graphene plays a role not only as a support for adsorption but also as an additional ligand to (n-BuCp)2ZrCl2 during ethylene polymerization . In the p-p stacking between graphene and (n-BuCp)2ZrCl <nUm> , the rich electron environment and bulky surface of graphene increase the electron density of (n-BuCp)2ZrCl2 and inhibit the b-hydrogen elimination , resulting in a higher MW and PDI of PE than those of homogenous (n-BuCp)2ZrCl2 . V . 
A series of nickel complexes ni1 - ni4 containing n-(5,6,7-trihydroquinolin- 8-ylidene)aminoaryl ligands was prepared in good yields . the amino group present allowed covalent anchoring of these complexes through an amido link onto the surface of two kinds of multi-walled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs ) . XPS analysis evidenced that the molecular structure of these Ni (II) complexes was maintained after grafting . activated by MAO , these catalytic systems promoted ethylene polymerization . our studies evidenced the beneficial influence of the MWCNTs since in most cases , heterogeneized systems are more active than the corresponding unsupported catalysts , producing higher molecular weight polymers in which MWCNTs are homogeneously dispersed .

polybutene-1 was synthesized stereoselectively with the precursor e5-(pentamethyl-cyclopentadienyl) tribenzyloxide titanium ( Cp*Ti(OBz)3 ) and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the effects of polymerization conditions , trimethyl alumina ( TMA ) content in MAO and temperature on the crystalline and molecular weight of the products , and catalytic activity were investigated . the structural properties of the polybutene-1 were characterized with 13C NMR and WAXD . 
metallacyclic metallocene complexes of titanium , zirconium and hafnium can be prepared by hydrogen elimination processes of suitable substituents such as o-phenylalkyl or o-alkenyl at the aromatic ligands . In some cases , the intermediates containing agostic hydride ligands can be isolated and characterized . the synthesized metallacyclic metallocene complexes can be activated with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) and are then able to polymerize 1-olefins catalytically . the advantages of such catalysts are their high thermal stability and their potential of self - immobilization combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis and their high activities . In some cases these catalysts show activities that are three to four times higher than the activities of the parent dichloride complexes . the fact that these catalysts do not contain any halides and that they remain in the produced polymer makes them very friendly to the environment when they are thermally decomposed .

this review summarizes the use of metallocene complexes and related compounds as catalysts in the dimerization or oligomerization of olefins ( alkenes ) or terminal acetylenes ( alkynes ) and in the dehydrocoupling / dehydrooligomerization of silanes . metallocene complexes of group - III metals ( scandocenes , yttrocenes , lanthanocenes ) , lanthanoids ( neodymocenes ) and group-IV metals ( titanocenes , zirconocenes , hafnocenes ) have been utilized in the selective ( co- / hydro-)oligomerization of ethene , of the a-olefins propene , 1-butene , 1-pentene , 1-hexene , 1-heptene , and 1-octene , of branched olefins , e.g. methyl-butenes , methyl-pentenes and styrene , of cycloolefins , e.g. cyclopentene and norbornene and of α , o-dienes , e.g. 1,5-hexadiene and 1,7-octadiene . group - III metallocenes are often active in the C-C coupling without a cocatalyst ; group-IV metallocenes require the help of a cocatalyst , such as methylalumoxane , MAO , aluminum alkyls , e.g. AliBu <nUm> , or perfluorated boranes , e.g. BC6F5 <nUm> . the actinoid metallocenes ( C5M5 ) 2AnMe2 with an = thorium , uranium allow for the dimerization and oligomerization of terminal acetylenes . the dehydrooligomerization of (hydro)silanes is typically achieved by group-IV metallocene chlorides together with n-butyl lithium . also included in this review are related sandwich and half - sandwich ( mono-cyclopentadienyl ) complexes used for olefin oligomerization . the related sandwich complexes feature phospholyl , boratabenzene or carboranate ligands . methods of oligo - olefin analyses by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) , 1H NMR spectroscopy , gas chromatography ( GC ) or viscosity measurements for molecular weight determinations and by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy or MALDI - TOF mass spectrometry for end group structure determinations are summarized . possible applications of olefin oligomers , in particular oligopropenes are presented . the functionality of a double bond at the end of each chain ( for further modifications ) together with the product homogeneity are the advantages of oligomers from metallocene catalysis . In addition , olefin oligomerization is used to study mechanistic aspects and to obtain a better insight into the reaction mechanism of metallocene polymerization catalysis because of the homogeneity of the reaction mixture and because certain mechanistic aspects are easier to investigate in oligomeric products than in high-molar-mass polymers .

ligand modifications have played a crucial role in developing new catalyst precursors for optimizing polymerization activity as well as polymer properties . o-Carborane is a highly versatile molecule and can be converted into the closo-C2B10H102- , nido-C 2B9H112- , nido-C2B 10H122- , and arachno-C2B 10H124- ligands which are capable of being bonded to metal ions in s- , e5- , e6- , and e7-fashion , respectively . such unique features make the replacement possible of either a cyclopentadienyl or an amido unit in the traditional CpSiN constrained - geometry ligands , by a carboranyl moiety . these modifications lead to a novel class of constrained - geometry ligands bearing a carboanion functionality and to a new version of constrained - geometry ligand frameworks incorporating a dicarbollyl moiety . these ligands provide interesting opportunities for the design of metallocenes with new metal / charge and π / σ component combinations and for the study of the role of carborane in catalysis . achievements , problems and perspectives in this new and rapidly growing field are discussed in this article .

pentalene bridged zirconocene / methylaluminoxane catalysts are described as useful for the polymerization of ethene , propene , and co-polymerizations with norbornene . they show a high thermostability up to polymerization temperatures of <nUm> ° C . polyethylenes with molecular masses of <nUm> million g / mol are obtained at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> g / mol at more than <nUm> ° C . the molecular mass distribution varies between <nUm> and <nUm> because of the steric isomers of the pentalene ligand . some of the complexes are active for the polymerization of propene . similar to ansa cyclopentadienyl-fluorenyl complexes , the tacticity of the produced polypropylenes can be changed from syndiotactic to isotactic by substitution of the cyclopentadienyl ring .

the synthesis and reactivity of group <nUm> ketimide complexes , comprising bent - metallocene , half - sandwich and cyclopentadienyl-free compounds is described . neutral compounds of general formulas Cp'2M(NCR 1R2)X and Cp'2M(NCR1R 2)2 have been prepared by transmetallation reactions of metal halide derivatives with appropriate lithium , tin or silicon ketimide derivatives and by acid - base reactions between ketimines and anionic ligands attached to the metals . Ti (III) and cationic M(IV) bent - metallocene complexes have been mainly prepared by nitrile insertion into metal-carbon or metal - hydride bonds of bis-Cp systems . metallacyclic ketimide complexes are also described . these were obtained as a result of oxidative addition reactions , nitrile insertions and nitrile additions to unsaturated CC bonds in bent - metallocene systems . half - sandwich and cyclopentadienyl-free complexes were prepared aiming at the synthesis of olefin polymerization catalyst precursors through transmetallation reactions . titanium systems containing one cp ring and one ketimide ligand in particular have proven to be highly active ethylene , propylene and 1-hexene homopolymerization catalysts when activated by MAO . the activities reported in styrene homopolymerization are slightly lower although Cp*Ti(NCtBu2)Cl2 catalyses living styrene / ethylene copolymerization . this emerging role of ketimide ligands as ancillary ligands in the reactivity of early transition metals is quite recent and comes from their inertness towards insertion of unsaturated substrates in MN bonds and electrophile attack .

homogeneous single - site alkene polymerization is a " mature " field . however , this does not imply that interest to this research area fades . moreover , armed by well understood fundamentals of single - site polymerization , researchers get more and more detailed mechanistic data , important for the improvement of the existing catalyst systems , and rational design of new effective catalysts.This review aims at summarizing the new results obtained over the last few years in unraveling the mechanisms of coordination polymerization of a-olefins and selective oligomerization of ethylene . it is mainly focused on isospecific polymerization , living polymerization , polymerization by late transition metal complexes , and selective trimerization and tetramerization of ethylene .

new CrAlSBA-15 mesoporous materials have been prepared by direct synthesis and characterized by ICP - AES , XRD , N adsorption , 27Al NMR , TEM , UV - vis and H - TPR . CrAlSBA-15 materials exhibited high mesostructural order starting from chromium (III) nitrate ( Si / Cr = <nUm> ; Si / Al = <nUm> at pH <nUm> ) and from chromium (III) acetate hydroxide ( Si / Cr = <nUm> ; Si / Al = <nUm> at pH <nUm> ) . the incorporation of chromium and aluminium into SBA-15 mesoporous structure is enhanced by increasing the pH and produces an increase in pore size and pore volume . after calcination , samples prepared by one - step synthesis showed Cr (VI) centres well dispersed with a proportion of chromate species higher than Cr / AlSBA-15 catalysts prepared by impregnation and grafting . H - TPR measurements showed that only the <nUm> % of Cr (VI) ions incorporated into the SBA-15 structure were reduced , so part of chromium ions may be located in non-accessible positions inside the solid walls . CrAlSBA-15 materials obtained by direct synthesis exhibited higher ethylene polymerization activity ( <nUm> kg PE / g Cr h ) than Cr / AlSBA-15 and conventional Cr / O2Si phillips catalyst prepared by impregnation ( <nUm> and <nUm> kg PE / g Cr h , respectively ) .

r.l . A novel preceramic polymer polyzirconocenyborazane ( PZCBN ) was synthesized by the polymerization of bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium divinyl and borazine , introducing Zr , B , C , N together . the formation and concentration of elements Zr , C , B , N in the precursor and ceramic were detected through FTIR NMR , XRD , SEM and TEM . from the analysis , the Cp2Zr(CH=CH2)2 and borazine linked together via the addition reaction between C=C and B-H . and after pyrolysis at <nUm> ° C , the precursor turned to CZr / B2Zr / BN composite ceramics , with a yield of <nUm> wt % . EDX resulted showed that the elements were well dispersed in the ceramics . according to SEM and TEM , the ceramic had a relatively dense structure with nano crystalline areas of CZr embedded in the amorphous Zr-C-B-N matrix . TGA in air demonstrated that the ceramic had a favorable property on oxidation resistance . 
here , we revealed the effect of particle size of the nanoscale O2Si on catalytic and characteristic properties of LLDPE / nano-SiO2 composites synthesized via the in situ polymerization with a zirconocene / MAO catalyst . In the experiment , O2Si ( <nUm> and <nUm> nm ) was first impregnated with MAO . then , copolymerization of ethylene / 1-hexene was performed in the presence of nano-SiO2 / MAO to produce LLDPE / nano-SiO2 composites . it was found that the larger particle exhibited higher polymerization activity due to fewer interactions between O2Si and MAO . the larger particle also rendered higher insertion of 1-hexene leading to decreased melting temperature ( Tm ) . there was no significant change in the LLDPE molecular structure by means of 13C NMR . 
employing a kinetic monte carlo ( KMC ) simulation algorithm , tandem polymerization of ethylene is thoroughly investigated . to do this , the evolution of ethylene copolymerization is evaluated in terms of ethylene consumption and 1-hexene accumulation . the results obtained are in good agreement with the existing experimental kinetic data . it is revealed that the pre-trimerization time is a key factor in controlling the architecture of copolymer chains . moreover , the precise computation of instantaneous and cumulative comonomer contents along with the chemical composition distribution of simulated copolymers provides a comprehensive image of the growing chains during tandem polymerization . A well - established crystallization fractionation ( CRYSTAF ) analysis mathematical model is applied to delve into the molecular architecture and the crystallization fractionation behavior of the produced polyolefins . 
the ANN - generated data shows good agreement with the theoretical results , with an overall R2 of <nUm> . using its significantly enhanced computational speed , the ANN was used to analyze the reaction space , providing insights into trends seen in molecular weight and đ with various combinations of kinetic parameters , particularly pointing out regions of desirable and undesirable operation . the network was trained in reverse and used to generate reaction rate constants from chain length and đ , enabling a new form of kinetic deduction for polymerization reactions . this training was used to derive potential rate constants for different catalysts reported in the literature . overall , this data indicates that ANNs are a plausible tool for analyzing data from complex metallocene - catalyzed olefin polymerizations . 
the paper gives a review of publications on polymers with conjugated matrices ( PPy , PTh , PAni , hydrocarbon or mixed chains ... ) which incorporate metallocene complexes ( Fe , Ru , Co ; Ni , Ti , Zr , Ta ) with two cyclopentadienyl ligands ( cp ) and their derivatives , in particular with methylated cyclopentadienyl rings ( cp* ) , as well as hemi-metallocene complexes ( Fe , Ru , Co , Mn ) , as pendant groups or inside the principal chain ( part B ) . the information on related short - chain systems , monomers and oligomers , is also included . In part A , a brief overview of various conjugated polymer materials is presented , with their classification in accordance with the conductivity mechanism ( ionic , electronic or mixed conductors ) or with the structural type ( linear - chain organic or mixed polymers , derivatization , metallopolymers , multi-dimensional structures , alternating and block copolymers with organic or mixed units , hybrid materials with a mixture of conjugated and inert polymers , polymers inside a solid matrix , conjugated polymers with incorporated nanoelements of transition metals , carbon , semiconductors etc. V . 
V . cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> was immobilized on silica by two methods : direct grafting ( GS ) and via entrapment within silica matrix , produced by the non-hydrolytic sol - gel method ( NH ) . In the latter case , the surface was further modified by metal salts ( Cr , Mo and W ) . the supported catalysts ( three GS and four NH systems ) were evaluated in ethylene polymerization , having methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as the cocatalyst . almost all of them resisted to at least <nUm> mg g − <nUm> acetone ( used as probe molecule for oxygenated poisons ) . NH systems bearing W or Mo ( <nUm> wt. % ) on its structure were shown to be more productively efficient against poisoning . NH containing W in its structure tended to keep its catalyst activity even after the addition of the poison . therefore , metal doping may be a suitable strategy to keep or increase the efficiency of entrapped zirconocene systems against oxygenated poisons . SAXS analyses show likewise that the smaller the primary spheres , the more protected will be the active site . texture and microstructure of the catalytic systems and properties of the yielded polyethylenes reveal that the nature of the immobilization route affects the polymer properties ( mw and T m ). 
A ruthenium complex bearing cooperative PNP ligands showed unprecedented activities in homogenous catalysis of the reversible dehydrogenation of ammonia borane at both n-functionality and ethylene backbone . quantum chemical calculations on a simple model of Ru - complex are carried out to probe the H <nUm> release mechanism . the energy barrier for H <nUm> formation from NH 3BH <nUm> is found to be strongly reduced with the presence of Ru - catalyst , and one additional H <nUm> molecule can be produced . the Ru - complex can also be used as a catalyst for H <nUm> release from other potential materials for chemical hydrogen storage such as hydrazine and ammonia alane .

the primary absorber in dental resins is the photoinitiator , which starts the photo polymerization process . we studied the quantum yield of conversion of camphorquinone ( CQ ) , a blue light photoinitiator , in dental resin composites using a LED lamp ( <nUm> m FreeLight ) and a quartz tungsten halogen ( QTH ) lamp ( VIP ) as the light curing units at five different irradiances . the molar extinction coefficient , e469 , of CQ was <nUm> ± <nUm> cm - <nUm> / ( mol / L ) at <nUm> nm . the reciprocity of irradiance and exposure time holds for changes of CQ absorption coefficient , that is , irradiance × exposure time ( = radiant exposure ) = constant . both LED and QTH lamps yielded the same curing threshold ( the radiant exposure when CQ absorption drops to <nUm> / e ) and the same quantum yield conversion under different irradiances . In our dental resin formulation ( <nUm> wt. % CQ with reducing agents <nUm> wt. % dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate ( DMAEMA ) and <nUm> wt. % butylated hydroxytoluene ( BHT ) ) the quantum yield was measured as <nUm> ± <nUm> CQ conversion per absorbed photon . 
purpose : to evaluate important material properties of six experimental resin - based restorative materials ( EXP ) with systematically modified resin matrices using conventional and alternative monomers in comparison with an experimental standard ( ST ) . materials and methods commercially available monomers were selected according to their molecular weight , functionality , viscosity , and polymerization shrinkage . ST , <nUm> wt % filler , matrix UDMA / Bis-GMA / TTEGDMA and six EXPs with modified organic matrices but the same filler content were manufactured . flexural strength , flexural modulus , water sorption , solubility and polymerization shrinkage of all EXPs were measured and compared with the results of ST. results : ANOVA ( p < <nUm> ) revealed significant differences among the materials and all investigated properties . Bis-GMA and UDMA were substituted by alternative monomers without losing flexural strength or modulus . replacing the diluting monomer TTEGDMA with alternative monomers resulted in increased flexural strength . none of the experimental products with modified matrices showed increased water sorption or solubility but some even performed better than ST. increased hygroscopic expansion and reduced shrinkage were achieved using a very hydrophilic monomer but no significant differences of water sorption and solubility in comparison with ST were found . conclusion : the results indicated that there are monomers commercially available providing the same or even better properties than conventional matrices . 
abstract objectives the aim of this study is to determine if hexaarylbiimidazoles ( HABIs ) are efficient , visible light - active photoinitiators for thiol - ene systems . we hypothesize that , owing to the reactivity of lophyl radicals with thiols and the necessarily high concentration of thiol in thiol - ene formulations , HABIs will effectively initiate thiol - ene polymerization upon visible light irradiation . methods UV - vis absorption spectra of photoinitiator solutions were obtained using UV - vis spectroscopy , while EPR spectroscopy was used to confirm radical species generation upon HABI photolysis . functional group conversions during photopolymerization were monitored using FTIR spectroscopy , and thermomechanical properties were determined using dynamic mechanical analysis . results the HABI derivatives investigated exhibit less absorptivity than camphorquinone at <nUm> nm ; however , they afford increased sensitivity at this wavelength when compared with bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphineoxide . photolysis of the investigated HABIs affords lophyl radicals . affixing hydroxyhexyl functional groups to the HABI core significantly improved solubility . thiol - ene resins formulated with HABI photoinitiators polymerized rapidly upon irradiation with <nUm> nm . the glass transition temperatures of the thiol - ene resin formulated with a bis(hydroxyhexyl) - functionalized HABI and photopolymerized at room and body temperature were <nUm> ± <nUm> ° C and <nUm> ± <nUm> ° C , respectively . significance although thiol - enes show promise as continuous phases for composite dental restorative materials , they show poor reactivity with the conventional camphorquinone / tertiary amine photoinitiation system . conversely , despite their relatively low visible light absorptivity , HABI photoinitiators afford rapid thiol - ene photopolymerization rates . moreover , minor structural modifications suggest pathways for improved HABI solubility and visible light absorption .

new symmetrical bicationic polymethine dyes were synthesized and their spectroscopic and electrochemical properties were described . the bichromophoric dyes ( benzothiazole , benzoxazole , indolinium derivatives ) were investigated as sensitizers in the free radical photopolymerization initiated by their borate salts . the obtained kinetic results shown that bicationic polymethine dyes as the organoborate salts are much efficient photoinitiating systems of acrylate monomers polymerization than monocationic parent dyes . the rate of polymerization depends on DGET of electron transfer from borate anion to the excited singlet state of bicationic polymethine dye . the relationship between the rate of polymerization and the free energy of electron transfer process shows the dependence predicted by the classical theory of electron transfer . 
the AB and AB2 trans-stilbene-benzophenone dyads were synthesized through multi-step pathway . the target dyads showed remarkable absorption in visible light region . visible light photoinitiating polymerization of methyl methacrylate by the new dyads was studied by photo - differential scanning calorimetry . the results suggested that the AB2 dyad showed more efficient photoinitiating polymerization of methyl methacrylate than the AB one under visible light irradiation . furthermore , the new dyads yielded the greater visible light photoinitiaing polymerization effect than the intermolecular photoinitiating systems and the commercial photoinitiator titanocene respectively . the molecular weights of visible light photopolymers produced by the new dyads were determined by gel permeation chromatography . the visible light photoinitiating mechanism of the new dyads was analyzed by the static and transient absorption and emission spectra , electron spin resonance spectra and cyclic voltammograms . the thermal stabilities of the new dyads were further studied by differential scanning calorimetry and thermograving . 
A new monomer , 1,8-diaminocarbazole ( DACz ) , has been synthesized as a missing link between two classes of electropolymerizable compounds - aromatic amines and carbazoles to combine some attractive features of both . electropolymerization of DACz on Pt substrate carried out by cyclic voltammetry from acetonitrile and aqueous ( neutral and acidic ) solutions leads to formation of compact and very well adherent conducting films , electroactive in both media . In aqueous solutions poly(1,8-diaminocarbazole) ( PDACz ) exhibits a linear dependence of redox potential on pH . morphology of the polymer films was studied by AFM using a tapping mode . ability of amino groups of PDACz for post-functionalization was studied by covalent bonding of tyrosinase .

V . electrochemical synthesis of H3N from dinitrogen and protons from water by using Cp2TiCl2 supported in a hydrophobic ionic liquid , 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate ( [C9H20N]+[(C2F5)3PF3]- ) , was achieved in a solid polymer electrolyte ( SPE ) cell under ambient conditions . the yield of H3N per Cp2TiCl2 and current efficiency are <nUm> % and <nUm> % , respectively , which are improved in comparison with those reported previously . 
we report electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance ( EQCM ) results for electrodeposition of titanocene derivatized polypyrrole p(Tc3Py) films and redox transformation of polypyrrole matrix and titanocene centers immobilized in the film . films of p(Tc3Py) , Tc3Py = C4H6NTc 4H4 ( Tc = Cl2TiCpCp' , cp = C 5H5 , cp' = C5H4 ) were obtained from acetonitrile solutions of monomer on a Pt disc or thin Au layer evaporated on <nUm> MHz quartz crystals . polymerization efficiency , derived from the slope of the change of resonant frequency as a function of the deposition charge ranged from <nUm> % to <nUm> % . A gradual loss of redox activity of Tc centers during consecutive redox cycles of p(Tc3Py) film in TBAFP6 / THF solutions is discussed in terms of elimination of cl- ions from the Tc complex and accommodation of solvent molecule . the EQCM data are supported by XPS results . the preliminary studies performed in TEACl in AN solution have shown that the presence of cl- ions in the solution markedly inhibits the loss of redox activity of Tc centers immobilized in the polymer matrix . 
the electrochemical polymerization of a vitamin B12 derivative containing a pyrrole group in a peripheral alkyl chain is achieved on Pt under potentiodynamic conditions . the process efficiency depends critically on the range of the cathodic potential applied , supporting the view that the release of one CN- group upon the co-complex reduction promotes the adsorption of the modified complex prior to its electropolymerization . AFM analysis revealed the common characteristics of a conducting polymer in what concerns to its morphology . In situ ellipsometric measurements have been used to probe changes in the polymer films induced by the applied potential . the data reveal marked structural reorganisations upon metallic centre redox conversions ; polymer oxidation originates a density decrease and a very small increase in conductivity . the low conducting character , indicative of films formed by short chains , is also retrieved from the obtained values for polymer refractive index . however , the modified electrodes present interesting electrocatalytic properties as shown by the behaviour towards the ORR . 
synthesis of a titanocene dichloride derivative functionalized with 3,4-etylenedioxythiophene group , Tc1EDOT ( Cl2TiCpC5H 4(CH2) ( 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene ) ) has been described . redox behavior of the monomer in tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) , dichloromethane ( DCM ) and acetonitrile ( AN ) at different scan rates has been discussed in terms of different ability of these solvents to coordination with the reduced titanocene ( Tc ) complex and the solvation of cl- anions . electrooxidation of Tc1EDOT to get a conducting polymer film with immobilized titanocene dichloride centers and electrochemical properties of its polymer matrix in background acetonitrile solution have been compared with those of non-substituted PEDOT and PEDOT-methanol derivative ( PEDOTMet ) , to elucidate the effect of substituents both on polymerization and redox potentials of the matrix . STM and AFM images of p(Tc1EDOT) films obtained with potentiodynamic and potentiostatic regimes are compared to illustrate that the films deposited at constant potential are better ordered and more compact than those obtained by cyclic voltammetry . A comparison of the cyclic voltammograms of p(Tc1EDOT) and poly(titanocene-propyl- pyrrole ) ( p(Tc3Py) ) films in <nUm> TBAPF6 in THF has shown that the electroactivity of the polymer matrix of p(Tc1EDOT) is extended to more negative potentials in comparison to that of p(Tc3Py) . this results in the anodic shift of redox potential of Tc centers immobilized in p(Tc1EDOT) film with respect to that of the centers fixed in p(Tc3Py) . 
the first part of this paper describes in detail the electrochemical synthesis of polypyrrole ( PPy ) films monitored by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance ( EQCM ) . these films are either doped only with a keggin - type heteropolyanion ( HPA ) , SiMo12O404- , or co-doped with such polyanions and sulphate ions . it is evidenced that this HPA catalyses the electropolymerisation of the pyrrole since it is able to oxide pyrrole monomer , and on the other hand , that AsHP are definitively entrapped into the polypyrrole film as shown by their electrochemical response . all the PPy film is electroactive . when the co-doped film is obtained by potentiodynamic method , its anion composition is not homogeneous in depth , there is a concentration gradient of the doping anions . In the second part of this paper , the morphology of the films is shown as well as their electrochemical characterisations that were carried out by EQCM in order to focus on the charge compensation process that occurs during Mo12Si reduction and re-oxidation . In a wide domain of potentials , only the HPA response is observed , the polymer remains in its conducting form . the SiMo12O404- doped PPy films are cationic films . when several types of cations are present in the medium , the influence of the pH on the nature of the cations implied in the charge compensation that occurs during Mo12Si reduction and re-oxidation is important . when the PPy film is co-doped , it is possible to obtain a mixed PPy film . another important finding is the stability of trapped Mo12Si ions in contact with solutions of pH higher than <nUm> , on the contrary to what occurs when they are in solution . 
we have studied a reaction between the reduced form of titanocene dichloride ( Cp2TiCl2 ) and a group of organic halides : benzyl derivatives ( 4-X{single bond}C6H4CH2Cl , x = H , NO2 , CH3 ; 4-X{single bond}C6H4CH2Br , x = H , NO2 , PhC(O) ; 4-X{single bond}C6H4CH2SCN , x = H , NO2 ) as well as three aryl halides ( 4-NO2C6H4Hal , hal = Cl , Br ; 4-CH3O-C6H4Cl ) . it has been shown that the electrochemical reduction of Cp2TiCl2 in the presence of these benzyl halides leads to a catalytic cycle resulting in the reductive dehalogenation of these organic substrates to yield mostly corresponding toluene derivatives as the main product . No dehalogenation has been observed for aryl derivatives . based on electrochemical data and digital simulation , possible schemes of the catalytic process have been outlined . for non-substituted benzyl halides halogen atom abstraction is a key step . for the reaction of nitrobenzyl halides the complexation of Ti (III) species with the nitro group takes place , with the electron transfer from Ti (III) to this group ( owing to its highest coefficient in LUMO of the nitro benzyl halide ) followed by an intramolecular dissociative electron redistribution in the course of the heterolytic c{single bond}Hal bond cleavage . the results for reduced titanocene dichloride centers immobilized inside a polymer film showed that the catalytic reductive dehalogenation of the p-nitrobenzyl chloride does occur but with a low efficiency because of the partial deactivation of the film due to the blocking of the electron charge transport between the electrode and catalytic centers . 
electrochemical and ellipsometric methods have been used to study the electropolymerization process of a functionalized monomer , Tc3Py ( in which pyrrole is covalently bonded with titanocene dichloride complex ) on platinum electrode from a dilute monomer solution in acetonitrile . the deposition has been performed in the potentiodynamic regime . A new method for the acquisition and treatment of ellipsometric data has been proposed which allowed us to analyze the evolution of the film properties at each potential . the model of a single uniform layer was unable to describe the ellipsometric experimental observations with the necessary precision . A proper fitting of the data has been achieved considering a model of two layers having identical values of the refractive index but different values of the extinction coefficient ( higher absorption for the outer layer ) . the analysis of the calculated values of the optical parameters of these layers has led to the assumption that both layers represent morphologically the same medium ( i.e. that the whole polymer film is uniform ) while the higher extinction coefficient of the external layer was due to a penetration into it of solute oligomers possessing an intensive absorption at the wavelength of the observation , <nUm> nm . the dependences of the thicknesses of each layer and of the whole film on the cycle number have been established , the increment of the growth ( <nUm> nm per cycle ) being constant within the whole deposition procedure . the variation of the optical constants of the layers during the potential cycling was determined and interpreted . the calculated values for the extinction coefficients and the layer thicknesses have been used to estimate how the film absorbance changes during the potential cycling . its comparison with the same characteristic measured directly in a spectroelectrochemical cell for a film deposited at the ITO electrode surface has provided an extra evidence in favor of the above hypothesis on the film being a morphologically uniform material , with incorporated solute oligomers in its outer layer . 
nanocomposites were prepared by in situ redox intercalative polymerization method , in which a-RuCl3 microcrystals were soaked in pyrrole . polypyrrole ( PP ) was formed as a result of the intercalation of pyrrole into the layered structure of Cl3Ru crystal and the reaction between pyrrole and the host material . the appearance of polypyrrole was proven by infrared spectroscopy . the as-formed (PP)z+(RuCl3)z- nanocomposites were attached to paraffin - impregnated graphite or gold surfaces and studied by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical nanogravimetry . the redox behaviour of the composite shows the electrochemical transformations of both the polypyrrole and Cl3Ru . the redox waves of PP are similar to those observed for very thin PP films . it attests that the response is originated from monolayer - like PP film situated between Cl3Ru layers . the transport of the charge - compensating ions reflects the variation of the oxidation states of both PP and Cl3Ru . the nanocomposites behave as self - doped layers in the potential region when both constituents are charged , i.e. , PP is partially oxidized while Cl3Ru is partially reduced , since the electroneutrality is assured by mutual charge compensation . when PP is reduced , cations enter the layer to counterbalance the negative charge resulted from the reduction of Ru (III) to Ru (II) . it was also found that the intercalation of water molecules is - albeit still substantial - smaller than that of pure Cl3Ru microcrystals which is related to the presence of PP between the Cl3Ru layers . 
redox properties of three cationic tantalocene hydroxo complexes , [Cp*(CpR)TaVOHCl]+ , with one pentamethylated cyclopentadienyl ligand , cp* = e5-C5Me5 , me = CH3 , and one monosubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligand , CpR , cp = C5H4 , r = H , SiMe3 or C7H10N , as well as of an oxo complex with the pyrrole - containing ligand , Cp*(Cp(CH2)3NC4H4)TaOCl , have been studied in acetonitrile solutions with cyclic voltammetry in the ranges of the Ta (V) reduction to Ta(IV) and to Ta (III) . both transitions are irreversible due to the dissociation of reduced complexes with the loss of their chloride ligand . the mechanism of hydroxo complex reduction is discussed in terms of its reversible deprotonation / protonation equilibrium with the corresponding oxo complex , Cp*(CpR)TaOCl . the variation of the reduction potential for the Ta (V) / Ta(IV) transition in the negative direction in the series of tantalocene complexes : dichloride > hydroxo > oxo , as well as the difference in the behavior of the reduced ( Ta(IV) ) complexes ( stable for dichloride but losing their chloride ligand for hydroxo and oxo complexes ) was explained by the increase of the electronic density at the central metal in this series , correlated with the weakening of the Ta-Cl bond and its easier dissociation . the tantalocene centers were immobilized inside a polypyrrole matrix on the electrode surface by electropolymerization of the cationic complex [Cp*(Cp(CH2)3NC4H4)TaOHCl]+ . this was possible after removal of the " free " chloride ions from the polymerization bath by their precipitation upon addition of F6PTl . the corresponding polymer , poly[Cp*(Cp(CH2)3NC4H4)TaOHCl] , was found to be electroactive in contact with a background electrolyte , giving a redox response both in the polymer matrix and tantalocene potential ranges . the mechanism of the immobilized tantalocene complex transformation was the same as that for the same species dissolved in solution . 
new co-oligomers based on 4,4'-dialkyl-2,2'-bithiazole and 3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene ( EDOT ) in a donor - acceptor type molecule were obtained using organometallic polycondensation mediated by organotransition metal complexes . the properties of electrochemically obtained polymer films from these monomers were characterized by cyclic voltammetry combined with in situ conductivity , UV - vis spectra , and electrochemical quartz microbalance ( EQCM ) method . 
the initial stages of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) ( PEDOTh ) film growth on platinum electrodes from TBAClO <nUm> / acetonitrile solution are investigated by means of current - time transient measurements and tapping mode atomic force microscopy . it is shown that , for growth potentials in the range <nUm> - <nUm> V vs . SCE , the deposition process involves the formation of oligomers in the solution , progressive nucleation of centres of the new phase and three - dimensional growth of a first compact layer followed by a non-uniform distribution of granular - like clusters , whose number and size increase with the synthesis potential and charge . the obtained results reveal that PEDOTh films prepared at distinct potentials but with the same growth charge ( q g ) display similar electroactivities . they also depict that the electrochemical behaviour of the films is a function of the charge used for the synthesis , namely the reduction of tick PEDOTh layers ( q g > <nUm> mC cm <nUm> ) includes more that one step , as a consequence of the formation of a two - layered polymer film . 
creating micropatterns of electrically conductive polymers on solid substrates is important for the low - cost construction of organic microelectronic devices . this work develops a novel strategy for the preparation of large - area polypyrrole ( ppy ) micropatterns through area - selected in situ electropolymerization of pyrrole within microchannels . the effects on micropattern formation of electropolymerization procedures such as dynamic potential polymerization ( DPP ) , static potential polymerization ( SPP ) , and constant current polymerization ( CCP ) , the solvent , and the polymerization time were studied systematically . the electrical conductivities of the ppy micropatterns were measured and compared with a homogeneous ppy thin film synthesized under the same conditions . given the straightforward and versatile nature of this method , it is expected to contribute greatly to the convenient fabrication of low - cost organic microelectronic devices . 
the chemical synthesis of an EDOT derivative endowed with an electron acceptor anthraquinone moiety ( AQ - EDOT ) is described . the electrochemical polymerization of the monomer has been studied by cyclic voltammetry , chronoamperometry and chronopotentiometry . the monomer oxidation - polymerization takes places on platinum at potentials more positive than <nUm> V vs. Ag / AgCl . the polymer film presents a stable redox process with E0 = <nUm> V , that can be assigned to the characteristic exchange process of the parent unsubstituted PEDOT polymer . an unstable redox process at E0 = <nUm> V , present decreasing charges on the consecutive cycles despite that the lost reduction charge is recovered by two irreversible oxidation processes taking place at high anodic potentials <nUm> and <nUm> V . A structural charge trapping effects occurring by reduction at <nUm> V and re-oxidation at <nUm> V of the anthraquinone moiety is suggested . the stable redox process is not affected by cycling allowing the obtention of the oxidation empirical kinetics , kinetic coefficients and reaction orders . different initial states attained by reduction at different cathodic potentials for a constant time were explored for the kinetic study . 
electrooxidation of magnesium (II) porphine , a totally unsubstituted porphyrin , in acetonitrile solution under potentiostatic or potentiodynamic regime leads to a polymer film at the electrode surface . polymer deposition takes place at extremely low potential , several hundred mV less positive even compared to the deposition potential for pyrrole or EDOT ( at identical monomer concentrations ) in the same solvent . film thickness can be controlled by the passed deposition charge . this material and its THF - soluble fraction have been characterized by various electrochemical methods as well as by UV - visible and IR spectroscopies , XPS , XRD and MALDI - TOF techniques . this analysis has allowed us to conclude that the polymer film is composed by chains of Mg porphine building blocks , with single bonds between the neighboring units . In the course of the potential sweep , this polymer film demonstrates a redox response resembling that of polythiophene - coated electrodes . namely , the film is electroactive and electronically conducting in two potential ranges ( p- and n - doping ) , which are separated by a broad interval where the film possesses a much higher resistance . the polymer may be switched between all these redox states repeatedly by the change of the potential . the film capacitance in the electroactive potential intervals is proportional to the deposition charge . 
previous publication of the authors presented evidences that electrochemical oxidation of Mg (II) porphine ( fully unsubstituted porphyrin , MgP ) in acetonitrile ( AN ) at a very low potential leads to deposition of films at electrode surface corresponding to typical electroactive polymers , with their reversible transition between the electron - conducting and insulating states depending on the electrode potential / oxidation level ( " film of type I " ) . it is demonstrated in the actual publication that these films in contact with a monomer - free solution are subject to an irreversible transformation to quite a different material ( " film of type II " ) under the influence of a higher positive potential ( above <nUm> - <nUm> V vs. Ag / Ag + in AN ) . films with the same properties may also be obtained directly by electrooxidation of the monomer , MgP , at a sufficiently high potential . films of type II possess a high redox activity and electronic conductivity within the whole potential interval of above <nUm> V in the width . their grayish color is related to a constant absorption intensity within the whole range of wavelengths studied ( 320-1000 nm ) . on the basis of a combination of experimental observations ( ATR IR and XPS ) and literature data the molecular structure of this new material is assumed to be polymer chains of directly linked porphine units ( with a partial loss of Mg cations ) , probably with multiple bonds ( meso-meso and b-b types ) between neighboring units . 
we synthesized new electropolymerizable [ Ru(bpy)nL m](PF6)2 ( L = <nUm> bis(3-pyrrol-1-ylpropyloxy) bipyridyl ) derivatives . the introduction of electron donating ether groups in the bipyridine ligand induced a negative shift of the Ru (III) / ( II ) redox couple . the electrochemical behavior of complex ru1 ( n = <nUm> , m = <nUm> ) and complex ru2 ( n = <nUm> , m = <nUm> ) were compared using platinum and Multi-Walled carbon nanotube ( MWCNT ) electrode . higher polymerization yields and surface concentrations were obtained at MWCNT electrodes . furthermore , MWCNT electrodes increase polymer permeability and decrease the charge trapping phenomenon involved in the oxidation and reduction of the polypyrrolic skeleton of the Ru (II) functionalized polymers . 
electropolymerization and doping / undoping process of poly(1,8- diaminocarbazole ) ( PDACz ) were investigated by cyclic voltammetry combined with electrochemical quartz microbalance ( EQCM ) , in aqueous solution of <nUm> m ClHO4 and in <nUm> m ClLiO4 in acetonitrile . the results demonstrated that protonation of the polymer in ClHO4 strongly influences the gravimetric response obtained during polymerization as well as the mechanism of redox process of the polymer in the monomer - free solution . the data are discussed in terms of the presence of protons and ClO4 - counter ions in the reduced ( neutral ) polymer matrix . In aprotic acetonitrile containing ClLiO4 as the supporting electrolyte , the polymer doping / undoping occurs according to the simple mechanism with exchange of anions . the gravimetric results obtained in acidic aqueous solution allowed for some revision of the scheme of the redox process proposed by the authors in the previous paper . 
the electropolymerization of COOH - functionalized 3,4-ethylenedioxythipohene was investigated by cyclic voltammetry , by anodic potential steps or by flow of a constant anodic current . compared with PEDOT , an anodic shift of the oxidation polymerization potential is observed . nevertheless the polymer film oxidation / reduction is shifted to more cathodic potentials , giving higher stored specific charges than those obtained from PEDOT films generated in similar conditions . the generated polymer shows a stable redox process , E0 = <nUm> V . EQCM results point to a p - doping process exchanging anions with solution , whereas a second reduction process at <nUm> V is related to a p - doping process exchanging cations . the new material is electrochromic : it is colourless in its oxidized state and blue colour in its reduced state . UV - vis spectroelectrochemical results are similar to those obtained from PEDOT films . all rights reserved . 
electrochemical and mechanical properties of thin poly(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene ) ( PEDOT ) films deposited on gold and platinum have been investigated in aqueous sulfuric acid solutions . At sufficiently positive electrode potentials overoxidation of the polymer takes place on both metals . structural changes of the polymer layer caused by overoxidation ( degradation ) could be detected by using the electrochemical bending beam method . the impedance spectra recorded after overoxidation differed considerably from the impedance spectra of freshly made electrodes . the most interesting feature was the appearance of an arc ( or a " depressed semicircle " ) at high frequencies in the complex plane impedance plot , which indicates that the charge transfer process at the metal / film interface is hindered by the degradation process . changes of the effective mass of the film were studied by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance ( EQCM ) . the morphological changes of the PEDOT film during overoxidation were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . 
polypyrrole ( PPy ) films of different thicknesses ( within the range from <nUm> nm to <nUm> mm ) were electrodeposited on two types of inhomogeneous substrates , single band and double - band Pt electrodes . topographic images of the polymer layers were obtained by means of ex situ large - scale AFM technique to demonstrate how the propagation rates of the film growth above the electrode ( in the normal direction to the electrode surface ) and along the insulating surface surrounding the single- or double - band electrodes ( in the horizontal direction ) change with the deposition charge . it is proved that variations in the film thickness over the double band electrodes and progressive changes of the PPy morphology from compact thin film to rough thick layers represents an obstacle for reliable determination of the specific conductivity of the deposited polymer film from conductance / resistance data for such coated microband electrodes . advantages and shortcomings of other methods of specific conductivity measurements of the polymer films are also discussed .

the electrodeposition of silver was examined under conditions that excluded a possibility of electroless formation of polypyrrole and silver crystallites . the polymer layers were appropriately prepared ; after finishing the polymerization and before the silver reduction they were oxidized . A comparison of the theoretical chronoamperograms with the experimental data , appropriately corrected for the induction time , revealed that the progressive nucleation took place for all examined polymer films and deposition potentials . for lower overpotentials the Ag nuclei were mainly formed under the polymer layer and in its pores . an explanation was given for why the Ag crystallites can not be completely oxidized from the polypyrrole films . 
In this paper we present the procedures allowing for synthesis of the composite systems in which Au nanoparticles are located : ( i ) only on the surface of the polymer film , ( ii ) only inside the polymer matrix or ( iii ) both on the polymer surface and in the polymer film . thin poly(1,8-diaminocarbazole) ( PDACz ) films were electrodeposited on gold or highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( HOPG ) electrodes from acetonitrile solution . then , Au nanoparticles ( NPs ) were formed either by electroless deposition on the polymer layer in the solution of AuCl4H or by electrochemical reduction of AuCl4 - incorporated into the polymer matrix , carried out in the solution of ClHO4 . the amount of deposited Au was determined from electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance measurements and from the reduction charge . the role of protonation of amino groups of the polymer in the process of AuCl4 - insertion into the polymer matrix has been discussed . A distribution of Au nanoparticles on the top and inside the polymer film was studied by SEM and TEM images of the polymer cross sections prepared by focused ion beam ( FIB ) method . 
In this study , bis(thiophene)-bis(ethylenedioxythiophene)-3,3'- dinonylthiazole ( ThEdNBTEdTh ) comonomer was obtained by using organometallic polycondensation mediated by organotransition metal complexes . the properties of electrochemically obtained poly[bis(thiophene)-bis(ethylenedioxythiophene)-3 , 3'-dinonylthiazole ] ( P[ThEdNBTEdTh] ) from this comonomer were characterized by electrochemical techniques such as voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS ) . oxidative polymerization of ThEdNBTEdTh was carried out in dichlorometane onto a platinum electrode . effect of polymerization charge on the redox behaviour of polymer films was investigated and these films were further characterized by ATR - FTIR , UV - visible and fluorescence spectrophotometric measurements . EIS studies revealed that high capacitance values observed in the lower frequency region and proposed electrical equivalent circuit was applied to the experimental data to correlate the results , obtain the parameter of each element and explain the interface between the Pt / P[ThEdNBTEdTh / Bu4NPF6 system . results showed that polymer has low oxidation potential , low band gap ( <nUm> eV ) and good stability in the oxidized state and it shows p- and n-dopable properties . n - doping was verified experimentally by ex-situ FT-IR spectroelectrochemical measurements . the measured capacitance values are quite promising for supercapacitor applications . 
published by elsevier Ltd.Thick films of polypyrrole-paraphenolsulfonic acid ( PPy - HpPS ) , polypyrrole-dodecylbenzensulfonic acid ( PPy - DBS ) and a bilayer PPy - HpPS / PPy - DBS ( asymmetric bilayer ) were electrogenerated from aqueous solutions . two bilayers : PPy - HpPS / tape and tape / PPyDBS were constructed . the angular displacement of those three bilayer muscles was characterized in ClNa aqueous solution by cyclic voltammetry and parallel video recording of the bending movement . the attained coulo - voltammetric ( charge - potential ) , dynamo - voltammetric ( angle - potential ) and coulo - dynamic ( charge - angle ) responses until different cathodic potential limits were analyzed . the dynamo - voltammetric and coulo - dynamic responses from the PPy - HpPS / tape and tape / PPyDBS muscles inform about the reaction driven ionic exchanges in the two PPy films . electrochemo - dynamical responses from the asymmetric PPy - HpPS / PPy - DBS bilayer muscles are explained using those reactions . cooperative dynamic effects exist when both layers follow complementary reaction - driven volume changes ( swelling / shrinking , or shrinking / swelling ) due to complementary entrance / expulsion of ions . the cooperative amplitude of the angle described by the asymmetric bilayer muscle is one order of magnitude larger than those attained from each of the conducting polymer / tape bilayer muscles . antagonist dynamic actuation occurs when the two films swell , or shrink , simultaneously originating narrower angular displacements . improving cooperative actuation or eliminating antagonist actuation and creeping by suitable selection of polymers and electrolytes seem the way to get most efficient polymeric motors and industrial products . 
this paper presents an easy , efficient and reproducible way to obtain cobalt polyporphine films . A fast three step process ( less than one hour ) based on electrosynthesis of magnesium polyporphine of type I followed by a demetallation in acid medium and then cobalt insertion inside the porphine units allowed us to obtain an interesting material with a high density of active cobalt (II) centers . kinetics studies were conducted to determine the best conditions for the demetallation and remetallation steps . moreover , IR - ATR and UV - visible measurements attested that the initial molecular structure of the porphine units was kept during the three step process . qualitative composition of polyporphine films has been confirmed via XPS and EDX methods . In situ specific conductivity of these polyporphine polymers of type I has been determined as a function of the imposed potential , i.e. of the oxidation degree . 
PEDOT layers are obtained in the presence of perchlorate ions and one of the two organic anions , polystyrene sulfonate ( PSS ) or dodecyl sulfate ( DDS ) . potentiostatic current transients of silver electrodeposition are measured in the course of several consecutive deposition / dissolution experiments on both PEDOT / PSS- and PEDOT / DDS - coated electrodes . it is found that the metal nucleation and growth is markedly influenced by the type of organic ions used , with PEDOT / DDS providing conditions for more intense metal electrodeposition in comparison to PEDOT / PSS . the latter type of layers shows also an effect of deactivation in the course of several consecutive measurements . experimental current transients obtained in the PEDOT / PSS case are interpreted by means of scharifker model for multiple nucleation and growth . the seeming deactivation of the PEDOT / PSS layers is considered to occur at the expense of decrease in both number of active sites for nucleation and nucleation rate per active site . these results are commented in terms of the appearance of concentration gradient in the polymer bulk of the more hydrophilic PEDOT / PSS resulting in a lower effective overpotential for electrochemical nucleation and growth than the formally calculated one . 
its electropolymerization was conducted in acetonitrile , containing <nUm> m ClNaO4 + <nUm> m CILiO4 ( MCIO4 ) . properties of the polymer film , obtained P[T-NBT-Ph2DTT-NBT-T] , were characterized by electrochemical techniques . effect of the polymerization charge on the redox behavior of the polymer film was investigated , and the film was further characterized by UV - visible spectrophotometric measurements . corresponding electrical equivalent circuit was applied to the experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS ) data to explain the parameters of each element and the interface of the Pt / P[T-NBT-Ph2DTT-NBT-T] / MCIO4 system . the band gap of the polymer was obtained as <nUm> eV by in situ spectroelectrochemical measurements . good stability in the oxidized state was verified experimentally . molecular orbitals and electropolymerization of the comonomer were investigated at DFT level . 
A series of new half - metallocene complexes of titanium containing siloxy ligands and a new bimetallic titanocene complex ( compound <nUm> ) with a crystallographically determined structure have been prepared . when activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , they showed high activities toward polymerization of styrene with high syndiotacticity . origin of the high activity and syndiotacticity found in this work was investigated systematically by comparison with polymerization results using other known complexes . 
the syndiotactic polymerization of styrene with exo-[(e5- isodiCp)TiCl3 ] <nUm> / methylalumoxane ( MAO ; isodiCp = isodicyclopentadienyl ) was studied as well as the ethylene / styrene copolymerization with exo-[{e5:e1(N)-isodiCp(SiMe2Nt-Bu)} Cl2Ti ] <nUm> / MAO . these two catalytic systems are stable during polymerization . the half - sandwich titanocene <nUm> exhibits good syndiospecificity and average activity . the bridged half - sandwich amino complex <nUm> was found to incorporate styrene into polymer chains at <nUm> ° C . activity results decrease with increasing styrene concentrations . 
three silyl-substituted titanium trichloride complexes [ CpSi(CH 3)2X]TiCl3 [ x = cl(1) , me(2) , PhOMe(3) ] were tested as catalyst precursors for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene . the catalytic activity increased in the order <nUm> . the highest activity was <nUm> × <nUm> g s-PS / mol timol sh using complex <nUm> / MAO catalytic system at molar ratio of Al / Ti = <nUm> . the effects of variation on polymerization temperature and Al / Ti ratio on the polymerization of styrene were also studied . 
the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene with a new class of multinuclear transition metal catalysts in the presence of methylalumoxane and triisobutylaluminum has been investigated . the new multinuclear catalysts [(e5-C5Me5)Ti]4(m-O) <nUm> and [(e5-C13H17)Ti] 4(m-O)6 were received by reaction of the corresponding mononuclear compounds with water and characterized by x-ray crystal structure analysis . the molecular structure of both complexes is tetrameric with six bridging oxygen atoms between the four titanium atoms , forming an adamantane - like cage structure with a substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand remaining e5-bonded to each titanium atom . the bulky [(e5-C13H17)Ti]4(m-O) <nUm> shows higher polymerization conversions than [ ( e5- C5Me5)Ti]4(m-O)6 . the polymerization activity is significantly increased by an enhancement of the MAO concentration after a short retardation period and levels off at MAO / [(e5-C13H17)Ti]4(m-O) <nUm> molar ratios above about <nUm> . triisobutylaluminum increases the polymerization yield to a maximum at a TIBA / [ ( e5-C 13H17)Ti]4(m-O)6 molar ratio of about 30-100 , but considerably decreases it at higher molar ratios below the polymerization conversion reached without any additional aluminum alkyl . both compounds affect molecular weight and molecular weight distribution without any influence on the stereo - specificity of the different catalytic sites active in polymerization reactions . the new multinuclear transition metal catalysts reach about 30-50 % of the polymerization activity of the mononuclear catalysts on a molar basis and show a remarkably high catalytic activity in complex - coordinative polymerizations even after storage in non-inert-atmosphere conditions . the active polymerization sites of the multinuclear catalysts are not as uniform as the active sites of the mononuclear catalysts are and provide polystyrenes of a slightly lower syndiospecificity , but do not significantly influence the weight average molecular weights . 
poly(vinyl chloride ) ( PVC ) was prepared using a titanium complex with an anionic oxygen tripod ligand [CpCo{P(O)(OEt)2}3] - ( LOEt- ) as catalyst and methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst . the polymerization behavior was compared with that of pentamethyl cyclopentadienyl titanium trichloride ( Me5CpTiCl <nUm> ) . it is observed that LOEt- Cl3Ti can polymerize vinyl chloride with activity comparable to that of me 5CpTiCl3 . the PVC samples prepared with L OEtTiCl3 / MAO exhibit bimodal molecular weight distribution and the fraction of high molecular weight peak decreases with polymerization temperature . the microstructure and thermal decomposition of the PVC obtained were studied . five types of structural defect were detected by 1H - NMR . only saturated structural defects are found at low polymerization temperature , but at high polymerization temperature unsaturated structural defects , possibly resulting from dehydrochlorination of the saturated structural defects , appear as well . No head - to - head structural defect is observed . 13C - NMR shows that the PVC prepared-by L OEtTiCl3 has an atactic stereostructure . compared with the PVC from radical polymerization and anionic polymerization , the PVC samples prepared with LOEtTiCl3 show improved thermal stability . 
syndiotactic polystyrene has been chemically modified with succinic anhydride by use of friedel - crafts acylation reaction in the presence of anhydrous aluminum chloride in carbon disulfide . the modified syndiotactic polystyrene containing -COCH2CH2COOH fragments in side phenyl rings , named succinoylated syndiotactic polystyrene ( s-sPS ) , was characterized by FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy . the effects of reaction conditions on the degree of succinoylation of s-sPS were investigated . In addition , the effects of incorporation of carboxyl groups into syndiotactic polystyrene on the thermal behavior were studied by differential scanning calorimetry in comparison with pure syndiotactic polystyrene . it was found that the crystallization temperature , melting temperature , and degree of crystallinity of the modified polymer decreased with increasing the degree of succinoylation , while the glass transition temperature increased . 
the heterogeneous bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium(IV) dichloride catalyst of the composition MgCl2(THF) / (AlEt2Cl)0.34 / (Cp2ZrCl2)0.01 as determined by FTIR , XRD , and AAS analyses was synthesised and , after activation by MAO , applied for ethylene polymerisation . the catalyst turned out to be stable and more active than those magnesium supported catalysts already known from the literature . the polyethylene produced has a relatively high molecular weight ( mw > <nUm> g / mol ) , a narrow and monomodal molecular weight distribution ( MWD = <nUm> ) , a bulk density of about <nUm> g / dm3 , and monomodal particle size distribution . application of a ternary al(i - bu)3 / MAO / B(C 6F5)3 activator decreased the amount of MAO needed and increased catalyst activity , but did not change the reaction mechanism . 
reaction of ( o , m , p ) disodium(phenylenedimethylene)dicyclopentadienide C12H10Na <nUm> with <nUm> equiv of (MeCp)TiCl3 yields the phenylenedimethylene bridged binuclear titanocenes complexes [ ( MeC 5H4)TiCl2](C5H4CH 2C6H4CH2C5H 4)[(MeC5H4)TiCl2] ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) in high yield , which were characterized by 1H NMR and elemental analysis . they were used successfully as efficient catalysts for ethylene polymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the catalytic activities of <nUm> and <nUm> are somewhat higher than that of <nUm> and the molecular weight distributions ( MWD = <nUm> - <nUm> ) of the polymers generated from the bimetallic catalytic systems are obviously higher than that obtained by conventional Cp2TiCl <nUm> . all right reserved . 
the electrochemical synthesis and characterisation of poly(methyl vinylsilane ) and a series of poly(methyl vinylsilane-co-metallocenes ) network polymers are described in detail . this class of polymers are not accessible through wurtz coupling reaction and are however prepared by electro-reduction of dichloro methyl vinylsilane in a non-aqueous system using aluminum electrodes in a single compartment cell . these polymers have been characterised using UV , FTIR , XRD , SEM and NMR spectral techniques . cyclic voltammetric studies of the above polymers reveal their conducting behavior . these polymers show optical properties as explained from the results . polymers of this type are proposed as potential soluble precursors for CSi and metal doped CSi materials . 
unbridged bis-substituted-indenyl zirconocene complexes , [ ( 2,4-Me 2Ind)2ZrCl2 , met-1 ; ( 2,4,6-Me 3Ind)2ZrCl2 , met-2 ] , were supported on silica and montmorillonite carriers ( resulting in silica - supported catalysts MS-1 and MS-2 , and montmorillonite - supported catalyst MT-1 ) . ethylene polymerization by homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts showed high activity , affording polyethylenes with high molecular weight . the catalytic activity and the molecular weight of the polymer were improved using the heterogeneous systems . the activities for the ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization by heterogeneous systems were lower than those using homogeneous systems , however , the comonomer was incorporated efficiently into polymer in both the homo- and the heterogeneous systems , and moreover , the microstructure of the copolymer derived from the heterogeneous catalysts showed different characteristics from those resulting from the homogeneous systems . the rErH values of the heterogeneous catalysts ( <nUm> for MS-1 and <nUm> for MS-2 ) , are quite different from those of their homogeneous analogues ( <nUm> for met-1 and <nUm> for met-2 ) . 
the effect of very low amounts of methylaluminoxane as an activating cocatalyst in the coordination polymerization has been investigated in the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene with a half - sandwich metallocene catalyst in the presence of triisobutylaluminum at molar ratios of methylaluminoxane / transition metal from <nUm> / <nUm> to about <nUm> / <nUm> in comparison to the polymerization behavior at high molar methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) / metal ratios . As a result , there can not be observed any polymerization reaction below a true molar ratio MAO / Ti of <nUm> : <nUm> . At higher molar ratios until about <nUm> , the polymerization conversion is increasing significantly with the MAO / Ti molar ratio . these observations and the results of the determination of the kinetic reaction order can be explained with barron 's tert-butyl aluminoxane based model of MAO as a cage of six monomeric MAO units (AlOMe)6 in contrast to sinn 's MAO model of a cage of twelve monomeric units (AlOMe)12 and are discussed with the results received at usually applied much higher MAO / transition metal ratios leading to a first - order dependence of the polymerization rate on the MAO concentration . from the thermal behavior of the syndiotactic polystyrenes synthesized it can be concluded , that the stereospecificity of the polymerization reaction is not affected by MAO at low MAO concentrations . 
In the coordination polymerization of styrene , selected transition metal complexes of metals other than group <nUm> elements and non-metallocenes have been investigated in comparison to a known half - metallocene titanium complex with regard to the catalytic activity as well as to the thermal and molecular properties of the polymers synthesized . whereas iron catalysts lead to syndiotactic polystyrenes , catalysts with nickel as the transition metal result only in atactic polymers with an enhanced isotactic content . In addition to the influence of the transition metal , the effect of a broad variation of the ancillary ligands of a specific half - sandwich titanocene , octahydrofluorenyl titanium trimethoxide , on polymerization activity and polymer properties has been investigated and discussed in detail .

4,4'-Bis(methylene)biphenylene bridged homodinuclear titanocene ( 3 ) and zirconocene ( 4 ) have been synthesized by treatment of CpTiCl3 and CpZrCl3 · DME with Na2[C5H4CH2C6H4-p-C6H4CH2C5H4] , respectively , in THF and characterized by 1H NMR and element analysis . after activation with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) , these catalysts were used for the homogeneous polymerization of ethylene . the influences of reaction conditions , such as temperature , time , catalyst concentration and molar ratio of MAO / cat . on ethylene polymerization were investigated in detail . the catalytic activities of <nUm> and <nUm> are more than three times higher than that of the phenyldimethylene bridged homodinuclear metallocene of titanocene ( 5 ) and zirconocene ( 6 ) , respectively , and also twice higher than that of Cp2TiCl2 / MAO and Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO , respectively . however , the catalytic activity of <nUm> is nearly half as high as that of <nUm> , which reached <nUm> × <nUm> g PE / mol cat h . the molecular weight of polyethylene increases simultaneously with prolongation of polymerization time . GPC spectra show that <nUm> and <nUm> produce polyethylene with broad molecular weight distribution ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) . the high melting points of the products ( 131-134 ° C ) indicate that the polyethylene formed is highly linear and highly crystalline .

A new metallocene catalyst applied to propene polymerization provides an expansion of the properties of polypropylene ( PP ) by generating semi-crystalline materials having 0-60 % crystallinity . the purpose of the present study was to investigate such low crystalline elastomeric polypropylene ( ePP ) samples in order to compile further information on their crystal structure and the related phase transitions in the temperature range of 298-423 K . calorimetric and stress strain measurements of mentioned ePP in comparison with high crystalline PP ( xc = <nUm> % ) confirms the new class of low crystalline PPs . these polymers combine the properties of a thermoplast , like excellent processability and ductility using heat , with those of elastomers . temperature dependant WAXS investigations were carried out to determine crystallinity , crystalline structure , crystal modifications and crystal size in the temperature range from <nUm> to <nUm> K . As a function of temperature , apparent a- and g-crystalline modifications were correlated and discussed concerning the phase transitions observed calorimetrically . the presented study includes calorimetric , tensile and x-ray scattering measurements of five metallocene PPs with crystallinities of <nUm> % , <nUm> % , <nUm> % , <nUm> % and <nUm> % .

NMR analysis of the end groups further confirmed that styrene polymerization catalyzed by anilido-imino nickel complexes / MAO systems proceeded through a coordination mechanism , and the chain was initiated through styrene secondary insertion into the ni{single bond}H and terminated mainly through b-H elimination of styrene producing the chain - end group ( { single bond}CH{double bond , long}CHPh ) . 
two hetero - atom containing bridged dinuclear metallocene complexes , (CpMCl2)2(C5H4CH2CH2OCH2CH2C5H4) [ m = Ti ( 1 ) , Zr ( 2 ) ] , have been synthesized by treating the disodium salt of the corresponding ligand C14H18O with two equivalents of CpTiCl3 and CpZrCl3 · DME , respectively , in THF at <nUm> ° C and characterized by 1H- and 13C - NMR , MS and IR spectroscopy . homogenous ethylene polymerization by those complexes has been conducted systematically in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the influences of reaction parameters , such as [MAO] / [Cat] molar ratio , catalyst concentration , ethylene pressure , temperature and time , have been studied in detail . the catalytic activities of the dinuclear complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were higher than those of (MeCpTiCl2)2(C5H4CH2C6H4CH2C5H4) ( 3 ) , (CpZrCl2)2(C5H4CH2C6H4CH2C5H4) ( 4 ) and the mononuclear metallocenes Cp2TiCl2 and Cp2ZrCl2 , respectively . complex <nUm> showed high catalytic activity at high temperature ( 50-100 ° C ) and high pressure ( <nUm> bar ) . the molecular weight distributions of polyethylene produced by <nUm> and <nUm> ( MWD = <nUm> and <nUm> ) were broader than those using the corresponding mononuclear metallocenes ( MWD = <nUm> and <nUm> ) . the melting points of the polyethylene produced ranged from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C , indicating a high linearity and a high crystallinity . 
new metallocene catalysts applied to propylene polymerization expand the range of properties of polypropylene ( PP ) , resulting in semi-crystalline materials having crystallinities below <nUm> % up to x-ray amorphous highly elastic ones . to date the origin of the unique elastic mechanical behavior of such low crystalline PP is not completely understood . therefore , the microscopic orientation of those PPs due to uniaxial stretching was investigated using wide - ( WAXS ) and small - angle x-ray scattering ( SAXS ) . the aim of this study was to correlate these orientations or changes in the developed fiber textures with the macroscopic stress - strain behavior . this includes efforts to come closer to the main question of the nature of the physical cross-links in these not chemical cross-linked homopolymers , which is the reason for the high elastic behavior . therefore , high molecular weight metallocene PPs showing different crystallinities ( 0-36 % ) were stretched to several elongations and the structural changes during the deformation were recorded by x-ray scattering . stress - strain measurements show the great potential of these PPs as a thermoplastic rubber material . for quantitative analysis and discussion of the polymer chain orientations , the orientation functions were calculated . correlations between the orientation functions and the stress - strain curves allow an interpretation of the macroscopic behavior on a microscopic scale . A higher cross-linking density in elongated samples indicates that the network , which is responsible for the elasticity , mainly built up by strain - induced morphology changes and chain orientations . 
1-n-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroaluminate ( [BMIM]+[AlCl4]- ) was applied to biphasic ionic liquid / hexane ethylene polymerisation as a medium of the Cp2TiCl2 titanocene catalyst activated by alkylaluminium compounds ( MAO , AlEt2Cl , AlEt3 ) . the best results were obtained using AlEt2Cl . the results show that catalyst recycling , higher ethylene pressure , and greater Al / Ti molar ratio along with a greater volume of the ionic liquid phase enhance catalyst activity . the polyethylene gathered from the hexane phase is characterised primarily by its high purity . its physical properties remain polyethylene obtained over a heterogeneous metallocene catalyst . thus , biphasic ionic liquid polymerisation using a metallocene catalyst is possible and offers interesting technological implications .

GPC spectra show that polyethylene produced by complexes <nUm> and <nUm> has a broad and even bimodal molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) . 
A systematic analysis was performed on a series of 1-n-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroaluminates ( where alkyl = ethyl , butyl , hexyl , and octyl ) , applied as a medium of the Cp2TiCl2 titanocene catalyst , to evaluate the influence of the physical properties of the ionic liquids on the polymerisation reaction carried out in the biphasic ionic liquid / hexane mode . two alkylaluminium compounds , AlEtCl2 and AlEt2Cl , were used as activators . the influence of the activator / catalyst molar ratio on the performance of the ethylene polymerisation was determined for each ionic liquid studied . the best results were obtained using 1-n-octyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroaluminate . for the titanocene catalyst immobilised in the ionic liquid , AlEtCl2 turned out to be a better activator than AlEt2Cl in our studies . the properties of the polyethylene product have also been presented . 
the dinuclear titanium p-tert-butylthiacalix[4]arene complexes <nUm> and <nUm> after activation with methylaluminoxane have been tested as homogeneous catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene . the results show that the catalytic activity of <nUm> , although still poor , is higher than those of the related mononuclear titanium complexes bearing calix[4]arene as ligand . the molecular weight of the polyethylene produced are high ( MW up to <nUm> × <nUm> dalton ) with broad molecular weight distribution . the polyethylenes have high melting point ( 133-142 ° C ) indicating a linear polymer microstructure which was confirmed by 13C NMR analysis .

A combination of the first complex and MAO forms a single - center catalyst which polymerizes propylene to a nearly perfectly atactic polymer . A combination of the second complex and MAO forms a multi-center catalyst system producing polymer mixtures with broad molecular weight distributions containing five to six flory components with different average molecular weights . relative contents of the flory components strongly depend on the type of solvent in the polymerization reactions . some of the active centers produce high molecular weight , highly isotactic crystalline material with the melting point over <nUm> ° C . the nature of steric errors in these polymer fractions ( determined by 13C NMR ) can be explained by a variant of stereocontrol similar to that exerted by metallocene catalysts of the C1 symmetry .

A series of pyridinium salts were synthesized and investigated as new dyes for photoinitiating systems of polymerization . they exhibit a strong absorption at about <nUm> nm well matching with the visible light emission of different convenient visible light sources . interestingly , very soft irradiation ( halogen lamp ) as well as laser diode exposure ( <nUm> and <nUm> nm ) can be used . when employed in the presence of a silane and an iodonium salt , they efficiently initiate the free radical polymerization of acrylates and free radical promoted cationic polymerization of epoxides . an acrylate / epoxide blend is also easily polymerized i.e. for the synthesis of interpenetrating polymer networks . In combination with amine , the proposed dyes can also initiate free radical polymerizations . the mechanisms analyzed by ESR and photolysis experiments are discussed for the different multi-component initiating systems .

novel nickel based FI catalysts with different ligands from well known salicylaldehyde imine ligand , to naphthoxy-imine ligand were designed , synthesized , and characterized . the effect of synthesized ligand on ethylene polymerization was investigated . extensive experimentations have been carried out using the nickel catalysts after activation with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) to study the ethylene polymerization behavior of the prepared catalysts comparably . substituents on the arene moiety and / or the backbone of the ligand influence the activities of the active sites of the catalyst during the polymerization . therefore , not only polymerization behavior varied , but also versatile products regarding molecular weight , crystallinity and melting point were obtained . the crystallinities and melting points of the polymer obtained at the temperatures of <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> ° C were <nUm> % , <nUm> % , and <nUm> % and <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> ° C respectively . 
In the polymerisation of DPB , it was critical to use a mixed solvent of cyclohexane with a small amount of THF to attain high solubility . since DPB polymerized exclusively in 1,4-addition manner , the resulting block copolymers were readily transformed into the regioblock PS by hydrogenation of the residual double bonds in the main chain . the structure of the regioblock PS thus synthesized were confirmed by carefully characterizing with GPC , 1H NMR , 13C NMR , UV – vis and raman spectra . 
the molecular structures of the representative complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were confirmed by single - crystal x-ray diffraction , and revealed distorted octahedral geometry at Ti and tetragonal pyramid in V complex . titanium - based catalytic systems were found to be active in the ethylene and 1-hexene polymerization and copolymerization , but only in the presence of a binary co-catalyst Et2AlCl / Bu2Mg . vanadium - based systems were active in the same reactions in the presence of Et3Al2Cl3 or Et2AlCl mixed with CCl3CO2Et reactivator . the amount of co-monomer incorporated by these systems have reached <nUm> mol % . when applied in the presence of aliphatic solvents vanadium complexes catalyze 1-hexene oligomerization yielding dimers and trimers . when the same process is carried out in toluene , the solvent got alkylated by monomers and light oligomers ( friedel – crafts reaction ) . 
x-ray diffraction analysis revealed that complexes 1a , 4a , and 2b adopted square - pyramidal geometry , trigonal bipyramid , and distorted square - planar geometry , respectively . activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , all the complexes were highly active for norbornene polymerization in a vinyl addition fashion , affording high molecular weight polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions . the activities of palladium complexes are particularly notable ; the highest activity reached <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> g PNB ( mol of Ni ) − <nUm> h − <nUm> . the activities of the complexes were affected by the ligand structure as well as the reaction parameters such as polymerization temperature , time , and cocatalyst loading . 
the influence of the kind of the catalyst and polyreaction conditions on the performance of copolymerization as well as on the properties of the copolymers was studied . depending on polyreaction parameters , the DDSQ contents in the copolymer varied in the range of <nUm> – <nUm> wt % which determined the compositions and the structural properties of copolymers . DDSQ incorporated into the polymer chain could constitute pendant groups in the main chain or it could act as a cross-linking agent . the ethylene / DDSQ copolymers also had different kinds and contents of unsaturated end groups and they offered interesting morphological and thermal properties including various glass transition temperatures as well as melting and crystallization behaviours . 
we used it to obtain a dimethylated version of poly(caprolactone) ( PdmCL ) from dimethylated MDO ( DMMDO ) . first , we revisited monomer synthesis and achieved a milder synthetic protocol by introducing a cobalt - based catalyst . we also developed a new route towards DMMDO via a cyclic carbonate using the petasis chemistry . amphiphilic block - copolymers were then generated by free radical polymerization of DMMDO with a PEG - based macroinitiator . the resulting polyesters self - assembled into nanoparticles that were biodegradable as well as biocompatible . the nanoparticles proved to be an effective protective shell for an entrapped enzyme that was released upon degradation of the polyester by esterase . we are confident that our results will spur further research into block - copolymers resulting from RROP .

In combination with excess of benzhydrol , these complexes could catalyze immortal ring opening polymerization ( ROP ) of e-caprolactone and rac - lactide , and benzhydrol served as co-initiator and chain transfer agents simultaneously , which afforded polymer esters with well - controlled molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions . end - functionalized polyester could be also accessed if functionalized benzhydrols were employed as chain transfer agents .

GPC results demonstrate that <nUm> and <nUm> yield PE with a broad / bimodal molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) . In contrast , <nUm> and <nUm> yield PE with relatively narrow and unimodal MWD ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) . elevating the temperature and Al / Fe molar ratio will narrow the MWD of PE . V .

A comparison with the behavior observed for related polymetallic dendrimers has enabled the dendritic features that affect various catalytic parameters to be determined . thus , it has been possible to discern whether the dendritic effect detected in the catalysis should be ascribed to the metallic nuclearity rather than the bulkiness of the metallodendrimer .

V.Three bulky cyclopentadienyltitanium aryloxide complexes , [Ti(e5-C5Me4Ar)(O-2,6-tBu2C6H3)Cl2] , ( Ar = C6H5(4) , 4-iPrC6H4(5) , 4-Me3SiC6H4(6) ) have been synthesized from reaction of the corresponding cyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride derivatives with <nUm> equiv of LiO-2,6-tBu2C6H3 . these half - sandwich complexes 4-6 have been characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy . the molecular structure of complexes <nUm> and <nUm> has been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies . when activated with iBu3Al and Ph3C+B(C6F5)4- , complexes 4-6 exhibits reasonable catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization , producing moderate molecular weight polyethylenes . 
V.Nine bis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride complexes of the type [ C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > -(CH < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) < inf > n < / inf > -O-Ar ] < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ClZr < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ( n = 3-5 ; Ar = ph , t-Bu-Ph ) were synthesized , characterized , activated with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) and tested for ethylene polymerization . structure-property-relationship studies showed that the activities of the catalysts depend on the length of the bridging chain between the indenyl and the phenoxy group as well as on the bulk at the phenoxy substituent . A t-Bu substituent at the ortho position of the phenoxy group ( 5a / MAO ) gives a much higher catalyst activity ( <nUm> kg PE / mol cat h ) than the isomer 8a / MAO with a t-Bu substituent at the para position of the phenoxy group ( <nUm> kg PE / mol cat h ) . obviously substituents in the ortho position of the phenyl ring generate a bulkier catalyst cation and this can keep the MAO anion at a further distance to allow easier ethylene coordination and chain growth in the polymerization steps . the mono substituted bis(indenyl) complex ( C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > )[C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > -(CH < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > -O-4-t-Bu]ZrCl < inf > <nUm> < / inf > shows lower activity ( <nUm> kg PE / mol cat h ) than 8a indicating that the electronic effect is dominating in this type of catalysts .

v.copy ; A series of 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) loaded core / shell electrospun fibers is reported . the fibers have shells made of eudragit S100 ( ES - <nUm> ) , and drug - loaded cores comprising poly(vinylpyrrolidone) , ethyl cellulose , ES - <nUm> , or drug alone . monolithic 5-FU loaded ES - <nUm> fibers were also prepared for comparison . electron microscopy showed all the fibers to have smooth cylindrical shapes , and clear core - shell structures were visible for all samples except the monolithic fibers . 5-FU was present in the amorphous physical form in all the materials prepared . dissolution studies showed that the ES - <nUm> shell was not able to prevent drug release at pH <nUm> , even though the polymer is completely insoluble at this pH : around 30-80 % of the maximum drug release was reached after <nUm> h immersion at pH <nUm> . these observations are ascribed to the low molecular weight of 5-FU permitting it to diffuse through pores in the ES - <nUm> coating , and the relatively high acid solubility of the drug providing a thermodynamic impetus for this to happen . In addition , the fibers were observed to be broken or merged following <nUm> h at pH <nUm> , giving additional escape routes for the 5-FU .

zirconocene catalyst was heterogenized inside an organosilane - modified montmorillonite ( MMT ) pretreated by calcination and acidization , for supported catalyst systems with well - spaced a-olefin polymerization active centers . the varied pretreatment and modification conditions of montmorillonite are efficient for supported zirconocene catalysts in control of polyethylene microstructures , in particular , molecular weight distribution . In contrast to other supported catalyst systems , Cp2ZrCl2 / modified montmorillonite(MMT-7) - supported catalysts with a distinct interlayer structure catalyzed ethylene homopolymerization and copolymerization with 1-octene activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , resulting in polymers with a bimodal molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) . 
oligomeric cp < inf > <nUm> < / inf > Zr < sup > + < / sup > -allyl species were detected in reaction mixtures of either [ cp < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ZrMe][MeB(C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > F < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ] or [ cp < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ZrMe][B(C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > F < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ] with propylene by a combination of < sup > <nUm> < / sup > H NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionization ( tandem ) mass spectrometry techniques . conjointly , the data imply that formation of cp < inf > <nUm> < / inf > Zr < sup > + < / sup > -allyl species occurs via (re)coordination of alkene ( propylene and vinylidene end groups of unsaturated polymer chains , respectively ) to cp < inf > <nUm> < / inf > Zr < sup > + < / sup > r ( r = CH < inf > <nUm> < / inf > , H , polymeryl ) , followed by intramolecular proton transfer from cg to r and release of RH . analysis of the olefinic region of the < sup > <nUm> < / sup > H NMR spectra of the reaction mixture obtained from [ cp < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ZrMe][MeB(C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > F < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ] and propylene reveals the presence of a triplet resonance at δ ∼ <nUm> , which was attributed to the unprecedented 3-propenyl end group . A plausible mechanism for the origin of the 3-propenyl end groups is discussed . additionally , a mechanism for incorporation of stereodefects into stereoregular polymers is also discussed . the cationic cp < inf > <nUm> < / inf > Zr < sup > + < / sup > -allyl intermediates formed during polymerization may contribute to catalyst deactivation .

isospecific centers in propylene polymerization catalysts of the 4th generation [ combinations of solid catalysts of the Cl4Ti / aromatic diester / Cl2Mg composition and binary cocatalysts containing AlC6H15 and methoxysilanes RnSi(OCH3)4-n ] contain several populations of active centers , which differ in kinetic parameters and in the level of stereospecificity control . the differences in the kinetic parameters between the active centers translate into large differences in the average polymerization degree of the polymer material the centers produce , from 500-800 to 8000-17,000 . differences in the stereospecificity level between the active centers result in large differences in melting points of the polymer components . methoxysilanes RnSi(OCH3)4-n directly affect each type of the polymerization center ; both the kinetic parameters of the centers and their level of stereocontrol are influenced by the nature of the alkyl groups r . 
quantitative agreement between experimentally determined m – C bond dissociation energies ( BDE ) and DFT predictions ( M06-2X / TZ / / TPSSTPSS / DZ ) can be reached by choosing the correct anchor for experimentally derived BDE . for the example of the archetypical metallocene catalyst Cp2TiCl2 , it is shown that titanium – carbon bonds are very weak under polymerization conditions and fluctuate ; steric strain is introduced after <nUm> insertion and via olefin capture . thus , homolysis can become competitive with chain propagation . depending on the catalyst and temperature , <nUm> insertion can be only a temporary inconvenience ( dormancy ) or a definitive decay event . it is then shown for a set of nine common Ti and Zr polymerization catalysts how ligand variation affects the metal – carbon BDE . predicted stabilities of the M(IV) oxidation state with respect to homolysis are in nice agreement with the experimentally observed temperature tolerance of the various catalysts : homolysis is easier for Ti than for Zr , and cyclopentadienyl groups in particular facilitate homolysis , especially in bis-cyclopentadienyl systems . 
A series of monodisperse polynorbornene ( PNB ) chains bearing different contents of aryloxide ligands at their side chain were synthesized by grubbs ring - opening metathesis copolymerization between norbornene and 2-aryloxonorbornene . these PNB chains were employed as a soluble support for grafting half - titanocene complexes to afford structurally well - defined supported catalysts , where a pre-defined number of Ti centres was confined in a nano-sized random coil of PNB chains . extensive investigation in ethylene polymerization revealed unique catalytic features of these soluble polymer - supported catalysts , represented by a synergistic activity enhancement among multiple active centres confined in a random coil . the well - defined nature of these novel polymer - supported catalysts is powerful in studying interactions between active centres and supports as well as among active centres themselves in catalysis .

Cp2ZrCl2 was entrapped into dual - layered silica by two iterated nonhydrolytic sol - gel steps . silica was modified by Cl6W and organosilanes , which acted as potential lewis acid sites and active site spacers , respectively . for comparative reasons , entrapped (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 systems and one - layer W - containing systems were also synthesized . catalyst activity was evaluated in ethylene polymerization , with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as the cocatalyst . dual - shell systems have shown greater resistance than grafted ones when exposed to air . the presence of lewis acid centers ( W ) on the support improves contaminant tolerance . ATR experiments indicate that tungsten oxides increase acetone adsorption onto the silica surface . GPC measurements show polyethylene low mass fraction reduction , which suggests that ketones preferably deactivate this specific site of polyolefin production . the polymer polydispersity index is broadened in dual - shell systems , such as that containing one silica layer modified with Me-Si , and another with C8-Si moieties containing two different metallocenes ( nonsubstituted and alkyl-substituted ) .

A model for drug release from a polymeric fibrous scaffold , which takes into account the distribution of fiber diameters within its structure , is developed here . it is demonstrated that the fiber diameter distribution significantly affects the drug release profile from electrospun scaffolds . the developed model indicates that altering the fiber distribution can be used as an additional tool to achieve an appropriate drug release profile . using published data , it was demonstrated that an application of the model allows a more precise calculation of the drug diffusion coefficient within the polymer , which is important for predicting drug release rates from fabricated materials . 
V . one of the most actively developing fields in modern medicine is controlled drug delivery , an ability to keep optimal concentration of a drug at the desired body location . In particular , the most attention for potential use as drug delivery vehicles is drawn towards biodegradable polymeric materials . this is due to the versatility of tools for their fabrication , as well as due to the need to extract them after implantation being eliminated . In order to enhance polymer characteristics in terms of biocompatibility their surface can be functionalized . plasma treatment is a method for the modification of material surface properties , which spans a wide range of applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine . the main advantage of this method is its ability to modify a polymeric surface without altering the bulk properties of materials , thus preserving original mechanical characteristics . moreover , plasma modification is well - known for its speed , excluded need for solvents , and scalability . recently , this approach has been gaining popularity for drug delivery applications . the applications of plasma treatment during the fabrication of drug delivery vehicles include surface activation , enhanced wettability , the fabrication of hydrophobic barrier layer , induced cross-linking and improved drug loading . this review covers the variety of approaches , applied to different polymeric biomaterials , including non-woven meshes , films , microparticles , microneedles and tablets , in order to achieve a controlled drug release . the applications of drug delivery devices with an implemented plasma treatment modification are also described .

In this review , we mainly introduce the basic principles of electrospinning , and the mechanisms and applications of electrospun micro / nanofibers for delivery of small molecule drugs , proteins , and nucleic acids in the healthcare field . 
A series of previously reported homoleptic and non-homoleptic N,N-dialkylcarbamates of a range of non precious metals and N,N-dialkylcarbamate of Al (III) were investigated as easily available and inexpensive catalysts in the solventless synthesis of propylene carbonate ( PC ) from propylene oxide ( PO ) and CO2 . by operating at atmospheric CO2 pressure at ambient temperature , excellent results were achieved using Ti(O2CNEt2)4 , Al(O2CNR2)3 ( r = et , iPr ) , Cu(O2CNEt2)2 and Sn(O2CNEt2)4 , in combination with NBu4X ( x = Br or Cl ) as a co-catalyst . the reactions of MCl2(O2CNEt2)2 ( m = Ti , Zr ) with amorphous silica were straightforward through partial release of both chlorido and carbamato ligands , and readily afforded solid materials which were characterized by ICP - OES and EDS analyses , coupled to SEM . these heterogeneous catalytic systems revealed less efficient than the homogeneous counterparts . 
the electropolymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene ( EDOTh ) on platinum , under both potentiostatic and potentiodynamic control , has been analysed by electrochemical and ellipsometric measurements , simultaneously recorded . the experimental procedure for the acquisition of ellipsometric data , developed to follow the electrode surface modification along the whole process , allowed to collect information on the evolution of the polymer film properties with time and also as function of the electrode potential . A two - homogeneous phase model has been successfully used to describe the ellipsometric experimental parameters enabling to obtain from the azimuth angle ψ and phase shift δ , simultaneously the thickness and the complex refractive index of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) ( PEDOTh ) films at different growth stages and at various doping levels . since both electropolymerization methods originate two - layered films , the calculated optical parameters ( for the inner and outer layers ) are an adequate basis of analysis which have been used in the interpretation of the structural modifications occurring during the growth of PEDOTh films ( up to a thickness of about <nUm> nm ) as well as of those induced by the electrode potential , during and after the redox conversion of polymer films with different thicknesses . V . 
loss of electroactive dopants from conducting polymers ( CPs ) was investigated by electrochemical quartz crystal microgravimetry ( EQCM ) . pPy[ABTS] , polypyrrole doped with ABTS ( 2,2'-azino-bis(3- ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate ) , was used as a model system . two different kinds of electrolytes were used for studying the loss of dopants under electrochemical stimuli : one is a solvent to dissolve the dopant ( dopant - philic ) while the dopant is insoluble in the other ( dopant - phobic ) . degradation of polypyrrole backbone as well as loss of the dopant from pPy[ABTS] was observed in the dopant - philic electrolyte . severe chemical overoxidation of polypyrrole by the most oxidized state of ABTS {(ABTS2+)2-} was emphasized as a factor responsible for de-doping in addition to potential - driven overoxidation or ion exchange . In the dopant - phobic electrolyte , however , the chemical degradation of the polymer film was suppressed . V . 
proposed synthesis route is oriented towards hybrid materials , in which inorganic nanoparticles are distributed mostly inside the film of a polymer with conjugated chain far away from its external surface in contact with solution . its principal idea is to perform the electrodeposition of these particles from a solute precursor in conditions where the electronic transport across the film is so slow that it represents a rate - determining step of the process and the reduction of precursor molecules takes place deeply inside the pores of the film . such situation is realized in conjugated polymers functionalized by pendant redox - active centers , if the deposition process occurs in the potential range of their redox activity . important advantage of this procedure consists in the absence of any additional surface - active or stabilizing agent which has to be used if the nanoparticles are incorporated into the growing film from their solubilized colloidal solution . sizes of these particles may be varied in a controllable manner by the duration of the process and other parameters of the system . this approach has been successfully realized for deposition of silver nanoparticles inside the polymer with polypyrrole matrix and titanocene dichloride ( Cl2Tc ) complex attached to each monomer unit , poly(titanocene-propyl-pyrrole) , p(Tc3Py) . redox transformation of these Cl2Tc centers in contact with acetonitrile ( AN ) solution takes place in the negative potential range ( starting at about <nUm> V vs. Ag / <nUm> m Ag + in AN ) separated from the interval of the matrix conductivity by broad non-electroactivity potential range . to prevent the reduction of silver cation in the range of the polymer conductivity , i.e. to shift the silver deposition potential strongly in the negative direction , <nUm> m TEACl solution in AN was used as electrolyte in addition to silver cation . excess of chloride ions results in complete transformation of solute silver into soluble complex anion , AgCl2- , whose reduction wave at the polymer - coated electrode overlaps with the wave due to reduction of pendant Cl2Tc centers . presence of chloride anions in solution results also in reversible type of the redox transformation of titanium , Ti(IV) / Ti (III) , inside Cl2Tc complexes , that is a prerequisite for the electronic transport across the film via hopping mechanism . process of AgCl2- complex ion electroreduction at the p(Tc3Py) modified electrode has been studied by means of electrochemical methods and EQCM . synthesized composite material : electroactive polymer - nanoparticles has been characterized by SEM - EDX , AFM and TEM-SAED-EDS . nanoparticles are composed of ag(0) , their crystallography demonstrating the bulk - metal fcc state and the one with fivefold symmetry ( isohedral structure ) . V . 
experimental results for the ageing of polyaniline films of different thicknesses in <nUm> m H2O4S are presented . the ageing process was monitored by measuring the changes in the voltammetric response . the relation between the changes in the voltammetric peak parameters and the extent of the ageing process is analyzed employing a formal representation of the anodic voltammetric wave . the model considers a contribution of capacitive current together with an electrochemically reversible faradaic process , with interactions between the redox centres . the analysis shows that during the ageing process , only interaction energies between the reduced redox centres change and they become more attractive . also , it is shown that the extent of the ageing process may adequately be represented by the relative change of the voltammetric peak current . on the other hand , the change of the peak potential is not a direct measure of the extent of the ageing process . it is defined the so - called apparent number of exchanged electrons , nap , which shows the same ageing time dependence as the peak current does . the ageing process is interpreted by an elovich type of kinetic characterized by a pseudo zero order rate constant , k0 , and a parameter , β , that indicates how fast the activation free energy changes with the extent of the process . values of β and k0 are given for different polymer thicknesses . V . 
the electrochemically induced ageing of polyaniline films , as a function of the ageing potential , was investigated employing films of different thicknesses in <nUm> m H2O4S solutions . the ageing process was monitored by the change of the voltammetric response in a subsequent positive going potential scan after the ageing . it is observed that the ageing process , at more positive potentials , involves increasing amounts of non-reduced polymer . also , it is observed that the rate of ageing decreases as the ageing potential increases . the changes in the voltammetric response after ageing is interpreted through a model for the voltammetric response , previously developed , that includes capacitive currents and interactions between the redox centers . the analysis shows that neither the capacitive parameters nor the total faradaic charge change during the ageing . on the other hand , only the interaction energy between the reduced centers change during the ageing . this fact leads to a narrowing of the formal redox potential distribution that can be characterized by the apparent number of exchanged electrons . the decrease of the interaction energy between reduced centers is consistent with the reduction of the free energy of the polymer during the ageing . the kinetics of ageing is analyzed through an elovich type of equation from which k0 , the pseudo zero order rate constant and β , a parameter that indicates how fast the activation free energy changes with the extent of the process , can be obtained . V . 
V . electropolymerization of unsubstituted magnesium porphine in acetonitrile solutions possessing various proton - accepting properties has been studied . the overall rate of the polymer - product accumulation on the electrode surface has been established to be limited by the deprotonation step of intermediate species . this conclusion is based on the observed influence of proton - accepting additives , water or 2,6-dimethylpyridine ( lutidine ) , on the Mg - porphine electrooxidation process . lutidine addition into the polymerization bath enables one to enhance strongly the rate of the film growth and the efficiency of this process increases more than by a factor of two , redox , electric conductivity and spectral properties of thus obtained polyporphine films remaining unchanged , while this non-coordinating agent , lutidine , is not included inside such films . measurement of the electric resistance of magnesium polyporphine film obtained with lutidine addition has been carried out for its various redox states . correlation between the redox and electron - conductive properties of the polyporphine film for various potential ranges has been observed . 
hydroxyapatite nanoparticles ( HAP NPs ) are one of the widely used biocompatible materials . however , information about the reaction between HAP NPs and microorganisms is insufficient . this paper aims to understand the antibacterial property of a new nanocomposite consisting of gold - coated HAP and alginate polymer ( namely , Au - HAPatAlg NPs ) . to the best of our knowledge , we reported the first information regarding to MIC ( <nUm> mg / mL ) , DIZ ( no visible zone ) , and C50I ( <nUm> mg / mL ) of Au - HAPatAlg NPs toward the microorganism escherichia coli TOP10 . the real - time gene expression levels of polA , polB , cyd , mdoG , GAPDH , and 16S rRNA were maintained at stable levels up until conditions of <nUm> mg / mL Au - HAPatAlg NPs . the results showed that 16S rRNA can be a good reference under these conditions . the expressions of GAPDH , cyd , and mdoG were inhibited obviously under condition of <nUm> mg / mL of Au - HAPatAlg NPs . our results indicated that the possible antibacterial mechanism of Au - HAPatAlg was through the interaction with these carbohydrate and cell wall - related genes . this novel biocompatible and antibacterial material can potentially be applied in medical and environmental fields . V . 
In this present study , the linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) was synthesized via ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization with the zirconocene / MMAO catalyst by in situ impregnation of different silica ( OSi <nUm> ) supports . the OSi <nUm> supports used were small - pored ( SP ) and large - pored ( LP ) sizes with and without Ga modification . it was found that the SP - OSi <nUm> support exhibited higher polymerization activity ( ~ <nUm> times ) than that obtained from the LP - OSi <nUm> one . this can be attributed to the lower amount of MMAO being present inside the SP - OSi <nUm> support resulting in higher content of MMAO at the external surface . the higher activity in ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization was also found with the supported catalyst having Ga modification onto both SP - and LP - OSi <nUm> supports . the results demonstrated that the introduction of Ga may improve ability of supports to immobilize metallocene catalyst . based on 13C NMR measurement , it indicated that all synthesized polymers were typical LLDPE having random distribution of comonomer . 
four zirconium complexes containing fully deprotonated 2-(2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazol-2-yl)-4,6-di- tert-pentylphenol were used as catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene . In the presence of methylalumoxane ( MAO ) as a cocatalyst , the precursors were highly active for polyethylene with bimodal or multimodal molecular weight distribution .

Titanium(IV) oxide containing <nUm> % Mn as dopant was used as nanofillers . the influence of filler concentration , reaction temperature and pressure on the catalytic activity and polymer properties was investigated . there was a fourfold increase in the activity of zirconocene catalyst by addition of doped - titania . the morphology indicates that the doped - titania nanoparticles have a nucleus effect on the polymerization and caused a homogeneous PE shell around them . the optimum condition for polymerization was found to be <nUm> ° C . 
A new method was presented for preparing (co-)polyethylene with broad molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) and high molecular weight employed by the novel heterogeneous ziegler - natta catalysts via one - pot strategy . the preparation of these catalysts involved the introduction of alkoxy silane compounds as electron donors . the influences of the electron donors structure , as well as polymerization conditions such as temperature , molar ratio of Al / Ti , ethylene pressure and the concentration of 1-hexene in feed on the polymerization performance for ethylene (co-)polymerization , were investigated . the morphology of the catalyst particles was characterized by SEM and Ti content of these catalysts was characterized by ICP . the GPC results showed that the obtained homopolyethylene and ethylene / 1-hexene copolymer had the widest molecular weight distribution up to ca <nUm> when diethoxy-isopropoxy-(t-butoxy)-silane ( ED3 ) was used as internal electron donor . the 13C NMR and FT-IR analysis indicated that these catalysts efficiently catalyzed the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene . 
the copolymerization of MMA with ethylene was promoted by metallocene complex in the presence of initiator tetra(2,3-epoxy propoxy)silane ( is ) , reducing agent Zn and cocatalyst MAO , combining free radical polymerization with coordination polymerization via sequential monomer addition strategy in one - pot to produce 4-arms hydroxy-functionalized PMMA-b-PE . the effects of polymerization conditions such as temperature , time , ethylene pressure and Al / Ti molar ratio on the polymerization performance were investigated . 4-Arms hydroxy-functionalized PMMA-b-PE was obtained by solvent extraction and determined by GPC , MALLS , DSC , FT-IR , WAXD and 1H(13C) NMR . the DSC result indicated that the 4-arms hydroxy-functionalized PMMA-b-PE had one tg at <nUm> ° C and one Tm at <nUm> ° C which attributed to tg of PMMA segment and Tm of PE segment , respectively . the microstructure of 4-arms hydroxy-functionalized PMMA-b-PE was further confirmed by WAXD , FT-IR , and 13C NMR analysis . these results demonstrated that the obtained 4-arms block copolymer consisted of PMMA segment and crystalline PE segment . 
In the present study , the polymerization behaviors of ethylene-propylene ( EP ) copolymerization with a zirconocene / MAO catalyst upon the addition of a small amount of diene were investigated . it indicated that besides the addition of dienes , the polymerization behaviors were also dependent on the e / P ratios and types of diene . apparently , diene addition resulted in decreased activity , especially at high e / P ratio ( e / P = <nUm> ) . In all cases , the addition of <nUm> hexadiene ( <nUm> HD ) resulted in the lowest activities . it seemed that there was no significant change in the microstructure of EP elastomers upon different e / P ratios . the characteristics of polymer obtained by means of DSC and 13C NMR were further discussed in more detail .

the reaction of phenylalkyl substituted zirconocenedichloride complexes with two equivalents of n-butyllithium gives metallacyclic zirconocene complexes . In this reaction aromatic CH bonds can be activated in unbridged and bridged metallocenedichloride complexes even if the corresponding phenyl rings contain halogen substituents such as fluorine or chlorine . after the activation with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , all the metallocene complexes prove as attractive catalysts for ethylene polymerization reactions . because of their lewis basicity the halogen substituents fluorine or chlorine have a strong influence on the molecular weights of the produced polyethylenes . metallocene complexes with chloro substituents in the ortho positions of the phenyl rings produce bimodal polyethylenes . V . 
ethylene polymerization studies have been carried out with novel precatalysts of the type : [ ( e5-C13 H8)-X(t-BuOC6H12)Me-(e5- C5H4)]ZrCl2 [ x = C [1a] , Si [2a] ] , [ (e5-C13H8)-XMe2- ( e5-(t-BuOC6H12C5 H3 ) ) ] Cl2Zr [ x = C [3a] , Si [4a] ] in the presence of excess methylalumoxane ( MAO ) to compare their catalytic activity and to delineate the effect of the 6-t-butoxyhexyl functionality on ethylene polymerization . the precatalysts [1a] and [2a] with the bridge functionality showed higher activity in ethylene polymerization than the corresponding complexes [3a] and [4a] which have it on the cp ring moiety . on the other hand the silyl bridged complexes [2a] and [4a] produced a higher molecular weight polyethylene than the carbon - bridged one , regardless of the location of functional group .

In bulk polymerization , the difference of activities between RCpTi(OMe)3 / MAO and RCpTiF2 ( OMe ) / MAO systems became small , where complexes 2e and 3e exhibited remarkably higher activities compared with their solution polymerization activities . the maximum polymerization activities were found at the polymerization temperature of <nUm> ° C for most of the complexes . the influence of the polymerization time ( tP ) , polymerization temperature ( TP ) and Al / Ti ratio on the activities of complexes 2b and 3b were investigated . it was observed that the initial rate of propagation of complex 2b was higher than that of complex 3b and the highest activities of both catalysts were reached at the relatively low Al / Ti ratio of <nUm> and decrease for larger ratios .

the (butadiene)zirconocene system is characterized by the occurence of two isomers , (s-cis-)- and ( s-trans-e4-C4H 6-)ZrCp2 . out of this equilibrium , (butadiene)zirconocene has successfully been employed as a stoichiometric reagent in organic and organometallic synthesis and as a precursor for the generation of active homogeneous ziegler - natta catalyst systems .

the catalytic significance of immobilized , single - site , Ti IV - centered epoxidation catalysts , anchored , asymmetric , organometallic chiral diamino catalysts , encapsulated " ship - in - bottle " and bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts , has been highlighted for a number of industrially significant and economically viable catalytic reactions ranging from the epoxidation of fatty acid methyl esters , asymmetric hydrogenation of keto-carboxylic esters , oxidation of methane , oxyhalogenation of aromatics and single - step , solvent - free hydrogenation of polyenes . because of the availability of well - defined nanoporous silicas , possessing ( controllable ) pore diameters of <nUm> Å to ca. <nUm> Å , bulky organometallic species may be readily introduced on to the inner walls of these thermally stable , solid supports . four kinds of highly active catalysts that may be derived from the combination of these two materials are illustrated . first , starting from titanocene dichloride , single - site ITiV - centered epoxidation catalysts of exceptional activity may be formed . these are now used in the preparation of epoxy polymers and other products from naturally occurring methyl esters of fatty acids , a novel example of sustainable development . second , asymmetric organometallic species that exhibit good enantioselectivity as homogeneous catalysts ( in the hydrogenation of keto-esters , for example ) may be significantly improved in their catalytic performance when they are anchored to a concave silica surface , their ee values are boosted by the spatial restrictions imposed by the mesopores within which they are anchored . examples of three distinct diamino-complexes of Rh (I) are illustrated for the selective hydrogenations of methylbenzoylformate and e-a-phenylcinnamic acid . In the third kind of catalyst immobilized on nanoporous silica , several mixed - metal carbonylates are used as precursors . they are firmly anchored to the inner walls and may , by gentle calcining , be converted to bimetallic catalysts [ e.g. , PdRu , Ru 5Pt and PtRu5 ] that exhibit very high activity , under mild conditions , in the single - step , solvent - free hydrogenation of a range of economically important unsaturated compounds . the fourth category of immobilized , organometallics illustrated here is of the " ship - in - bottle " kind , where , typically , a chlorinated copper-phthalocyanine incarcerated within the cages of zeolite-X efficiently converts methane to methanol and also smoothly oxyhalogenates a range of aromatic compounds ( e.g. , benzene , phenol , toluene , aniline , anisole and resorcinol ) in air , again under mild conditions . the unconventional techniques , both in situ and ex situ , required to characterize all these immobilized catalysts are outlined .

the study of molybdocene dichloride and related metallocenes has been dominated by their remarkable catalytic properties in organic synthesis and polymer chemistry . interest in the aqueous , bioorganometallic chemistry of metallocene dihalides has stemmed from the potent antitumor properties of titanocene dichloride , including results from human clinical trials . this review will summarize key results reported in the last decade on the biological chemistry of molybdocene dichloride . the effect of concentration , pH and ionic strength on the rates of hydrolysis of both the cyclopentadienyl and halide ligands have established that the positively charged monoaquated species cp 2Mo(OH)(OH2)+ , in equilibrium with the dipositively charged dimer Cp2Mo(m-OH)2MoCp <nUm> , is present under physiological conditions . systematic studies of the coordination chemistry of Cp2MoCl2 with nucleobases , nucleotides , single - stranded and double - stranded oligonucleotides , and calf - thymus DNA have shown that while simultaneous phosphate(O) and heterocyclic(N) adducts are formed with nucleotides , negligible interaction with DNA occurs under physiological conditions . In contrast , Cp2MoCl <nUm> forms strong , non-labile complexes with deprotonated thiols in amino acids . molybdocene dichloride is able to catalyse the hydrolysis of activated phosphate esters under physiological conditions , but hydrolysis of unactivated phosphodiesters is only significant at pH <nUm> . limited antitumor activity results , inhibition studies with protein kinase C and topoisomerase II , structure - activity and cell - uptake studies have provided some insight into possible mechanisms of antitumor action .

the meso- and rac - like isomers of bis{e5-(1-benzyl)indenyl} zirconium dichloride ( 5 ) , bis{e5-(1-para-methoxybenzyl)indenyl} zirconium dichloride ( 6 ) , bis{e5-(1-para-fluoro-benzyl)indenyl} zirconium dichloride ( 7 ) and bis{e5-(1-phenylethyl)indenyl} zirconium dichloride ( 8 ) were synthesized and isolated . solid - state structures of meso- and rac - like <nUm> were determined by x-ray structure analysis . polymerization properties of the methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) activated diastereomers of complexes 5-8 were studied in ethene polymerizations under different monomer concentrations . the rac - like isomer of 1-phenylethyl-substituted <nUm> / MAO showed significantly higher activity than the 1-benzyl substituted analogs 5-7 / MAO . In addition , rac - <nUm> / MAO behaves like a single center catalyst producing polyethene with narrow molar mass distribution ( <nUm> - <nUm> ) , while diastereomers of 5-7 / MAO produce polymers with molar mass distributions varying from <nUm> up to <nUm> . the rac and meso-like isomers of 5-7 / MAO have different response on the monomer concentration . quantum chemical calculations suggest a strong interaction between the benzyl substituent and the electron deficient zirconium center . the phenyl metal coordination energies depend on the electronic properties of the para-substituent . In <nUm> / MAO , due to the ethyl spacer , the coordination does not have a significant role and therefore much higher activity and single center polymerization behavior is observed . V .

characteristics of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) polymerization using oscillating zirconocene catalysts , (2-Ph-Ind)2ZrX2 ( x = Cl , <nUm> ; x = me , <nUm> ) , mixtures of rac- and meso-zirconocene diastereomers , (SBI)ZrMe2 [ <nUm> , SBI = Me2Si(Ind)2 ] and (EBI)ZrMe2 [ <nUm> , EBI = C2H4(Ind)2 ] , as well as diastereospecific metallocene pairs , rac-4 / Cp2ZrMe <nUm> ( 5 ) and rac - <nUm> / CGCTiMe2 [ <nUm> , CGC = me 2Si(Me4C5)(t-BuN) ] , are reported . MMA polymerization using the chloride catalyst precursor <nUm> activated with a large excess of the modified methyl aluminoxane is sluggish , uncontrolled , and produces atactic PMMA . on the other hand , the polymerization by a <nUm> / <nUm> ratio of <nUm> / BC18F15 or <nUm> / Ph3CB(C 6F5)4 is controlled and produces syndiotactic PMMA . mixtures of diastereomeric ansa - zirconocenes <nUm> or <nUm> containing various rac / meso ratios , when activated with BC18F15 , yield bimodal PMMA ; this behavior is attributed to the meso-diastereomer that , in its pure form , affords bimodal , syndio-rich atactic PMMA . for MMA polymerization using diastereospecific metallocene pairs , rac - <nUm> / <nUm> and rac - <nUm> / <nUm> , the isospecific catalyst site dominates the polymerization events under the conditions employed in this study , and the aspecific and syndiospecific sites are largely nonproductive , thereby forming only highly isotactic PMMA .

In particular , a high melting point ( <nUm> ° C for 5a and <nUm> ° C for 5b ) was observed with the bis-tetrahydroazulenyl system , although the activities by these hafnocenes were lower than those by the corresponding zirconocenes .

treatment of aminoferrocene with substituted 2-hydroxybenzaldehydes yields the air- and moisture - stable ligands 1-4 , which were then reacted to form the chromium dichloride complexes 5-7 and the nickel bis-chelate species <nUm> and <nUm> . the metal compounds are very air - sensitive but the chromium compounds act as pre-catalysts for the polymerisation of ethylene . reaction of 1,1'-bis(amino)ferrocene with similarly substituted 2-hydroxybenzaldehyes or simple benzaldehyde gives the ligands 10-12 and <nUm> , respectively . the x-ray crystal structure of <nUm> shows the molecule to have non-crystallographic C <nUm> symmetry and to be linked by C-H ... π interactions between the anthracene rings . titanium - containing complexes 13-16 can be formed utilising ligands 10-12 and there is a change in geometry within the complexes dependent on the adjacent co-ligands , whilst ligand <nUm> can be reacted with PdClMe(COD) to form the chelate complex <nUm> . cyclic voltammetric studies have been carried out on <nUm> and its oxidised analogue <nUm> , but both complexes are inactive towards ethylene polymerisation .

metallocene alkyl cations for polymerization of olefins possess two active sites involved in migratory insertion . site epimerization , with an inversion at the metal atom , is considered to be one of the major causes for break - down of the alternating propagation model , resulting in stereoerrors whenever the two catalytic sites have substantially different enantioface selectivities . density functional theory has been used to determine the intrinsic reaction coordinate that connects the optimized minima and transition states of inversion in the parent ansa - zirconocene [{H2C(Cp)2}Zr-Pr]+ ( Pr = n-propyl ) . these calculations yield a three - step reaction path for site epimerization . starting from the pyramidal b-agostic complex , an activated rotation around the Zr-Pr bond first produces an a-agostic conformation . continued rotation leads to an equivalent second a-agostic intermediate and then finally to the inverted b-agostic complex . the second step is rate - determining and proceeds through a planar three - coordinate transition state . In the case of [{H2C(Cp)2}Zr-iBu]+ ( iBu = iso-butyl ) , the situation is more complicated , because there are several interconvertible a- , b- and g-agostic intermediates , but the rate - limiting step is again an inversion process connecting two different a-agostic conformers with the alkyl group on opposite enantiosides . for both ansa - zirconocene catalysts , the computed free - energy barriers for epimerization are around 11-12 kcal / mol and almost independent of temperature , while those for insertion increase with temperature due to the entropic cost of association . according to the computational results for the isolated catalysts , insertion remains favored over epimerization for the experimentally relevant temperature range in the n-propyl case , whereas both processes are competitive in the iso-butyl case . inclusion of bulk solvent effects by a continuum solvation model does not affect the results much , while explicit consideration of a coordinating counterion causes larger changes . the present model calculations on the role of site epimerization should thus be most relevant for propene polymerization with non-coordinating counterions .

the role of titanium oxidation states in olefin polymerization activity for ziegler - natta ( ZN ) catalyst has been investigated using density functional calculations at B3LYP / LANL2DZ as well as extended LANL2DZ basis that includes diffuse and polarization functions for C , H and Cl . using the simple [TiCl2CH3]n ( n = + <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) model catalyst systems , we could rationalize some of the well - known experimental facts with varying Ti oxidation states ( + <nUm> , + <nUm> , + <nUm> ) in the real ZN systems . firstly , irrespective of Ti oxidation states , the activation barriers ( eact ) for ethylene and syn propylene insertion in Ti - CH3 bond are comparable in accordance with experimental and modeling studies . secondly , it was observed that Ti(IV) catalyst has the lowest eact which progressively increase in the order Ti(IV) < Ti (III) < Ti (II) high spin < Ti (II) low spin catalysts in line with experimental and several modeling results . the effect of solvation on olefin insertion barriers are seen more prominent in case of Ti(IV) systems compared to other oxidation states .

In this account we present the synthesis , characterization and catalytic activity in the polymerization of propylene of a bis(dimethyl malonate ) titanium bis(diethylamine) complex ( 1 ) . the complex exhibits in solution a dynamical isomerization following an internal bailar twist . the activation of complex <nUm> was obtained by its reaction with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) . the activated complex in solution shows a different dynamic process involving an equilibrium between a monodentate e1 and bidentate e2 binding of the dimethylmalonate ligand to the metal center . this equilibrium is responsible for the formation of , at least , two active species for the polymerization reaction bearing major symmetry differences . the monodentate coordination ( opened form ) of the ligand was found to be the major form of the active species of the complex when activated with MAO , most probably due to a strong interaction of the oxygen atoms in the ligand with the strong lewis acid co-catalyst . the active species in the polymerization were studied by NMR and ESR spectroscopies . the resulting polypropylene showed elastomeric properties with low tacticites .

zirconium and titanium bis(benzamidinate) dimethyl complexes were found to be active catalytic precursors for the oligomerization of mono- and bis-substituted silanes . the activation of such complexes , by an excess of MAO or by an equimolar amount of BC18F15 , increases the catalytic activity of the complexes and the molecular weight of the obtained oligosilanes . the maximum polymerization index that was accomplished ( n = <nUm> ) is by far the largest obtained with other organometallic complexes . In addition , the activated benzamidinate catalysts were also found to be active for the polymerization of 1,5-hexadiene producing poly(methyl-1,3-cyclopentane) . for the latter , the results obtained with C2 - symmetry bis(benzamidinate) dimethyl complexes were compared with a chiral complex bearing a myrtanyl group at the benzamidinate ligand .

Cp2TiCl is the first example of a single electron transfer ( SET ) agent that both provides initiating radicals from three different types of functionalities ( i.e. radical ring opening of epoxides and reduction of aldehydes and peroxides ) and doubles as mediator for the living radical polymerization of styrene ( st ) by reversibly endcapping the growing polymer chains . an initiator ( I ) comparison was performed using 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether ( BDE ) , benzaldehyde ( BA ) and benzoyl peroxide ( BPO ) as models . the investigation of the effect of reaction variables was carried out over a wide range of experimental conditions ( [Cp2TiCl2] / [I] = <nUm> / 1-4 / <nUm> ; [Zn] / [Cp2TiCl2] = <nUm> / 1-3 / <nUm> , [St] / [I] = <nUm> / 1-400 / <nUm> and T = 60-130 ° C ) to reveal living polymerization features such as a linear dependence of molecular weight on conversion and narrow molecular weight distribution ( mw / Mn ) for each initiator class . however , progressively lower polydispersities and larger initiator efficiencies are obtained with increasing the [Cp2TiCl2] / [I] and [Zn] / [Cp2TiCl2] ratios and with decreasing temperature . accordingly , optimum conditions correspond to [St] / [I] / [Cp2TiCl2] / [Zn] = [50-200] / [1] / [2-3] / [4-6] at 70-90 ° C . by contrast to peroxides , aldehydes and the more reactive epoxides provide alcohol end groups useful in block or graft copolymers synthesis .

drastic effects of lewis acids E(C6F5)3 ( e = Al , B ) on polymerization of functionalized alkenes such as methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) and N,N-dimethyl acrylamide ( DMAA ) mediated by metallocene and lithium ester enolates , Cp2Zr[OC(OiPr){double bond , long}CMe2]2 ( 1 ) and Me2C{double bond , long}C(OiPr)OLi , are documented as well as elucidated . In the case of metallocene bis(ester enolate ) <nUm> , when combined with <nUm> equiv. of AlC18F15 , it effects highly active ion - pairing polymerization of MMA and DMAA ; the living nature of this polymerization system allows for the synthesis of well - defined diblock and triblock copolymers of MMA with longer - chain alkyl methacrylates . In sharp contrast , the <nUm> / 2B(C6F5)3 combination exhibits low to negligible polymerization activity due to the formation of ineffective adduct Cp2Zr[OC(OiPr){double bond , long}CMe2]+[O{double bond , long}C(OiPr)CMe2B(C6F5)3]- ( 2 ) . such a profound Al vs. B lewis acid effect has also been observed for the lithium ester enolate ; while the Me2C{double bond , long}C(OiPr)OLi / 2Al(C6F5)3 system is highly active for MMA polymerization , the seemingly analogous Me2C{double bond , long}C(OiPr)OLi / 2B(C6F5)3 system is inactive . structure analyses of the resulting lithium enolaluminate and enolborate adducts , Li+[Me2C{double bond , long}C(OiPr)OAl(C6F5)3]- ( 3 ) and Li+[Me2C{double bond , long}C(OiPr)OB(C6F5)3]- ( 4 ) , coupled with polymerization studies , show that the remarkable differences observed for Al vs. B are due to the inability of the lithium enolborate / borane pair to effect the bimolecular , activated - monomer anionic polymerization as does the lithium enolaluminate / alane pair .

V.This work is devoted to the DFT study of the activation effect of metal chlorides ( Cl2Mg , ClLi , Cl2Zn , CaCl2 ) in ethylene polymerization reactions on post-titanocene complexes LTi(Y)Cl ( 1 ) , where L is the bidentate saligenin type ligand , Y is alkyl group or Cl . the activation effect of metal chlorides is caused by secondary complexation reactions between <nUm> and metal chlorides . In accordance with previously reported experimental data , our DFT calculations predict that the most probable catalytic particles in the systems based on Cl2Mg possess higher reactivity with respect to ethylene molecule than in the systems based on ClLi . one could expect a higher catalytic activity for CaCl2 than for Cl2Mg , but for Cl2Zn the catalytic activity should be the lowest . results of our calculations show that at least three different hetero - trinuclear compounds of Ti , Mg and Al have similar reactivity towards ethylene molecule . this result explains mw / Mn indexes > <nUm> measured earlier for one of the systems under the study with R3Al ( r = me , t-Bu ) as activators .

(E)-N-(1-(pyridin-2-yl)ethylidene)-2-(trifluoromethyl)aniline Ni complex supported on silica - alumina affords polyethylene with higher molecular weights , broader molecular weight distribution , and lower level of branching than the homogeneous catalyst . 
V . theoretical study on the propylene polymerization using ansa-dimethylsilylene(fluorenyl)(amido)dimethyltitanium complexes were performed and related to the experimental results . the calculated activation energies for coordination - insertion of propylene via four different conformations after the first monomer insertion showed that propylene coordinates to the titanium center avoiding the steric repulsion of polymer chain , which was placed toward the amido group . the bulkiness of the amido groups was closely related to the frequency of the chain - migration without monomer insertion , probably because the bulky amido group would force the fluorenyl ligand to coordinate to the titanium center in e1-manner . these theoretical results well explained the experimental ones . 
structure of complex <nUm> was established by x-ray diffraction . titanium atom adopts a tetrahedral geometry formed by three oxygen atoms of ligands and one oxygen atom of isopropoxo group . the resulting complexes <nUm> – <nUm> are moderately or highly active in ethylene polymerization in the presence of { 3Et2AlCl + Bu2Mg } binary co-catalyst . obtained polymers are linear polyethylene of ultrahigh molecular weight ( <nUm> – 8.8*106 g / mole ) with a broad molecular weight distribution . polymers are suitable for the modern methods of polymer processing - the solventless solid state formation of super high - strength ( breaking strength over <nUm> GPa ) and high - modulus ( elastic modulus over <nUm> GPa ) oriented films and film tapes . 
V. DFT calculations were performed on the cationic ring - opening polymerization ( CROP ) reaction of trimethylene carbonate ( TMC ) by the “ naked cation ” zirconocene catalyst , [Cp2ZrMe]+ . two reaction steps of the CROP ( initiation and chain propagation ) are considered . using a set of <nUm> catalyst structures that differ in electronic and steric properties , the effects of ligand modification on the catalyst performance are explored . the calculations support the activated chain - end mechanism of the process , providing structural , energetic and electronic properties of key cationic species involved . it is found that varying ligand structures tend to destabilize the complexation in the initiation step and lower the activity of the chain propagation . furthermore , the stability and reactivity of CROP can not be ascribed solely by electronic origin as steric effect between the ligand and monomer is also playing a role . the effect of solvent and dispersion on the CROP reactivity was also investigated with the results , indicating that it plays a dominant role in the initiation process . the results in this paper might contribute to further improvements of this catalytic system . 
two indenyl moieties are linked at the 1-,1'-positions via a 1,2-bis(dimethylsilyl)benzene unit . the ligand precursor was prepared via three reaction steps including grignard coupling of chlorodimethylsilane and 1,2-dibromobenzene , Cl2Pd - catalyzed chlorination , and the reaction with indenyllithium . the zirconium and hafnium complexes were obtained by deprotonation of the corresponding bis-(indenyl) compound with n-BuLi followed by metalation reactions of MCl4 ( m = Zr , Hf ) in tetrahydrofuran . the solid state molecular structures of both complexes were established by single crystal x-ray diffraction analyses .

V . A series of titanium ( IV ) complexes ( <nUm> , 5-7 ) stabilized by a substituted 2-hydroxybenzyl alcohols ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) – were synthesized . structures of complexes 6-7 were determined by x-ray diffraction . titanium atom in the tetrameric complex <nUm> has an octahedral environment created by chlorine atom and five oxygen atoms . the main structural feature of <nUm> is a centrosymmetric O3Ti2 cage which is built of two seco - norcubanes O3Ti4 sharing a common Ti2O2-face . A coordination polyhedron around the titanium atoms is the distorted octahedron , with the long Ti-m-O and short Ti-O bonds . all resulting complexes are moderately or highly active in ethylene polymerization in the presence of { 3Et2AlCl + Bu2Mg } binary co-catalyst . resulting polymers are linear ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylenes ( up to <nUm> <nUm> g / mole ) . polymers are suitable for the modern processing methods – the solvent - free solid state formation of super high - strength ( tensile strength over <nUm> – <nUm> GPa ) and high - modulus ( elastic modulus up to <nUm> GPa ) oriented film tapes . 
V.A series of vanadium (III) complexes containing diphosphine ligands of the type R2P(CH2)2PR2 [ r = me ( dmpe , 1a ) , r = et ( depe , 1b ) , r = ph ( dppe , 1c ) ] were synthesized by reacting VCl3(THF)3 with <nUm> equiv. of the corresponding ligand . the molecular structures of 1a and 1b were determined by x-ray crystallography , revealing that both are dimers of the type [VCl3(dmpe)]2(m-P,P'-dmpe) and [VCl3(depe)]2(m-P,P'-depe) , respectively , having one chelating diphosphine ligand , and an additional diphosphine bridging the two vanadium metals . upon activation with diethylaluminum chloride ( Et2AlCl ) and in the presence of ethyltrichloroacetate ( ETA ) the complexes exhibited good activity in the polymerization of ethylene , affording linear , semicrystalline polymers with melting temperatures of about <nUm> ° C . all the complexes ( 1a – 1c ) showed from good to excellent activity in the copolymerization of ethylene with norbornene . the resultant copolymers are mainly alternating with a uniform composition and a norbornene incorporation depending on the ligand employed . the substituents at the phosphorus atoms strongly affect the catalytic activity , which increased in the order 1a < 1b < 1c with increasing the ligand donor strength , and the comonomer incorporation , while no significant differences were observed in terms of copolymers microstructure and molecular weight . the results are carefully compared with those obtained with the monodentate phosphine VCl3(PMePh2)2 complex and VCl3(THF)3 . overall , we found that the use of diphosphine ligands gave less active catalysts likely because PMePh2 and THF ligands are weakly coordinated to the metal , but (co)polymers with higher molecular weight due to the ability of chelating diphosphines to stabilize the electron - deficient catalytic intermediate , thus reducing the rate of β – hydrogen elimination and subsequent chain - transfer . 
the molecular structures of AlMTBP , AlDIPP , AlP2 , AlDPP , and AlN-1 have been determined by x-ray crystallography . all dimeric diisobutylaluminum aryloxides were tested as activators of rac-Et (2-MeInd)2ZrMe2 in homopolymerization of ethylene , propylene , copolymerization of ethylene with propylene and terpolymerization of ethylene / propylene / 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene . it was shown that only AlMTBP and AlDPP work as effective activators in all polymerization processes , with activity of AlMTBP system being significantly higher than that of AlDPP . the evaluation of dimerization energies of synthesized aryloxides by means of DFT calculations have shown AlMTBP and AlDPP to form the least stable dimers . the activation of rac-Et (2-MeInd)2ZrMe2 was modeled as bonding of diisobutylaluminum aryloxide with zirconocene followed by the first insertion of ethylene into zr+ – me bond . As per that model , DFT calculations demonstrated the process to be the most favorable for AlMTBP and AlDPP which well corresponds to experimental observations .

PolyFePtL2 has almost twice higher cytotoxicity ( <nUm> % viable cell ) than polyFePtL1 in <nUm> mM concentration . we also inspected the cell apoptosis mechanism by FACS using Annexin-V FITC / PI double staining assay and found that polyFePtL2 induced apoptosis selectively leading to cancer cell death with ∼ <nUm> % detectable apoptotic cell .

In addition , the molecular structures of <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> were determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction studies . the metallocene complexes have been tested as catalyst ( with co-catalyst MAO ) in the polymerization of ethylene where the substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ligand have a direct influence on the catalytic activity . 
V . acrylic monomer is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation ( UVR ) through photoinitiator . upon irradiation , the acrylic monomers formed stable polymer through free radical polymerization , hence its appearance will change from colorless and transparent to colored and non-transparent . furthermore , the degree of changes was based on the UVR dose , and those optical changes could be detected by UV – vis spectrophotometer at the fixed wavelength of <nUm> nm . In this study , we used 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate ( HEA ) as acrylic monomer , which mixed with polyvinyl alcohol ( PVA ) , and finally obtained a three - dimensional hydrogel material through cross-linking by glutaraldehyde ( GA ) . after doping with photoinitiator-Bis(2,6-difluoro-3-(1-hydropyrro-1-yl)-phenyl) titanocene ( 784 ) , the gel material was sensitive to UV-A radiation ( <nUm> – <nUm> nm ) , which forms an important part ( ~ <nUm> % ) of the natural solar UV radiation reaching the earth surface . the behavior of different formulations ’ dose response sensitivity , detector linearity , diffusion , stability after UVA radiation were investigated . the results showed that when the dosage range of UVA radiation was <nUm> – <nUm> J / cm <nUm> , the gel had a great sensitivity and the linearity was found to be closed to <nUm> . after UVA radiation , the gel also had a very good optical stability . In addition to this , when irradiated with high dose UVA , the gel could maintain a low diffusion . 
we evaluated the effect of an electron donor on photogelation of photocurable gelatin , which is gelatin partially derivatized with eosin ( eosin - gelatin ) . As an electron donor , ascorbic acid , 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate ( DMAEMA ) , and three kinds of radical polymerized amines such as poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide-co-2- (N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate)(poly(DMAAm-co-DMAEMA)) , poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide-co-3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl acrylamide ) ( poly(DMAAm-co-DMAPAAm) ) , and poly(3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl acrylamide ) ( polyDMAPAAm ) were examined . upon photo irradiation at the wavelength ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> nm with low illumination intensity ( <nUm> × <nUm> lx ) , no gel was obtained from <nUm> wt. % of a viscous aqueous solution of the eosin - gelatin even by adding with ascorbic acid . whereas in the presence of monomeric amine ( DMAEMA , <nUm> wt. % ) , gel formation occurred by radical recombination between eosin groups incorporated into the gelatin . when the polymeric amines were added to the eosin - gelatin solution , gelation was markedly enhanced due to cross-linking of gelatins through polymeric amines in addition to direct bonding between gelatins . an increase in amine unit content in the polymeric amines resulted in increased gel yield and reduced swelling degree of water . In the presence of polyDMAPAAm , almost all gelatins were converted relatively rigid hydrogel . application for a topical hemostatic glue was preliminary performed in rat injured model . A rat liver injured in laparotomy was coated with the aqueous eosin - gelatin solution containing polyDMAPAAm . upon irradiation , the solution was immediately converted to a swollen gel , which was tightly adhered to the liver tissue and concomitantly hemostasis was completed with little tissue damage .

A weak or no relaxation was found by using different solvents such as NB , DCE , and DCM . 
two different supported zirconocene , that is , bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 , catalysts were synthesized . each catalyst was used to prepare one ethylene homopolymer and one ethylene-1-hexene copolymer . catalyst active center multiplicity and polymer crystallization kinetics were modeled . five separate active center types were predicted , which matched the successive self - nucleation and annealing ( SSA ) peak temperatures . the predicted crystallinity well matched the differential scanning calorimetric ( DSC ) values for a single avrami - erofeev index , which ranged between <nUm> and <nUm> for the polymers experimented . the estimated apparent crystallization activation energy ea did not vary with cooling rates , relative crystallinity α , and crystallization time or temperature . therefore , the concept of variable / instantaneous activation energy was not found to hold . ea linearly increased with the weight average lamellar thickness lwav DSC - GT ; and for each homopolymer , it exceeded that of the corresponding copolymer . higher ea , hence slower crystallization , was identified as a pre-requisite to attain higher crystallinity . crystallization parameters were correlated to polymer backbone parameters , which are influenced by catalyst active center multiplicity .

the present study revealed the effect of different O2Ti nanoparticles employed on catalytic and characteristic properties of LLDPE / O2Ti nanocomposites synthesized by the in situ polymerization with zirconocene / dMMAO catalyst . it was found that the presence of rutile phase in titania apparently resulted in decreased activities due to low intrinsic activity of active sites being present . based on 13C NMR results , all LLDPE / O2Ti samples exhibited the random copolymer having different degree of 1-hexene insertion . the highly dispersion of titania can enhance the degree of 1-hexene insertion resulting in decreased crystallinity .

V.In this study , we have for the first time demonstrated that succinimide (SI)-KI is an efficient catalyst system to synthesize propylene carbonate ( PC ) from carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and propylene oxide ( PO ) at a solvent - free condition . A synergistic effect was observed between SI and KI that largely increased the reaction yield . it enabled the cycloaddition reaction to take place at <nUm> ° C under a low pressure ( <nUm> MPa ) for only <nUm> h , with a PC yield as high as <nUm> % . the overall condition is milder than the reaction catalyzed by most of the other KI involved co-catalyst systems reported in literatures . the excellent catalytic ability was explained by the increased KI solubility in PO due to the presence of SI and the weak acidity of NH in SI which can be enhanced by KI . A reaction mechanism was proposed based on a reaction kinetics study . SI-KI was applicable to cycloaddition of CO2 with other epoxides . it may offer an inexpensive , environmentally - friendly route to synthesis of propylene carbonate from CO2 .

new nanocomposites based on polyethylene have been prepared by in situ polymerization of ethylene in presence of mesoporous MCM-41 . the polymerization reactions were performed using a zirconocene catalyst either under homogenous conditions or supported onto mesoporous MCM-41 particles , which are synthesized and decorated post-synthesis with two silanes before polymerization in order to promote an enhanced interfacial adhesion . the existence of polyethylene chains able to crystallize within the mesoporous channels in the resulting nanocomposites is figured out from the small endothermic process , located at around <nUm> ° C , on heating calorimetric experiments , in addition to the main melting endotherm . these results indicate that polyethylene macrochains can grow up during polymerization either outside or inside the MCM-41 channels , these keeping their regular hexagonal arrangements . mechanical response is observed to be dependent on the content in mesoporous MCM-41 and on the crystalline features of polyethylene . accordingly , stiffness increases and deformability decreases in the nanocomposites as much as MCM-41 content is enlarged and polyethylene amount within channels is raised . ultimate mechanical performance improves with MCM-41 incorporation without varying the final processing temperature .

UV - vis DRS results suggested the formation of MAO - like species on the silica surface . these species may be formed from the reaction of TMA either with water adsorbed on the support or OH groups of the silica surface .

this work presents the results of homopolymerization of ethylene using an hybrid system (nBuCp)2ZrCl2-Cp2ZrCl <nUm> , supported on silica . the catalytic systems were analyzed by RBS , DRIFTS and EXAFS and polyethylenes ( PE ) by GPC and DSC . the catalytic activities and the polymer properties showed dependence on the different ratio used (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 / Cp2ZrCl2 at the preparation step . theoretical studies permit us to conclude that the metallocenes interact with the surface in different ways . depending on the addition order and the molar ratio between both metallocenes , distribution and nature of active species would be different . possibility of binuclear active sites with different propagation and termination constants is analyzed and discussed . EHMO calculations allow us to conclude that Cp2ZrCl <nUm> has a strong affinity by AIS plane , whereas ( nBuCp ) 2ZrCl2 shows similar affinity for both silica planes . V . 
homoleptic and mixed a-zirconium phosphonates ( ZrPs ) a-Zr(O3PR)2 ( r = me , bun , bui , hex , oct and ph ) and a-Zr(O3PR1) 2-x(O3PR2)x were readily prepared in high yields from zirconyl choride and the corresponding phosphonic acids in suitable solvent mixtures under hydrothermal conditions at low fluoride concentrations . they form crystalline aggregates consisting of platelets from ca. 10-20 monolayers thickness , with well - defined surface structures . impregnation with Cp2ZrCl2 by sublimation or slurry methods provided the first examples of PZr - supported alkene polymerization catalysts . crystal morphology and interlayer spacing are unaffected by the impregnation process . solid - state NMR spectroscopy provides evidence for the integrity of the adsorbed metallocene structure . covalent attachment of Cp*ZrCl3 to functionalized ZrPs of the type a-Zr(O 3PR1)1.8(O3PCnH 2nOH)0.2 is similarly possible . the new catalysts polymerize ethene with good to excellent activities under mild conditions , even at remarkably low methylalumoxane / zirconocene ratios of <nUm> : <nUm> . the polymer is obtained as free - flowing particles , which reflect the morphology of the catalyst supports . V . 
the reactivity of Cp2ZrCl2 towards partially dehydroxylated silica was evaluated and the effects of chemical modification of this silica were studied . different modified silicas were prepared by reaction of the original partially dehydroxylated silica with silicon ethers , EtOSiMe3 and (Me3Si)2O , or a silazane , ( me 3Si)2NH . the resulting materials were activated with MAO and the catalytic systems were evaluated in ethylene polymerization . the different reactions were monitored by FT-IR spectroscopy . the catalysts were characterized by elemental analysis as well as by infrared and UV - vis spectroscopy . grafting of organosilanes occurs by reaction with reactive siloxane bridges . the new SiR3 groups formed on the surface react with Cp2ZrCl2 to form volatile ClSiMe3 and oxo zirconium species . these latter species are active , after the addition of MAO , in ethylene polymerization . the effects caused by changing the nature of the modifier in the grafting reaction with the metallocene , as well as the catalytic activities of the resulting materials , are presented and discussed .

catalysts <nUm> / MAO - <nUm> / MAO at molar ratios Al / Ti = <nUm> and styrene / ethene = <nUm> at <nUm> ° C produced pseudo-random copolymer containing up to <nUm> mol % of incorporated styrene . the ethene - styrene copolymerization has been investigated using the dimethylsilylene-bridged (amidocyclopentadienyl)dichlorotitanium(IV) complexes [ ClTi 2{e 5-1-(SiMe 2Nt-Bu-kN ) -2,3,4-Me 3-5-R-C <nUm> } ] , where r = me ( 1 ) , H ( 2 ) , bu ( 3 ) , ph ( 4 ) , 4-fluorophenyl ( 5 ) , and but-2-en-2-yl ( 6 ) in combination with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) as catalysts . the nature of the substituent r strongly influenced the catalyst activity and selectivity and the copolymer microstructure and molecular weight . the catalysts derived from <nUm> to <nUm> were by about one order more active than those derived from <nUm> to <nUm> . At the optimum Al / Ti molar ratio of <nUm> , the highly active catalysts produced a pseudo-random copolymer ( 95-97 wt. % ) containing up to <nUm> mol % of incorporated styrene . the low - active catalysts gave mixtures of a pseudo-random copolymer ( 76-85 wt. % ) with polyethene ( <nUm> wt. % ) and polystyrene sequences ( 3-7 wt. % ) . the x-ray diffraction crystal structures of <nUm> and <nUm> were determined . comparison of crystal structures of <nUm> and <nUm> versus <nUm> and <nUm> revealed a slightly shorter distances Ti-Cg ( cg - centroid of the cyclopentadienyl ring ) and slightly larger Cl-Ti-Cl angles in <nUm> and <nUm> , indicating a higher electron density at the titanium atom . an electron attracting effect of phenyl or alkenyl substituents as well as their steric hindrance can account for a low catalytic performance of 4-6 / MAO catalysts .

IR spectroscopy has been used to study the interaction of silica with PhNEt <nUm> ( N ) and B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ( B ) and subsequent interaction of the support OSi <nUm> / [ N + B ] with dimethylzirconocene me 2Si(2-Me-Ind) 2ZrMe <nUm> ( " Zr " ) . the data were obtained on the composition of the surface compounds appeared at both stages of catalyst synthesis . it has been shown that ( B ) and ( N ) interact with OH groups of silica to form ionic pair [ HNR <nUm> ] +[(C 6F <nUm> ) 3BOSi ] - ( IP-1 ) . cation fragment of this pair contains highly reactive NH bond with a.b. at <nUm> cm <nUm> . it has been found that NH groups in a part of IP-1 complexes react with neighboring OH groups of silica by hydrogen bonding that gives complexes IP-2 . it has been shown that " Zr " complexes interact both with complexes IP-1 and IP-2 . As " Zr " reacts with IP-1 , zirconium ionic complexes IP-3 containing ZrMe bond are formed on silica . these complexes are suggested to be the precursor of the polymerization active sites . the reaction of " Zr " with IP-2 , most likely , produces surface zirconium compound containing no ZrMe bonds and inactive for propylene polymerization . IR spectroscopy has been used to study the interaction of silica with PhNEt <nUm> ( N ) and B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ( B ) and subsequent interaction of the support OSi <nUm> / [ N + B ] with dimethylzirconocene me 2Si(2-Me-Ind) 2ZrMe <nUm> ( RL 2ZrMe <nUm> ) . the data were obtained on the composition of the surface compounds appeared at both stages of catalyst synthesis .

the reaction pathways for acetylene trimerization and hydrogenation , and ethylene hydrogenation , catalyzed by palladium , are explored using a range of surface - sensitive techniques . reflection - absorption infrared spectroscopy ( RAIRS ) and low - energy electron diffraction ( LEED ) show that ethylene is di-s - bonded on clean pd(1 <nUm> <nUm> ) , but forms a p-bonded species on a hydrogen pre-covered surface , where the transformation is induced by sub-surface hydrogen . catalytic ethylene hydrogenation proceeds on an ethylidyne-covered pd(1 <nUm> <nUm> ) surface , and it is found that ethylene can still adsorb onto palladium in spite of the presence of an ethylidyne overlayer , and is still in a di-s - configuration . the rates of ethylidyne formation , and removal by hydrogen are measured independently , where the latter rate is found to be first order in hydrogen pressure . the ethylidyne coverage is measured under reaction conditions as a function of H2P / C2H4P and found to decrease to ∼ <nUm> / <nUm> of saturation . benzene is formed from acetylene on clean pd(1 <nUm> <nUm> ) via a metallocyclic CH intermediate . this further reacts with a third acetylene to form benzene . however , catalytic cyclotrimerization proceeds in the presence of a carbonaceous layer , which consists of vinylidene species ( CH ) . thus , at high pressures , benzene is formed by reaction between acetylene adsorbed on the vinylidene-covered palladium surface and adsorbed vinylidene itself . the addition of high pressures of hydrogen to the reaction mixture forms a more open surface covered by a mixture of ethylidyne and vinylidene species , rationalizing the observed increase in the benzene formation rate with the addition of hydrogen .

the catalytic properties of ( r XPh ) 2C(Cp)(Flu)MCl <nUm> complexes ( r x = Cl , F or CF <nUm> ; m = Zr or Hf ) in propylene polymerization were studied . the results showed dependences of stereospecificity and polymerization activity on the substituent on phenyl group . when r x is CF <nUm> , the activity is <nUm> times of that of the complex with no substituent at <nUm> atm propylene pressure and is extremely high at <nUm> MPa propylene pressure . the CF <nUm> group increased the regioirregular insertion during polymerization to produce partially crystalline s-PP . when r x is halogen , the obtained polymer has higher melting point than that obtained from the complex with no substituent . V . 
the meso ansa zirconocene with dimethylsilyl bridge , activated by methylalumoxane , catalyses the ethylene polymerization , producing ethyl-branched polyethylene . with respect to the polymers obtained with the previously investigated meso zirconocenes , we have found higher branching amount and lower molecular weight . the rapid b-H transfer from the growing chain to the coordinated monomer could account for both these features of the polymer . the investigation on the structural parameters of the complex , through x-ray diffraction analysis , and on the electrophilicity of the cationic center , through NMR experiments , suggests , as a possible rationalization of this behavior , the obstruction in the inward site . V . 
A series of titanium complexes Cp*TiCl(OCHRCH2NAr) ( cp* = C5Me5 , r = H , Ar = phenyl ( 2a ) ; r = H , Ar = 2,6-dimethylphenyl ( 2b ) ; r = me , Ar = phenyl ( 2c ) ; r = me , Ar = 2,6-dimethylphenyl ( 2d ) ) was prepared by the reaction of corresponding 2-phenylamino-ethanol derivatives with Cp*TiCl3 in the presence of excessive triethylamine . all the titanium complexes display higher catalytic activity towards the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene in the presence of modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) as a cocatalyst , yielding higher molecular weight polystyrenes with higher syndiotacticities and melting temperatures ( Tm ) than their mother complex Cp*TiCl3 . when 2-(2,6-diisopropyl-phenylamino)-ethanol was reacted with Cp*TiCl <nUm> , an unexpected monodentate complex Cp*TiCl <nUm> ( C8H8NO iPr2-2,6 ) <nUm> was obtained . the complex <nUm> displays relative low catalytic activity towards styrene polymerization , but produces higher molecular weight polystyrene with higher syndiotacticities .

silica-poly[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate-co-4-vinylpyridine ] inorganic - organic hybrid ( SMV ) has been synthesized , and by loading zirconocene catalyst on the carrier , novel zirconocene supported catalyst has been made and tested for ethylene polymerization . the silica monomer ( SM ) is prepared by coupling reaction of hydroxyl group of silica surface with 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate ( MPS ) and then , SMV is synthesized by copolymerization of SM with 4-vinylpyridine . the formation of SM and SMV has been confirmed by FTIR , solid - state 13C NMR , XPS , and elemental analysis ( EA ) . loading Cp2ZrCl2 on SMV resulted in the zirconocene supported catalyst . ethylene polymerization data demonstrate that the SMV supported catalyst has higher activity than the SM supported one and yields polyethylene with much higher molecular weight than that produced by the corresponding homogeneous zirconocene catalyst . V . 
titanium constrained-geometry-inspired complexes ( CGCs ) are assembled on aminosilica surfaces using two metallation protocols , a single - step method using a piano-stool complex , and a multi-step surface grafting approach that uses amine elimination from a M(N(Et2))4 precursor . two scaffolds are used in the study , one that has spatially patterned amines on the silica surface and another that has a distribution of different amine species prepared by a traditional amine - grafting approach . the materials are characterized by thermogravimetric analysis , elemental analysis , diffuse reflectance UV - vis spectroscopy , and subsequently , are evaluated in the polymerization of ethylene . using both metallation protocols , the catalysts prepared on the patterned aminosilica are more productive than the materials prepared using traditional supports . the materials made via the single - step metallation method are more productive in the polymerization of ethylene per mole of metal atoms than the materials made using the amine elimination approach . however , on all supports , the single - step method results in significantly lower metallation efficiency than the amine elimination route , which allowed nearly quantitative surface functionalization . As a result , the materials made via amine elimination have a substantially higher metal loading that gives a higher catalytic productivity per gram of catalyst . it is also shown that the catalysts made via the amine elimination method are less susceptible to complex leaching caused by the co-catalyst methylalumoxane than the materials made via the single - step approach . furthermore , when alkylaluminum / borane co-catalysts are used , leaching of active metal species from the support is not detected .

UV / vis in diffusion reflection mode ( DRS ) and DRIFT spectroscopy have been used to study the surface zirconocene species formed at the interaction of Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 and Me2Si(Ind) 2ZrMe2 complexes with the MAO / O2Si support . effect of additional activation of these catalysts with TIBA has been studied as well . structure of type [Me2Si(Ind)2ZrMe] +[MeMAO]- ( C ) is formed at the reaction of me 2Si(Ind)2ZrMe2 complex with MAO / O2Si ( a.b. at <nUm> nm in UV / vis spectra ) . interaction of this complex with TIBA results in the formation of new structure ( d ) with a.b. at <nUm> nm in UV / vis spectra . the surface species of different composition and structures are formed at interaction of Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 complex with MAO / O2Si . the ratio between these species depends on the zirconium content in the Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO / OSi <nUm> catalysts . according to the DRIFTS data ( CO and ethylene adsorption ) and ethylene polymerization data these catalysts contain active ZrMe bonds but activity of these catalysts at ethylene polymerization is low . interaction of Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO / OSi <nUm> with TIBA leads to the formation of the new cationic structure of type ( d ) with a.b. at <nUm> nm in UV / vis spectra and great increasing of activity at ethylene polymerization .

under atmospheric pressure , nano-polyethylene fibres were prepared via in situ ethylene extrusion polymerization , with MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) catalytic systems , respectively . the effects of the geometrical structures and surface properties of MCM-41 and SBA-15 on the morphology of the resultant polyethylene , catalytic activity and polymerization rate were investigated and compared in various polymerization conditions . the possible formation mechanism of nano-polyethylene fibres with MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported Cp2ZrCl2 as catalyst was discussed . V . 
In the present study , the titanium - catalyzed ethylene trimerization in general , and more specifically , the concomitant PE formation have been studied . the polymer formation is undesirable as it not only will lead to lower 1-hexene yields , but it can cause reactor fouling under the applied conditions ( 30-80 ° C , toluene solvent ) . it is , therefore , important to know which factors are involved in the formation of polymeric products and how their formation can be reduced or even prevented . the PE formation turns out to be catalyzed by at least two different species . A significant amount of PE is formed in the early stages of the reaction , caused by the presence of partly alkylated titanium species . the PE formation during later stages of the reaction is due to degraded catalyst species , which means that polymer formation is an inherent property of this catalyst system . the polymer output can be reduced largely by premixing Cp'TiCl3 and methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) prior to injection into the reactor . it was also demonstrated that the type of MAO activator / impurity scavenger is of great importance . for a low yield of PE it is essential to use an MAO that does not contain and / or is not able to generate aluminum hydride species . In the end the best results with respect to both productivity and selectivity were obtained by starting from trimethyl titanium compounds . V . 
five new double silylene-bridged binuclear titanium complexes were synthesized by the reaction of RCpTiCl3 and Li2[m,m-(SiMe2)2 C5H3 ] in toluene . they were all well characterized . these complexes activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) are highly active catalysts ( <nUm> × <nUm> g PE / mol cat h ) for the polymerization of ethylene even at low Al / Ti ( Al / Ti = <nUm> ) . the molecular weight distribution of the polymer indicates broad or bimodal ( MWD = <nUm> ) distribution .

the constrained geometry complexes { 3,6-tBu2C13H6 SiMe2NtBu}TiCl2 ( x = Cl , <nUm> ; me , <nUm> ) , in combination with MAO or borane activators , have been investigated in the copolymerization of propylene with styrene at 25-60 ° C , 1-5 atm . both systems were found to give styrene-propylene ( PP-PS ) copolymers with up to <nUm> mol % of styrene incorporated and moderate molecular weights ( mw = 14,000-88,000 ; mw / Mn = <nUm> - <nUm> ) . addition of some ethylene to the styrene-propylene feed improves the catalytic polymerization activity . the PP-PS copolymers feature a syndiotactic - enriched polypropylene microstructure ( r > <nUm> % ) , with randomly distributed single styrene and / or short polystyrene units . V . 
the new ansa - complexes (R-Ph)2C(Cp)(Ind)MCl2 ( r = CF3 , F , Cl ; m = Ti , Zr or Hf ) were synthesized from the reaction of dilithium salt of the corresponding ligands with appropriate group <nUm> metal halides . they were tested for ethylene homopolymerization and copolymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) at various ethylene pressures and temperatures . In the case of zirconocenes , complexes <nUm> ( r = CF3 ) and <nUm> ( r = Cl ) demonstrated much higher catalytic activity than complexes <nUm> ( Ph2C(Cp)(Ind)ZrCl2 ) and <nUm> ( r = F ) in ethylene polymerization . the same trend was observed in titanocenes and hafnocenes . the electronic and geometric effects of substituents at the phenyl group on the polymerization activity were easily noticed . for the ethylene / 1-hexene or 1-octene copolymerization , <nUm> also showed the highest catalytic activity , and the copolymers from complex <nUm> possessed the highest 1-hexene and 1-octene contents .

A study on the effect of phenoxy ligands of an donor or acceptor character in titanium half - sandwich catalytic systems of a general formula LTiCl2(OC6H4X-p) / MAO ( where L is cyclopentadienyl , indenyl or pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ; x = NO2 , Cl , H , CH3 , t-C4H9 , CH3O ; MAO : methylalumoxane ) on their activity and selectivity in the reactions of polymerization of olefins and styrene and of their co-polymerization , showed that the effect of coordination of the polymerization centers by the phenyl rings substituted with donor groups is involved here . the effect resulted in the formation of polymers of a lower molecular weight and was crucial to the composition of the products obtained : polymer or oligomer , co-polymer or homopolymer mixture . V . 
various (aryloxo)(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) dichloride complexes of the type , Cp*TiCl2(OAr) [ cp* = C5Me5 , Ar = 2,6-Me2C6H3 ( 1 ) , 2,4,6-Me3C6H2 ( 2 ) , 2,6-iPr2C6H3 ( 3 ) , 2,6-iPr2-4-tBuC6H <nUm> ( 4 ) , 2,6-tBu2C6H3 ( 5 ) , 2,6-tBu2-4-MeC6H2 ( 6 ) ] , have been prepared , and structures for <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined by x-ray crystallography . the ti{single bond}O{single bond}C ( phenyl ) bond angles for the cp* analogues containing the 2,6-diisopropyl-substituted phenoxo ligands ( 3-4 , <nUm> - <nUm> ° ) were larger than those for other cp* analogues ( <nUm> - <nUm> ° ) , suggesting that both cp* and 2,6-diisopropyl-substituted aryloxo ligand force the unique bond angle leading to more O → Ti π donation into Ti . effect of aryloxide ligand in 1-hexene polymerization catalyzed by Cp*TiCl2(OAr) - MAO catalysts were explored , and 3-4 exhibited the exceptionally high catalytic activities . various tert-BuCp analogues of the type , (tBuC5H4)TiCl2(OAr) [ Ar = 2,6-Me2C6H3 ( 7 ) , 2,4,6-Me3C6H2 ( 8 ) , 2,6-iPr2C6H3 ( 9 ) , 2,6-iPr2-4-tBuC6H <nUm> ( 10 ) , 2,6-tBu2C6H3 (11),2,6-tBu2-4-MeC6H2 ( 12 ) ] , have also been prepared , and explored effect of the aryloxide ligand in syndiospecific styrene polymerization in the presence of MAO cocatalyst . the catalytic activity increased in the order : <nUm> ( activity <nUm> kg sPs / mol Ti h ) > <nUm> , <nUm> ( 1370 ) > <nUm> ( 534 ) > <nUm> ( 258 ) > <nUm> ( 54 ) , strongly suggesting that role of anionic donor ligand was present in this catalysis .

In the series of the methylated compounds (e5-C5H5-nMen)TiCl3 ( n = 0-5 ) 1-6 , linear correlations of lmax of the absorption band and δ 49,47Ti chemical shift with the number of me groups were found . it is due to the dependence of both the magnitudes on the HOMO-LUMO energy gap which is influenced by electron donating methyl substituents . the catalysts made by combining 1-6 with MAO ( molar ratio Al / Ti <nUm> ) showed only a gross dependence of decreasing activity with the number of methyl groups . for compounds (e5-C5Me4R)TiCl3 7-14 and (e5-C5H(1,2,3-)Me3R)TiCl3 15-20 where r = alkyl , silyl or phenyl no correlation between lmax and δ was found . limited DFT calculations were performed to assign HOMO / LUMO orbitals involved . crystal structures of <nUm> and <nUm> were determined and some other inspected to prove the absence of steric hindrance . the poor correlation of the spectroscopic properties with the catalytic activity is not surprising because steric effects of cyclopentadienyl ligands at cationic polymerization centers are generally anticipated . V . 
the reactivity of the silyl ether - substituted zirconocene [ Zr{e5-C5H4(CH2) 3OSiMe3}(e5-C5H5) Cl ] ( 1 ) towards dehydroxylated silica was evaluated and comparative studies with respect to the unmodified analogue [ Zr(e5-C5H5)2Cl <nUm> ] ( 2 ) were performed . the different reactions were monitored by FT-IR spectroscopy . the resulting materials were activated with MAO and the catalytic systems were evaluated in ethylene polymerization . the catalysts were characterized by elemental analysis as well as by FT-IR and UV - vis spectroscopy . In addition to the classical reaction between zr{single bond}Cl bonds and acidic silanol surface groups , grafting of complex <nUm> occurs to some extent by reaction between the silyl ether group and reactive siloxane bridges on the silica surface . In contrast , complex <nUm> , as one would expect , only reacts through the zr{single bond}Cl groups . supporting zirconocene <nUm> on MAO - modified silica gives rise to a more efficient catalyst . the effects caused by these different grafting reactions , as well as the catalytic activities of the resulting materials , are presented and discussed . V . 
the ansa - indene compound {1-Me2Si(3-C9H6Et)2} ( 1 ) was prepared by alkylation of the unsubstituted ansa - indene . this compound was converted , by reaction with nBuLi , to the dilithium compound [Li2{1-Me2Si(3-C9H5Et)2}] ( 2 ) . ansa - zirconocene [Zr{1-Me2Si(3-e5-C9H5Et)2}Cl2] ( 3 ) was prepared by the reaction of Cl4Zr with <nUm> in ether / toluene at <nUm> ° C . the molecular structure of meso-3 was determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction studies . the ansa - zirconocene <nUm> exhibits a greater activity in ethylene polymerization than reference complexes such as [Zr{1-Me2Si(e5-C9H6)2}Cl2] and [Zr{1-C2H4(e5-C9H5)2}Cl2] and , in addition , it maintained a reasonable level of activity after <nUm> h of contact with MAO solution . furthermore , the different elementary steps in the activation process of ethylene polymerization for substituted complexes [Zr{1-Me2Si(3-e5-C9H5R)2}Cl2] ( r = et <nUm> , me <nUm> , nPr <nUm> and nBu <nUm> ) by commercial methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) have been studied by UV - vis spectroscopy . addition of MAO in large excess ( [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> ) at <nUm> ° C yields a previously unreported intermediate in the activation process of metallocenes ; this intermediate has an absorption band centered at λ = <nUm> nm . we report here the influence of the type of catalyst , ring substitution , type of cocatalyst and addition of THF on the activation process of these metallocenes .

heterogeneous zirconocene catalysts were prepared with an unconventional method by grafting mesoporous silica SBA-15 fiber with Cl4Zr in gas or liquid phase and subsequently with lithium salt of cyclopentadiene ( cp ) or indene ( ind ) . In order to obtain a better understanding of the bonding modes of the zirconium and the ligands , the ZrClx / O2Si and ZrClxL / O2Si were now for the first time characterized by several techniques , including elemental analysis , FTIR spectroscopy , 1H MAS NMR and 13C CP MAS NMR . the results verify the e5-bonding of the ligands to the metal center , which in turn was discovered to be both mono- and bifunctionally bonded to the silica . the catalysts were tested in ethylene polymerization , in which they yielded polyethylene with moderate activities .

five novel binuclear titanocenes (CpTiCl2)2[(C5H4)CH2(p-C6H4)O(CH2)nO(C6H4-p)CH2(C5H4)] ( n = 2-6 ) ( 16-20 ) with the bridge combination of rigid and flexible segment were synthesized and characterized . In the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , the behaviors of these complexes toward ethylene polymerization were investigated . the results show that their catalytic behaviors are highly dependent on the length of flexible segment and polymerization conditions . with the length of flexible segment becoming longer , the catalytic activity increases , whereas the molecular weight ( MW ) of the produced polyethylene ( PE ) decreases . In addition , the longer flexible segment is favorable to produce PE with broader molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) . V .

ClNa doped Cl2Mg supported Cl4Ti catalysts were used for 1-hexylene polymerizations in this paper . the catalysts ' activity , the molecular weight distribution and the tacticity of polyhexylene are influenced strongly by the doping of ClNa in Cl2Mg , based on the polymerization experiment , the deconvolution analysis of molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) profiles and the 13C NMR analysis . the results show that it is possible to control the active center distribution of supported Cl4Ti / Cl2Mg catalysts by doping of support with ClNa .

heterogeneous olefin polymerisation catalysts were prepared by combining zirconocene with a series of purely siliceous and Al - containing MCM-41 supports with different Si / Al ratios , using simplified and improved versions of the well - known direct impregnation and " MAO pre-treatment " methods . the catalysts were tested in ethylene polymerisation . analysis of polymerisation activities and kinetic profiles led to a rationalisation on the effect of support Si / Al ratios and methods used for catalyst preparation over the catalytic behaviour for ethylene polymerisations . polymers were characterised by scanning electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry . A mechanism is proposed to associate the formation or absence of fibrous morphology with polymerisation activities . V . 
the mesoporous catalyst activities of supported molybdenum oxide for diphenyl carbonate ( DPC ) synthesis in liquid - phase transesterification of dimethyl carbonate ( DMC ) and phenol were investigated . the yields of DPC and methyl phenyl carbonate ( MPC ) were greatly improved when MoO3 was supported on SiMCM-41 to act as catalyst . MoO3 / SiMCM-41 catalysts were characterized by x-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , N adsorption - desorption isotherms , and fourier transform infrared ( FT-IR ) spectroscopy . characterized results revealed that the high activity sites of MoO3 / SiMCM-41 were isolated MoO42- tetrahedral species and polymerized octahedral molybdenum oxide species . MPC formation increased with reaction time up to <nUm> h and then decreased thereafter , and maximum MPC yield achieved <nUm> % . the decrease of MPC yield after <nUm> h might be ascribed to MPC disproportionation into DPC and reversible transesterification reaction . 
an MCM-41 has been modified by grafting several zirconocene complexes to give new materials potentially active in the polymerization of a-olefins . these materials have been activated by the cocatalyst MAO , to generate the catalysts MCM - <nUm> / metallocene / MAO ( metallocene = [Zr(e5-C5H5)2Cl2] ( 1 ) , [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}Cl2] ( 2 ) and [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H3But)}Cl2] ( 3 ) ) . the resulting functionalized ordered mesoporous silica samples ( 1-3 ) were tested as catalysts in the polymerization of ethylene and compared with both the homogeneous system analogues and the functionalized silica derivatives SG / metallocene / MAO ( SG = silica gel ; metallocene = [Zr(e5-C5H5)2Cl2] ( 4 ) , [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}Cl2] ( 5 ) and [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H3But)}Cl2] ( 6 ) ) . the metallocenes <nUm> and <nUm> have been characterized by 13C-CP MAS NMR and 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy . the structure and surface properties of MCM-41 / [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}Cl2] and MCM-41 / [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}Cl2] / MAO systems have been studied by x-ray diffractometry , nitrogen adsorption - desorption isotherms measurement and thermogravimetry . the grafting of the metallocene complexes , activation with MAO and subsequent polymerization reaction have been followed by an FT-IR " in situ " study . scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy have been used to show the morphology of the heterogeneous catalysts as well as the resulting polyethylene obtained .

ethylene polymerization using catalysts derived from activation of zirconocene aluminohydride complexes , supported on silica , pretreated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , is described . the novel catalyst compositions were compared to those using conventional zirconocene dichloride complexes and characterized by SEM / EDX and DRIFT spectroscopy . supported catalysts were prepared which featured various surface Al : Zr ratios . when using excess MAO as both activator and scavenger , the catalysts containing the most Zr per g of support gave rise to the most active formulations ; the high activities in the presence of excess MAO are due , in part , to catalyst leaching prior to and / or during polymerization . when tri-isobutylaluminum ( TIBAL ) was used as scavenger , the supported catalysts that featured a higher surface Al : Zr ratio had higher activity than those prepared at the lower Al : Zr ratios . the activity of the aluminohydride complexes was significantly higher than that of the corresponding dichloride complexes , when activated by MAO while the in the presence of TIBAL , there was little difference in performance between the two catalyst precursors . V . 
In this work the cross-linked polystyrene beads were functionalized with silyl hydride groups . two synthetic procedures were employed to tether of indenyltrichlorotitanium ( IndTiCl3 ) on the functionalized polystyrene beads . In one approach ( method A ) , the half - titanocene catalyst bearing an allyl group ( 1-allylindenyltrichlorotitanium ) was synthesized and covalently anchored on the functionalized polystyrene by using of hydrosilylation chemistry . In the second approach ( method B ) , the half - titanocene complex was synthesized on the functionalized polystyrene beads . the polymer - supported catalysts were tested for styrene polymerization using methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as a cocatalyst . the obtained results revealed that the supported catalyst prepared with method ( A ) has higher catalytic activity and syndiotacticity than the supported catalyst obtained by method ( B ) . In addition the scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) images showed that the polymer particle replicates the shape of the carrier . furthermore , the 13C NMR and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) studies confirmed the high syndiotacticity of obtained polymers . V . 
zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) supported on montmorillonite K-10 , which has previously been shown to be an efficient catalytic system for olefin polymerization , was found to be comparable to the highly activated homogeneous combination of Cp2ZrCl2 and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , and more reactive than the originally reported homogeneous catalytic system of Cp2ZrCl2 / Me3Al in the methylalumination reaction of an aryl substituted terminal alkyne . examination of solvent effects in the ethylalumination reaction using Cp2ZrCl2 supported on montmorillonite K-10 , O2Si / HLiO , and O2Si / MgO , indicated that the anionic counterpart of the actual catalytically active zirconocenium cation is highly delocalized , thus suggesting that the actual active zirconocenium cation is only very weakly coordinating with the anionic moiety . this accounts for the high activity of systems using solids such as co-catalysts and as supporting materials in olefin polymerization in general . V . 
various candidate active centers and mechanisms of ruthenium - based olefin polymerization have been investigated by means of DFT . the calculations strongly suggest that the olefin polymerization activity observed for the (bis(oxazoline)pyridine)RuCl2(ethylene) / MAO system is not due to a mononuclear ruthenium center bearing an intact bis(oxazoline)pyridine ligand . V . 
A novel fluorinated bis(b-ketoamino) copper complex was synthesized and characterized . norbornene polymerizations with bis(b-ketoamino) copper complexes activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) were investigated . the highest catalytic activity up to now reported for copper based systems in norbornene polymerization was achieved using fluorinated bis(b-ketoamino) copper / MAO . the influence of precursor structure including steric and electronic effects on catalytic activity for norbornene polymerization was evaluated in detail . bulky steric substituents and strong electron - withdrawing groups can enhance catalytic activity of precursor for norbornene polymerization through a dissociative mechanism . the influences of polymerization parameters such as polymerization temperature and Al / Cu ratio on norbornene polymerization with bis(b-ketoamino) copper catalysts were also examined . norbornene polymerization catalyzed by bis(b-ketoamino) copper complexes / MAO proceeded on Cu (I) species through a coordination / insertion mechanism to produce vinyl-addition polynorbornene .

V . 
titanocene ( Cp2TiCl2 ) was immobilized by entrapping within a silica matrix using a non-hydrolytic sol - gel route . the catalyst was evaluated in ethylene polymerization under different experimental conditions . the catalyst was able to produce fibers of ultra-high molecular weight ( UHMWPE ) directly from the polymerization process . the polymer showed a well - organized and dense microstructure with evidence of extended - chain crystal formation . this resulting microstructure improved some mechanical properties in comparison with a commercial UHMWPE .

A non-metallocene titanium complex of b-carbonylenamine derived [O-NS]TiCl3 ( 2 ) , which can form a tandem catalytic system with difluoro-substituted 2,6-bis(imino)pyridyl iron complex ( 1 ) , was firstly used as in situ copolymerization catalyst to prepare linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) with ethylene as the sole monomer stock and MMAO as the only cocatalyst . during the reaction , <nUm> / MMAO oligomerized ethylene to linear a-olefins with high activity and selectivity , while <nUm> / MMAO copolymerized ethylene with the in situ generated a-olefins to LLDPE with high activity ( up to <nUm> × <nUm> g / mol Ti h atm ) . the influences of reaction conditions upon catalytic activity and polymer structures and properties have been researched . the polymers were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , high temperature gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) and high temperature 13C NMR spectroscopy and proved to be LLDPE with ethyl , butyl as well as longer branches . the branching degrees were tuned efficiently from <nUm> to <nUm> / 1000C by different reaction conditions such as reaction temperature , Fe / Ti molar ratio and Al / ( Fe + Ti ) molar ratio . the melting points , degree of crystallinity and molecular weights also changed correspondingly with reaction conditions .

A kind of (ArO)TiR3 ( ArO = 2,6-(R')2-4- methylphenolate , R' = me , tBu , CH2SPh , CH 2N(iPr)2 , CH2NPh2 ) complexes was synthesized and characterized . x-ray analysis of 6a and <nUm> shows that neither CH2SPh ( 6a ) nor CH2N(iPr) <nUm> group ( 7 ) coordinates to titanium . large bond angles C(Ar)-O(1)-Ti(1) angel ( <nUm> in 6a and <nUm> in <nUm> indicate that the bond have partial sp - hybridized character . upon treatment with modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) , the titanium complexes exhibit significant thermal stability , and prove useful as styrene syndiotactic polymerization catalysts . comparisons between different complexes on the styrene polymerization were discussed . steric instead of electronic properties at 2,6-positions of phenol affect the polymerization activity . (2-tert-Butyl)-4-methylphenoxytitanium(IV) chloride 5e was established the most efficient one . high activity ( <nUm> × <nUm> g sPS / mol(Ti) h ) was achieved when styrene polymerization was carried out in the presence of 5e / MMAO at <nUm> C for <nUm> h .

this paper presents a study of the effects of different treatments on the polymerization activity of modified clays as cocatalysts . to achieve this goal , an intercalating cation was introduced into two smectites and these clays were then modified with trimethyl aluminium . the results for ethylene polymerization , when a zirconocene complex was used as catalyst , and the structure analysis , allow us to obtain interesting deductions about the generation mode of the active species . all active materials employed as support activators presented aluminium in a pentahedral environment together with acidic hydrogen atoms . these two features were detected only after TMA treatment and they seem to be crucial elements in active cocatalyst generation . moreover , a material without structural aluminium displayed the best activity pointing to the new aluminium species generated in the solid matrix as the determining factor for the activity . we proposed a synergic effect between lewis acid aluminium centres and acidic bronsted protons that generate the AlHOSi groups that activate the zirconium compound . V . 
V . quantitative structure - property relationships in group <nUm> metallocene olefin polymerization catalysts were constructed for a dataset of <nUm> zirconocenes in a combined experimental and quantum chemical study . A total of <nUm> descriptors measuring the steric and electronic influence of the rac - SiMe2[Ind]2 based ligand framework were correlated with the observed polymerization activities , together with the molecular weights , melting temperatures , stereoerrors and regioerrors of the produced isotactic polypropene . direct correlations between the calculated descriptors and observed catalytic properties turned out to be relatively weak due to the combined steric and electronic effects of multiple descriptors . multiple regression models based on ordinary least squares linear regression and principal component regression techniques typically led to significant improvements , particularly for the molecular weights , melting temperatures and regioerrors , providing R2 of up to <nUm> . the results provide a solid starting point for an extension of the methodology for a greater variety of catalyst structures , and thereby for the development of new high - performance catalysts for this industrially important process . 
V.In the present study , binary systems based on 2,6-bis(imino)pyridine iron and zirconocene complexes were evaluated in the polymerization of ethylene using different catalyst molar ratios and methylaluminoxane as the cocatalyst . the catalyst activity and polydispersity were evaluated , supported by electrochemical data of isolated and binary systems . the results indicated that in binary systems , each complex solely forms an active species . the combination effect was shown to be dependent on the nature of the complexes and on the ratio between them . for an equal molar ratio , a synergistic effect occurs on the catalyst activity . A redox reaction between the complexes was detected , which led to a decrease in the concentration of active species for the other ratios . In addition , it was found that such combined systems can produce polyethylene with a broad polydispersity with bimodal patterns and higher cristallinity than isolated systems . 
V.Several alkylammonium-AlPO-kanemites were prepared to display a range of interlayer distances due to the presence of variable n-butyl / n-dodecylammonium concentrations . zirconocene and titanocene dichlorides reacted with these layered materials to produce new supported metallocene catalysts . the characterization of these materials confirmed their formation and the presence of the anchored metallocene on the solid support . this study aimed to test these samples for the first time as catalysts for ethylene polymerization for verification of the influence of the metallocene supports with tunable interlayer distances on the catalytic behavior and for in situ production of nanocomposites . the data showed that the highly active new supported systems reaches values of activity comparable to that obtained by analogous homogeneous system . the increase in the interlayer space acted to increase the activity , showing that the possibility of change the interlayer space is a tool to control the activity . polymers obtained by the supported catalysts presented higher molecular weight and lower polydispersities index than that synthetized with homogeneous catalyst . the ethylene polymerization promoted the exfoliation of the alkylammonium-AlPO-kanemite layers in the polymer matrix , characterizing the formation of a nanocomposite . compared to the pristine polymer , the presence of inorganic fillers in the polymer matrix increased the melting temperature of the nanocomposite . 
V . the mechanism of ethylene polymerization on phenoxy-imine ( FI ) titanium catalysts was studied theoretically to identify the major factors affecting the catalytic activity . geometry optimizations of FI ligands , octahedral titanium dichloride complexes , active cationic species , and their p-complexes with ethylene as well as calculations of the energy profile of chain propagation were performed at the BP86-D3 level . we found that the calculated energy gaps between frontier orbitals ( HOMO and LUMO ) in the active cations of the catalysts correlate with the experimental activity values . high activities of FI catalysts with a-Cumyl groups were attributed to smaller HOMO-LUMO gaps due to hyperconjugation between p-systems of a-Cumyl and (N-aryl)salicylaldimine moieties in the active cations . the correlation provides a qualitative estimate of the catalytic activity for further design of new FI titanium complexes . 
e. , methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and Et2AlCl . the results are carefully compared with those obtained with VCl3(THF)3 and Cl3V in the presence and absence of ethyltrichloroacetate ( ETA ) , and free phosphine . VCl3(PMePh2)2 was likely activated through a dissociative mechanism where the dissociation of the labile phosphine ligand was the first and possibly the rate - determining step . the activity of VCl3(THF)3 was slightly higher than that of VCl3(PMePh2)2 likely due to a different competition of re-insertion rate of dissociated ligand compared to the insertion / coordination of (co)monomers . copolymers obtained at low norbornene feedstock concentration from VCl3(THF)3 , showed greater non-uniformity in terms of composition distribution with respect to those from VCl3(PMePh2)2 because of a more pronounced compositional drift in the semi-batch polymerization process . this strongly affects the copolymer 's thermal properties , the copolymers from VCl3(PMePh2)2 exhibiting higher tgs . the effect of PMePh2 and THF ligand on reactions responsible for chain growth termination , affecting the copolymers molecular weight , is discussed . control over the norbornene incorporation and molecular weight of the resultant copolymers proved to be possible by changing the polymerization temperature , and ETA loading . In addition , ad - hoc. experiments , designed to ensure the uniformity of the catalytic copolymerization process even in the presence of the observed relevant ( and unavoidable ) compositional drift were performed , and copolymers microstructure and catalytic mechanisms were thoroughly investigated . due to the peculiar features of the catalytic systems , these studies could be performed only after appropriate modifications to well established methods were developed . As a by - product of these investigations , general and original computational methods are proposed , whose applicability goes beyond the cases treated here . 
reactions with an aliphatic dicarboxylate ( oxalate ) as well as an aromatic dicarboxylate ( terepthalate ) in combination with an N,N' donor ligand ( trans-4,4'-azobispyridine ) results two new coordination polymer of divalent manganese , namely { [Mn(azbpy)(H2O)4]*(bdc) *(H2O)2}n , ( 1 ) and { [ Mn(ox)(H 2O)2]*(azbpy)*(H2O) 2}n,(2) . both the coordination polymers have one dimensional structure and extended to two - dimension by means of H - bonding . interestingly , in solid state structure , the hydrogen bonding interaction recognizes the dicarboxylate ( bdc ) in case of <nUm> and N donor ligands ( azbpy ) in <nUm> . the variation in the use of dicarboxylates , creates here a huge variation in the co-ordination modes of the metal ion as well as in the supramolecular structure within the crystal of <nUm> and <nUm> . the contribution of various types of non-covalent forces are quantitatively explained in the light of hrishfield surface analysis , which justifies the role of hydrogen bonding in the recognition of the above organic linkers . A DFT calculation of NBO also gives a quantitative understanding of the formation of the solid state structure by H - bonding . A thermogravimetric analysis , solid state fluorescence spectra and EPR spectroscopic study of the complexes have also performed which also nicely corroborated their crystal structures . V . 
A large variety of Ti catalysts are involved in the polymerization of ethylene , propylene , <nUm> butadiene and other di-olefins . In the present work we deal with the reaction mechanism of Cp2TiCl2 which in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as alkylating agent produces a predominantly cis-1,4 poly(butadiene) ( cis content of about <nUm> % ) . different reaction mechanisms have been proposed in the literature : the e5coordination of both cp ligands , the formation of a carbene - like structure containing a Ti-H bond , and the loss of one of the cp ligands during the polymerization process . we investigate in a systematic way all the proposed pathways by means of density functional theory calculations and car - parrinello molecular dynamics . calculations can rule out several catalytic pathways that are either thermodynamically or kinetically disfavored . the resulting proposed energy profiles and free energies differences suggest that the only mechanism compatible with the formation of cis-1,4 poly(butadiene) is the loss of a cp ring during the polymerization process , as previously suggested by miyazawa and Suzuki[A. miyazawa , Y. suzuki , J. chem. res. ( S ) ( 2002 ) <nUm> ] . within the proposed pathway we have also identified the catalytic step responsible for the chemoselectivity of the growing chain . the calculated ratio between the occurrence of <nUm> and cis-1,4 in the produced polymer is in fair agreement with experiments , which gives predominantly cis-1,4 polybutadiene .

A new chiral ansa - metallocene catalyst , namely rac-dimethylsilyl-bis(2,4,6- trimethyl-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) , has been synthesized and used as a catalyst for isospecific polymerization of propylene , with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) as the cocatalyst . the influences of polymerization temperature ( T p ) on the polymerization activity , polypropylene ( PP ) microstructure and polymer properties are investigated , and the results are compared with rac-dimethylsilyl-bis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride congener ( 2 ) under identical conditions . <nUm> / MAO has a very high activity for propylene polymerization at 50-70 ° C and <nUm> atm propylene pressure . A beneficial feature of catalyst <nUm> is its higher stability at elevated temperature than <nUm> . At tp = <nUm> ° C , the novel catalyst shows a great improvement in terms of stereoregularity , with [mmmm] = <nUm> % and Tm = <nUm> ° C , while <nUm> displays [mmmm] of <nUm> % and Tm of <nUm> ° C under the same conditions . the regiospecificity of <nUm> / MAO is also better than <nUm> / MAO . 
C1 - bridged 2,5-dimethylcylcopentadienyl ansa - titanocene complexes , [ Me(H)C(e5-C5H4)(e5-2,5- Me2C5H2)]TiCl2 ( 4 ) and [ ( CH 3CH2CH2)(H)C(e5-C 5H4)(e5-2,5-Me2C 5H2)]TiCl2 ( 5 ) and a dinuclear titanium complex , Me2Si[(e5-2,5-Me2C 5H2)Ti{O(2,6-iPr2C6H 3)}Cl2 ] ( 7 ) have been prepared . the solid state structure of <nUm> has been determined by x-ray crystallography . ethylene polymerization reactivities of <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and the structurally related ansa - zirconocene complexes , [ Me(H)C(e5-C5H4)(e5-2,5- Me2C5H2)]ZrCl2 ( 1 ) , [ (Me)(H)C(e5-2,5-Me2C5H2) 2]ZrCl2 ( 2 ) and [ Me2Si(e5-2,5- Me2C5H2)2]ZrCl2 ( 3 ) are investigated after activation with MAO . interestingly , the ansa - titanocene complexes <nUm> and <nUm> show much higher activity than the ansa - zirconocene complexes <nUm> and <nUm> , and the molecular weights of the polymers obtained by the titanocene complexes are significantly higher ( mw , ∼ <nUm> <nUm> ) than those of polymers obtained by the zirconocene complexes ( mw , below <nUm> <nUm> ) . the Me2Si - bridged complex <nUm> shows extremely high activity for ethylene polymerization and the activity ( <nUm> × <nUm> g / mol h ) is <nUm> times higher than that of [ Me2Si(Me4C 5)(NtBu)]TiCl2 ( CGC ) under the same conditions . ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization reactivities of <nUm> and <nUm> have been studied . the complexes are inferior to CGC in terms of comonomer incorporation ability . 
copolymers of norbornene with 1-hexene or 1-octene were prepared using the ansa - metallocene [methylene(bis(2,5-dimethylcyclopentadienyl))]zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) in the presence of MAO . the a-olefin content in the copolymer was determined by 13C NMR spectroscopy and resulted in a dramatic decrease in polymer tg and mw . the catalyst activity was determined to be <nUm> ± <nUm> kg ( polymer ) / mmol(Zr) h at <nUm> ° C . 
the reaction of phenylvinylboron chloride ( 11 ) with allylethylamine afforded (N-allyl-N-ethylamino)vinylphenylborane ( 12 ) which on treatment with <nUm> mol % grubbs catalyst gave 1-ethyl-2,5-dihydro-2-phenyl-1H-1,2-azaborole ( 13 ) . the reaction of <nUm> with LDA in ether gave lithium 1-ethyl-2-phenyl-1H-1,2- azaborolide ( 14 ) , which was silylated with Me2SiCl2 to afford <nUm> . reaction of <nUm> with CpLi followed by LDA and then Cl4Zr gave bridged compound <nUm> . the reaction of <nUm> with <nUm> followed by LDA and then Cl4Zr gave the bridged complex <nUm> . the reaction of <nUm> with Cp*ZrCl3 gave <nUm> . the x-ray crystal structures of <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> show that they closely resemble the corresponding zirconocene dichlorides . on activation with excess methylaluminoxane <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> form active catalysts from the polymerization of ethylene . 
two unprecedented syntheses of group <nUm> metallocenes from 6-substituted fulvenes have been discovered and developed into high - yielding processes . In the first route the di-n-butylmetal dichlorides of Ti , Zr and Hf are generated in toluene suspensions of ClLi at <nUm> ° C from the metal tetrachlorides and <nUm> equiv. of n-butyllithium . bringing the Bun2MCl2 to <nUm> ° C and then heating at reflux for several hours gave complete conversion to slurries of MCl2 ( m = Ti , Zr , Hf ) . heating such slurries of MCl2 with <nUm> equiv. of 6-substituted or 6,6-disubstituted fulvenes gave high yields of ansa - metallocenes or substituted ethylene-bis(cyclopentadienyl)metallocene dichlorides ( fulvenes : 6,6-dimethyl- , 6-phenyl- , 6-(1-naphthyl)- , 6-(9-anthryl)- ) . for 6-substituted fulvenes , both racemic- and meso-1,2-disubstituted ethylene-ansa-metallocene dichlorides are expected to form , but with m = Zr ( or Ti ) , the actual racemic- to meso-ansa-metallocene dichloride ratios observed were : phenyl , <nUm> : <nUm> ; 1-naphthyl , <nUm> : <nUm> ; 9-anthryl , <nUm> : <nUm> . apparently for steric reasons 6,6-diphenylfulvene underwent no ansa - metallocene dichloride formation with Cl2Zr but rather produced bis(diphenylmethyl(cyclopentadienyl))zirconium dichloride . the second route to novel metallocenes involves generating Bun2MCl2 at <nUm> ° C in toluene slurry , as in the foregoing method , but then adding <nUm> equiv. of the 6-substituted or 6,6-disubstituted fulvene immediately thereafter at <nUm> ° C . except with Bun2TiCl2 , warming the reaction mixture to <nUm> ° C and then further heating at <nUm> ° C cause a smooth bis-hydrometallation by transfer to occur , giving good to very good yields of bis(substituted cyclopentadienyl)metal dichlorides ( m = Zn , Hf ) . the instability of Bun2TiCl2 , even at <nUm> ° C , rapidly led to a mixture of Cl2Ti and Bun2TiCl2and hence to a mixture of ansa - titanocene dichlorides and unbridged , bis(substituted cyclopentadienyl ) titanocene dichlorides . with a detailed study of the attainment and the stereochemistry of the formation of ansa - bridged complexes or metallocenes with acetophenone , benzylideneaniline and 6-arylfulvenes , a mechanistic model is developed involving either a three - membered metallocycle formed from MCl <nUm> or an " open - face sandwich " complex of the fulvene and MCl2 . such intermediates offer a rational steric explanation for the observed stereochemistry of ansa - bridge C-C bond formation . finally , in comparative polymerizations of ethylene by such metallocenes , cocatalyzed by MAO , the superior catalytic activity of ansa - metallocenes in the order , Ti > Zr > Hf and of ansa - metallocenes over unbridged substituted metallocenes is attributed to the hyperconjugative stabilization afforded by the ansa σ C-C bond to the metallocenium cation at the active olefin - polymerization site .

recent developments in single - site catalysis ( SSC ) have led to many interesting discoveries in ethylene and a-olefin copolymerizations . here , we report the synthesis of , and polymerizations with , supported piano-stool catalysts and their related analogues . CpTiCl3 , Cp*TiCl <nUm> , TMSCpTiCl3 , and (TMS)2CpTiCl3 were covalently bound to a poly(styrene-r-4-hydroxystyrene) copolymer , affording macroligated catalysts . ethylene / 1-octene and ethylene / styrene copolymerizations with each of these supported catalysts were attempted with cocatalysts including methyl aluminoxane , BC6F5 <nUm> , [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] , and [PhN(CH3)2H][B(C6F5)4] . to determine the effects that the macroligand and the substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ring have on polymer yield and activity , comonomer incorporation , polymer composition , molecular weight , polydispersity index , melting point , and crystallization behavior were investigated . we discovered that the catalysts have vastly different , yet interesting , effects on ethylene / 1-octene ( EO ) and ethylene / styrene ( ES ) copolymerizations . for ethylene / 1-octene copolymers , the activity of the supported catalysts and the amount of 1-octene incorporated into the copolymer is dependent upon the substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ring . the formation of EO copolymers using supported aryloxy-based cyclopentadienyl complexes can also be used as additional evidence for the presence of the tethered aryloxy moiety . the copolymer composition and the thermal properties of these copolymers were also studied . ethylene / styrene copolymerizations produced polymers with varying characteristics specific to the catalyst employed for the polymerizations . polymers synthesized with the supported CpTiCl3 and TMSCpTiCl <nUm> displayed both polyethylene and syndiotactic polystyrene melting points . conversely , polymers synthesized with the supported Cp*TiCl <nUm> displayed only a polyethylene melting point , while polymers prepared with the supported (TMS)2CpTiCl3 displayed only a syndiotactic polystyrene melting point . these findings suggest that copolymerization of ethylene and styrene is not possible with these catalysts . analysis of the homopolymerizations of styrene and ethylene with Cp*TiCl3 and (TMS)2CpTiCl3 , respectively , shows significantly lower activities , leading to preferential polymerization of the more active monomer during copolymerization . 
the synthesis , characterization and reactivity of novel carbometalla[2]ferrocenophanes (e-C5Me4)Fe(e- C5H4)CH2ER2 ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) ( e = Pb , r = ph or e = Zr , r = ( e-C5H5 ) ) are reported . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> were prepared by the reaction of the dilithiated species (e-C5Me4)Fe(e-C5H4Li)CH 2Li · xTMEDA with the appropriate dichlorodiorganoplumbane or dichlorozirconocene in low yields ( ca. <nUm> % ) . the Pb species <nUm> was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR , and MS , however it could not be cleanly separated from pentamethylferrocene . moreover , it was found that the C-Pb bonds of <nUm> underwent facile cleavage , and under ambient light or at room temperature , <nUm> decomposed to Pb2Ph6 and pentamethylferrocene . compound <nUm> , on the other hand , was stable and readily purified ; this species was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR , UV - vis , MS , and elemental analysis . single crystal x-ray diffraction studies of this compound revealed the presence of a moderate degree of ring - tilt with a value of α = <nUm> ° ( a negative value is used to denote tilting away from the bridging elements ) , and a potentially moderate degree of strain due to a large b(Zr) of <nUm> ° ( angle between Cp'(Fe) plane and ipso-Cp'-Zr bond ) . attempted thermal ring - opening polymerization ( ROP ) of <nUm> resulted only in decomposition and attempted transition metal - catalyzed and photolytic ROP were also unsuccessful . the reaction of <nUm> with ClH · Et2O resulted in cleavage of the C-Zr bonds , and led to the formation of pentamethylferrocene . 
new titanium complexes , 1,2-diphenyl-4-R-cyclopentadienyl titanium trichloride ( r = me ( 4 ) , n-Bu ( 5 ) , ph ( 6 ) ) have been synthesized . the crystal structure of complex <nUm> has been determined by x-ray diffraction analysis . all the titanium complexes were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy . In the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , these complexes show high catalytic activity and syndiospecificity for the polymerization of styrene . the catalytic activity of the three complexes increases in the order of <nUm> < <nUm> < <nUm> . 
the group <nUm> pentahalides MX5 ( m = Nb , Ta ; x = Cl , Br ) , <nUm> , react with a variety of epoxides ( 1,2-epoxybutane , styrene oxide , 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-epoxybutane , epoxycyclohexane , ethylene oxide ) in a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio to afford the dinuclear dihalide-tris(2-haloalcoholato) complexes [MX2(OR)2(m-OR)]2 [ m = Nb , x = Cl , r = -CH(Et)CH2Cl , 2a ; m = Nb , x = Cl , r = -CH2CH(Ph)Cl , 2b ; m = Nb , x = Cl , r = -C(Me)2C(Me)2Cl , 2c ; m = Nb , x = Br , r = -CH2CH(Ph)Br , 2d ; m = Nb , x = Br , r = -C(Me)2C(Me)2Br , 2e ; m = Ta , x = Cl , r = -CH(Et)CH2Cl , 2f ; m = Ta , x = Cl , { A figure is presented } , <nUm> g ; m = Ta , x = Br , r = -CH2CH2Br , <nUm> h ] , in moderate to good yields . the products , 2a-h , result from multiple epoxide insertion into metal - halide bonds , and the reactions involving 1,2-epoxybutane and styrene oxide proceed with high regioselectivity . the molecular structure of <nUm> h has been elucidated by x-ray diffraction . differently , F5Nb adds one equivalent of 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-epoxybutane to give the monomer NbF5[O{double bond , long}C(Me)(But) ] , <nUm> , in high yield , as a result of epoxide to ketone isomerization . the reactions of MF5 ( m = Nb , Ta ) with other epoxides proceed non-selectively according to various pathways , including formation of C-O and C-F bonds and C-C and C-H cleavages . 
A series of n-(pyridin-2-yl)picolinamide derivatives was synthesized and characterized . tetranickel complexes were obtained by stoichiometric reaction of Br2Ni and corresponding ligands , and characterized by elemental and spectroscopic analysis . moreover , the coordination pattern of complex 3a was confirmed by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . In the structure , two ligands linked two nickel atoms to form a unit , and two units were bridged via m3-OMe and m2-Br to form a tetranickel cluster . these Ni (II) complexes were investigated in ethylene oligomerization and found to exhibit remarkable catalytic activities upon activation with MAO . reaction conditions as well as ligand environment significantly affected the catalytic performance of the nickel complexes ; the highest activity could be achieved to be <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 Ni h-1 . 
reactions of phenylethynyl lithium with substituted cyclopentenones gave the corresponding pendant phenylethynyl substituted cyclopentadienes . subsequent deprotonation and transmetallation with TiCl4*2THF , ClZr <nUm> , and Cp1ZrCl3 yielded the alkyne - functionalized metallocene complexes [C5Me4(CCPh)] 2MCl2 [ m = Ti ( 1 ) , Zr ( 2 ) ] , Cp1[C 5Me4(CCPh)]ZrCl2 ( 3 ) , and Cp1[C 5H2R'2(CCPh)]ZrCl2 [ R' = me ( 4 ) , ph ( 5 ) ] . these complexes were fully characterized by 1H NMR , 13C NMR , MS spectra , and elemental analysis . the molecular structure of <nUm> was determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . ethylene polymerization was studied with these complexes in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . 
tris(4-hydroxy-3,5-diisopropylbenzyl)amine ( LH3 ) was synthesized by the reaction of 2,6-diisopropylphenol and hexamethylenetetramine in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid or paraformaldehyde . its solid state structure was determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction . its fully deprotonated specie , (4-O-3,5-i-Pr2PhCH2)3N ( L ) , was used to form novel trinuclear half - sandwich titanocene complexes , namely [(e5-C5Me5)TiCl2] <nUm> L ( 1 ) and [ (e5-C5Me5)Ti(OMe) 2]3L ( 2 ) , which were then tested for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) cocatalyst . their catalytic properties were directly compared with those of trichloro(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) ( 3 ) and dichloro(2,6- diisopropylphenolato)(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) ( 4 ) . <nUm> / MAO and <nUm> / MAO systems showed higher activities towards styrene polymerization than the mononuclear catalytic systems <nUm> / MAO and <nUm> / MAO , giving syndiotactic polystyrene of high molecular weight . 
four zirconium complexes with pendant aryloxy groups attached to the metallocene moiety by ethyl or hexyl spacers have been synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic methods and HR-MS or elemental analysis . the solid state structure of bis[{6-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)hexyl}cyclopentadienyl] zirconium dichloride was determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction . the prepared complexes were tested as catalyst precursors in the polymerization of ethylene upon activation with MAO . the results showed a marked effect of the spacer length on the catalytic activity , while only a minor effect of the substitution on the aryl group , which affected its steric properties . 
dimethylsilylene bridged 3,4-dimethylcyclopentadienyl / amido titanium and zirconium complexes , namely [ Me2Si(C5Me2H 2)(tBuN)]MCl2 ( m = Ti , Zr ) , were synthesized by the reactions of the dilithium salt of the ligand with the corresponding inexpensive metal precursors TiCl4(THF)2 and ClZr <nUm> , respectively . these complexes were characterized by spectroscopic techniques and single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . In addition , the obtained complexes exhibited high catalytic activities in the polymerization of ethylene and copolymerization of ethylene / 1-octene , and afforded PE and poly(ethylene-co-1-octene)s with high molecular weights . especially , the dimethyl-Cp substituted constrained geometry complex ( CGC ) , [ me 2Si(C5Me2H2)(tBuN) ] Cl2Ti exhibited a higher incorporation ratio of 1-octene at <nUm> C compared to the tetramethyl-Cp substituted CGC , [ Me2Si(C 5Me4)(tBuN)]TiCl2 , which was judged by the density and 13C NMR analysis of the obtained copolymer . this is presumably due to the steric and electronic effects of the two vicinal methyl groups in [ Me2Si(C5Me2H2)( tBuN)]MCl2 during the (co)polymerization and specifically , no agostic interactions available in the propagation and termination steps of the (co)polymerization . 
the ansa indenyl ligand precursors C3H5 2(C9H6R)2 ( r = me ( 7 ) , et ( 8 ) , Pr ( 9 ) ) have been prepared by the reaction of the corresponding lithium indene , Li(C9H6R-1) ( r = me ( 4 ) , et ( 5 ) , Pr ( 6 ) ) , with 1,3-dibromopropane . compounds 7-9 were converted , by the reaction with butyllithium , to the dilithium compounds , Li2{CH2CH 2CH2(C9H5R-3)2 } ( r = me ( 10 ) , et ( 11 ) , Pr ( 12 ) ) . the three carbon atom bridge ansa - bis(indenyl)zirconium complexes , [ Zr{CH2CH2CH2(e5- C9H5R-3)2}Cl2 ] ( r = me ( 13 ) , et ( 14 ) Pr ( 15 ) ) were synthesized from the reaction of 10-12 with zirconium tetrachloride . compounds 13-15 have been tested as homogeneous catalysts in the polymerization of ethylene . the molecular structures of <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies . 
A series of ethylene-bridged C1 - symmetric ansa-(3-R-indenyl) ( fluorenyl ) zirconocene complexes 3a-i ( r = 2-[2-(4-methylphenyl)propyl] , 3a ; r = 2-[2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)propyl] , 3b ; r = 2-(2-benzylpropyl) , 3c ; r = 2-methylbenzyl , 3d ; r = 2-(2-cyclohexylpropyl) , 3e ; r = 2-[2-(1-cyclohexenyl) propyl ] , 3f ; r = 2-(2-n-butylpropyl) , <nUm> g ; r = cyclohexyl , <nUm> h ; r = iPr , 3i ) were synthesized by a salt metathesis method and characterized by NMR spectroscopy , elemental analysis ( or HRMS ) and x-ray diffraction ( 3e and <nUm> h ) . upon activation with methylaluminoxane , most of these zirconocene complexes exhibited sufficient catalytic activities up to <nUm> × <nUm> g C6 / ( mol - zr*h ) and high selectivities up to <nUm> % toward propylene dimerization , affording 2-methyl-1-pentene as the major isomer which was confirmed by gas chromatography . remarkably , the selectivity and activity of complexes 3a-i were significantly influenced by the structural features of the substituent on the 3-position of indenyl ring : a pendant aryl or alkyl group linked by a quaternary carbon bridge provided the complex with high selectivities in the range of <nUm> - <nUm> % for 2-methyl-1-pentene and low to moderate catalytic activities ; the lack of a quaternary carbon bridge within the substituent would lead to mainly polypropylenes of low molecular weight . the steric hindrance around the active metal center induced by the pendant group might be responsible for the catalytic dimerization behavior , and the presumed mechanism was discussed . In addition , for complexes <nUm> h and 3i , the selectivity for propylene dimerization could also be enhanced with the increase of reaction temperature . noticeably , most of these ansa - zirconocene complexes exhibit excellent thermal stability at <nUm> ° C , which is important with regard to industrial application . <nUm> elsevier ltd. 
In hopes of extending the existing knowledge on the chemistry of phospholyl and boratabenzene complexes of zirconium , which have shown potential notably as polymerization catalysts , this study aims at exploring the synthesis of mono boratabenzene and mono phospholyl zirconium complexes and at studying their reactivity towards the formation of mixed (boratabenzene)(phospholyl)zirconium complexes . several derivatives of (e5-phospholyl)Zr(NMe2)xCl3-x and (e6-boratabenzene-NMe2)Zr(NMe2)xCl3-x were synthesized and used as precursors for the formation of mixed (boratabenzene)(phospholyl)zirconium complexes . 
reactions of zinc (II) chloride with (S)-(-)-nicotine ( nic ) , cotinine , thionicotine and selenonicotine in <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio yielded new metal complexes , which were characterized by elemental analysis , infrared , < sup > <nUm> < / sup > C and < sup > <nUm> < / sup > H NMR spectral methods . single crystal x-ray diffraction studies of ClZn < inf > <nUm> < / inf > complexes with thionicotine and selenonicotine revealed that the two complexes form isostructural crystals build of 1D coordination polymers ( CP ) and that coordination to metal centers alters the conformation of the parent organic ligand from syn to anti . quantum chemical calculations indicate that in the isolated state the anti conformation of the uncoordinated chalcogen nicotine lactams is slightly more preferred energetically and it does not undergo substantial changes upon coordination to the metal center . the preference for the syn conformation in crystals of thio- and selenolactams of nicotine might be ascribed to their involvement in columnar stacking interactions , which do not operate in the isolated state and are also absent in crystals of their adducts with ClZn < inf > <nUm> < / inf > . this study has provided useful information regarding functionalization of (S)-(-)-nicotine molecule as a mixed - donor - atom ligand to enforce formation of 1D coordination polymers . 
two new anilido-imine tetra-azane ligands , 1,2-[(2'-(ArNH)C6H4HC = N)]2C6H4 ( Ar = 2,6-Me2C6H3 ( L1H2 ) and 2,6-iPr2C6H3 ( L2H2 ) ) , were synthesized by the condensation reaction of o-phenylenediamine with the corresponding 2-(arylamino)benzaldehyde , and their zirconium and hafnium complexes , L1MCl2 ( m = Zr ( 1b ) , Hf ( 1c ) ) and L2MCl2 ( m = Zr ( 2b ) , Hf ( 2c ) ) , were synthesized in high yields ( 61-66 % ) by the reactions of L1Li2 and L2Li2 with MCl4 in toluene . direct ClH - elimination reactions of L1H2 with MCl4 ( m = Ti , Zr , Hf ) in toluene at <nUm> ° C under vacuum afforded the products L1HMCl3 [ m = Ti ( 1a' ) , Zr ( 1b' ) , Hf ( 1c' ) ] with a partially deprotonated tridentate ligand in good to high yields ( 48-70 % ) . all the new complexes were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and the molecular structures of 1b and 2c were determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . the metal centers in both complexes are six - coordinated with a distorted octahedral geometry . upon activation with MAO or AlR3 / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 , complexes 1b-1c and 2b-2c all exhibit moderate catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization and produce linear polyethylene with ultra-high molar masses ( 100-184 × <nUm> g / mol ) . 
structures of complexes <nUm> – <nUm> were established by x-ray diffraction . titanium atom in the dimeric complex <nUm> has an octahedral environment created by chlorine atoms and five oxygen atoms . In the tetrameric complex <nUm> coordination polyhedra of ti(1) atom is trigonal bipyramid and in ti(2) – tetragonal pyramid with the environment of five oxygen atoms . each complex contains alkoxo-groups and / or a chlorine atom easily leaving during treatment with magnesium- or organoaluminum compounds . all resulting complexes are moderately or highly active in ethylene polymerization in the presence of { 3Et2AlCl + Bu2Mg } binary co-catalyst . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> are significantly superior to previously described analogs <nUm> – <nUm> in thermal stability and catalytic activity . resulting polymers are linear polyethylenes of high and ultrahigh molecular weight ( over <nUm> · <nUm> g / mole ) with a broad molecular weight distribution . polymers are suitable for the modern methods of polymer processing – the solventless solid state formation of super high - strength ( breaking strength over <nUm> GPa ) and high - modulus ( elastic modulus over <nUm> GPa ) oriented films and film tapes . 
photolysis of <nUm> with alkynyl-Grignard , [HC[tbnd]CMgBr] in toluene led to the isolation of vinyl hydroborate complex [Cp*Ru(m-H)BH{HC[dbnd]CH2}L] , 2a as a sole product . compound 2a can be viewed as a ruthenium – borate complex with an ethylene moiety . further , the chemistry of <nUm> with various internal and terminal alkynes has been performed in photolytic conditions . photolysis of <nUm> with [RC[tbnd]CR] ( r = CO2Me ) yielded vinyl hydroborate complex [Cp*Ru(m-H)BCl{RC[dbnd]CR}L] , 2b . terminal alkynes [HC[tbnd]CR] ( r = ph or CO2Me ) under the same reaction conditions led to the isolation of metal vinyl complexes [Cp*Ru(CO)(C2HR)(L)] , 3a and 3b ( 3a : r = ph ; 3b : r = CO2Me ) . In addition , DFT calculations were carried out to analyze the bonding and electronic structures of these new compounds . 
representative substituents are : me , ph , PhCH2 , PhCH2CH2 , PhCH2CH2CH2 , C2H3 = CH2 . subsequent deprotonation of these substituted indenes and reaction with indenyl zirconium trichloride gave the corresponding dissymmetric bis(indenyl) zirconium complexes . after activation with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) these complexes show high activities both in ethylene homopolymerisation and ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerisation . the rate of comonomer incorporation can reach <nUm> % ( <nUm> / MAO ) . the copolymers exhibit lower melting points than the homopolymers and their crystallinities α are lower compared with the homopolymers . 
after activation with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , all complexes are catalysts for ethylene polymerization . however , in nearly all cases , the species with the silyl substituent in the 1-position show much higher activities than those with the same substituent in 2-position of the indenyl moiety . for instance , the MAO activated complex bis(e5-1-(dimethyl-4-tolylsilyl)idenyl) zirconium(IV) dichloride ( 3 ) , displayed an almost five times higher activity ( <nUm> kg PE / mol cat.h ) than the isomeric bis(e5-2-(dimethyl-4-tolylsilyl)indenyl) zirconium(IV) dichloride ( 19 ) / MAO catalyst ( <nUm> kg PE / mol cat.h ) . the same trend was observed for the para-fluorophenyl silyl indenyl complexes <nUm> and <nUm> . this behavior may be explained in a way that the same silyl substituent in position <nUm> can exert more steric hindrance around the metal center compared to the 1-substituted analogues . the GPC characterization of the produced polyethylenes showed that some of the resins have a bimodal molecular weight distribution indicating at least two different active sites that are involved in the polymerization process . 
(THF)Cl3 ( 6 ) were synthesized by direct reaction of VCl3(THF)3 with corresponding BIAN ligands . all these complexes were characterized by elemental analyses , and FT-IR spectroscopy . the molecular structures of <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were identified by x-ray crystallography , in which the six - coordinated vanadium metal centers were in distorted octahedral geometry with the oxygen atom of the coordinated THF , two nitrogen atoms of the diimine ligand and one chlorine atom in the same plane . when activated with AlEt2Cl these vanadium complexes showed high catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization affording linear polyethylene with high molecular weight . however , when MAO was used as co-catalyst , ultra high molecular - weight polymers were obtained albeit with decreased activity . 
PVC was synthesized using a trichloroindenyltitanium-methylaluminoxane catalyst at room temperature , and its degradation was monitored along with a commercial sample at <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> ° C under air or nitrogen atmosphere . the process was followed by ClH evolution , yellowing index , colour formation and thermogravimetric analysis . the produced polymer had a lower molecular weight and higher surface area , compared with a commercial PVC , while 1H NMR and tg values show minimal differences between materials . the ClH evolution degradation studies indicate that produced PVC has a lower thermal resistance than commercial PVC , while TGA reveals the opposite behaviour . yellowing index and colour evaluation give evidence that nitrogen atmosphere and high surface area in produced PVC allow the polyene growth , whereas low surface area and air atmosphere generate shorter polyenes and chromophoric species . differences in degradation performance are thought to be due to chemical origin , inherent morphology and differences in instrumentation . 
vinyl ether and vinyl silyl ether ( VSiE ) monomers were polymerized in methylene chloride with an indenyltitanium trichloride catalyst using methyl aluminoxane as co-catalyst . the polymerization reactions were carried out at different temperatures and using an [MAO] / [IndTiCl3] = <nUm> molar ratio . the stereoregularity of the polymers was determined by NMR analysis . the molecular weights ( Mn 's ) observed in the polymers obtained from vinyl silyl ethers were lower than the respective poly vinyl ethers . the polymer hydrolysis reactions produced PVA 's with the same stereoregularity , the tacticities of new the PVA 's were different compared with the PVA produced by the traditional reaction of poly(vinyl acetate ) hydrolysis . the most important syndiotacticity ( rr ) observed in the products obtained from the VSiE polymerization reaction was in the range of 28-39 % , while the heterotactic fractions ( mr ) observed in the PVA 's produced from the specific poly(vinyl dimethylphenylsilyl ether ) and poly(tert - butyl vinyl ether ) hydrolysis reactions were <nUm> and <nUm> % , respectively . 
the use of an isothermal degradation method on metallocene produced PVC and commercial PVC , under nitrogen and air atmospheres , reveals more details about degradation routes . without regard to the polymer origin , the hydrochloric acid release occurs in two steps , which are reflected in molecular weight only under a nitrogen atmosphere ; otherwise , the oxygen appears to be included in the scission / crosslinking process . on the one hand , met PVC has unsaturations from its synthesis , producing a faster ClH release compared to com PVC ; consequently , its degradation resistance is lower . on the other hand , com PVC has more oxidized species and has a natural tendency to include more of them . surface area seems to have an important effect and is directly related to the rate of hydrochloric acid release . the latter is not supported by the chain oxidation mechanism , making the effect of the applied atmosphere more critical to the results obtained from the degradation experiments . 
catalyst creates new grades of polyethylenes while their degradation phenomena determine the resulting application profiles . the resins and the end - products eventually contain residual catalysts . therefore , the effects of the following two residual catalysts - one ziegler - natta [ PQ silica / bu 2Mg / tBuCl / Cl4Ti ] , and the other metallocene [ PQ silica / MAO / (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 ] - on the UV - induced degradation of the resulting unstabilized ethylene homopolymer films were studied . the MetCat HomoPE film was found to be more susceptible to UV - induced degradation degradation than the Z-N HomoPE one despite the residual Zr level was <nUm> / 15th of the Ti content . therefore , the zirconocene residual catalyst better ( i ) facilitated the UV - initiated reaction , and ( ii ) decreased the activation energy required for the decomposition of the resulting hydroperoxide . these findings were explained from the differences in ( i ) electronic configuration and atomic radius , and ( ii ) surface chemistry and solid - state electronic environment of these catalyst systems . In both films , tpm and tpc did not significantly vary with the exposure time . the change of % crystallinity showed to be irregular and disturbed . As a function of carbonyl index , tpm and tpc,varied in a similar fashion in the MetCat HomoPE film . however , they significantly differed for the Z-N HomoPE film . here , tpm did not appreciably change whereas tpc initially increased very mildly ; then it did not essentially differ . 
crystalline structures and thermal properties of poly(ethylene-co-a ,o-nonconjugated diene)s , [ diene = 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) , 1,7-octadiene ( OD ) , and 1,9-decadiene ( DD ) ] have been investigated in relation to insertion mode of the dienes . In the case of poly(ethylene-co-HD) , the copolymer containing high cis-1,3-cyclopentane units shows lower melting point depression with increasing the comonomer content than the copolymers containing high trans-1,3-cyclopentane units . In the case of poly(ethylene-co-OD) and poly(ethylene-co-DD) , the copolymers containing pendant vinyl groups show higher DHm than that of the copolymers with cyclic units or branching structures . thermal degradation of the copolymers has been investigated under nitrogen atmosphere and the degradation of the copolymers containing the cyclic structures begins at lower temperature than the copolymers containing pendant vinyl groups . 
single site olefin polymerisation catalysts are suitable candidates for modelling purposes . their well - defined structure and the almost complete elucidation of their polymerisation mechanisms , make these organometallic complexes ideal for studies based on quantitative structure - activity relationships ( QSAR ) . although the QSAR technique is extensively used in drug design , there are very few reports on its application to metallocene - based polymerisation catalysis . this probably has something to do with the difficulties inherent in controlling experimental conditions during the polymerisation process . In the present study , we obtained ethylene polymerisation data using a number of zirconocene catalysts under carefully controlled experimental conditions , i.e. keeping all polymerisation variables constant except catalyst structure . the catalytic activity and molecular weight of the resulting polyethylenes were experimentally determined . we then applied 3D-QSAR methodology to explain the experimental data in terms of three - dimensional ( 3D ) field descriptors related to the structure of the metallocene catalyst . our results provide useful correlations between experimental ethylene polymerisation activities and the steric , LUMO and local softness fields of the catalysts . the molecular weights calculated from comparative molecular field analysis ( CoMFA ) models including LUMO and local softness fields correlate well with the experimental ones . the predictive capacity of the models was also tested . based on the proposed models , steric and electronic factors affecting polymerisation performance are discussed . 
an early transition metal metallocene compound , Cp2TiCl <nUm> , has been used as a catalyst in aqueous emulsion polymerization of methylmethacrylate to high molecular weight polymer with an anionic surfactant , sodium n-dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) as emulsifier . the added surfactant has been found to play the dual role of stabilizer of the cation as well as an emulsifying agent for the monomer . reactions with cationic ( cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ) emulsifiers were not successful under the conditions examined . 
the dynamic mechanical and rheological properties of five long - chain branched ( LCB ) and three linear ethylene / propylene ( EP ) copolymers were investigated and compared using a dynamic mechanical analyzer ( DMA ) and an oscillatory rheometer . the novel series of LCB EP copolymers were synthesized with a constrained geometry catalyst ( CGC ) , [ C5Me 4(SiMe2NtBu)]TiMe2 , and had various propylene molar fractions of <nUm> - <nUm> and long - chain branch frequencies ( LCBF ) of <nUm> - <nUm> . the linear EP copolymers were synthesized with an ansa - zirconocene catalyst , rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( EBI ) , and contained similar levels of propylene incorporation as the CGC copolymers , but no LCB . In dynamic mechanical analysis , the dynamic storage moduli ( G' ) and loss moduli ( G'' ) of the copolymers decreased with an increase of propylene molar fraction . the a- and b-transitions of the CGC copolymers were overlaid with each other . high damping ( tand ) values were found with the CGC copolymers at temperatures below <nUm> ° C . In oscillatory rheological analysis , compared to the linear EBI counterparts , the LCB CGC copolymer melts showed higher zero shear activation energies , broader plateaus of δ and larger elastic contributions , which are essential characteristics of LCB polymers . it was found that the long chain branching was the determining factor in controlling rheological properties of the polymer melts while the short chain branching from propylene incorporation played a decisive role in affecting dynamic mechanical properties . this work represents the first rheological evidence of LCB in EP copolymers synthesized with CGC . 
homogeneous ethylene and propylene polymerisation with new mixed - ligand chloroalcoholate of hafnocene was investigated . the catalytic activity of the complex was studied in comparison with Cp2HfCl2 pre-treated with 2-methyladamantan-2-ol in different molar ratios . the addition of the bridged alicyclic alcohol to the metallocene does not deactivate the catalytic system , but results similar to those obtained with the corresponding mixed - ligand hafnocenes were obtained . the voluminous alcoholato-moiety makes part of the [MAdO-MAO]- counter-ion where it promotes regioerrors in the growing polymer chain . the x-ray structure of new complex was determined . 
those effective catalyst precursors for syndiotactic styrene polymerization , Cp*Ti(OCH2-CHCH2)3 ( I ) , Cp*Ti(OCH2-CHCHC6H4)3 ( II ) , Cp*Ti(OCH2C6H5)3 ( III ) , Cp*Ti(OCH2C6H4OCH3) <nUm> ( IV ) were synthesized , and the influence of catalyst ligands on the catalytic activity and properties of polymer were investigated . the polymer thus obtained coupled with higher molecular weight and higher syndiotacticity determined by GPC and 13C NMR as well as solvent extraction manners , respectively . those catalysts promoted by methyaluminoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity . of all catalysts mentioned foregoing , Cp*Ti(OCH2-CHCHC6H4)3 ( II ) , Cp*Ti(OCH2C6H5)3 / MAO ( III ) and Cp*Ti(OCH2C6H4OCH3) <nUm> ( IV ) catalysts showed higher activity and stability even at fairly low Al / Ti ratio of <nUm> , and possessed excellent control of the stereoregular insertion of monomer , exhibited a significant increase of the ratio of the propagation rates to chain transfer termination . the kinetic and titration results also indicated that those metallocene catalysts ( II ) , ( III ) , and ( IV ) showed higher catalytic activity and produced polymer with higher molecular weight , because of a great number of active species , and lower ratio of ktrb / kp , higher ratio of ktrb / ktrs which indicate that b-H elimination was predominant . 
polyethylene and isotactic polypropylene containing hydroxylated cyclic units were synthesized by copolymerization of ethylene or propylene and cyclodiolefins , dicyclopentadiene ( DCPD ) , 5-vinyl-2-norbornene ( VNB ) , 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene ( ENB ) , with zirconocene catalysts and subsequent hydroboration reaction of residual unsaturated group . the resulting hydroxylated copolymers showed higher glass transition temperature ( tg ) than the original and hydrogenated copolymers . relationship between the cyclodiolefin content and DTg ( DTg = difference of T g between hydroxylated copolymer and hydrogenated copolymer ) was given by a straight line independent of the structure of the comonomers . improvement in shape memory effect was observed in the hydroxylated ethylene-VNB copolymer . 
o-Allyl , o-undecenyl and a,o-undecenyl polystyrene macromonomers , well defined in molar mass and functionality , were synthesized via anionic polymerization . their coordination copolymerization with ethylene with a cationic a-diimine palladium catalyst [ ( ArN = C(Me) - C(Me) = NAr)Pd(CH2) 3(COOMe)]+BAr4'- , ( Ar = 2,6-iPr2-C6H3 and ar' = 3,5-(CF3)2-C6H3 ) affords access to a new type of graft copolymers constituted of a polyethylene backbone and polystyrene grafts . it was shown that the environment of the terminal double bond of the PS macromonomers has a huge influence on the polymerization behavior . indeed , an undecenyl end - group is more reactive than an allyl end - group . the copolymerization of ethylene with a,o-undecenyl polystyrene macromonomers lead to cross-linking for long polymerization time ( <nUm> h at <nUm> ° C ) . the influence of several parameters ( polymerization temperature , ethylene pressure , concentration ) on molar masses and macromonomer incorporation yield was also investigated . macromonomers having the lowest molar masses were the most reactive . the molar mass of the copolymer increased with ethylene pressure . As expected with such a chain walking catalyst , the copolymers presented moderately branched to highly branched structures depending on the ethylene pressure , like for the homopolymerization of ethylene . finally , rheological investigations of the copolymers showed that a few percentage of polystyrene incorporation can change drastically the mechanical properties of the materials . 
polymerizations of vinyl-cyclohexane ( VCH ) in the presence of catalytic systems based on zirconocenes belonging to C2 , c2v or Cs symmetry group were performed . all polymers were analyzed by 13C NMR spectroscopy and show isotactic microstructure . A steric control mechanism , involving a like 1,3-asymmetric induction of the chiral carbon of the last inserted unit on the chirality of the incoming monomer coordination , is proposed . this would be the only stereocontrol mechanism in the presence of a c2v-symmetry catalyst , and it would enforce or overcome site control in case of active species with C2 and C s-symmetry , respectively . 
the cross-type vinylurethane macromonomers ( C-VUMs ) were successfully synthesized using trimethylolpropane ( TMP ) as a cross-agent , and applied to the dispersion polymerization of styrene in ethanol . the existence and the structural identification of the reactants and the products were verified using the FT-IR and 1H NMR spectra . the molecular weight of C-VUM increased , but the polydispersity index of C-VUM decreased with that of PEG . structural verification of PS spheres synthesized from C-VUMs is carried out using 1H NMR . however , the molecular weight of polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) in C-VUM does not affect the particle size of the PS particles , whereas enhanced the uniformity of the PS particles . thus , C-VUMs act not only as reactive stabilizers , but also as grafting agents 
visible laser light of wavelengths <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> nm was used to write holographic reflection gratings with notches into the infra-red spectral region in polymer dispersed liquid crystals ( H-PDLC ) . the gratings were formed by the spatially periodic phase separation of nematic liquid crystal during thiol - ene photopolymerization . an organic titanocene based complex , rhodamine 6G ( Rh6G ) and pyrromethene <nUm> ( pym ) dyes in combination with benzoyl peroxide , were used as initiators . using visible laser light and a single prism , electrically switchable reflection gratings with notches in the blue , green , yellow , red , and near infra-red ( NIR ) spectral regions were fabricated using angle tuning . the photophysics of the initiator dyes was studied by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy . morphology studies by TEM showed a periodic distribution of discrete nematic droplets of nearly spherical shape . the development of visible photoinitiator systems broadens the range of fabrication wavelengths of dynamic reflection filters using inexpensive visible lasers . 
isoprene ( 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene ) was attempted as a comonomer in metallocene - catalyzed propylene polymerization to prepare side chain - unsaturated isotactic polypropylenes ( i-PP ) . hydrogen was added into the sluggish copolymerization of propylene and isoprene mediated by a highly isospecific metallocene complex rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO . catalyst activity was restored due to breaking by hydrogen of the stable p-allyl zirconocene species caused by 1,4-isoprene insertion . stunningly , it was found that the generated Zr-H species had been able to take the accompanying vinylidene-terminated polymer chain for insertion as a preemptive mode of re-initiation . with a consecutive action of chain release followed by in situ reinsertion , the hydrogen - induced catalyst reactivation was not accompanied by chain termination . with the smooth occurrence of the copolymerization , the 1,2-insertion of isoprene led to the preparation of i-PP bearing pendant vinylidene groups . 
A new photoinitiating system for living cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers such as isobutyl vinyl ether ( IBVE ) has been reported . the photoinitiating system comprises free radical photoinitiators such as 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenyl acetophenone ( DMPA ) , benzophenone or thioxanthone , together with an onium salt , such as diphenyliodonium chloride and zinc bromide . In the first step , photochemically generated free radicals are oxidized to the corresponding carbocations which subsequently react with vinyl ether monomer to yield an adduct . In the presence of zinc salt , this adduct initiates living cationic polymerization of IBVE . 
ansa - zirconocene complexes have been studied by three - dimensional quantitative structure - activity relationship ( 3D-QSAR ) . using the comparative molecular field analysis ( CoMFA ) method , the experimental results obtained for catalytic activity and polymer molecular weight have been successfully correlated with the steric and electrostatic 3D structural descriptors , which were calculated by density functional theory ( DFT ) methods . 
the kinetics of syndiospecific polymerization of styrene over silica - supported Cp*Ti(OCH3)3 / MAO catalyst has been investigated through experimentation and theoretical modeling . At low monomer concentrations , the polymerization rate increases almost linearly with monomer conversion , but the reaction rate becomes independent of monomer concentration at high bulk phase monomer concentrations . A kinetic model that incorporates the monomer partition effect between the solid and the liquid phases has been proposed . the model simulations show that the observed non-linear kinetics can be adequately modeled by the monomer partition model . the polymer molecular weight has also been found to increase with the monomer concentration and the polymer molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) is quite broad , suggesting that the catalytic behavior deviates from the single site catalytic polymerization model . the MWD broadening is modeled by a two - site kinetic model and a good agreement between the model and the experimental data has been obtained . 
specific interfacial interactions in multi-component systems such as composites improve the chemical compatibility between the filler and the matrix , prevent the filler from aggregating and strengthen the interface . carbon nanotube ( CNT ) based polyacrylonitrile ( PAN ) composites were prepared either by extrusion or electrospinning to yield fibers with diameters on two different scales - micro- and nanometric . introduction of a third component , ethylene carbonate , a plasticizer which is capable of forming strong dipolar interactions with the nitrile group of the polymer , had a four-fold effect . it enabled melt - processing of the polymer , caused a structural transition in the crystalline matrix , improved the uniformity and decreased the diameter of the electrospun fibers . it also indirectly revealed a preferred interaction between the p-electrons of the CNT and the nitrile groups of PAN , as was identified based on synchrotron microbeam WAXD , DSC , 13C NMR and FTIR of CNT - filled and unfilled PAN fibers . the nature of CNT and PAN interaction was modeled by charge - transfer of CNT p-electrons from the highest occupied molecular orbital to the empty nitrile p* orbital of PAN . 
heterogeneous cocatalysts , catalysts , and catalyst mixtures for the polymerization of ethylene were prepared applying " fumed silica " and mesoporous MCM-41 support materials and zirconocene dichloride , titanocene dichloride , and a bis(arylimino)pyridine iron complex as catalyst precursors . the catalyst mixtures produced polyethylenes which exhibit the properties of two single polymers . polyethylenes with the desired bimodal molecular weight distributions could be obtained with a series of ternary Zr / Ti / Fe catalysts . the ability of the zirconium and titanium species to copolymerize short - chain 1-olefins produced by the iron centers ( " in situ " copolymerization ) is useful for the production of copolymers from only one monomer ( ethylene ) . 
bulk polymerization of vinyl chloride ( VC ) with Cp*Ti(OPh)3 / MAO catalyst was investigated . the bulk polymerization of VC with Cp*Ti(OPh)3 / MAO catalyst proceeded to give poly(vinyl chloride ) ( PVC ) with high molecular weight in good yields . the Mn of the polymer increased in direct proportion to polymer yields and the line passed through the origin . the mw / Mn of the polymer decreased with an increase of polymer yield . the GPC elution curves were unimodal and the whole curves shifted clearly to the higher molecular weight as a function of reaction time . this indicates that the control of molecular weight can be achieved in the polymerization of VC with Cp*Ti(OPh)3 / MAO catalyst even in bulk . the structure of PVC obtained from the bulk polymerization of VC with Cp*Ti(OPh)3 / MAO catalyst consists of a regular structure . the thermal stability of the polymer obtained with Cp*Ti(OPh) / MAO catalyst was higher than that of PVC obtained from radical polymerization and depended on the molecular weight of the polymer . In contrast to that , the initial decomposition temperature of the polymer obtained from a radical polymerization did not depend on the molecular weight . we presumed that the decomposition of the polymer obtained with Cp*Ti(OPh)3 / MAO catalyst initiated at the chain end . 
this article reviews recent studies on the polymerization of 1,6-heptadienes and 2-aryl- and 2-alkoxy-1-methylenecyclopropanes catalyzed by Co , Fe , and Pd complexes . Co and Fe complexes with bis(imino)pyridine ligands catalyze the cyclopolymerization of 1,6-heptadiene in the presence of MMAO to produce the polymer , which contains five - membered rings in the monomer units . the polymers with cis- or trans-five-membered rings are obtained selectively , depending on the complex used in the polymerization . the catalyst , prepared from the Co complex having a bis(imino)pyridine ligand and MMAO , promotes the polymerization of 2-aryl-1-methylenecyclopropanes without ring - opening . the reaction under ethylene atmosphere produces alternating copolymer of the two monomers to yield the polymers composed of the C4 repeating unit with a 1,1-cyclopropanediyl group . the alternating copolymer of ethylene and 7-methylenebicyclo[4.1.0]heptane undergoes thermal rearrangement to afford the polymer with c{double bond , long}C double bond in main chain . A radical pathway is proposed . dinuclear p-allylpalladium complexes with bridging Cl ligands initiate living polymerization of 2-alkoxy-1-methylenecyclopropanes , which accompanies ring - opening of the monomer , to afford the polymers composed of the C3 repeating units having alkoxy and vinylidene groups . A cyclic dinuclear p-allylpalladium complex reacts with 2-alkoxy-1-methylenecyclopropane in the presence of pyridine to produce the living polymer with macrocyclic structures . block copolymerization of the two monomers that contain OR or O(CH2CH2O)R as the substituents on the three - membered ring , results in the polymers with hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments . 
hyperbranched polymers were produced using glycidyl methacrylate ( GMA ) / Cp2TiCl2 / Zn as self - condensing vinyl polymerization ( SCVP ) system . the polymerization is firstly initiated by the epoxide radical ring opening catalyzed by Cp2Ti(III)Cl generated in situ via the reaction of Cp2TiCl2 with Zn . by optimizing the molar ratio of the SCVP inimer ( GMA ) to the mediator ( Cp2Ti(III)Cl ) , the active propagation chains are reversibly transformed to the dormant species and the cross-linking does not occur until a higher level of monomer conversion ( ca. <nUm> % ) . we detail this facile one - step polymerization technique to prepare highly branched polymers with a multiplicity of particular end reactive functionalities including Ti alkoxide , hydroxyl and vinyl functional groups , which differs from most previously reported SCVP systems . 
A facile self - condensing vinyl polymerization ( SCVP ) system , the combination of glycidyl methacrylate , Cp2TiCl2 and Zn , has been firstly used to prepare novel hyperbranched polymers , consisting of vinyl polymers as the backbone , and cyclic ester polymers ( poly(e{open}-caprolactone) or poly(l-lactide) ) as the side chains . the polymerizations are initiated by the epoxide radical ring - opening catalyzed by Cp2Ti(III)Cl which is generated in situ via the reaction of Cp2TiCl2 with Zn . the key to success is that the polymerizations can proceed concurrently via two dissimilar chemistries possessing the opposite active initiating species , including ring - opening polymerization ( ROP ) and controlled / living radical polymerization ( CRP ) . we have demonstrated that this facile one - step polymerization technique can be applied successfully to prepare highly branched polymers with a multiplicity of end reactive functionalities including Ti alkoxide , hydroxyl and vinyl functional groups . 
novel terpolymers containing ethylene , 1-hexene and dicyclopentadiene ( DCPD ) were synthesized using bis(b-enaminoketonato)titanium catalysts [PhNC(R2)CHC(R1)O]2TiCl2 ( 1a : R1 = ph , R2 = CF3 ; 1b : R1 = CF3 , R2 = CH3 ) . In the presence of modified methylaluminoxane , these catalysts afforded terpolymers with a broad range of monomer compositions and unimodal molecular weight distributions . 13C NMR spectra reveal the exclusive insertion manner of DCPD maintained under various reaction conditions . DSC results show the melting temperature and the glass transition temperature are very sensitive to the terpolymer composition and the morphology can be easily tuned from semicrystalline state to amorphous state . with ethylene / 1-hexene / DCPD molar ratio about <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> , the terpolymer exhibits low glass transition temperature ( tg = <nUm> ° C ) and has a great potential to serve as polyolefin elastomer . additionally , the terpolymer containing <nUm> mol % 1-hexene and <nUm> mol % DCPD was served as the " reactive intermediate polyolefin " for PCL graft reaction . the composition of graft copolymer was well controllable and high graft efficiency was observed . the microscopy studies in conjunction with the tensile tests revealed that PCL graft copolymer is the effective compatibilizer for polyethylene / polar polymer blends by improving the interfacial adhesion between separated phases . 
comparison with the conventional ziegler - natta catalyst Cl4Ti / Cl2Mg ( I ) , the modified supported ziegler - natta catalysts (iso-PentylO)TiCl3 / Cl2Mg ( II ) and (BzO)TiCl3 / Cl2Mg ( III ) were prepared as efficient catalysts for copolymerization of ethylene with 1-octene . the complexes ( II ) and ( III ) were desirable for the production of random ethylene / 1-octene copolymers coupled with higher molecular weight , higher comonomer incorporation within copolymer chain and good yield even at high temperature <nUm> ° C and fairly low Al / Ti molar ratio of <nUm> . the effects of catalysts ligands , Al / Ti molar ratio , polymerization temperature , as well as concentration of 1-octene on the catalytic activity , molecular weight and microstructure of the copolymer were investigated in detail . the structure and properties of the copolymers were characterized with 13C NMR , GPC , DSC and WAXD . the kinetic results also indicate that these catalysts ( II ) and ( III ) show higher catalytic activity and the produced polymers feature higher molecular weight , because of lower ratio of ktrm / kp and ktra / kp , and higher ratio of ktra / ktrm which indicates that chain transfer to cocatalyst is predominant . 
branched a-olefin , 4-methyl-1-pentene ( <nUm> MP ) , was polymerized with classical a-diimine nickel complexes in the presence of MAO . influences of structure of a-diimine nickel catalysts and polymerization parameters including temperature and [Al] / [Ni] mole ratio were evaluated . At <nUm> ° C , 4-methyl-1-pentene can be polymerized in a living / controlled manner . the obtained poly(4-methyl-1-pentene)s are amorphous elastomers with low glass transition temperature ( tg ) . nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) and distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer ( DEPT ) analyses show that various types of branches and microstructural units are present in the polymers . on the basis of assignment of microstructures , mechanistic models that involves the 1,2- and 2,1-insertion , and chain walking were constructed . the influences of temperature and [Al] / [Ni] mole ratio on branching degree , branch type , and insertion pathways were also discussed in detail . 
according to the observable evidence from 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry , new dinuclear constrained geometry catalysts ( DCGCs ) with a structure of [ { ti(e5 : e1-(C9H5)Si(CH3) 2NtBu)Cl2(CH2)n } 2(C6H4) ] [ n = <nUm> ( 10 ) , n = <nUm> ( 11 ) , n = <nUm> ( 12 ) ] were synthesized successfully . copolymerization of ethylene and styrene were tested by using three new DCGCs and dow CGC . the catalyst activity , the molecular weight ( MW ) and styrene content of the copolymers were sharply improved as the bridge structure was transformed from para-phenyl ( 10 ) to para-xylyl ( 11 ) and para-diethylenephenyl ( 12 ) . the activity of <nUm> and <nUm> was about four to five times greater than that of <nUm> regardless of the polymerization conditions . In addition , the capability to form high MW polymers increased in the order of dow CGC ≈ <nUm> < <nUm> < <nUm> . the styrene contents in copolymers generated by <nUm> and <nUm> were higher than those of <nUm> . 
the investigation of a multicomponent catalyst in polyolefin field came up as an alternative for synthesizing bimodal polymers in only one step process under constant reaction conditions . In the present work , new bifunctional catalysts were prepared by combining chromium and metallocene species on the same solid and tested in ethylene polymerization in order to evaluate the possibility of producing bimodal polyethylene . the catalytic system methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) / (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 was immobilized on activated chromium catalysts supported onto several inorganic carriers ( silica , silica - alumina , aluminophosphate and mesostructured SBA-15 - type materials ) . the reaction results showed a clear influence of the physicochemical properties of the support on the relative contribution of metallocene and chromium centers as well as on polymers molecular weight distribution . A bimodal polyethylene was obtained by supporting the MAO / metallocene system on a mesostructured chromium catalyst prepared by direct synthesis . 
the series of trichlorotitanium 2-(2-pyridinyliminomethyl)phenolates , [ 4,6-tBu2C6H2O-2-CHNC5R 1-4N]TiCl3 ( R1-4 = H ( 1 ) ; R1,3,4 = H , R2 = me ( 2 ) ; R1,2,4 = H , R3 = me ( 3 ) ; r <nUm> = H , R1,3 = me ( 4 ) ; R1,3 = H , R2 = CF3 , R4 = Cl ( 5 ) ) , were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis and 1H / 13C NMR spectroscopy . the molecular structures of the representative complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were confirmed by single - crystal x-ray diffraction , and revealed distorted octahedral geometry at titanium . In the presence of MAO , all titanium pro-catalysts showed good activities for ethylene polymerization with good thermal stability at the optimum temperature of <nUm> ° C . In comparison with the ethylene polymerization results , the activity observed for the co-polymerization of ethylene / 1-hexene was far lower , but the polymers produced were of high molecular weight . for the co-polymerization of ethylene / 1-octene , enhanced catalytic activity was observed , with 1-octene incorporation of up to <nUm> mol % . 
norbornene ( NB ) has been polymerized with Cl4Ti - AlR 2Cl ( r = et , me , iBu ) at various NB / Cl4Ti molar ratio . the products obtained at low ratio ( from ca. <nUm> to <nUm> , depending on the mode of catalyst preparation ) are a mixture of oligomers , from which it has been possible to isolate a crystalline heptamer having a 2,3-exo-disyndiotactic structure by single crystal x-ray analysis . the products obtained at higher NB / Cl4Ti ratio have a higher molecular weight ( up to ca. <nUm> for the soluble products ) and consist of amorphous and crystalline polymers . the crystalline polymers , characterized by x-ray and 13C NMR , are a new type of stereoregular polynorbornene ( PNB ) , having a 2,3-exo-disyndiotactic structure . mechanistic aspects are examined and a precise assignment of some resonances in the 13C NMR spectrum of vinyl-type PNBs is reported . 
A well - dispersed multiwall carbon nanotube ( MWCNT ) / syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) composite was prepared by simple in-situ polymerization of styrene using pentamethylcyclopentadienyltitanium(IV) trimethoxide ( CpTi(OMe)3 ) attached to the shortened and functionalized MWCNT ( f-MWCNT ) . the attachment of CpTi(OMe)3 to the f-MWCNT was confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis , x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy , fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy , and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy . CpTi(OMe)3 attached to pristine MWCNT in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) did not produce PS , whereas CpTi(OMe)3 attached to f-MWCNT showed a high catalytic activity for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene under the same polymerization conditions . obtained sPS showed a narrow molecular weight distribution ( PDI z <nUm> ) , a high SI value ( <nUm> % ) , and a high melting point ( z272 C ) . scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images showed that MWCNT strands were well dispersed in the MWCNT / sPS composite . such composites had greatly improved thermal stability compared to normal sPS polymers . 
we synthesized a series of four dinuclear constrained geometry catalysts ( DCGCs ) containing alkyl-substituted para-xylene bridges [ ClTi 2{N(tBu)Si(Me)2}C9H 5]2[(CH2){(R)2C6H 2}(CH2) ] : <nUm> ( r = hydrogen ) , <nUm> ( r = isopropyl ) , <nUm> ( r = n-hexyl ) , and <nUm> ( r = n-octyl ) . the structures and compositions of the synthesized complexes were conveniently identified by 1H NMR , 13C NMR and elemental analysis ( EA ) . In order to determine the effect of steric and electronic properties of various alkyl branches on the xylene group , ethylene homo and copolymerization experiments by use of these metallocenes have been conducted . dow CGC ( [ Me2Si (m5-Me4Cp)NtBu]TiCl2 ) has been used as the control catalyst for comparison . it was found that the activity of catalyst <nUm> was highest and the activities of the new DCGCs were much higher than that of dow CGC . polyethylene having more than <nUm> g / mol of molecular weight that may be classified as ultra high molecular weight polyethylene ( UHMWPE ) has been able to be successfully produced from the new DCGCs . most importantly it was demonstrated that the control of polymerization properties of DCGCs was determined by the nature of the alkyl substituent at para-xylene bridge . catalyst <nUm> having isopropyl substituent at the bridge produced the longest polymer with the lowest catalytic activity . on the other hand , DCGCs <nUm> and <nUm> exhibited the greatest comonomer reactivity to make ethylene / styrene copolymers with the highest styrene contents .

this paper reported a photocleavage type polymerizable organosilicon macromolecular photoinitiator ( HHMP-Si-CC ) , which was synthesized based on traditional photoinitiator 2-hydroxy-1-[4-(2-hydroxyethoxy) phenyl]-2-methyl propan-1-one ( HHMP ) and amino polysiloxane . HHMP-Si-CC can not only spontaneously form a concentration gradient in the photopolymerization system , initiate gradient photopolymerization and effectively mitigate inhibition of oxygen , but also overcome the migration of photolysis fragments of the photoinitiator from UV - curable material . its structure was confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1H NMR ) , 13C NMR , 29Si NMR and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ) and gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) . the kinetics of photopolymerization of HHMP-Si-CC was studied by real - time infrared spectroscopy ( RTIR ) . moreover , it was proved by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) and UV absorption that HHMP-Si-CC had relatively good self - floating ability . the polymer initiated by HHMP-Si-CC presented a gradient change in the degree of polymerization , molecular weight , thermostability and glass transition temperature ( tg ) . the surface morphology of poly(triethylene glycol diacrylate ) ( PTPGDA ) initiated by HHMP-Si-CC was studied by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . more importantly , the migration of photolysis fragments of the HHMP-Si-CC from UV - curable materials was also investigated by high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) . the results showed that the migration more was effectively mitigated by introducing polymerizable groups into the HHMP-Si-CC . HHMP-Si-CC should have potential applications for preparing more environmentally friendly gradient materials . 
all the complexes were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis . the molecular structures of complex 2a and 2b were further determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction , both of them adopt a three - legged distorted tetrahedral geometry in which the aryl substituents are orthogonally to the aryloxide group . activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , these complexes showed high activities ( up to <nUm> kg mol − <nUm> ( Ti ) h − <nUm> ) for ethylene polymerization . the resultant polyethylenes had high molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distributions . furthermore , for the ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization , these complexes exhibited moderate activites and moderate to high 1-hexene incorporation ability . the sequence distributions of poly (ethylene-co-1-hexene)s are greatly influenced by the substituent on the cyclopentadineyl group of titanium complexes . 
hydrozirconation of vinyl-containing polystyrene ( copolymer of styrene and 4-(vinylphenyl)-1-butene ( PSVS ) ) was found to be an efficient way for immobilization of zirconocene pre-initiator onto polymer backbone by carbon-zirconium ( C-Zr ) sigma ( σ ) bond . by activation with MAO , the resultant hydrozirconated PSVS could act as a macroinitiator with multiple - initiating sites ( Zr d+ -C d- ) for ethylene insertion and propagation in “ graft from ” fashion . the hydrozirconation and the following ethylene polymerization were monitored by NMR and GPC , revealing the successful synthesis of PS-g-PE and the following formation of free PE chains due to chain transfer characteristic of metallocene catalyst . thus we could prepare PE / PS-g-PE alloy through in situ ethylene polymerization by this method . the presence of PS-g-PE in the resultant alloy endowed some special functionalization , for example , acting as compatibilizer in PE / PS blends . 
the obtained copolymers possessed pendant vinyl groups , of which content was varied from <nUm> to <nUm> % by the initial feed ratio of the monomers . the copolymers were soluble in various solvents even at high conversion ( > <nUm> % ) , showing that the crosslinking of pendant vinyl groups was negligible . the glass transition temperature of the copolymer was changed from <nUm> ° C to over <nUm> ° C , depending on the comonomer composition . post-functionalization of the pendant vinyl groups with 3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-nonafluoro-1-hexene via ruthenium - catalyzed metathesis reaction was also performed and fluoroalkyl-functionalized cyclic olefin copolymer was successfully obtained . the fluorinated copolymer film showed higher contact angle than the unfunctionalized copolymer . 
synthetic reactions were carried out with a zirconocene catalyst under either homogenous or supported conditions , the SBA-15 particles being used as carriers , and testing the immobilization of the catalytic system by several approaches . the existence of polypropylene able to crystallize within the mesoporous channels in the resulting materials is initially figured out from the appearance of a small endothermic process on heating calorimetric experiments , located at around <nUm> ° C . the presence of polypropylene crystallites confined within the SBA-15 mesostructure is thereafter confirmed by SAXS measurements through the intensity variation of the SBA-15 first order reflection , this change being dependent on composition . accordingly , polypropylene chains can grow up either outside or inside the SBA-15 channels during polymerization and the mesoporous particles maintain their ordered hexagonal arrangement . mechanical response , as deduced from indentation measurements , improves with SBA-15 incorporation ( without varying the final processing temperature ) . thus , stiffness increases and deformability is reduced in the nanocomposites as the SBA-15 content rises . simultaneously , polypropylene amount within channels is enlarged . amount of SBA-15 is , then , the most important variable .

the discovery of metallocenes and post-metallocenes has revived olefin polymer chemistry as these single - site catalysts enable the production of (co)polyolefins with tunable molecular structures , stereochemistries and molecular weight distributions . to be used in industry , however , such catalysts have to be manipulated under conditions already common to existing polyolefin production processes . this means , in particular , that their heterogenization is required to produce beads of polyolefins and prevent reactor fouling , and this in turn leads to the use of supports for these catalysts . the large majority of supports currently used in industry are inorganic - based , with silica being the most important . organic supports are also of interest as they are expected to be more versatile and less expensive . this review presents a detailed survey of the different routes to immobilizing single - site catalysts on organic supports . the various methods as well as the different types of supports are described . the influence of the organic support on the catalytic activity and main features of the thus formed polyolefin viz. molecular weight , dispersity and morphology , are also considered .

In order to immobilize these complexes onto heterogeneous supports , a new methodology was developed to introduce functional anchors to the ethylene-bis(indenyl) ligand , EBI . this was accomplished by selective alkylation of indene to form toluene-4-sulfonic acid 2-(3H-inden-1-yl)-ethyl ester , which was then used to alkylate 6-bromoindene . the selective introduction of an aryl bromide then undergoes coupling reactions with aryl borates via the suzuki coupling to efficiently introduce an alkenyl or alcohol , functional anchor in a simple four step synthesis . 
A comparison of two routes towards the synthesis of tetramethylcyclopentadienes on a range of different polymer supports is discussed . it was found that the direct displacement of the halide from halogen terminated polymers furnished a cleaner product and in fewer steps . 
inertial confinement fusion ( ICF ) experiments generate a demand of specific organometallic materials , especially titanium - doped porous polymers obtained from specific Ti - containing monomers . two new polymerizable titanium(IV) complexes were synthesized . their free radical co-polymerization affords several titanium - containing polymers , which were dried under supercritical conditions to afford organic aerogels . the chemical compositions of these materials were investigated by NMR , IR , and elemental analysis while their structure was characterized by MEB - EDS and by N adsorption / desorption isotherm measurements . 
hydrophosphonylation reactions have emerged as efficient processes for the functionalization of alkenes or alkynes . synthesis of alkylphosphonates was achieved by an original double radical transfer mediated by titanocene and propylene oxide . by the same way , nitriles which are considered as inert functions in radical process lead to aminobisphosphonates . 
four ethylene bis-indenyl ligands containing tethers of various lengths were successfully immobilized on the surface of functionalized silica gel . the strategy of immobilization was based on catalytic thiol - ene coupling of terminal alkene groups in the tethers with surface thiol groups . obtained materials have high BET surface area and pore volume . the method developed can be used for immobilization of catalytically active bis-indenyl metallocene complexes , thus preventing their dimerization and deactivation . 
V . the analysis of FT-IR spectra of isotactic and syndiotactic poly(N-pentenylcarbazole) ( i-PPK and s-PPK ) amorphous film samples are reported in the present paper . A comparison with FT-IR spectrum of a non stereoregular polyvinylcarbazole ( PVK ) commercial sample is also presented . calculated vibration spectra of both i-PPK and s-PPK are obtained through the density functional theory ( DFT ) method . theoretical results are interpreted in terms of potential energy distribution ( PED ) analysis , and compared with i-PPK and s-PPK FT-IR experimental spectra . only a few differences , due to the conformational constrain imposed by tacticity , are detected between the two fully amorphous polymer stereoisomers . moreover , the observed differences between PPKs and PVK spectra are attributed to the presence of the alkylene linker ( -(CH <nUm> ) <nUm> - ) in PPK samples , distancing the carbazole groups to the main chain . the alkylene linker allows more flexibility to both the side and main chain of PPK samples , giving rise to new vibrational mixed modes which are not detected in PVK . 
nearly ten years ago , a research program concerning materials and technologies was defined to develop the very complex cryogenic target for obtaining the combustion of a deuterium - tritium mixture by inertial confinement fusion in the laser megajoule facility . the CEA target fabrication project includes research and development on various organic polymers and materials for the cryogenic laser megajoule target assembly as well as for other targets that can be useful for the fusion program ( pre and post-ignition ) . recent advances have been accomplished concerning the development of specific organic materials for the fabrication of targets components , including the synthesis of polymers for the laser megajoule microshells and metal - doped organic foams for the elaboration of doped - foam microshells or for the micromachining of components . 
ConspectusOur interest in chelating s-aryl ancillary ligands was motivated by their potential to impart unusual reactivity , since we envisioned that s-donors with minimal - donation would create a catalytic center with enhanced electrophilicity . we developed a family of group <nUm> post-metallocene catalysts supported by pyridine-2-phenolate-6-(s-aryl) [O,N,C] ligands bearing a fluorinated moiety in the vicinity of the metal . notable features of these meta-substituted tris(hetero)aryl frameworks include their coordination geometry and inherent rigidity . for the first time , the elusive C-H***F-C interaction was manifested as NMR-discernible1H-19F coupling in solution and characterized by a neutron diffraction study . their existence carries implications for catalyst design and in the context of weak attractive ligand - polymer interactions ( WALPI ) , since they substantiate the practical viability of the ortho-F***H(b) ligand - polymer interactions proposed for living group <nUm> fluorinated bis(phenoxyimine) catalysts . In metal - catalyzed olefin polymerization reactions , the notion of noncovalent interactions between an active ancillary ligand and the growing polymer chain is new . these interactions must be fragile and transient in nature , otherwise the intrinsic chain propagation process would be disrupted , and inherently tunable attractive forces such as hydrogen bonds are ideally suited to this role . the nature , relevance , and usability of extremely weak hydrogen bonds such as C-H***F-C has been a topical yet controversial area of research.We subsequently prepared a series of group <nUm> complexes supported by fluorinated (s-aryl)-2-phenolate-6-pyridyl [O,C,N] ligands . [1H,19F]-HMBC NMR experiments were conducted to probe the observed1H-19F coupling , and specifically separate contributions from scalar ( J ) coupling and cross-correlation ( CR ) interference . for the first time , a significant scalar component was confirmed for the1H-19F coupling in Ti - [O,C,N] and [O,N,C] complexes , which occurs with chemical connectivity across intramolecular C-H***F-C interactions . this result is important because the applicability of weak attractive ligand - polymer interactions in catalysis is feasible only if the observed coupling and hence the noncovalent interaction is genuine . the verified intramolecular C-H***F-C contacts in these complexes can therefore be considered as synthetic models for ligand - polymer interactions in olefin polymerization processes . significantly , reports concerning late transition metal systems have appeared that hint at the generality of the WALPI concept for modulating polymerization reactions.We evaluated the olefin polymerization reactivity of Ti - [O,N,C] catalysts through judicious substitution . DFT calculations , which revealed diverse kinetically competitive reaction pathways and active sites ( including unusual ethylene-assimilated species ) in addition to normal chain propagation , were also employed to rationalize polymerization efficiencies . further developments in catalytic applications of multidentate s-aryl ligand systems and novel reactivity of the corresponding complexes can be envisaged . 
ConspectusTransition - metal catalyzed C-H functionalizations became a complementary and efficient bond - forming strategy over the past decade . In this respect , CpRh(III) complexes have emerged as powerful catalysts for a broad spectrum of reactions giving access to synthetically versatile building blocks . despite their high potential , the corresponding catalytic enantioselective transformations largely lag behind . the targeted transformations require all the remaining three coordination sites of the central rhodium atom of the catalyst . In consequence , the chiral information on a competent catalyst can only by stored in the cyclopentadienyl unit . the lack of suitable enabling chiral cyclopentadienyl ( cp < sup > x < / sup > ) ligands is the key hurdle preventing the development of such asymmetric versions . In this respect , an efficient set of chiral cp < sup > x < / sup > ligands useable with a broad variety of different transition - metals can unlock substantial application potential . this account provides a description of our developments of two complementary classes of C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > -symmetric cp < sup > x < / sup > derivatives . we have introduced a side- and back - wall concept to enforce chirality transfer onto the central metal atom . the first generation consists of a fused cyclohexane unit having pseudo axial methyl groups as chiral selectors and a rigidifying acetal moiety . the second ligand generation derives from an atrop - chiral biaryl-backbone and which possesses adjustable substituents at its 3,3'-positions . both ligand families can be modulated in their respective steric bulk to adjust for the specific needs of the targeted application . the cyclopentadienes can be metalated under standard conditions . the corresponding chiral rhodium (I) ethylene complexes are relatively air and moisture and represent storable stable precatalysts for the targeted asymmetric Rh (III) - catalyzed C-H functionalizations . these complexes are then conveniently oxidized in situ by dibenzoyl peroxide to give the reactive cp < sup > x < / sup > Rh(III)(OBz) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > species . for instance , this catalyst is used for directed C-H activations of aryl hydroxamates and the subsequent enantioselective trapping with olefins , providing dihydroisoquinolones in very high enantioselectivities . In addition , we have established highly selective intramolecular trapping reactions with tethered higher substituted alkenes giving dihydrobenzofurans with quaternary stereogenic centers . concerning intermolecular reactions , allene coupling partners allow for an enantioselective hydroarylation yielding substituted allylated compounds . A trapping process of the cyclometalated intermediate with diazo reactants enables the enantioselective construction of isoindolinones . moreover , the catalysts can be used for the construction of atropchiral biaryl motives using a dehydrogenative heck - type reaction . the development of flexibly adjustable chiral cp < sup > x < / sup > ligands is described in this account showcasing their applicability for a variety of Rh (III) catalyzed C-H functionalization reactions . these cp < sup > x < / sup > derivatives hold promise as powerful steering ligands for further transition - metals used in asymmetric catalysis . 
ConspectusTitanium , as the second most abundant transition metal in the earth 's crust , lends itself as a sustainable and inexpensive resource in catalysis . its nontoxicity and biocompatibility are also attractive features for handling and disposal . titanium has excelled as a catalyst for a broad range of transformations , including ethylene and a-olefin polymerizations . however , many reactions relevant to fine chemical synthesis have preferrentially employed late transition metals , and reactive , inexpensive early transition metals have been largely overlooked . In addition to promising reactivity , titanium complexes feature more robust character compared with some other highly lewis-acidic metals such as those found in the lanthanide series . since the advent of modulating ligand scaffolds , titanium has found use in a growing variety of reactions as a versatile homogeneous catalyst . these catalytic transformations include hydrofunctionalization reactions ( adding an element-hydrogen ( E-H ) bond across a C-C multiple bond ) , as well as the ring - opening polymerization of cyclic esters , all of which are atom - economic transformations.Our investigations have focused on tight bite angle monoanionic N,O - chelating ligands , forming four - membered metallacycles . these ligand sets , including amidates , ureates , pyridonates , and sulfonamidates , have flexible binding modes offering a range of stable and reactive intermediates necessary for catalytic activity . additionally , the simple form of these ligands leads to easily prepared proligands , along with facile tuning of steric and electronic factors . A sterically bulky titanium amidate complex has proven to be a leading catalyst for the selective formation of anti-Markovnikov addition products via intermolecular hydroamination of terminal alkynes , while sterically less demanding titanium pyridonates have opened the path to the selective formation of amine substituted cycloalkanes via the intramolecular hydroaminoalkylation of aminoalkenes over the competing hydroamination pathway . sulfonamidates have boosted reactivity for hydrofunctionalization and polymerization reactions compared with amide ligands not bearing a sulfonyl group . N,O - chelated titanium complexes have been used to synthesize ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene and have been utilized in the challenging task of realizing equal incorporation of two different cyclic esters in a random ring - opening copolymerization . these discrete complexes have allowed for careful study of fundamental coordination chemistry and stoichiometric organometallic investigations . with inexpensive starting materials and modular ligands , titanium N,O - chelated complexes are well - suited to address the challenges of achieving greener chemical processes while accessing useful reaction manifolds for sustainable synthesis . 
ConspectusRadical chemistry has witnessed over the last decades important advances that have positioned it as a methodology of choice in synthetic chemistry . A number of great attributes such as specific reactivities , the knowledge of the kinetics of most elementary processes , the functional group tolerance , and the possibility to operate cascade sequences are clearly responsible for this craze . nevertheless , at the end of the last century , radical chemistry appeared plagued by several hurdles to overcome such as the use of environmentally problematic mediators or the impossibility of scale up . while the concept of photocatalysis was firmly established in the coordination chemistry community , its diffusion in organic synthetic chemistry remained sporadic for decades until the end of the 2000s with the breakthrough merging of organocatalysis and photocatalysis by the MacMillan group and contemporary reports by the groups of yoon and stephenson . since then , photoredox catalysis has enjoyed particularly active and intense developments . it is now the topic of a still increasing number of publications featuring various applications from asymmetric synthesis , total synthesis of natural products , and polymerization to process ( flow ) chemistry.In this account , we survey our own efforts in this domain , focusing on the elaboration of new photocatalytic pathways that could lead to the efficient generation of C - centered functionalized alkyl and aryl radicals . both reductive and oxidative manifolds are accessible through photoredox catalysis , which has guided us along these lines in our projects.Thus , we studied the photocatalytic reduction of onium salts such as sulfoniums and iodoniums for the production of the elusive aryl radical intermediates . progressing to more relevant chemistry for synthesis , we examined the cleavage of C-O and the C-Br bonds for the generation of alkyl C - centered radicals . activated epoxides could serve as valuable substrates of a photocatalyzed variant of the Nugent-RajanBabu-Gansauer homolytic cleavage of epoxides . using imidazole based carbamates , we could also devise the first photocatalyzed barton - McCombie deoxygenation reaction . finally , bromophenylacetate can be reduced using the [Au2(m-dppm)2]Cl2 photocatalyst under UVA or visible - light . this was used for the initiation of the controlled atom transfer radical polymerization of methacrylates and acrylates in solution or laminate.Our next endeavors concerned the photocatalyzed oxidation of stabilized carbanions such as enolates of 1,3-dicarbonyl substrates , trifluoroborates , and more extensively bis-catecholato silicates . because of their low oxidation potentials , the later have proved to be exquisite sources of radical entities , which can be engaged in diverse intermolecular reactions such as vinylation , alkynylation , and conjugate additions . the bis-catecholato silicates were also shown to behave as excellent partners of dual photoredox - nickel catalysis leading in an expeditious manner to libraries of cross coupling products . 
ambient ionization mass spectrometry is achieved in a simple manner by loading a sample solution onto a corner of a microscope cover glass positioned in front of the inlet to a mass spectrometer and applying a high voltage to the sample . the resulting stream of charged droplets is stable , has no contamination from the substrate platform , and can be used repeatedly . the utility of droplet spray for in situ analysis and real - time monitoring of chemical reactions was demonstrated by the bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride ( zirconocene dichloride ) / methylaluminoxane , cp < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ClZr < inf > <nUm> < / inf > / MAO , homogeneously catalyzed polymerization of ethylene in various solutions . reaction times ranged from seconds to minutes , and catalytically active species and polymeric products of ethylene were acquired and identified by tandem mass spectrometry . 
the current interest for platinum N - heterocyclic carbene complexes in cancer research stems from their impressive toxicity reported against a range of different human cancer cells . to date , the demonstration of their in vivo efficacy relative to that of established platinum - based drugs has not been specifically addressed . here , we introduce an innovative approach to increase the NHC-Pt complex potency whereby multiple NHC - Pt (II) complexes are coordinated along a polyethylenimine polymer ( PEI ) chain . we show that such NHC-Pt(II)-PEI conjugates induce human cancer cell death in vitro and in vivo in a xenograft mouse model with no observable side effects in contrast to oxaliplatin . additional studies indicate nucleus and mitochondria targeting and suggest various mechanisms of action compared to classical platinum - based anticancer drugs . 
five azo-functionalized coordination polymers ( CPs ) , namely , [ Zn(azbpy)(NO <nUm> -bdc)*H <nUm> O ] n ( 1 ) , [ Zn(azbpy)(NO <nUm> -bdc ) ] n *3H <nUm> O ( 2 ) , { [ Cd(azbpy)(NO <nUm> -bdc)*H <nUm> O]*2H <nUm> O } n ( 3 ) , { [ mn(azbpy) <nUm> ( NO <nUm> -bdc ) ] <nUm> } n ( 4 ) , and { [ Co(azbpy)(NO <nUm> -bdc)(H <nUm> O ) <nUm> ][Co(azbpy) <nUm> ( NO <nUm> -bdc)(H <nUm> O ) <nUm> ] } n ( 5 ) have been synthesized using different transition metal salts with 5-nitro-1,3-benzenedicarboxylate ( NO <nUm> -bdc 2- ) and 4,4'-azobispyridine ( azbpy ) ligand using a slow diffusion technique at room temperature . the complexes 1-5 were characterized by single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis , elemental analysis , infrared spectroscopy ( IR ) , powder x-ray diffraction ( PXRD ) , and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) . In the solid state , compound <nUm> shows a wavy one - dimensional ( 1D ) ladder ; constructed through the N,N' - donor azbpy and NO <nUm> -bdc 2- ligands with the metal centers , whereas compound <nUm> exhibits a bilayer two - dimensional ( 2D ) sheet containing a wavy 1D ladder of metal-carboxylate , and compound <nUm> shows a stairlike wavy 2D sheet . compound <nUm> exhibits a novel 2-fold interdigitated 2D sheet of two similar layers containing pendent azbpy ligands , whereas compound <nUm> displays a polythreaded 2D structure with an intercalated 1D chain into the pore . the solid state luminescence properties of 1-3 along with free N,N' - donor azbpy ligand have been performed at room temperature , where all the complexes 1-3 show azbpy ligand based luminescence property . the gas and solvent vapor adsorption study have been performed for compounds 2-4 , and the dehydrated frameworks of compounds 2-4 exhibit selective CO <nUm> adsorption at <nUm> K over N <nUm> ( at both <nUm> and <nUm> K ) due to the strong interactions between polar pore walls of dehydrated frameworks with the CO <nUm> molecule having quadruple moment . 
A study was conducted to demonstrate the use of discrete cationic complexes for ring - opening polymerization ( ROP ) catalysis of cyclic esters and epoxides . it was demonstrated that in the majority of cases a single reactive nucleophilic group was initially attached to the metal center , and only one polymer chain was generated per metal center . it was seen that discrete cationic metal complexes acted as lewis acids that triggered the cationic ROP of epoxides . 
the remarkable progress in olefin polymerization catalysis and polyolefin technology contributes to sustainable development in manifold ways and helps to meet the urgent demand of the growing world population for cost- , resource- , and energy - efficient as well as environmentally benign materials with a low carbon footprint and facile recycling . the development of multisite catalyst and reactor blend technology will continue to play a prominent role . during the 20th century , in the premetallocene age , many attempts toward multisite and tandem catalysis were commercial failures due to poor process control , which frequently led to the formation of rather ill - defined product mixtures . today , considerably more robust catalyst systems are at hand combining different single - site catalysts in a single multisite catalyst . now it is possible to co-immobilize independent sites , thus preserving their single - site nature , to produce reactor blends in which immiscible polymers are blended together and uniformly dispersed on the nanometer scale . blend composition and properties are primarily governed by the site mixing ratios and the properties of the individual catalyst components . high - throughput screening enables identification of complementary single - site catalysts with matched compatibilities and polymerization kinetics . 
this review describes organometallic compounds and materials that are capable of mediating a rarely encountered but fundamentally important reaction : b-alkyl elimination at the metal-Ca-Cb-R moiety , in which an alkyl group attached to the cb atom is transferred to the metal or to a coordinated substrate . the objectives of this review are to provide a cohesive fundamental understanding of b-alkyl-elimination reactions and to highlight its applications in olefin polymerization , alkane hydrogenolysis , depolymerization of branched polymers , ring - opening polymerization of cycloalkanes , and other useful organic reactions . to provide a coherent understanding of the b-alkyl elimination reaction , special attention is given to conditions and strategies used to facilitate b-alkyl-elimination / transfer events in metal - catalyzed olefin polymerization , which provide the well - studied examples . 
cyclic monomers bearing either vinyl or exomethylene groups have the ability to be polymerized through a radical pathway via a ring - opening mechanism ( addition - fragmentation process ) , leading to the introduction of functionalities in the polymer backbone . radical ring - opening polymerization ( rROP ) combines the advantages of both ring - opening polymerization and radical polymerization , that is the preparation of polymers bearing heteroatoms in the backbone but with the ease and robustness of a radical process . this current review presents a comprehensive description of rROP by detailing : ( i ) the various monomers that polymerize through rROP ; ( ii ) the main parameters that govern the rROP mechanism ; ( iii ) the copolymerization by conventional or controlled / living radical polymerization between rROP monomers and traditional vinyl monomers to obtain copolymers with advanced properties ; ( iv ) the different applications ( low shrinkage materials and preparation of (bio)degradable materials ) of rROP monomer - containing materials , and ( v ) the main alternatives to rROP to induce degradability to materials obtained by a radical polymerization . 
monomers possessing two functionalities suitable for polymerization are often designed and utilized in syntheses directed to the formation of cross-linked macromolecules . In this review , we give an account of recent developments related to the use of such monomers in cyclopolymerization processes , in order to form linear , soluble macromolecules . these processes can be activated by means of radical , ionic , or transition - metal mediated chain - growth polymerization mechanisms , to achieve cyclic moieties of variable ring size which are embedded within the polymer backbone , driving and tuning peculiar physical properties of the resulting macromolecules . the two functionalities are covalently linked by a " tether " , which can be appropriately designed in order to " imprint " elements of chemical information into the polymer backbone during the synthesis and , in some cases , be removed by postpolymerization reactions . the two functionalities can possess identical or even very different reactivities toward the polymerization mechanism involved ; in the latter case , consequences and outcomes related to the sequence - controlled , precision synthesis of macromolecules have been demonstrated . recent advances in new initiating systems and polymerization catalysts enabled the precision syntheses of polymers with regulated cyclic structures by highly regio- and / or stereoselective cyclopolymerization . cyclopolymerizations involving double cyclization , ring - opening , or isomerization have been also developed , generating unique repeating structures , which can hardly be obtained by conventional polymerization methods . 
inspired by the preferential , allosteric binding of RAPTA-T and auranofin to the nucleosome core particle , we describe the design and synthesis of a series of heterobimetallic ruthenium (II) - gold (I) complexes with varying spacer lengths ranging from four to eight polyethylene glycol units . evaluation of their cytotoxicity reveals IC <nUm> values in the low micromolar range against cisplatin sensitive and resistant human ovarian carcinoma ( A2780 , A2780cisR ) and nontumoral human embryonic kidney ( HEK293 ) cell lines . binding studies monitored via mass spectrometry revealed an affinity for histidine residues on a fragment of the amyloid b-protein ( residues 1-16 , employed as a model system ) , which is in accordance with the binding sites of parent drugs , RAPTA-C and auranofin , to the nucleosome core particle . 
highly effective hydroboration precatalyst is developed based on a cobalt(II)-terpyridine coordination polymer ( CP ) . the hydroboration of ketones , aldehydes , and imines with pinacolborane ( HBpin ) has been achieved using the recyclable CP catalyst in the presence of an air - stable activator . A wide range of substrates containing polar C = O or C = N bonds have been hydroborated selectively in excellent yields under ambient conditions . 
A novel precursor to the distonic O- and C - centered radical cations Oxo+O* and Oxo+C* was designed and synthesized , which represents model systems for radicals produced during polyester degradation . the precursor is equipped with a nitrate functional group , which serves as a masked site for these alkoxyl and carbon radicals that are unleashed through collision - induced dissociation ( CID ) . Oxo+O* and Oxo+C* feature a cyclic carboxonium ion as permanent charge tag to enable monitoring their ion - molecule reactions on the millisecond to second time scale in the ion trap of the mass spectrometer . the reactions of Oxo+O* and Oxo+C* with cyclohexene , cyclohexadiene , ethyl acetate , 1,1-dimethoxyethane , and 1,2-dimethoxyethane , which exhibit structural features present in both intact and defective polyesters , were explored through product and kinetic studies to identify " hot spots " for radical - induced damage in polyesters . all reactions with Oxo+O* were extremely fast and proceeded predominantly through HAT . Oxo+C* was about two orders of magnitude less reactive and did not noticeably damage aliphatic ester moieties through hydrogen abstraction on the time scale of our experiments . radical addition to alkene π systems was identified as an important pathway for c-radicals , which needs to be included in polymer degradation mechanisms . 
A series of neutrally charged Ni (II) phenoxyiminato catalysts with fluorine atoms at different positions on the n-terphenyl motif are synthesized , and their abilities to polymerize ethylene are compared . At <nUm> ° C , the ortho-fluorinated Ni-5F , Ni-3F' , and Ni-2F achieve significantly higher polymerization activities than Ni-3F and Ni-0F . In addition , branch density and molecular weight of the obtained polyethylenes vary gradually in the order of Ni-5F , Ni-3F , Ni-3F' , Ni-2F , and Ni-0F . based on the x-ray crystal structure and < sup > <nUm> < / sup > F NMR spectra , the ortho fluorine atoms are found to make terphenyl groups more rigid and bulky . theoretical calculations suggest that the increased steric bulk of terphenyl motif leads to an increase in the ground state energy of the resting state species relative to the migratory insertion transition state , and consequently , lowered migratory insertion barriers are expected in Ni-5F , Ni-3F' , and Ni-2F . on the other hand , the weak hydrogen bonding between the ortho fluorine atoms and coordinated ethylene in insertion transition state is also proposed in favor of insertion . similar to previous reports , polyethylene microstructure was mainly related to electronic effects of fluorine atoms . ( figure presented ) . 
we report the design , synthesis , and physical / mechanical properties of graft copolymers containing semicrystalline polypropylene side chains and amorphous ethylene / a-olefin copolymer backbones . these materials , a new class of semicrystalline , polyolefin - based thermoplastic elastomers , are made in two steps . first , allyl-terminated syndiotactic or isotactic polypropylene macromonomers are synthesized with controlled microstructure and molecular weight using bis(phenoxyimine)titanium or chiral ansa - zirconocene catalysts , respectively . second , a pyridyl-amido hafnium catalyst is used to copolymerize the macromonomer , ethylene , and an a-olefin with precise control of composition and side chain incorporation . with highly crystalline polypropylene side chains and amorphous backbones of low glass - transition temperatures ( < <nUm> ° C ) , the samples have strain - to - break values up to <nUm> % and elastic recovery above <nUm> % at maximum strains up to <nUm> % . the synthetic method described herein does not require the use of a living polymerization catalyst ; in addition , the mechanical properties of these graft copolymers exceed those of the best linear block polyolefins . 
highly efficient synthesis of cyclic olefin ( CO ) copolymers with high glass transition temperatures ( tg ) as well as high catalytic activity have been attained not only by copolymerization of norbornene ( NBE ) with a-olefins ( 1-hexene , 1-octene , 1-dodecene ) , but also by copolymerization of tetracyclododecene ( TCD ) with a-olefins using half - titanocene catalysts , Cp'TiCl2(N = CtBu2 ) [ cp' = tBuC5H4 ( 1 ) , cp ( 2 ) ] in the presence of MAO . linear relationships between the tg values and the NBE or TCD contents were observed in all cases ; tg values in poly(TCD-co-a-olefin)s were higher than those in poly(NBE-co-a-olefin)s with the same CO contents . NBE and TCD incorporations in these copolymerization under high NBE or TCD feed conditions ( especially by <nUm> ) were not affected by a-olefin ( number of methylene units in the side chain ) employed . an introduction of terminal olefinic double bond into the polymer side chain could be attained , if the copolymerization of NBE with 1-octene by <nUm> was conducted in the presence of 1,7-octadiene . 
cyclopolymerization of bis(diazocarbonyl) compounds is described for the first time . by choosing appropriate reaction conditions and monomer structures , the cyclopolymerization of bis(diazoacetate)s efficiently proceeded to give carbon-carbon main chain cyclopolymers with well - defined structures , as confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS analyses . the products are a new kind of cyclopolymer with respect to polymer structure : there exists no free methylene in the sp3-carbon - based polymer backbone in contrast to conventional cyclopolymers prepared from divinyl compounds , which inevitably have free methylenes in and between cyclic units in their polymer backbones . the resulting cyclopolymers with closely aligned cyclic units along the polymer backbone showed a much higher glass transition temperature compared to the corresponding polymers without cyclized repeating units . 
the synthesis and characterization of polyethylene-polyester block and graft copolymers and their potential as compatibilizers in polyethylene-based polymer blends are being described . the various routes to functionalized polyethylenes and the corresponding block / graft copolymers have been compared and evaluated for their scalability to industrial scale production . hydroxyl chain - end and randomly OH - functionalized HDPE as well as randomly OH - functionalized LLDPE were employed as macroinitiators for producing the corresponding block and graft copolymers . these materials were prepared using two different strategies . the graf ting from approach entails catalytic ring - opening polymerization of lactones , i.e. , [?]-caprolactone and o-pentadecalactone and hydroxyl-functionalized polyethylenes as macroinitiator . the alternative graf ting onto approach involves the preparation of block and graft copolymers via simple and convenient transesterification of polycaprolactone or polypentadecalactone with OH - functionalized polyethylenes . the copolymers were characterized in terms of their molecular weight ( SEC ) , chemical structure ( liquid state NMR ) , topology ( MALDI-ToF-MS ) , supramolecular assembly ( solid state NMR ) , and thermal properties ( DSC analysis ) . the applied techniques for synthesizing the copolymers allow preparation of the products with sufficiently high molecular weight of the final materials . the copolymers were tested as compatibilizers for polyethylene / polycarbonate blends . As proven by SEM analysis , addition of the compatibilizers resulted in a significant improvement of the blend morphology . 
A novel anthracene - containing isotactic polypropylene ( an - iPP ) with high molecular weight ( > <nUm> × <nUm> ) and satisfying incorporation ( <nUm> mol % ) was synthesized via direct copolymerization of propylene and 9-hexenylanthracene . the pendent anthryl group of the resulting an - iPP is quite active , and this provides a facile and efficient avenue to synthesize various functional iPPs . As a typical and important example , maleic anhydride ( MA ) functionalized polypropylene , was successfully prepared in a highly efficient , catalyst - free , byproduct - free , and controllable way via mild diels - alder ( D-A ) reaction between pendent anthryl groups and MA . more importantly , the D-A functionalization process did not sacrifice the original properties of the an - iPP , as no unfavorable degradation and cross-linking were detected in DSC and GPC analyses . besides MA , several other dienophiles could also be conveniently used as functional reagents to prepare various functionalized iPPs with distinct properties . the unique fluorescent property of an - iPP was studied and could be used for functionalization process monitoring . 
chiral and achiral b-turn mimetic polymer conjugates were synthesized , and their chiroptical properties were investigated . chiral helical poly(n - hexyl isocyanate)s ( CsHIP ) with alkyne functional end groups ( <nUm> - <nUm> kDa ) were synthesized via coordination polymerization using either a chiral or an achiral alkyne - functional organotitanium catalyst . the obtained helical polymers were coupled with a chiral b-turn mimetic structure using the copper - catalyzed azide / alkyne cycloaddition ( CuAAC ) reaction , in turn allowing to tune the distance between the PHIC - helix and the chiral center from <nUm> to <nUm> Å . the successful linkage of the PHIC - helix to the b-turn mimetic was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) , high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) , 1H NMR spectroscopy , and MALDI - ToF mass spectrometry , proving the attachment of either one or two PHIC - helices to the central b-turn . circular dichroism ( CD ) spectra confirmed chirality induction from the chiral b-turn mimetic structure to the polymer backbone of the achiral PHIC over five chemical bonds via postpolymerization modification , and revealed a distance - dependent effect for the transmission of stereochemical information . In contrast , a linkage effect leading to reduced chirality was observed when an additional linker unit was incorporated in-between the b-turn mimetic structure and the polymer backbone . the reported data do show that transfer of chirality is possible after polymerization over a relatively short distance of atoms . 
A comprehensive picture of insertion of 1,1-disubstituted difunctional olefins , their ability to double the functional group density at the same level of incorporation as that of monofunctional olefin , and copolymerization with ethylene has been demonstrated . exposure of a palladium complex [ { P- }PdMe(L) ] ( P- = k2-P,O-Ar2PC6H4SO2O with Ar = 2-MeOC6H4 ; L = C2H6OS ) to methyl 2-acetamidoacrylate ( MAAA ) revealed slight preference for 1,2-insertion over 2,1-insertion ( <nUm> : <nUm> ) . In contrast , insertion of electron - deficient 2-(trifluoromethyl)acrylic acid ( TFMAA ) unveiled selective 2,1-insertion { via [(P-)PdC5H6F3O2] ( 11 ) } . the unstable intermediate <nUm> undergoes b-hydride and b-fluoride elimination to produce subsequent insertion and elimination products . the identity of elimination products ( e / z)-2-trifluoromethyl)but-2-enoic acid [ <nUm> ( e / z ) ] and 2-(difluoromethylene)butanoic acid ( 13 ) was fully established by 1-2D NMR spectroscopy . these insertion experiments , taken together with insertion rates , suggest that MAAA and TFMAA are amenable to insertion . polymerization of ethylene with MAAA , TFMAA , acetamidoacrylic acid , 2-bromoacrylic acid , dimethyl allylmalonate , and allylmalonic acid was catalyzed by [{P-}PdMe(L)] ( L = C2H3N ) ( 5.ACN ) , and the highest incorporation of <nUm> % was observed for dimethyl allylmalonate ( DMAM ) . the changes in the surface properties of the copolymers after incorporation of difunctional olefins were evaluated by measuring the water contact angle . copolymer with highest ( <nUm> % of DMAM ) incorporation revealed a reduced water contact angle of <nUm> ° . these findings demonstrate that 1,1-disubstituted difunctional olefins are amenable to polymerization , and incorporation of difunctional olefins in polyethylene backbone leads to the production of relatively hydrophilic polyethylene copolymers . 
herein , we present a novel synthetic strategy , to amino-acid - free peptide synthesis based on postpolymerization conversion , for chiral nonnatural polypeptides . optically active poly-N-alkoxyamides were prepared by our asymmetric polymerization as precursors of polypeptides , and the reductive cleavage of N-O bonds using a I2Sm - THF complex was carried out . the reaction proceeded smoothly with quantitative conversion to afford a nonnatural polypeptide . the resulting polypeptide adopted a one - handed stable helical structure in solution , which was established by circular dichroism ( CD ) and theoretical calculations using density functional theory ( DFT ) . the simulated spectra by time - dependent ( TD ) DFT methods clearly indicated the validity of the proposed structure . the synthetic approach is a promising candidate for the synthesis of nonnatural polypeptides . 
the polymerization of halide - substituted styrenes ( XSt ) and their copolymerization with styrene by half - sandwich scandium catalysts with and without a THF ligand have been examined . the THF - free aminobenzyl scandium complex (C5Me4SiMe3)Sc(CH2C6H4NMe2-o)2 ( 2 ) in combination with <nUm> equiv of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] showed high activity and excellent syndiotacticity for the polymerization of the halide - substituted styrenes ( XSt = p- , o- , and m-ClSt , p-FSt , p-BrSt , and p-ISt ) . despite the presence of the electron - withdrawing halogen substituent on the aromatic ring , the polymerization activity reached up to <nUm> g of polymer molSc <nUm> h-1 with syndiotacticity ( rrrr ) up to <nUm> % . this constitutes the first example of the syndiospecific polymerization of halogenated styrenes with high activity and high stereoselectivity . moreover , the syndiospecific copolymerization of XSt with styrene has also been achieved by this catalyst , which afforded the corresponding syndiotactic copolymers with high molecular weight and a controllable amount of the halogenated styrene units . In contrast , the THF - containing trimethylsilylmethyl scandium complex (C5Me4SiMe3)Sc(CH2SiMe3)2(THF) ( 1 ) showed high activity and high syndiotacticity for the polymerization of m-ClSt but gave atactic polymers in the polymerization of p- and o-ClSt , p-BrSt , and p-ISt , while a mixture of syndiotactic and atactic polymers was yielded in the case of p-FSt . the copolymerization of XSt with styrene by complex <nUm> was also achieved , but the stereoselectivity and comonomer distribution sequences in the resulting copolymers were significantly different from those obtained by using complex <nUm> . 
with a multitude of potential applications , poly(phosphine-borane)s are an interesting class of polymer comprising main - group elements within the inorganic polymer backbone . A new family of primary alkylphosphine - borane polymers was synthesized by a solvent - free rhodium - catalyzed dehydrocoupling reaction and characterized by conventional chemicophysical techniques . the thermal stability of the polymers is strongly affected by the size and shape of the alkyl side chain with longer substituents imparting greater stability . the polymers show substantial stability toward UV illumination and immersion in water ; however , they undergo a loss of alkylphosphine units during thermal degradation . the polymers exhibit glass transition temperatures ( tg ) as low as <nUm> ° C . A group interaction model ( GIM ) framework was developed to allow the semiquantitative prediction of tg values , and the properties of the materials in this study were used to validate the model . 
solution copolymerizations of ethylene and 1-hexene were performed using the dichloride ( Cl2Hf ) and dimethyl ( HfMe2 ) analogues of the bis(n-propylcyclopentadienyl)hafnium precatalyst . tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate dimethylanilinium salt ( [B(C6F5)4]-[Me2NHPh]+ ) ( B ) or methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) was employed as activator , and tri-n-octylaluminum ( TOA ) was used as scavenger . crystallization analysis fractionation ( CRYSTAF ) or crystallization elution fractionation ( CEF ) was used to measure the chemical composition distributions ( CCD ) . above a minimum 1-hexene threshold concentration , the CCD profiles of all copolymers were bimodal , and the areas under the peaks depended on the B / Cl2Hf and B / Al ratios . decreasing the TOA concentration reduced the weight fraction of the higher crystallinity copolymer . copolymerizations using MAO also produced copolymers with bimodal CCDs . copolymerizations using HfMe2 / B without TOA produced copolymers with unimodal CCD . these results suggest that TOA reacts with either the catalyst or the activator , generating a new active site with a lower propensity for incorporating comonomer than the original catalyst system . 
we showcase the stability of aromatic azaborine derivatives by demonstrating the syndioselective polymerization of BN 2-vinylnaphthalene ( BN3V ) by a monocyclopentadienyl titanium complex . homogeneous early transition metal catalysts are well - established systems for the synthesis of highly stereoregular syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) , but the oxophilic nature of these complexes results in catalyst decomposition with polar monomers . BN3V 's compatibility with coordination polymerization , and its ability to intercept the mechanism of styrene polymerization , is attributed to its aromaticity . stereoretentive postpolymerization oxidation of the organoborane side chain generates syndiotactic poly(vinyl alcohol ) ( sPVA ) , an example of BN3PV 's potential for diverse postfunctionalization . 
radical initiation of methyl methacrylate polymerizations mediated by titanium amino-phenolate complexes gave exceptional control without the need for any cocatalyst or activator . the polymerization proceeds not by a classical controlled radical or coordination insertion mechanism but via a unique bimetallic group transfer process . detailed experimental and computational studies support a polymerization mechanism with a titanium(IV) - enolate complex and a second titanium (III) complex that delivers an activated monomer and provides new insight into both titanium - mediated radical reactions and polymerizations . 
In comparison with hundreds of literature reports on palladium catalyzed (co)polymerization using polar vinyl monomers , studies on palladium catalyzed (co)polymerization using polar styrene monomers have received much less attention and remains almost unexplored . In this contribution , by employing the benchmark cationic a-diimine and neutral phosphine - sulfonate palladium catalysts <nUm> and <nUm> , a comprehensive picture on (co)polymerization of polar styrene monomers including o-F , o-Cl , o-MeO , o-CN , o-OH , o-COOH , o-CHO , o-NO2 , o-NH2 , o-NMe2 , o-PPh2 , m-F , m-MeO , p-F , p-MeO , p-vinyl , and 2,3,4,5,6-F5 functional groups was built . by utilizing the cationic catalyst <nUm> , due to the formation of the cationic p-e3-benzyl chelate , homopolymerization of polar styrene monomers and the copolymerization with ethylene only generated atactic polar styrene homopolymers or produced no polymer , depending on the type of polar styrene monomers . In contrast , by using the neutral catalyst <nUm> , homopolymerization of polar styrene monomers was not possible , but copolymerization with ethylene showed good activities ( up to <nUm> kg mol-1 h-1 ) to afford a family of new ethylene / polar styrene copolymers with high incorporations ( up to <nUm> mol % ) . interestingly , the incorporated comonomer units are prone to an average distribution at the saturated chain end , in-chain , and unsaturated chain end . the origin of this unexpected observation was explored through stoichiometric insertion studies using selected polar styrene comonomers . 
the C / C coupling activity of the cationic Re (III) species [(C5H5)ReBr]+ with different heteroatom - substituted alkynes was investigated . by using the sulfide - substituted bis(benzylsulfanyl)acetylene an unprecedented rhenacyclopentatriene complex was obtained . an XRD structure determination of [(C5H5)ReBr(CSBn)4]+ uncovered the coordination of the remote ethylene moiety at Re leading to an e4-coordination mode of the C4(SBn)4 ligand and a folded five - membered metallacycle . In contrast , reaction of the monoalkyne complex [(C5H5)ReBr(CSBn)2]+ with diphenylacetylene as well as diiodoacetylene led to the mixed bis(alkyne) complexes . the different behavior is attributed to kinetic reasons according to DFT calculations . XRD as well as IR studies with the cationic bis(alkyne) complexes [(C5H5)ReBr(CSBn)2(C2Ph2)]+ and [(C5H5)ReBr(CSBn)2(C2I2)]+ revealed clear differences in the bond strengths of the coordinated alkynes at the same metal center . further investigations on the coupling activity resulted in addition products with H2O and a trimerization of two diphenylacetylene molecules and one bis(benzylsulfanyl)acetylene , both as byproducts and involved in a sulfide bond cleavage . 
the synthesis of various titanatranes containing tris(aryloxo)amine ligands , TiX[{(O-2,4-R2C6H2)-6-CH2}3N] [ r = me ( 1 ) , tBu ( 2 ) ; x = OiPr ( a ) , OtBu ( b ) , C3F6HO ( c ) , C4F9O ( d ) , Cl ( e ) ] , and some reactions with Al alkyls have been explored . the Ti-Al heterobimetallic complexes [TiMe{(O-2,4-Me2C6H2-6-CH2)2(m2-O-2,4-Me2-C6H2-6-CH2)}N]-[Me2Al(m2-OR')] [ R' = tBu ( 3b ) , C3F6H ( 3c ) , C4F9 ( 3d ) ] were isolated by reaction of 1b-d with <nUm> equiv of AlMe3 , whereas reaction of 2b with AlMe3 in toluene did not take place under the same conditions , and the reaction of 2c afforded the methyl complex TiMe[{(O-2,4-tBu2C6H2)-6-CH2}3N] . structures of 3b,c were determined by x-ray crystallography . these complexes exhibited high catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization in n-octane in the presence of MAO , and the activity by <nUm> and <nUm> was affected by the terminal donor ligand ( x ) as well as the substituent on the atrane ligand ( r ) . the activities by 1c,d increased upon addition of AlMe3 , and the corresponding heterobimetallic complexes ( 3c,d ) showed high activities , whereas an increase in the activity upon addition of AlMe3 was not observed by 1b,e , and 2c,e . 
we describe and compare the proposed mechanisms of ethene polymerization by the metallocene / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) catalyst in terms of quantum chemical calculations . In combination with the cp < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ZrMe < inf > <nUm> < / inf > precatalyst , we employ two models for MAO , produced by hydrolysis of trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) . both MAOs contain associated TMA as a key ingredient for cocatalytic activity . the TMA association / dissociation equilibrium in the MAOs controls the mechanism of catalyst activation and suggests preference for catalyst activation via [ AlMe < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ] < sup > + < / sup > abstraction from the MAO by the precatalyst rather than via lewis-acidic abstraction of the leaving group from the precatalyst by the MAO . solvent interactions increase the relative concentration of lewis-acidic sites . chlorination of MAO facilitates the catalytic processes . studies as a function of precatalyst structure reproduce the general experimental observations of the easier catalyst activation by zirconocenes than by hafnocenes and the positive effects of adding a dimethylsilyl bridge and replacing the cyclopentadienyl with an indenyl ligand . this study provides a starting point for rational control of the behavior of the metallocene / MAO catalyst system .

immobilized decamethylzirconocene methyl cation on a silica support was generated by treatment of Cp*2ZrMe2 with tethered borate activator [(SiO2)x(Al(iBu)n(OC6H4B(C6F5)3)2-n][R2R'NH] ( NEt : r = R' = et or NPh : r = me ; R' = ph ) . the concentration of [Cp*2ZrMe]+ on the support was quantified using a newly developed and straightforward method that involves trapping and releasing the active species by subsequent treatment with vinyl methyl thioethers ( CH2CH(CH2)nSMe , n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) and ammonium bromide , [Bu4N]Br , followed by quantification using simple 1H NMR spectroscopic tools . reaction of [Cp*2ZrMe]+ with the trapping agent results in formation of stable metallacycle [Cp*2Zr(CH2CHMe(CH2)nSMe)]+ ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) ; ion exchange in Cp*2Zr(Br)(CH2CHMe(CH2)nSMe) ( n = <nUm> ) . this affords a measure for the number of ionic species that were initially present on the support . In this particular case , full conversion of the decamethyl zirconocene precursor to the corresponding cation , [Cp*2ZrMe]+ , was observed . whereas trapping with allyl methyl thioether renders a species that is not active in olefin polymerization catalysis , using butenyl methyl thioether as trapping agent provided a species that is catalytically active in the polymerization of olefins . furthermore , this study shows that the fate of ionic [Cp*2ZrMe]+ is the same on the support as it is in solution phase . 
three examples of discrete six - coordinate O,Npy,N - bearing titanium(IV) trifluoride complexes , [{2-(C5H4N)-6-(CMe2O)C5H3N}TiF3] ( 1 ) , [ { 2-(C6H4-2'-O),6-(CM = N(2,6-i-Pr2C6H3))C5H3N}TiF3 ] ( 2a ) , and [ { 2-(3-C12H8-2-O)-6-(CM = N(2,6-i-Pr2C6H3))C5H3N}TiF3 ] ( 3a ) , were prepared using a one - step HF elimination protocol from cis-[(THF)2TiF4] and the corresponding pincer ligand precursor ( HL1 , HL2H , and HL2Ph ) . A mer configuration of the three fluoride ligands is adopted in their solid - state structures , which is mirrored in solution , as shown by mutual two - bond F-F coupling in their 19F{1H} NMR spectra . for purposes of comparison , the chloride counterparts of 2a and 3a , [ { 2-(C6H4-2'-O),6-(CM = N(2,6-i-Pr2C6H3)C5H3N}TiCl3 ] ( 2b ) and [ { 2-(3-C12H8-2-O)-6-(CM = N(2,6-i-Pr2C6H3))C5H3N}TiCl3 ] ( 3b ) , are also reported . on treatment with excess MAO , <nUm> is scarcely active in ethylene polymerization , 2a is more active , and the most sterically protected system , 3a , represents the most active nonmetallocene metal - fluoride precatalyst reported to date ( <nUm> g mmol-1 h-1 bar-1 ) and produces ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene ( UHMWPE ) . similar structure - activity correlations are displayed for chloride - containing 2b and 3b , but , in general , they are significantly more active than their fluoride counterparts , with 3b being the most productive of the series ( <nUm> g mmol-1 h-1 bar-1 ) . using fluoride rather than chloride in the precatalyst has a marked effect on not only the molecular weight but also the molecular weight distribution , with broad dispersities being a feature of the polymers obtained from 2a and 3a , whereas those for chloride - containing 2b and 3b are appreciably narrower . single - crystal x-ray structures are reported for <nUm> , 2a , 2b , and 3a . 
the highly lewis acidic , cationic aluminum species [DIPP-nacnacAlMe]+[B(C6F5)4]- ( <nUm> , DIPP - nacnac = [HC{C(Me)N(2,6-iPr2C6H3)}2]- ) has been shown to undergo reactions with a wide variety of small molecules , in both the presence and absence of an external weak phosphine base , PPh3 . cycloaddition reactions of unsaturated C-C bonds across the aluminum diketiminate framework are reported , and the first structural confirmation of this type of cycloaddition product is presented . addition of PPh3 to <nUm> produces the cationic aluminum phosphine complex [DIPP-nacnacAl(Me)PPh3]+[B(C6F5)4]- , which undergoes fluxional dissociation / coordination of the phosphine in solution . this weak Al-P interaction can be utilized in frustrated lewis pair type reactions to activate alkenes , alkynes , CO2 , propylene oxide , and the C-Cl bonds of CCl2H2 . the CO2 adduct [DIPP-nacnacAl(Me)OC(PPh3)O]+[B(C6F5)4]- undergoes further stoichiometric reduction with Et3SiH to produce an aluminum formate species . 
discrete ionic complexes belonging to two main families of highly isoselective polymerization zirconocene systems , C1 - symmetric { cp / flu } ( a,b ) and C2 - symmetric {SBI} ( c ) systems , have been scrutinized . the ion pair reorganization processes for inner - sphere ion pairs ( ISIPs ) 3a,b-MeB(C6F5)3 , 3c-MeB(C6F5)3 , and 3c-MeAl(C6F5)3 and for the outer - sphere ion pair ( OSIP ) AlMe3 adducts [6b,c]+[B(C6F5)4]- , quantified by dynamic NMR analysis , were found to feature lower activation barriers for the {SBI} - based systems in comparison to those for the { cp / flu } - based congeners . the higher electrophilic character of the { cp / flu } - based cationic systems was corroborated by UV / vis spectroscopy studies coupled with TD - DFT calculations . these fundamental differences between the ionic systems of the two metallocene families are discussed in light of their respective propylene polymerization performances , and reasons for the higher productivity of {SBI} systems in comparison to {Cp-Flu} systems are proposed . 
A series of heterobimetallic Zr-Al complexes , [ZrCl{(O-2,4-tBu2C6H2-6-CH2)3(m2-O-2,4-tBu2-C6H2-6-CH2)}N][R2Al(m2-OiPr)] [ r = me ( 3 ) , et ( 4 ) ] and [ZrR{(O-2,4-tBu2C6H2-6-CH2)3(m2-O-2,4-tBu2-C6H2-6-CH2)}N][R2Al(m2-OiPr)] [ r = et ( 5 ) , iBu ( 6 ) ] , have been prepared by reactions of Zr(OiPr)[(O-2,4-tBu2C6H2-6-CH2)3N] ( 1 ) with <nUm> equiv of Al alkyls ( Me2AlCl , Et2AlCl , AlEt3 , and AliBu3 ) , and their structures ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) were determined by x-ray crystallography . the isobutyl complex ( 6 ) is stable in C6D6 and toluene-d6 at <nUm> ° C ; the thermolysis of <nUm> at > <nUm> ° C gradually afforded <nUm> with liberation of AliBu3 . these complexes exhibited remarkable catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization at 80-120 ° C in the presence of MAO ; only complex <nUm> exhibited the high activity even at 45-60 ° C . 
A pendant nitrile group attached to the lithium cyclopentadienide moiety in (C5H4CMe2CMe2CN)Li was alkylated using organyl lithium reagents ( RLi , r = ph , t-Bu , me ) , giving rise to dianionic cyclopentadienyl-ketimides [ C5H4CMe2CMe2C ( r ) = N]Li2 , which were subsequently utilized as chelating ligands for the synthesis of group <nUm> bent metallocene or half - sandwich complexes ( <nUm> examples of the types [ (e5-C5R'5){e5-C5H4CMe2CMe2C ( r ) = N-kN}MCl ] , R' = H or me , m = Ti , Zr , or Hf , and [ { e5-C5H4CMe2CMe2C ( r ) = N-kN}TiX2 ] , x = Cl or NMe2 , respectively , were prepared and characterized ) . consecutive protolysis of the intramolecularly bound ketimide moiety in bent metallocenes afforded pendant imine or cationic iminium moieties , respectively , attached to group <nUm> organometallic fragments . selected compounds were used as precatalysts in a preliminary screening for ethylene polymerization activity . 
the synthesis of mixed (aryloxo)(imidazolin-2-iminato)titanium dichloride complexes is presented . full characterization of the complexes , including solid - state x-ray diffraction analysis of four complexes , is reported . their catalytic activity in the polymerization of ethylene , propylene , 1-hexene , and 1-octene was studied . the different substituents at the aryloxo moiety were found to have a substantial impact on the reactivity of the complexes , indicating the need for a balance of steric and electronic effects . the complex (1,3-di-tert-butylimidazolin-2-iminato)(2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxide)titanium dichloride ( 1 ) was found to be the most active in the polymerization of ethylene , whereas the complex (1,3-di-tert-butylimidazolin-2-iminato)(2,6-di-tert-butylphenoxide)titanium dichloride ( 2 ) was found to be the most active in the polymerization of propylene . interestingly , all complexes were more active in the polymerization of propylene than in that of ethylene . 
synthesis and structural analysis of a series of half - titanocenes containing chlorinated phenoxy ligands of the type Cp'TiCl2(OAr) [ cp' = cp , Ar = 2,6-Cl2C6H3 ( 1 ) , 2,4,6-Cl3C6H2 ( 2 ) , C6Cl5 ( 3 ) ; cp' = indenyl , Ar = 2,6-Cl2C6H3 ( 4 ) , 2,4,6-Cl3C6H2 ( 5 ) , C6Cl5 ( 6 ) ] and CpTiMe2(OAr) [ Ar = 2,4,6-Cl3C6H2 ( 9 ) , C6Cl5 ( 10 ) ] have been explored . the Ti-O bond distances in 1-3 are apparently longer than those of the reported aryloxo-modified half - titanocenes , and the Ti-O-C(in phenyl ) angles in 1-3 are also rather small . the cp analogues ( 1-3 ) exhibited higher catalytic activities than the reported (indenyl)TiCl2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) in ethylene copolymerization with norbornene ( NBE ) in the presence of MAO ; these complexes ( 1-3 ) also showed better NBE incorporation than those reported previously . 
an indene based borata - alkene was used as a reagent for the synthesis of BC12F10 - functionalized group <nUm> bent - metallocene complexes . the respective borata - alkene was prepared by BC12F10H hydroboration of dimethylbenzofulvene followed by deprotonation with lithium tetramethylpiperidide . treatment of CpTiCl3 or CpZrCl3 with the borata - alkene gave the respective [(C6F5)2B-indenyl]CpMCl2 bent - metallocene complexes . both were characterized by x-ray diffraction . the boryl-functionalized metallocenes gave active ethene or propene polymerization catalysts , respectively , upon activation with triethylaluminum . 
the catalytic polymerization of silafluorenes with [Ni(dmpe)2] ( dmpe = 1,2-bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane ) afforded 2,7-dibutoxy-9H-9-silafluorene polymers with a narrow polydispersity ( mw / Mn < <nUm> ) . In an open vessel , the polymerization ceased shortly after complete consumption of the monomer , but transfer of the reaction mixture into a closed system resumed the polymer growth . polymerization in a closed system with occasional removal of the evolved H furnished soluble polymers with a maximum molecular weight of Mn = <nUm> . treatment of a 2,7-dibutoxy-9H-9-silafluorene tetramer with [Ni(dmpe)2] resulted in the initial formation of a mixture of monomers and trimers , which subsequently transformed into oligomers ( si1 - si9 ) . this polymerization involves a preferential dehydrogenative condensation between the monomer and an oligomer relative to that between oligomers , while the presence of H regenerates the monomer after its consumption and thus promotes further polymer growth . 
two novel silyl-bridged C2 - symmetric ( 2-methyl-4-aryl-7-methoxy ) substituted bisindenyl based ansa - hafnocene complexes of varied steric demand ( I , 4-phenyl ; II , 4-[(3',5'-methyl)-phenyl] ) were synthesized and examined in the coordinative polymerization of propene . both complexes enable a comparative study with the state of the art homogeneous metallocene catalyst ( III , 4-[(3',5'-tert-butyl)-phenyl] ) for high melting ultrahigh molecular weight isotactic polypropylene . all three activated complexes exhibit extremely concise stereoregularity along with high molecular weights and high melting transitions at low to moderate polymerization temperatures . increased sterical encumbrance of the 4-aryl substituent prevents the process of chain release reactions more effectively , especially due to enhanced reduction of b-methyl elimination . accordingly , end group analysis disclosed the highest selectivity toward allylic chain ends as a result of b-methyl elimination with the less sterically encumbered complex I . examination of the catalytic activity of I-III disclosed considerable impact of the varied 4-aryl substituents on the maximum productivity with respect to the applied polymerization conditions considering the combined influence of activation , monomer diffusion rate , catalyst deactivation , and rate of chain growth . 
toward gaining insight into the behavior of bimetallic catalysts for olefin polymerization , a series of structurally related binuclear zirconium catalysts with bisamine bisphenolate and pyridine bisphenolate ligands connected by rigid teraryl units were synthesized . anthracene-9,10-diyl and 2,3,5,6-tetramethylbenzene-1,4-diyl were employed as linkers . bulky SiiPr3 and SiPh3 substituents were used in the position ortho to the phenolate oxygen . Pseudo-Cs and C2 symmetric isomers are observed for the binuclear complexes of bisamine bisphenolate ligands . In general , binuclear catalysts show higher isotacticity compared to the monozirconium analogues , with some differences between isomers . amine bisphenolate - supported dizirconium complexes were found to be moderately active ( up to <nUm> kg mmolZr-1 h-1 ) for the polymerization of 1-hexene to isotactically enriched poly-1-hexene ( up to <nUm> % mmmm ) in the presence of stoichiometric trityl or anilinium borate activators . moderate activity was observed for the production of isotactically enriched polypropylene ( up to <nUm> kg mmolZr-1 h-1 and up to <nUm> % mmmm ) . the previously proposed model for tacticity control based on distal steric effects from the second metal site is consistent with the observed behavior . both bisamine bisphenolate and pyridine bisphenolate supported complexes are active for the production of polyethylene in the presence of MAO with activities in the range of <nUm> - <nUm> kg mmolZr-1 h-1 and copolymerize ethylene with a-olefins . little difference in the level of a-olefin incorporation is observed between mono- and dinuclear catalysts supported with the pyridine bisphenolate catalysts . In contrast , the size of the olefin affects the level of incorporation differently between monometallic and bimetallic catalysts for the bisamine bisphenolate system . the ratio of the incorporation levels with dinuclear vs mononuclear catalysts decreases with increasing comonomer size . this effect is attributed to steric pressure provided by the distal metal center on the larger olefin in dinuclear catalysts . 
two novel silyl-bridged C2 - symmetric 2-methyl-4-aryl-7-methoxysubstituted bis-indenyl-based titanocene complexes with varied steric demand ( a , 4-(3',5'-dimethyl)phenyl ; b , 4-(3',5'-di-tert-butyl)phenyl ) were synthesized , characterized , and examined in the coordination polymerization of propene . both adapted ligand structures have proven their capability as precise catalysts in the formation of stereodefect- and regiodefect - free isotactic polypropylene . several activation pathways to the catalytically active , cationic complexes were analyzed in terms of catalytic activity and stability , taking into account the influence of polymerization temperature , monomer concentration , polymerization time , and type of applied scavenger . the overall lowest activities were observed using the methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) activated catalyst . the two - step activation mechanism of in situ alkylation with an excess of triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) and subsequent addition of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] resulted in moderate productivities of the respective catalyst systems . however , the highest catalytic activities were observed when eliminating the in situ alkylation step by application of bis-methylated titanocenes in combination with [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] . the latter activation mechanism in combination with the sterically more encumbered ligand framework b results in the most productive titanium - based metallocene catalyst for the polymerization of propene to date , at least with respect to reasonable reaction times . the determined molecular weights of the produced polymers were significantly affected by the ligand structures a and b but were only negligibly influenced by the applied activation method . end - group analysis via 1H NMR spectroscopy disclosed a chain release mechanism dominated by b-hydride elimination . In accordance with the observed accurate stereo- and regiocontrol mechanism , extraordinarily high melting transitions of up to <nUm> ° C ( ex reactor ) underline the remarkable potential of these titanium - based catalyst systems in the polymerization of propene . 
A series of cyclopentadienyl- ? 1-amidinate titanium complexes Cp*Ti{NC(ArR)NiPr2}Me2 ( ArR = 4-C6H4R , where r = H ( 1-Me ) , CF3 ( 5-Me ) , tBu ( 6-Me ) , or NMe2 ( 7-Me ) ) with different para-substituents in the amidinate ligand were synthesized and structurally characterized , along with three bimetallic analogues : 1,4-C6H4{C(NiPr2)N}2{Cp*TiMe2}2 ( 2-Me ) , 1,3-C6H4{C(NiPr2)N}2{Cp*TiMe2}2 ( 3-Me ) , and CH2{1,4-C6H4-C(NiPr2)N}2{Cp*TiMe2}2 ( 4-Me ) . 13C NMR spectroscopy , density function theory , and the quantum theory of atoms - in - molecules were used to evaluate the donor ability of the various NC(Ar R)NiPr2 ligands and the influence of the ArR group para-substituents . reactions of 1-Me and certain homologues , as well as 2-Me , with borate and borane reagents [CPh3][BArF4] ( ArF = C6F5 ) , ArBF3 , in the absence or presence of lewis bases or polar unsaturated substrates were carried out , forming adducts and migratory insertion products such as [Cp*Ti{NC(Ph)NiPr2}Me(THF)][BArF4] , [Cp*Ti{NC(Ph)NiPr2}{MeC(NiPr)2}][BArF4] , and [1,4-C6H4{C(NiPr2)N}2{Cp*Ti{MeC(NiPr)2}2][BArF4]2 . detailed olefin copolymerization studies for forming EPDM from ethylene , propylene , and certain dienes were carried out with mono- and bimetallic catalysts and borate and borane activators . catalyst - activator effects on polymerization productivity and polymer composition relationships were mapped . bimetallic catalysts <nUm> and <nUm> showed cooperative effects based on electronic factors , leading to enhanced propene incorporation , but unfavorable steric effects gave lower diene content . related but less significant electronic effects on propene affinity were found for the monometallic catalysts Cp*Ti{NC(ArR)NiPr2}Me2 as the ArR moiety para-substituents were varied . 
A series of phosphine - sulfonate ligands bearing various side - arm substituents were designed and prepared . the corresponding Pd (II) complexes [k2-(P,O)-2-(PPhAr)-1-benzenesulfonato]Pd(Me)(dmso) ( pd1 , Ar = o-MeO-C6H4 ; pd2 , Ar = o-PhO-C6H4 ; pd3 , Ar = o-(2,6-Me2-C6H3)O-C6H4 ; pd4 , Ar = o-PhSO2-C6H4 ) and Ni (II) complexes [k2-(P,O)-2-(PPhAr)-1-benzenesulfonato]NiPh(PPh3) ( ni1 , Ar = o-MeO-C6H4 ; ni2 , Ar = o-PhO-C6H4 ; ni3 , Ar = o-(2,6-Me2-C6H3)O-C6H4 ; ni4 , Ar = o-PhSO2-C6H4 ) were prepared and applied in ethylene polymerization and ethylene-polar monomer copolymerization . catalysts pd2 , pd3 , ni2 , and ni3 are moderately active in ethylene polymerization ( activity up to <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 h-1 ) , generating polyethylene with high molecular weights ( Mn up to <nUm> ) and high melting temperatures ( Tm up to <nUm> ° C ) . the two palladium catalysts can also initiate efficient copolymerization of ethylene with methyl acrylate , allyl cyanide , and allyl acetate . most importantly , high copolymer molecular weights ( Mn between <nUm> and <nUm> ) and high polar monomer incorporation ratios ( between <nUm> % and <nUm> % ) could be achieved simultaneously in this system . this side - arm strategy is highly effective in modulating the properties of the phosphine - sulfonate palladium and nickel catalysts . 
this work investigates the reactivity of neutral and cationic complexes of both bridged ansa - zirconocenes , rac-[C2H4(Ind)2]ZrMe[OC(OiPr) = CMe2 ] ( 1 ) and rac-[C2H4(Ind)2]Zr+(THF)[OC(OiPr) = CMe2][MeB(C6F5)3]a ( 1+ ) , and nonbridged zirconocenes , Cp*(nPrCp)ZrMe[OC(OiPr) = CMe2 ] ( 13 ) and Cp*(nPrCp)Zr(THF)[OC(OiPr) = CMe2]+[MeB(C6F5)3]a ( 13+ ) , toward biorenewable itaconic dialkyl esters ( itaconates ) and anhydride ( IA ) . behaving similarly , both cationic complexes 1+ and 13+ react readily with itaconates to form cleanly single monomer addition products , eight - membered - ring metallacycles <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively , and neutral enolate complexes <nUm> and <nUm> insert <nUm> equiv of IA to afford single-IA - addition products <nUm> and <nUm> . behaving differently , eight - membered - ring chelates <nUm> derived from the bridged metallocene framework undergo slow isomerization at room temperature via ligand exchange between the coordinated and uncoordinated ester groups to form thermodynamically favored seven - membered - ring chelates <nUm> , while eight - membered chelates <nUm> derived from the sterically more crowded unbridged metallocene framework are stable at room temperature and do not undergo such isomerization . the above cationic complexes exhibit no reactivity toward further additions of itaconates . replacing itaconates with more basic monomers such as N,N-dimethylacrylamide that can ring open the chelating resting intermediate , however , brings about effective and controlled polymerization by eight - membered Zr - itaconate metallacycles <nUm> and <nUm> , but not seven - membered <nUm> , producing either highly isotactic polymers ( > <nUm> % mm , by <nUm> ) or polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions ( ä < <nUm> , by <nUm> ) . these results further highlight the ansa effects in the metallocene polymerization chemistry and the importance of the formation and ring opening of the eight - membered chelating intermediates involved in the metallocene - mediated conjugate - addition polymerization . 
ansa-Dimethylsilylene(fluorenyl)(amido)titanium complexes bearing various electron - donating substituents are synthesized and applied to propylene polymerization by the use of MMAO / 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol as a cocatalyst . the complexes containing adamantylamido ligands ( 1a,b ) show unexpectedly high activity ( <nUm> kg of polymer ( mol of ti)-1 h-1 ) with a low Al : Ti ratio of <nUm> . the catalysts also promote syndiotactic - specific living polymerization to produce propylene-ethylene block copolymers . 
reaction of 4,5-bis(2,4,6-triisopropylanilino)-2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethylxanthene ( H2XN2 ) with [Zr(NMe2)4] , followed by crystallization from O(SiMe3)2 , yielded [(XN2)Zr(NMe2)2]*{O(SiMe3)2}0.5 ( 1*{O(SiMe3)2}0.5 ) . the zirconium dimethyl complex [(XN2)ZrMe2] ( 2 ) was subsequently accessed ( a ) by treatment of 1*(O(SiMe3)2)0.5 with excess AlMe3 or ( b ) via reaction of 1*(O(SiMe3)2)0.5 with excess Me3SiCl , affording [(XN2)ZrCl2] ( 3 ) followed by reaction of <nUm> with <nUm> equiv of MeLi . reaction of [(XN2)ZrMe2] ( 2 ) with one equiv of BC18F15 or [CPh3][B(C6F5)4] yielded cationic [(XN2)ZrMe][MeB(C6F5)3] ( 4 ) and [(XN2)ZrMe(arene)][B(C6F5)4] { arene = e6-benzene ( 5a ) , e6-toluene ( 5b ) , or bromobenzene ( 5c ) } , respectively . both <nUm> and 5b are active for ethylene polymerization under <nUm> atm of ethylene at <nUm> and <nUm> ° C in toluene with activities ranging from <nUm> - <nUm> kg mol-1 atm-1 h-1 , yielding polymers with weight - average molecular weights ( mw ) of 70,800-88,100 g mol-1 and polydispersities ( mw / Mn ) of <nUm> - <nUm> . 
the complexes [(dippp)Fe(C2H4)2] ( 2 ) and [CpFe(C2H4)2][Li*(tmeda)] ( 5 ) both contain a formally zerovalent iron center but exhibit markedly different catalytic properties . whereas <nUm> is able to induce a broad range of cycloisomerization and cycloaddition reactions , <nUm> is so far basically limited to cyclotrimerizations of alkynes and nitriles . investigations into the behaviors of both complex vis-a-vis unsaturated substrates provided insights into the likely origins of this distinct behavior . thus , ordinary terminal or internal alkenes were found not to replace the ligated ethylene units in <nUm> , whereas the stronger p-acceptor ligands 1,5-cyclooctadiene , 2-norbornene , and tolane afforded the corresponding p-complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> . A cyclopropene derivative engaged in oxidative cyclization with formation of the corresponding metallacycle <nUm> . Allyl-9-BBN or alkenyl-9-BBN derivatives succumbed to allylic C-H activation with formation of the unorthodox allyliron complexes <nUm> and <nUm> featuring a bridging hydride ligand between the iron and the boron atoms . along the same line , 1,3-dienes bind well to <nUm> but undergo spontaneous activation if allylic C-H bonds are present ; the resulting hydride is transferred to a residual ethylene ligand , as manifest in the formation of the cyclopentadienyl ethyl complex <nUm> . the same elementary steps surface in a remarkable reaction cascade comprising two consecutive C-H activation reactions and a stereoselective C-C bond formation , which ultimately provides the substituted cyclohexadienyl complexes <nUm> and <nUm> . In contrast , the heterobimetallic complex <nUm> neither induces allylic C-H activation nor binds 1,3-butadiene under conditions where it proved catalytically active . the targeted butadiene complex <nUm> had to be made by an indirect route and is distinguished by a noteworthy " flyover " constitution . therefore , we conclude that the known cycloaddition and cycloisomerization reactions catalyzed by <nUm> do not commence at a 1,3-diene motif but require an enyne entity as starter unit . 
the reaction of 2-(2,6-DippNHCH2)C8H5NH ( dipp = 2,6-iPrC6H3 , C8H6N = indolyl ) with <nUm> equiv of (Me3SiCH2)3Yb(THF)2 at room temperature generated mononuclear ytterbium complex <nUm> having the indolyl ligands in e1:e1 mode with reduction of yb3+ to yb2+ and oxidation of the amino to imino group . In the case of Er and Y , the reactions produced dinuclear complexes <nUm> and <nUm> having the indolyl ligands in m- e2:e2:e1 modes with the central metals . when the rare - earth metal is dysprosium , the reaction afforded mixed ligated dinuclear complex 4a having indolyl ligands in m- e5:e1:e1 and m- e6:e1:e1 modes with Dy , and its isomer 4b having the indolyl ligands only in m- e5:e1:e1 modes with Dy . however , when the rare - earth metal is Gd , the reaction only produced the mixed ligated dinuclear gadolinium complex [ ( m- e5:e1:e1)-2-(2,6-DippNCH2)Ind(m- e6:e1:e1)-2-(2,6-DippNCH2)Ind][Gd(CH2SiMe3)(thf)]2 ( 5 ) , having indolyl ligands in m- e5:e1:e1 and m- e6:e1:e1 modes with Gd . In addition , treatment of 2-(2,6-DippNHCH2)C8H5NH with <nUm> equiv of (Me3SiCH2)3Gd(THF)2 produced the alkoxido-bridged trinuclear gadolinium complex [ ( m- e3:e2:e1:e1)-2-(2,6-DippNCH2)Ind(m- e2:e1:e1)-2-(2,6-DippNCH2)Ind-(e1:e1)-2-(2,6-DippNCH2)Ind]-Gd3[(m3-O(CH2)5SiMe3)(m2-O(CH2)5SiMe3)(thf)3] ( 6 ) having indolyl ligands in e1:e1 , m- e2:e1:e1 , and m- e3:e2:e1:e <nUm> modes with metals , respectively . In complex <nUm> , sp2 C-H activation is observed at the 7-indolyl position producing unique 2-amido substituted indolyl-1,7-dianions having a m- e3:e2:e1:e1 bonding modes with three metals . the O(CH2)5SiMe3 arises from the ring - opening of THF by attack of CH2SiMe3 . moreover , when 2-(2,6-DippNHCH2)C8H5NH was treated with <nUm> equiv of (Me3SiCH2)3Sm(THF)2 , a dinuclear samarium complex [ m- e3:e1:e1-2-(2,6-DippNCH2)Ind]3Sm2(thf)3 ( 7 ) having a bridged indolyl ligand in m- e3:e1:e1 hapticities was isolated . all structures of the complexes have been determined by x-ray crystallographic analyses . dinuclear alkyl complexes 2-5 have been tested as isoprene polymerization initiators in the presence of AliBu3 and [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] . the regioselectivity for isoprene polymerization is tunable from 1,4-cis ( up to <nUm> % ) to 3,4- ( up to <nUm> % ) selectivity by these catalysts simply by adjusting the addition order of AliBu3 and [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] . 
the complex (m-Me2C-3,3'){(n5-cyclopentadienyl)[1-Me2Si-(tBuN)](TiMe2)}2 ( 3 ) was prepared as a new binuclear catalyst motif for homogeneous olefin polymerization . complex <nUm> exists as rac-3 and meso-3 diastereomers , which can be separated and characterized by solution NMR spectroscopy and single - crystal x-ray diffraction . while meso-3 has high thermal stability , rac-3 undergoes thermolysis in solution to quantitatively form the dimeric methylidene complex (m-Me2C-3,3'){(n5-cyclopentadienyl)[1-Me2Si(tBuN)][(m-CH2)Ti]}2 ( rac-4 ) . activation of rac-3 and meso-3 with <nUm> equiv of Ph3C+B(C6F5)4- yields [ (m-CMe2-3,3'){( n 5-cyclopentadienyl)[1-Me2Si(tBuN)]}2(m-CH2)(m-CH3)Ti2]+B(C6F5)4- ( <nUm> ; rac-5 and meso-5 , respectively ) . interestingly , meso-5 is stable in the presence of an additional <nUm> equiv of Ph3C+B(C6F5)4- , while rac-5 reacts to yield rac-[(m-CMe2-3,3'){( n 5-cyclopentadienyl)[1-Me2Si(tBuN)]}2(m-CH2)[(TiCH3)(Ti- n 1-Ph3C)]2+[B(C6F5)4-]2 ( rac-6 ) as indicated by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and DFT computation . meso-3 reacts with <nUm> equiv of BC18F15 to yield meso-[(m-CMe2-3,3'){( n n 5-cyclopentadienyl)[1-Me2Si(tBuN)]}2(m-CH2)(m-CH3)Ti2]+MeB(C6F5)3- ( meso-7 ) containing the same meso-5 cation but with a MeB(C6F5)3-counteranion . these findings , along with catalytic results , indicate that rac-3 and meso-3 remain structurally intact during polymerization , consistent with the observed diastereoselectivity effects . under identical ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization conditions , only activated bimetallic rac-3 produces appreciable polymer , with meso-3 exhibiting low activity , but both yield polymer with a branch density > <nUm> × that of the monometallic control [(3-tBu-C5H3)SiMe2NtBu]TiMe2 ( ti1 ) . In ethylene / styrene copolymerizations , rac-3 produces polymers with <nUm> × higher Mn and <nUm> × greater styrene incorporation versus ti1 , while meso-3 catalyzes only ethylene-free styrene homopolymerization . In 1-octene homopolymerizations , meso-3 + BC18F15 ( i.e. , meso-7 ) produces highly isotactic poly-1-octene ( mmmm <nUm> % ) , while rac-3 + Ph3C+B(C6F5)4- ( i.e. , rac-5 ) , rac-3 + BC18F15 ( i.e. , rac-7 ) , and meso-3 + Ph3C+B(C6F5)4- ( i.e. , meso-5 ) produce only atactic poly-1-octene . these bimetallic polymerization catalysts exhibit distinctive cooperative effects influencing product Mn , tacticity , and comonomer selection , demonstrating that binuclear catalyst stereochemical factors are significant . 
the hybrid alkyl / cyclopentadienyl " constrained - geometry " proligands (Me3Si)2CH{SiMe2(C5H5)} , (Me3Si)2CH{SiMe2(C5Me4H)} and (Me3Si)2CH{SiMe2(C5H4-3-SiMe3)} were synthesized by the reaction of the bromosilane (Me3Si)2CH(SiMe2Br) with the corresponding lithium cyclopentadienides . metalation of these proligands with an excess of MeK gives access to the corresponding dipotassium salts [(Me3Si)2C{SiMe2(C5H4)}]K2(OEt2)0.5 , [(Me3Si)2C{SiMe2(C5Me4)}]K2(OEt2) , and [[(Me3Si)2C{SiMe2(C5H3-3-SiMe3)}]K2(C6H6)]2*2C6H6 after recrystallization . similarly , the reaction between the phosphine - borane - substituted chlorosilane (Me3Si)CH{PMe2(BH3)}(SiMe2Cl) and [C5Me4H]Li gives the proligand (Me3Si)CH{PMe2(BH3)}{SiMe2(C5Me4H)} , which reacts with <nUm> equiv of PhCH2K to give the dipotassium salt [(Me3Si)C{PMe2(BH3)}{SiMe2(C5Me4)}]K2(THF) . x-ray crystallography revealed that the dipotassium salts of these hybrid ligands crystallize as zigzag polymers or three - dimensional networks . the suitability of the dipotassium salts as ligand transfer reagents for the synthesis of lanthanide complexes was probed through the synthesis of the lanthanum (III) complex [(Me3Si)2C{SiMe2(C5Me4)}]La(I)(THF)2 , in which the dianionic ligand chelates the lanthanum center . 
postsynthesis modification of solid polymethylaluminoxane ( sMAO ) with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane or pentafluorophenol produces highly active metallocene supports " sMMAOs " for use in slurry - phase ethylene polymerization . characterization of the sMMAOs using elemental analysis , BET isotherm , SEM - EDX , diffuse FT-IR , and solid - state NMR spectroscopy reveals that the surface methyl groups are exchanged for C6F5 and C6F5O moieties respectively , giving a material with reduced aluminum content and a lower specific surface area than sMAO . rac-Ethylenebis(1-indenyl) zirconium dichloride , {(EBI)ZrCl2} immobilized on B(C6F5)3- and C6F5HO - modified sMAO displayed activity increases of <nUm> % and <nUm> % respectively for ethylene polymerization compared to the same zirconocene catalyst precursor on unmodified sMAO . In the case of BC18F15 - modified sMAO , this enhanced polymerization activity is accompanied by excellent control of polymer particle size and morphology , and a small decrease in polymer molecular weight and polydispersities . 
the binuclear salphen Ti polymerization catalyst N,N'-1,2-phenylene[(salicylideneaminato)Ti(Cp*)Me2)]2 ( 2 ) is synthesized by reaction of salphen-H2 with Cp*TiMe3 . mononuclear [N-(2,6-diisopropyl)phenyl(salicylideneaminato)]Ti(Cp*)Me2 ( 1 ) serves as a control . activation studies of <nUm> with cocatalyst Ph3C+B(C6F5)4 - yield the cationic polymerization - inactive complex [N,N'-1,2-phenylene(salicylideneaminato)Ti(Cp*)]+B(C6F5)4 - ( 4 ) and polymerization - active Cp*TiMe2 +B(C6F5)4 - . polymerization studies comparing <nUm> with Cp*TiMe3 suggest that , within the catalytic time frame , while <nUm> retains bimetallic character under an ethylene atmosphere , it rapidly decomposes to <nUm> and Cp*TiMe2 + in the presence of 1-hexene . these monomer - dependent reorganization results highlight the importance of olefin polymerization activation mechanistic studies while providing insight for improved bimetallic catalyst design . 
this contribution provides the first detailed analysis of the nature of the M-C s-bond of three alkylated , isostructural group <nUm> ( m = Ti , Zr , Hf ) metallocenes , thereby elucidating individual peculiarities of each metal center in the catalytic conversion of olefins . therefore , the subtle electronic differences of the individual M-C s-bonds , which are considered crucial for several subprocesses in the coordinative polymerization of olefins , were examined by detailed experimental charge density studies . these studies provided measures of the increasing ionic character of the M-C bonds along the group <nUm> elements ( Ti-C < Zr-C < Hf-C ) . these results are further supported by high - pressure diffraction studies showing that the predominantly ionic Hf-C bond is more compressible than the more covalent Zr-C bond in line with a smaller degree of electron localization in the valence shell of the hafnium relative to the zirconium atom along the M-C bond directions . the Ti-C bond displays the largest degree of electron localization in these group <nUm> metallocenes as witnessed by a pronounced bonded charge concentration in the valence shell of the titanium atom-a rare phenomenon in transition metal alkyls . all findings were then complemented by experimental and theoretical studies of the kinetic aspects of M-C s-bond cleavage in group <nUm> metallocenes . these studies show that the entropy of activation is distinctly more negative for a Zr-C relative to a Hf-C bond dissociation . the combined results of the kinetic and electronic analysis herein shed new light on the different catalytic behavior of group <nUm> metallocenes with regard to the applied transition metal atom . In this context , deviations between zirconium- and hafnium - based catalysts concerning the catalytic activity and the stereoregularities became clearly explainable , just as the well - known " hafnium - effect " in the production of extraordinarily high molecular weight polypropylenes . 
Ti-C homolysis is generally regarded as a catalyst deactivation step in olefin polymerization catalyzed by titanium complexes . the present work demonstrates that for industrially relevant Ti catalysts in toluene and related solvents a " detour " via radical activation of the solvent can prolong catalyst lifetime and productivity , leading to chain transfer to solvents ( CTS ) . for differently substituted phosphinimide half - titanocenes and other Ti catalyst classes , i.e. constrained geometry ( CGC ) and amidinate catalysts , CTS leads to formation of up to ∼ <nUm> % benzylated chains . the efficiency of the reactivation pathway depends mostly on steric factors and correlates well with the percentage of buried volume , % VBur , as well with as DFT predictors . thus , the solvent is far from innocent , and catalyst behavior in such solvents may not be representative of polymerizations in more innocent saturated hydrocarbons . on the other hand , it might be the case that , in truly innocent solvents , the monomer itself can play a less innocent role . 
experimental and computational evidence supports a formation mechanism via reversible Ti-C bond homolysis rather than " classical " s-bond metathesis . 
synthesis and structural analysis of half - titanocenes containing anionic N - heterocyclic carbenes with a weakly coordinating borate [B(C6F5)3] moiety ( WCA - NHC ) of the type , [Cp'TiX2(WCA-NHC)] [ cp' = CH , tBuC5H4 ; x = Cl , me ; NHC = 1,3-bis(2,6-dimethylphenyl)imidazolin-2-ylidene ] , have been explored . the Ti-C bond distances between titanium and the N - heterocyclic carbene carbon atoms [ Ti - CNHC = <nUm> - <nUm> Å ] are longer than the ti-methyl bond distances in the dimethyl complexes [ <nUm> - <nUm> Å ] ; the WCA - NHC ligand coordinates to titanium as a conventional N - heterocyclic carbene ligand . [(tBuC5H4)TiCl2(WCA-NHC)] exhibited high catalytic activity ( e.g. , <nUm> kg-PE / mol - ti*h ) for ethylene polymerization in the presence of AliBu3-[Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] cocatalyst , and the complex demonstrated high catalytic activity with efficient 1-hexene incorporation for the ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization in the presence of MAO cocatalyst . 
low - cost and earth - abundant nickel catalysts are of great interest for olefin copolymerization with polar monomers to generate highly desirable functionalized polyolefins . however , nickel catalysts usually suffer from poor thermal stability and low copolymer molecular weight . In this work , by combination of design strategies of sterics and electronics , a family of sterically demanding aliphatic / aromatic - substituted phosphine - sulfonate neutral nickel complexes 1-4 {[k2(P,O)-(menthyl)ArP(C6H4SO2O)]NiMe(pyr)} ( <nUm> : Ar = (MeO)3C6H2 ; <nUm> : Ar = 2-(2',6'-(MeO)2C6H3)C6H4 ; <nUm> : Ar = 2-(C6H5)C6H4 ; <nUm> : Ar = 2-(2',6'-F2C6H3)C6H4 ) with different sterics and electronics were synthesized and fully characterized by comprehensive NMR spectroscopy , single - crystal x-ray diffraction , and elemental analysis . among these nickel catalysts , catalysts <nUm> and <nUm> are in favor of generating polyethylenes with high molecular weights ( up to <nUm> kg mol-1 ) in high activities ( up to <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 h-1 ) and good thermal stabilities ( up to <nUm> ° C ) , while catalysts <nUm> and <nUm> suffer from low thermal stability . more remarkably , the preferred catalysts <nUm> and <nUm> are also efficient for ethylene copolymerization with a broad scope of polar monomers including vinyl trimethoxysilane , various allyl monomers , 6-chloro-1-hexene , 6-bromo-1-hexene , methyl 10-undecenoate , and hydroxymethyl norbornene . these copolymerizations exhibit moderate to high activities ( up to <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 h-1 ) , high molecular weights ( <nUm> - <nUm> kg mol-1 ) , and relatively low incorporations ( < <nUm> mol % ) . 
(Arylimido)niobium(V) complexes containing 2-pyridylmethylanilido ligand Nb(NAr)X2(L) [ L = 2-(2,6-Me2C6H3)NCH2(C5H4N) ; x = NMe2 ( 2a,b ) , C3F6HO ( 3a-c ) , me ( 4a-c ) , CH2SiMe3 ( 5a ) ; Ar = 2,6-Me2C6H3 ( a ) , 2,6-iPr2C6H3 ( b ) , 2-MeC6H4 ( c ) ] have been prepared , and structures of 3a,b , 4b , and 5a were determined by x-ray crystallography . the dimethyl complexes ( 4a,b ) exhibited catalytic activities for ethylene dimerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , whereas the activity by 4c was negligible under the same conditions . complex 4b showed the highest activity , and the activity at <nUm> ° C was higher than those conducted at <nUm> and <nUm> ° C . the major product was 1-butene , and 1-hexene was formed by subsequent reaction of ethylene with 1-butene accumulated in the reaction mixture . A first - order relationship between the activity [ turnover frequency ( TOF ) ] and ethylene pressure was observed , suggesting that the metal - alkyl species would play a role in this catalysis . the activities further increased remarkably upon addition of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] at <nUm> ° C ; TOF at the initial stage ( <nUm> min ) of <nUm> <nUm> <nUm> h-1 ( <nUm> s-1 ) has been attained . reactions of the dimethyl complexes ( 4a,b ) with <nUm> equiv of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] in Et2O afforded [Nb(NAr)Me(L)]+[B(C6F5)4]-(Et2O)2 ( 6a,b ) , and the reaction of 6b with ethylene afforded 1-butene and 1-hexene even in the absence of MAO , clearly suggesting that the cationic species play a role in this catalysis . x-ray absorption near edge structure spectra of the catalyst solutions containing 4b ( in toluene at <nUm> ° C ) and MAO ( <nUm> and <nUm> equiv ) showed no significant differences in the pre-edge peak positions and intensities from that in the dimethyl complex ( 4b ) , strongly suggesting that both the oxidation states and the basic structures are maintained upon addition of MAO in these catalyst solutions . 
treatment of [ (Ind)(tBu3P = N)TiCl2 ] ( <nUm> ; ind = indenyl ) with AlEt3 in a range of solvents affords the emerald green heterobimetallic complex [ (Ind)(tBu3P = N)Ti(m2-Cl)2AlEt2 ] ( 2 ) . single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies , as well as nuclear magnetic and x-band electron paramagnetic resonance spectra , support formulation of <nUm> as a paramagnetic , formally [TiIIIAlIII] complex . both <nUm> and <nUm> are active precatalysts for ethylene polymerization in the presence of AlEt3 and a solid superacid ; the product polyethylene materials are found to have similar molecular weight distributions in each case ( <nUm> with <nUm> and <nUm> with <nUm> ) , implicating involvement of similar active catalysts in both . electrochemical studies reveal that <nUm> can undergo one - electron reduction to TiIII near <nUm> V versus ferrocenium / ferrocene in tetrahydrofuran electrolyte , whereas <nUm> undergoes one - electron oxidation at a significantly more positive potential ( ca. <nUm> V ) . spectroelectrochemical studies show that reduction of <nUm> in the presence of AlEt3 leads to clean formation of <nUm> . these findings support key roles for AlEt3 in ( 1 ) catalyst alkylation , ( 2 ) chemical reduction of <nUm> by one electron , and ( 3 ) provision of the highly lewis acidic [AlEt2] fragment that stabilizes the TiIII center in <nUm> , as judged by the voltammetric data . 
kinetic studies of homogeneous 1-hexene polymerization have been used for determining the propagation rates and active sites concentrations of industrially relevant zirconocene catalytic systems incorporating {SBI} - and { cp / flu } - ancillaries : {rac-Me2Si(2-Me-Benz[e]Ind)2}ZrCl2 ( {SBI}-1 ) , {rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2}ZrCl2 ( {SBI}-2 ) , {Me2C(3,6-TBu2-Flu)(2-Me-4-TBu-Cp)}ZrCl2 ( { cp / flu}-1 ) , {Ph(H)C(3,6-TBu2-Flu)(2-Et-4-TBu-Cp)}ZrCl2 ( { cp / flu}-2 ) , {Ph2C(2,7-TBu2-Flu)(2-Me-4-TBu-Cp)}ZrCl2 ( { cp / flu}-3 ) , {Ph(H)C(2,7-TBu2-Flu)(2-Me-4-TBu-Cp)}ZrCl2 ( { cp / flu}-4 ) . the influence of different activation parameters , such as aging time and nature of coactivator ( MAO vs boraluminoxane ) , has been investigated . it was found that the activation efficiency of { cp / flu } - type precatalysts by MAO is similar ( 1-12 % at <nUm> ° C ) to that of the {SBI} - type precatalysts ( 4-18 % ) . moreover , the propagation rates for the { cp / flu } - based systems appeared to be superior to those obtained with the {SBI} - type congeners . deactivation processes , arising from monomer 2,1-misinsertions and resulting in dormant M-sec-Alkyl species , were demonstrated to occur for both types of catalytic systems . while the {SBI} - type systems are capable to undergo further regular 1,2-insertions of 1-hexene into the M-sec-Alkyl ( or undergo regeneration of an active species through b-H elimination ) , the { cp / flu } - type congeners are apparently reluctant to further enchainement ; this is proposed to account for the observed overall lower productivity of the latter { cp / flu } - type systems . dormant M-sec-Alkyl species with the { cp / flu } ancillaries can be efficiently reactivated by introduction of small molecules ( H or ethylene ) . 
the current work describes the development of a nanoscaled biodegradable metal polymeric three - dimensional framework with controlled nanotherapeutic release for endothelial cell patterning and sustained angiogenesis for biomedical applications . biocompatible polymers gelatin and PLGA were used as polymeric nanofibrous three - dimensional framework in a core - shell manner with the gelatin core containing a biodegradable and bioactive metal nanoframework of cobalt caged with PEGylated curcumin by coaxial electrospinning . FTIR results confirmed the presence of nanobioactives in the core region of a coaxial nanofiber . scanning electron microscopic analysis of the coaxial nanofibrous system showed a three - dimensional architecture that favored endothelial cell adhesion , patterning , migration , and proliferation . the as-synthesized nanoscaled biodegradable metal polymeric three - dimensional core - shell nanofibers exhibited potent antibacterial efficacy . further , it improved the endothelial cell patterning promoting angiogenesis . the high therapeutic potential of cobalt nanoframework in the nanofibers enhanced the production of vascular endothelial growth factor promoting angiogenesis that resulted in the earlier restoration of wounded tissue compared with untreated control in vivo animal models . the study opens up a new horizon in exploring biodegradable biosorbable metal nanoframework for biomaterial applications . additionally , the present study opens up a new strategy in developing biodegradable biosorbable biomaterial with enhanced vascularization efficacy to the biomaterial , which is important for acceptance of these biomaterials into the host tissue . 
our previous experimental report showed a switching behavior from ethylene polymerization to nonselective oligomerization by a novel triphenylsiloxy complex of chromium (II) [ ( ph < inf > <nUm> < / inf > SiO)Cr*(THF) ] < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ( m-OSiPh < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ( 1 ) together with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as a cocatalyst . In this work , combined experimental and computational studies were carried out to shed some light on the nature of the active species and their fascinating switching mechanism . the experimental results and DFT calculations suggested that ( i ) the chain propagation and chain transfer processes proceed via a cossee - arlman mechanism and b-hydrogen transfer to the chromium center , respectively ; ( ii ) the trivalent cationic model [ ( ph < inf > <nUm> < / inf > SiO)Cr < sup > III < / sup > me ] < sup > + < / sup > and [ ( η < sup > <nUm> < / sup > -toluene)Cr < sup > III < / sup > me < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ] < sup > + < / sup > , which could be generated by a disproportionation reaction , are the most plausible active species for ethylene polymerization , and the divalent cationic model [ ( η < sup > <nUm> < / sup > -toluene)Cr < sup > II < / sup > me ] < sup > + < / sup > might be responsible for ethylene nonselective oligomerization . A switching mechanism from ethylene polymerization to nonselective oligomerization in the <nUm> / MAO catalyst system was proposed on the basis of DFT calculations . these results may have useful implications for studying active species and the mechanism of transition - metal - catalyzed olefin polymerization and oligomerization . 
A phenoxy-imine titanium catalyst ( FI - catalyst ) for selective ethylene trimerization was immobilized on methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) pretreated silica and its activity and selectivity was compared with that of the corresponding homogeneous catalyst system . the homogeneous and heterogeneous ethylene oligomerization was conducted in the presence of different aluminum alkyls , commonly used as scavengers during olefin polymerization to remove residual oxygen and moisture from the reaction medium . both the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts were strongly affected by the presence of scavenger in the reaction medium . upon activation with r < inf > <nUm> < / inf > Al / MAO ( r = et , nOct , iBu ) , the homogeneous catalyst switches selectivity from ethylene trimerization to polymerization . NMR spectroscopic investigations indicate that this change of selectivity can be attributed to ligand exchange between the precatalyst and the aluminum alkyl and reduction of the titanium species . the thereby formed ligand - free and / or reduced titanium alkyls act as polymerization catalysts and are responsible for the increasing polymer formation . using the heterogeneous catalyst , the scavenger employed during ethylene trimerization was found to be of crucial influence regarding the activity of the catalyst and the occurrence of reactor fouling . employing aluminum alkyls like iBu < inf > <nUm> < / inf > Al and nOct < inf > <nUm> < / inf > Al resulted in catalyst leaching and homogeneous polymer formation . the latter was prevented using me < inf > <nUm> < / inf > Al or et < inf > <nUm> < / inf > Al as scavengers ; however , in general the supported catalyst was poisoned by aluminum alkyls , resulting in a low overall activity . it was found to be beneficial for the heterogeneous trimerization system to employ silica - supported scavengers . by physical separation of the catalyst and the scavenger this poisoning effect was effectively prevented , resulting in a highly active heterogeneous catalyst . 
because of the steric bulkiness and the e5 / k1-constrained-geometry - configuration ( CGC ) geometry , the entire range of pyridyl-methylene-fluorenyl-stabilized rare earth metal bisalkyl complexes , (Flu-CH2-Py)Ln(CH2SiMe3)2(THF)x ( flu = fluorenyl ; py = pyridyl ; for <nUm> , ln = Sc and x = <nUm> ; for 2-11 , ln = Lu , Tm , Er , Ho , Y , Dy , Tb , Gd , Nd , or Pr and x = <nUm> ) , and monoalkyl complex , (Flu-CH2-Py)2La(CH2SiMe3) ( THF ) ( 12 ) , has been successfully achieved for the first time via the sequential salt metathesis reactions . activated by [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] and AliBu3 , complexes 1-9 showed high activity and perfect syndioselectivity for styrene polymerization , while the large nd- and Pr - attached precursors <nUm> and <nUm> exhibited slightly decreased syndioselectivity but rather low activity ; the monoalkyl La precursor <nUm> was completely inert . the activity increased with the decrease in the rare earth metal size , in striking contrast to the literature that has shown that a large metal facilitates a high activity , which was also not a result of an enthalpic effect ( DH[?] ) or an entropic effect ( DS[?] ) according to eyring plots . the types of organoborates and the aluminum alkyls , the electron donors , and the polarity of the reaction medium , which affected the coordination of styrene to the active species , aroused significantly different catalytic activity , indicating that styrene coordination played the key role in the polymerization process . on the basis of this , the density functional theory calculation of the active species in the model of [(Flu-CH2-Py)Ln-nC17H19]+ revealed whenever the orbitals of the pyridyl-methylene fluorenyl ligand overlapped with those of the rare earth metals , the LUMO energy of the active species was lowered and thus the catalytic activity was high . therefore , the LUMO energy of the active species could be adopted as a potential criterion to estimate the activity of a catalytic system for styrene polymerization . this work reveals for the first time the power of the pyridyl-methylene fluorenyl ligand and the nature of the factors influencing the catalytic performance . 
propene polymerization using Ti cp - phosphinimide catalysts in toluene and related aromatic solvents leads to the formation of benzyl-terminated polymer chains . end - group analysis suggests that these are formed after a 2,1-insertion event ; density functional theory ( DFT ) studies support a mechanism involving homolysis of a ti-sec-alkyl bond . this reaction could enable the catalytic formation of chain - end functionalized polyolefins . more importantly , it demonstrates that Ti-C homolysis might limit activity but does not necessarily constitute an irreversible deactivation mechanism . ( figure presented ) . 
accurate in silico prediction of copolymerization performance of olefin polymerization catalysts is demonstrated . it is shown by the example of <nUm> metallocene and post-metallocene group IV metal ( Ti , Zr , Hf ) systems that DFT ( M06-2X(PCM) / TZ / / TPSSTPSS / DZ ) can accurately describe the copolymerization factor re : i.e. , the competition of ethene and propene for insertion in metal n-alkyl bonds . experimental re values were computationally reproduced with a mean average deviation ( MAD ) and maximum deviation of only <nUm> and <nUm> kcal / mol , respectively . both dispersion and solvent corrections play a crucial role in achieving this accuracy . ethene insertion is found to be entropically favored for all catalysts due to a combination of symmetry factors and less congested insertion geometries . the enthalpic preference for either ethene or propene is catalyst dependent . the predictions are based on straightforward calculation of relevant insertion transition state energies ; there are no indications for a shift in rate - limiting step from insertion to e.g. olefin capture or chain rotation . ( figure presented ) . 
the chemical kinetics for a series of three zirconium amine bis(phenolate) catalysts for poly 1-hexene polymerization have been examined as a function of temperature . detailed modeling of the experimental data has yielded the activation parameters for many of the reaction rate constants , including those for propagation , initiation , chain transfer , and monomer misinsertion and recovery . while existing literature is sparse , the results herein generally agree with previously published values ; specifically , for the propagation rate constant , the magnitude of the enthalpy of activation is low ( <nUm> kcal mol-1 and below ) , and the magnitude of the entropy of activation is moderate ( up to <nUm> cal mol-1 K-1 ) . with regard to the remaining rate constants , arrhenius behavior is observed in most cases despite the complexity of the temperature dependence in the two - step adsorption / insertion kinetics . the rate expression for these reactions approaches an arrhenius form in certain limiting cases of the relative elementary rate constants . the reaction rate data are compared against these limiting cases , leading to the conclusion that docking , with an early transition state , is rate limiting for propagation and placing bounds on the interpretation of most of the remaining constants . the challenges encountered in assigning temperature - dependent rate constants for the polymerization reactions are indicative of both the significant complexity in modeling a reaction in which thousands of species are present and the extreme care that is required in generating reproducible data . 
In combination with EtAlCl2 , complexes {[WCl3(m-Cl)(N-2,6-iPr2C6H3)]2} , [WCl4(NR)(thf)] ( r = et , iPr , cHx , ph , 2,6-iPr2C6H3 , 4-F-C6H4 , and 2,4,6-F3-C6H2 ) , and [WCl2(NR')(PMe3)3] ( R' = ph , 2,6-iPr2C6H3 ) were all productive ethylene dimerization pre-catalysts , giving turnover numbers ( TONs ) in the range of 400-144 <nUm> ( mol C2H4)(mol W)-1 and moderate selectivities toward 1-butene ( > <nUm> % ) depending on the nature of the imido substituent . the formation of C6 side - products resulted from the incorporation of 1-butene rather than direct trimerization , something that is independent of butene concentration . stoichiometric reactions between the tungsten mono(imido) complexes and alkylaluminum reagents are described , which are consistent with the reduction of the tungsten centre playing an important part in the initiation process . testing discrete WV and WIV mono(imido) complexes for olefin dimerization revealed the former to be significantly more active , which offers insight into the mode of action of the commercially relevant tungsten mono(imido) - selective dimerization initiators described herein . 
the asymmetric 1,2-Markovnikov hydrosilylation of conjugated dienes with primary silanes catalyzed by a quinoline-oxazoline cobalt complex has been described . this protocol provides an efficient approach to chiral allyl dihydrosilanes with high regioselectivity and enantioselectivity ( up to <nUm> % ee ) . the catalyst system is effective for a wide array of conjugated dienes , including mono- and 1,2-disubstituted dienes with aryl and / or alkyl substituents . further , the products are applied to the synthesis of polyorganosiloxanes ( organo-silicone copolymers ) containing side chains of enantioenriched allylic functionalities using a pyridine-oxazoline cobalt - catalyzed step - growth polymerization with terephthalaldehyde . the result of a deuterium - labeling experiment involving the reaction of PhSiD3 and 1,3-pentadiene suggests that the hydrosilylation most likely proceeds through a modified chalk - harrod mechanism involving the 1,2-insertion of the terminal double bond of the diene into the Co-Si bond . 
the MAO / BHT ( MAO = methylaluminoxane ; BHT = 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol ) cocatalyst for olefin polymerization has been investigated by NMR spectroscopy . it has been found that it consists of oligomeric [ AlOMe <nUm> ( bht ) <nUm> ] n cages and monomeric MeAl(bht) <nUm> ( bht = deprotonated BHT ) . diffusion NMR indicates an average n for Al clusters of 62-96 , i.e. , 2-3 times higher than that estimated for unmodified MAO under analogous conditions ( n ≈ 26-41 ) . the reactivity of MAO / BHT has been explored by monitoring the activation of the cp* - phosphinimide titanium dichloride precatalyst Cp*(tBu <nUm> P = N)TiCl <nUm> . comparison with independently synthesized model species and DFT modeling allowed characterization of the reaction mixtures obtained at varying aluminum to titanium ratios . homodinuclear adducts [ Cp*(tBu <nUm> P = N)TiX ] <nUm> ( m-Y ) + ( x , Y = me or Cl ) forming outer sphere ion pairs ( OSIPs ) with MAO / BHT - derived anions are dominant at low Al / Ti ratios , whereas mononuclear inner sphere ion pairs [ Cp*(tBu <nUm> P = N)TiX ] + [ MAO / BHT ] - are formed at high Al / Ti ratios ; both types of species are found to be viable precursors for the cationic active species . activation of dibenzyl analogue Cp*(tBu <nUm> P = N)TiBn <nUm> results in the clean formation of [ Cp*(tBu <nUm> P = N)Ti-Bn ] + [ MAO / BHT ] - OSIP , giving sharp <nUm> H and <nUm> P NMR signals ; this reaction was exploited to quantify the amount of strongly acidic sites on Al clusters , shedding further light on the structure and properties of MAO / BHT . 
their performance in ethylene polymerization was extensively investigated to uncover the mechanism of cooperative catalysis among multiple Ti centers that are confined in a nanosized random coil of PNB chains . it was found that , under full activation , the activity of the PNB - supported catalysts was consistently higher than that of the unsupported molecular catalyst . At a lower polymerization temperature , the cooperation effect prevailed and the activity tended to improve as the number of Ti centers per chain was increased . At a higher temperature , a smaller number of Ti centers per chain led to better activity due to the active - site isolation effect . on the basis of a kinetic examination , the cooperation at a lower temperature was attributed to the enhancement of the propagation rate constant , where confined active centers as monomer trapping sites plausibly suppressed the entropic loss in the π complexation . 
cooperative catalysis is a powerful strategy in the catalytic ring - opening copolymerization of epoxides and CO2 , especially for breaking through the dependence of the polymer selectivity on the temperature and the restriction of the activity by catalyst concentration . In this work , to realize multisite cooperativity in a homogeneous catalysis , a series of oligomer catalysts flexibly bearing aluminum(III) porphyrin complexes in the side chains were synthesized by reversible addition - fragmentation chain transfer ( RAFT ) polymerization . the catalytic performance distinctly outperformed that of the previous molecular metal catalyst under identical conditions : ( 1 ) a 3-5-fold increase in activity was observed as approximately four to seven Al centers were anchored in one catalyst chain ; ( 2 ) the required use of a cocatalyst was reduced by 50-75 % ( 3 ) <nUm> % polymer selectivity was achieved even at <nUm> ° C ; ( 4 ) the activity was maintained at a very low catalyst loading ( [Al] / PO = <nUm> / 100a € >>000 ) , with the number - average molecular weight of the resulting copolymer above <nUm> kg / mol . 
A computational study of olefin polymerization has been performed on <nUm> zirconocene catalysts . the catalysts can be categorized into three classes according to the ligand framework : class I , Cp2ZrCl2 ( <nUm> catalysts ) , class II , CpIndZrCl2 ( <nUm> catalysts ) , and class III , Ind2ZrCl2 ( <nUm> catalysts ) , ind = e5-indenyl . detailed reaction pathways , including chain propagation and chain termination steps , are modeled for ethylene polymerization using zirconocene catalysts . optimized structures for reaction coordinates indicated the presence of a-agostic interactions in the transition states ( TSs ) for both the first and second ethylene insertions , as well as in the ethylene p-complex of the ZrnPr cation . however , b-agostic interactions predominate in the cationic n-propyl and n-pentyl intermediates . the calculated activation energy barrier energies show that the TS for the insertion of ethylene into the Zr - CH3 + bond is the highest point on the computed reaction coordinates . quantitative structure - activity relationship studies were also performed for 38-mixed zirconocene dichlorides . this study , in concert with the previous work , suggests that the type of ring attached to Zr ( cp vs ind ) affects the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics less significantly than the type of substituents attached to the cp and indenyl rings and that substituent effects are even greater than those arising from changing the metal ( Zr vs Hf ) . 
(Imido)vanadium(V) dichloride complexes containing 2-(2'-benzimidazolyl)-6-methylpyridine ligand ( L ) of type V(NR)Cl <nUm> ( L ) [ r = 1-adamantyl ( ad , <nUm> ) , C <nUm> H <nUm> ( 2 ) , and 2,6-Me <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> ( 3 ) ] have been prepared , and their structures were determined by x-ray crystallography as distorted trigonal bipyramidal structures around vanadium . reactions with ethylene using 1-3 in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) afforded a mixture of oligomer and polymers , and the compositions were affected by the imido ligand employed . by contrast , 1-3 exhibited remarkable catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization in the presence of me <nUm> AlCl ; the phenylimido complex ( 2 ) exhibited the highest activity [ <nUm> <nUm> kg-PE / mol - v*h turn over frequency ( TOF , <nUm> <nUm> <nUm> h <nUm> , <nUm> s <nUm> ) ] . the ethylene copolymerizations with norbornene afforded ultrahigh-molecular-weight copolymers with uniform molecular weight distributions and compositions [ e.g. , m n = <nUm> - <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> , m w / m n = <nUm> - <nUm> ] . on the basis of V nuclear magnetic resonance ( <nUm> V NMR ) , electron spin resonance , and V K - edge x-ray absorption near - edge structure ( XANES ) spectra of the catalyst solution , the observed difference in the catalyst performance in the presence of ( between ) MAO and me <nUm> AlCl cocatalyst should be due to the formation of different catalytically active species with different oxidation states . apparent changes in the oxidation state were observed in the ( especially in the NMR and XANES ) spectra upon addition of me <nUm> AlCl , whereas no significant changes in the spectra were observed in presence of MAO . 
tetramethyldisiloxa[3]metallocenophanes of the heavy group <nUm> elements germanium , 2a , tin , 2b , and lead , 2c , ( tetrelocenophanes ) have been synthesized by the reaction of dilithiated ligand , <nUm> , with the corresponding element(II) chloride . the plumbocenophane , 2c , forms one - dimensional coordination polymers in the solid state , while the germanocenophane , 2a , and the stannocenophane , 2b , are monomeric . furthermore , the reactivity of the stannocenophane , 2b , and the plumbocenophane , 2c , toward N - heterocyclic carbenes was explored . although the coordination of carbene is reversible in solution at room temperature , the corresponding carbene complexes , 3a,b , could be structurally characterized , illustrating the lewis acidity of the central atom in these metallocenophanes . 
ion - ion interactions are a crucial but often overlooked aspect of many polymerization reactions . the precise nature of cation - anion binding is as yet poorly understood , and little is known of the extent of ionic interactions in the typically nonaqueous , low - polarity reaction media of most polymerizations . nevertheless , adequate control of cation - anion interactions can greatly enhance the productivity and efficiency of chemical processes and can provide low - energy alternatives to current methods . this is illustrated here with the carbocationic polymerization of isoalkenes . carbocationic polymerizations involve , as the name implies , carbocations as propagating species . of the various types of substrates that can be polymerized cationically , the copolymerization of isobutene to isobutene - isoprene rubber stands out as the only large - scale , industrially important implementation of this reaction type . the products , elastomers with controlled degrees of unsaturation for subsequent cross-linking , have excellent gas barrier and mechanical dampening properties that make them indispensable components in polymer composites . for such applications , the polymer molecular weight has to be high , <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> g / mol , with 1-2 mol % isoprene . cationic polymerizations are however notoriously difficult to control . As a means of suppressing chain transfer , the process is carried out at temperatures as low as <nUm> ° C , with aluminum chloride initiators in chloromethane . current industrial production of isobutene - isoprene butyl rubber is thus highly energy intensive and produces aluminum and chloride effluent . this account summarizes how highly electrophilic organometallics coupled with new types of very weakly coordinating counteranions can provide the basis for a more environmentally friendly , lower energy alternative . because any copolymerization of two monomers , here primarily isobutene and isoprene , leads to two different propagating species , each of which is characterized by different chain growth and chain termination kinetics , variation of the associated counteranions can give rather unexpected results . with judicious choice of the initiator and the counteranion , new chemistry can be injected into such processes and can open avenues to new families of polymer materials . mechanistic investigations of the initiation process with zirconocene hydrides illustrate the complexity of this first step . replacing aluminum with zinc initiators not only provides a nontoxic alternative but also generates a system in which the polymer molecular weight is much less affected by temperature and comonomer concentration , which can lead to a range of products , from oligomeric lubricant precursors to C-C - rich high-molecular-weight elastomers . the key in all these cases is the construction of either preformed or in situ - generated complex anions that are resistant to electrophilic or redox degradation and are capable of stabilizing tightly associated carbocations . such initiator systems allow much more benign operating temperatures , reduce the need for chlorocarbon solvents , and can operate at concentrations as low as <nUm> × 10-5 m . along the way are provided the first examples of structurally characterized sec-alkyl carbocations and carbocation salts of organometallic zincates . 
(Butadiene)zirconocene adds BC18F15 at a terminal diene carbon atom to yield the zirconocene-(m-hydrocarbyl)-borate betaine Cp2-Zr[C4H6-B C6F5 ] ( 4 ) . the dipolar complex <nUm> contains a distorted p-allyl moiety and features an additional stabilizing Zr-F-C(arene) coordination . under kinetic control , an isomeric betaine system is formed , characterized by an internal Zr+***CH2[B]- ion - pair interaction , that rearranges to <nUm> upon heating . A great variety of ansa-metallocene(butadiene) complexes and related systems cleanly form analogous metallocene-(m - conjugated diene)-borate betaines upon treatment with BC18F15 and related lewis acids . most of these systems represent very active homogeneous single - component ziegler - natta catalysts for a-olefin polymerization and copolymerization . In addition , these betaine catalysts are ideally suited for carrying out mechanistic studies in active ziegler - natta catalyst systems . they allow for an experimental observation of the first alkene insertion step at the active single - component catalyst . this feature has been used for studying the mechanism of transfer of the stereochemical information from the bent metallocene backbone and for an experimental characterization of the energy profile of the alkene addition / alkene insertion reaction sequence in active homogeneous ziegler - natta systems . the neutral dipolar single - component catalysts ( e.g. , <nUm> ) produce a polyolefin - modified R'-(CHR-CH2)-C4H6-B (C6F5)3- counterion at the end of the initiation period upon entering into the repetitive active catalytic cycle . 
statistical models can be used in conjunction with NMR spectroscopy to study polymer microstructure and polymerization mechanisms . thus , bernoullian , markovian , and enantiomorphic - site models are well known . many additional models have been formulated over the years for additional situations . typically spectral interpretation and data treatment can be done through either " analytical " or " simulation " approaches . these can be combined into " integrated " approaches for specific situations . an alternative ( and more general ) approach considers the kinetics of the polymerization process and carries out predictions of polymer microstructures and NMR spectra . these various methodologies are briefly reviewed here . also reviewed is a recent effort in the simulation category involving a user - friendly excel program ( " polytact " ) that can simulate the tacticities of a large number of statistical models , particularly those that pertain to polyolefins made with single - site catalysts . 
As a prelude to metal mediated systems , a series of typical free radical initiators were first evaluated in the thermal or UV - mediated VDF polymerization in glass tubes , at room temperature ( rt ) in a variety of solvents . better polymerization results were obtained with initiators which generate the most reactive radicals ( TBPO ) , in solvents that minimize chain transfer ( ACN ) . the effect of UV irradiation was subsequently investigated to reveal a photocontrolled free radical polymerization . finally , a series of epoxides , aldehydes , halides and peroxides , known to initiate both styrene and diene polymerizations in the presence of Cp2TiCl* , were tested as potential rt VDF initiators . however , regardless of reaction conditions , no polymer was obtained . this is most likely due to the incompatibility of solvents appropriate for Cp2TiCl2 reductions with those conducive of VDF polymerizations . thus , polar solvents favored by Cp2TiCl <nUm> are strong chain transfer agents towards VDF ( dioxane , THF , diglyme , acetone ) , while solvents that limit chain transfer to PVDF* ( ACN ) , react with Cp2TiCl* . 
this study was directed to the synthesis of periodically titanium - containing organometallic polymer , which is stable in an aqueous solution , by transition metal - catalyzed simultaneous chain- and step - growth radical polymerization and post-polymerization reaction . the simultaneous radical polymerization of three component system , i.e. , n-isopropylacrylamide ( NIPAM ) , a dihalide with multidentate ligand for organotitanium , and unconjugated diene , was examined with the ClCu / Me6TREN system in DMF / H2O = <nUm> / <nUm> at <nUm> ° C to result in the periodically functionalized poly(NIPAM) . the periodically - introduced multidendate ligands originating from the dihalide were subsequently reacted with Cp*TiCl3 , the organotitanium part of which was introduced periodically into the poly(NIPAM) as the titanatrane complex . since the cp* - titanatrane structure was stable in water , the thermoresponsive behavior of the periodically titanatrane - containing poly(NIPAM) could also be evaluated in an aqueous solution . 
there are a number of strategies in molecular nanoscience to prepare stabilized magnetic nanocomposites , including the use of polymeric surfactants . ring - opening metathesis polymerization ( ROMP ) was used to prepare a series of novel , well - defined diblock copolymers of bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene 2-carboxylic acid 2-cyanoethyl ester and bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene , consisting of both anchoring and steric stabilizing blocks . cyanoester groups were incorporated into the norbornene polymers to chelate and stabilize iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles . these polynorbornene - based copolymers were characterized by GPC , along with 1H NMR , FTIR , DSC , and TGA . nanostructured maghemite ( g-Fe2O3 ) magnetic ferrofluids were prepared using diblock copolymers as stabilizers in toluene or cyclohexanone , via thermal decomposition of C5FeO5 and subsequent oxidation of the iron nanoparticles . transmission electron microscopic images showed a highly crystalline structure of monodispersed g-Fe2O3 nanoparticles , with average particle sizes varying from <nUm> to <nUm> nm . 
In this work , we achieved the production of pristine multiwalled carbon nanotube ( MWCNT ) / polyethylene ( PE ) composites composed of uniformly dispersed , PE - coated MWCNT strands , by the in situ polymerization of ethylene with cp 2ZrCl2 immobilized onto the sidewalls of pristine MWCNTs as a catalyst . the prepared composites showed a highly increased young 's modulus ( <nUm> % ) as compared to homopolyethylene , due to well - dispersed pristine MWCNTs in the PE matrices . electronic interactions and binding modes between zirconocenes and CNTs were investigated by theoretical and experimental methods , and both methods indicated that the sidewalls of CNTs could form a coordination bond with the positively charged active species and act as a ligand with strong electron donation . 
A series of 0-3 metal oxide - polyolefin nanocomposites are synthesized via in situ olefin polymerization , using the following single - site metallocene catalysts : C2 - symmetric dichloro[rac-ethylenebisindenyl]-zirconium(IV),Me 2Si( tBuN)(e 5-C 5Me 4)TiCl <nUm> , and(e 5-C 5Me 5)TiCl <nUm> immobilized onmethylaluminoxane (MAO)-treated BaOTi <nUm> , OZr <nUm> , 3-mol % -yttria - stabilized zirconia , 8-mol % -yttria - stabilized zirconia , sphere - shaped O2Ti nanoparticles , and rod - shaped OTi <nUm> nanoparticles . the resulting compositematerials are structurally characterized via x-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , 13C nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy , and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) . TEM analysis shows that the nanoparticles are well - dispersed in the polymer matrix , with each individual nanoparticle surrounded by polymer . electrical measurements reveal that most of these nanocomposites have leakage current densities of ∼ <nUm> -6-10 <nUm> A / cm <nUm> ; relative permittivities increase as the nanoparticle volume fraction increases , withmeasured values as high as <nUm> . At the same volume fraction , rod - shaped OTi <nUm> nanoparticle - isotactic polypropylene nanocomposites exhibit significantly greater permittivities than the corresponding sphere - shaped OTi <nUm> nanoparticleisotactic polypropylene nanocomposites . effective medium theories fail to give a quantitative description of the capacitance behavior , but do aid substantially in interpreting the trends qualitatively . the energy storage densities of these nanocomposites are estimated to be as high as <nUm> J / cm <nUm> . 
an overview is given of the various classes of p-conjugated oligomers and polymers incorporating p-moieties . topics covered include ( 1 ) p-conjugated systems based on arylphosphanes , ( 2 ) heteroaryl- , ethenyl- and ethynyl-phosphanes , ( 3 ) p-conjugated systems based on phospholes , ( 4 ) p-conjugated materials in phosphorus multiple bonds and ( 5 ) fulvene- , fulvalene , and quinone - based materials . the conceptual design and specific properties that directly result from the presence of the P - atom are also illustrated whenever possible . 
immobilized single - site polymerization catalysis has been the subject of several reviews in both length and scope . the present review comprehensively covers the substantial body of research within this field , focusing particularly on the requirements , challenges , protocols , and ingenious solutions to the successful immobilization of single - site catalysts . it describes inorganic oxide supports , zeolites and mesoporous materials , tethering to inorganic oxides , magnesium chloride , surface organometallic complexes and superacids , clays , " hybrid " multicomponent catalyst systems , modeling supports and supported catalyst systems , and polymeric supports . 
reported examples of vanadium complexes employed as homogeneous catalyst precursors for olefin polymerization , including some of the recent efforts using ( arylimido ) vanadium (V) complex catalysts for precise olefin polymerization , are summarized . more recent examples for ethylene dimerization and ring - opening metathesis polymerization to demonstrate the unique characteristics of vanadium are also compiled . use of thiobis(phenoxy) ligand in place of the dithiolato ligand improved the catalytic activity , and a complex showed remarkable catalytic activities in the presence of cocatalyst . arylimido)vanadium(IV) dichloride complexes has shown high catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization in the presence of Et2AlCl cocatalyst . feher et al. reported that vanadium - containing silsesquioxane showed catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization in the presence of AlMe3 as the cocatalyst affording polymer with unimodal distribution . 
recent advances in the area of olefin oligomerization via metallacycles that include dimerization , trimerization , tetramerization , and beyond , are reviewed . studies have found that metallacyclopentane decomposition to 1-butene many not be particularly facile due to the absence of metallacycle expansion . follow-up studies concentrated on the N-H functionality and the Cr oxidation state and role of MAO show that activities and selectivities to 1-hexene are similar to the original Cr (III) complexes . nenu and weckhuysen prepared silica - supported triazacyclohexane complexes , by treating the reduced phillips polymerization catalyst with triazacyclohexane ligands in dichloromethane . the influence of n-aryl functionality investigated by killian et al. shows that the selectivity was mainly dependent upon the steric bulk attached to nitrogen , and less so on the group 's basicity . 
recent abiotic homogeneous catalytic research focusing on the structures and organizational capabilities of enzymes to discover unique / more efficient catalytic processes is compiled . In <nUm> tian et al. reported a series of silane- and siloxane - bridged binuclear zirconocenes and these metallocenes were studied as catalysts for ethylene polymerization in the presence of MAO . sierra et al. described the synthesis of binuclear titanium and zirconium complexes , prepared by olefin metathesis . the binuclear CGC titanium catalysts are found to be very active when activated with bisborate B2 or bisborane BN <nUm> cocatalysts . methylene-bridged binuclear bis(imino)pyridyl Fe (II) complexes , activated with Al(iBu)3 , are found to exhibit higher activity than the corresponding mononuclear iron catalysts , along with an enhanced molecular weight of the linear polyethylene produced . tetra- and octanuclear half - titanocenes , when activated with MAO , display high ethylene polymerization activities . 
A description of catalytic and stoichiometric reactions in which 2-metallaoxetanes are identified as likely intermediates is provided . the properties of 2-metallaoxetanes and metallaoxetane reactivity are also described . sharpless and co-workers stated a chromaoxetane intermediate formed after olefin - metal precoordination and subsequent [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] addition with an oxo ligand would best explain the product distribution in the reaction of chromyl chloride with olefins . jacobsen suggested in his original report the direct transfer of the oxo ligand to the alkene , similar to the mechanism reported for related iron - porphyrin systems . friend and co-workers suggested formation of a surface metallacycle from the olefin and adsorbed atomic oxygen as intermediate in their study of the oxidation of propylene to acetone on a Rh(111) surface . milstein et al. had proposed sequential C-O oxidative addition , formation of a metallaoxetane , b-H elimination , and reductive elimination , although they could not isolate any intermediates . 
the article discusses the mechanisms and the applications in organic synthesis , materials , supramolecular , and polymer synthesis of most organic reactions mediated by single electron transfer . each reaction or class of reactions will be discussed by starting with the original discovery publication , followed by a summary of all or most review articles published in the field , and a discussion of the mechanism ( s ) and of the most important methodologic and synthetic developments since the most recent review was published . the mechanisms of most organic reactions are considered to proceed by two - electron transfer pathways , even though both biology and radical chemistry rely extensively on one - electron transfer processes . radicals generated by homolytic cleavage at high temperature were traditionally employed in the industrial production of polymers and to a lesser extent in the synthesis of organic molecules . 
the special issue of chemical review reviews the latest advancements in the field of coordination polymerization of polar vinyl monomers by single - site metal catalysts . this type of polymerization is achieved by catalyzed internal chain - transfer processes or by addition of an external chain - transfer reagent ( CTR ) . A number of essential characteristics of polymerization and the resulting polymers are described in each polymerization catalyst or initiator system reviewed in the issue . these characteristics include reaction condition , polymerization activity , polymer tacticity , stereocontrol mechanism , and polymerization control . coordination polymerization of polar vinyl monomers by single - site metal catalysts will include two major types of coordination polymerization in this review . these two types of coordination polymerization include migratory insertion and conjugate addition . 
the copolymerization of polar vinyl monomers with nonpolar olefins and the copolymerization of olefins and imines with carbon monoxide in transition - metal catalyzed coordination - insertion copolymerization of fundamental polar monomers , were studied . brookhart and coworkers found that a series of cationic Pd a-diimine complexes catalyzed the copolymerization of ethylene and MA . the low ester incorporation ratio and the results of experiments suggested that copolymerization proceeded through the coordination - insertion mechanism rather than radical or anionic polymerization , which produce MA - rich copolymer . pugh and coworkers reported that neutral catalysts generated in situ from pd(dba)2 or Ac2O2Pd and phosphonium-sulfonate , [2c]H , produced highly linear ethylene / alkyl acrylate copolymers with in-chain acrylate incorporation . although applications of copolymers consisting of polar vinyl monomers with CO have not yet been explored , further studies on their physical and chemical properties will lead to the development of functional polymers that exhibit truly novel properties . 
A study on electrochemistry of conducting polymers ( CP ) , their persistent models and new concepts was reported . A central point of electrochemical research is the analysis of the doping process , which corresponds to redox reactions in the polymer matrix . starting with the electrochemical formation mechanism of CPs , it has been clarified that oligomerization occurs in solution in front of the electrode and is preferably based on succeeding dimerization steps of ionic ( radicalic ) species . deposition of the oligomers involves nucleation , growth , and solid state coupling processes . the results of the oligomer approach prove that the redox charging of conjugated systems is due to potential - dependent successive redox steps , which may overlap , causing a faradaic plateau current . conceivable applications such as electrocatalysis , electronic devices , solar cells , or electrochromic windows are just a few challenges which have motivated researchers to refine strategies in preparing materials with tailor - made properties . 
A scientific review informed about the functions and applications of dendrimers resulting from supramolecular and physical properties . the review focused on the importance of the purities of dendrimers that potentially varied from one family to the other and significantly influencing the adequate achievement of the functions . it focused on the powerful concepts of dendrimer chemistry in terms of functions and potential applications . the findings revealed that dendrons bonded to polymers were called dendronized polymers and they disclosed properties relevant to those of dendrimers . branched or hyperbranched polymers were found to be useful alternatives to dendrimers that had significant commercial view and showed closely related properties for functions . local dendrimer dynamics , such as local motion were also compared to supercooled liquids and linear polymers , including glass transition aspects . 
an extensive review covering all aspects of calcium - mediated reactions , which include application of calcium compounds as homogeneous catalysts , is presented . considerable contributions is made to an understanding of schlenk equilibria in organocalcium chemistry and it is found that the stability of heteroleptic calcium complexes depend on temperature , concentration , presence of polar (co)solvents , amd ligand bulk . studies also found that the homoleptic complex of calcium is fast in e-CL polymerization and slow in the polymerization of l-lactide . investigation of calcium catalysts based on schiff base ligands shows that polymerizations are initiated either by a salen-Ca complex or by well - defined single - site catalysts . successful use of organocalcium species as initiators for syndioselective and living styrene polymerization can be attributed to the right balance of lewis - basic and lewis acidic properties . 
while ziegler - natta ( ZN ) polymerization is one of the most important catalytic industrial processes , the atomic - scale nature of the catalytically active surface species remains unknown . coupling high - resolution solid - state NMR spectroscopy with periodic density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations , we demonstrate that the major surface species in the ZN precatalyst corresponds to an alkoxy Ti(IV) surface species , which probably results from the ring - opening of tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) on a cationic Ti(IV) species . 
fluorinated activating supports ( AS ) for metallocene complexes were prepared via treatment of silica with AlEt3 or AlEt2F followed by pyrolysis and combustion steps , and a subsequent fluorination step when AlEt3 was used . this new family of activators appears to be universal for metallocene complexes leading to catalysts displaying high activities in ethylene polymerization without the addition of MAO . A productivity of <nUm> g gAS-1 was obtained in <nUm> h with the catalyst rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / AS8 / Al(iBu) <nUm> at <nUm> C under <nUm> bar of ethylene . an isotactic polypropylene with a melting transition at <nUm> C was prepared using rac-Me2Si(2-Me- benz(e)Ind)2ZrCl2 activated by AS9 and Al(iBu) <nUm> . the spherical particle morphology of polyolefins was particularly adapted to slurry processes employed in industry . 
the primary insertion ( or 1,2-insertion ) of propylene into ( C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > me < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > YCH < inf > <nUm> < / inf > CH < inf > <nUm> < / inf > CH(Me) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > , as well as the primary and secondary ( or <nUm> ) insertions of propylene into the activated ansa - zirconocene complex [ { Ph(H)C-(3,6-tBu < inf > <nUm> < / inf > Flu)(3-tBu-5-Me-C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > )}ZrMe ] < sup > + < / sup > were calculated with several DFT methods to find the most adequate methodology for the computation of metallocene - catalyzed olefin polymerization reactions . for the yttrium system , both solvent corrections and dispersion corrections are needed to determine energies of coordination and activation barriers in agreement with experimental data . dispersion corrections were included directly via the use of specific functionals like B97D and M06 or were added as empirical corrections ( GD3BJ ) to the B3PW91 calculations . for the zirconocene system , the best method is a combination of B3PW91 with solvent corrections incorporated with the SMD continuum model . the dispersion corrections , included via both GD3BJ and M06 , tend to overestimate the stabilization of the adducts because of the high steric bulk of the zirconocene system . the addition of dispersion corrections shifts the energy profiles toward lower values but does not affect the relative activation barriers . implementation of entropy corrections counterbalances almost perfectly the dispersion corrections . the same observations arise from the study of the C-H activations of propylene induced by the zirconocene complex . ( chemical equation presented ) . 
catalysis with transition - metal complexes is a part of the inorganic chemistry curriculum and a challenging topic for upper - level undergraduate and graduate students . A hands-on teaching aid has been developed for use during conventional lectures to help students understand these catalytic reactions . A unique method of illustrating the coordination polymerization of propylene with interlocking building blocks is described . three metallocene block models mimicking real catalysts recognize top and bottom faces of a prochiral propylene monomer block model and subsequently provide three polypropylene structures with different tacticity . the monomer recognition processes of the metallocene block models are based on steric hindrance , similar to those of the real catalysts . 
one new conjugated symmetric fulvene ligand L1 and two new unsymmetric fulvene ligands L2 and L3 were synthesized . five new supramolecular complexes , namely Ag2(L1)3(SO3CF3)3 ( 1 ) ( <nUm> , monoclinic , p21lc ; a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> ) , [Ag(L1)]ClO <nUm> ( 2 ) ( monoclinic , C2 / c ; a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> ) , [Ag(L1)(C6H6)SbF6]*0.5C 6H6*H2O ( 3 ) ( monoclinic , P2 <nUm> / c ; a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> ) , Ag(L2)(SO3CF3) ( 4 ) ( triclinic , P1 ; a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> ) , and Ag(L3)(H2O)(SO3CF <nUm> ) ( 5 ) ( triclinic , P1 ; a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> ) were obtained through self - assembly based on these three new fulvene ligands in a benzene / toluene mixed - solvent system . compounds 1-5 have been fully characterized by infrared spectroscopy , elemental analysis , and single - crystal x-ray diffraction . the results indicate that the coordination chemistry of new fulvene ligands is versatile . they can adopt either cis- or trans-conformation to bind soft acid Ag (I) ion through not only the terminal -CN and furan functional groups but also the fulvene carbon atoms into organometallic coordination polymers or discrete complexes . In addition , the luminescent properties of L1-L3 and their Ag (I) complexes were investigated preliminarily in EtOH and solid state . 
two single oxygen - bridged heterobimetallic oxides of Al (III) with group <nUm> metals ( Ti , Hf ) have been prepared . the reaction of LAlMeOH ( 1 ) [ L = CH(N(Ar)(CMe))2 , Ar = 2,6-iPr2C6H3 ] with dimethylmetallocenes of Ti and Hf in toluene ( <nUm> ° C ) and ether ( room temperature ) , respectively , resulted in the formation of LAl(Me)(m-O)M(Me) cp2 [ m = Ti ( 2 ) , Hf ( 3 ) ] in moderate to good yield . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by elemental analysis , IR , NMR ( 1H and 13C ) , EI-MS , and single - crystal x-ray structural analysis . furthermore , compound <nUm> showed good catalytic activity in ethylene and styrene homopolymerization , while compound <nUm> is less active in ethylene polymerization . the styrene polymerization yields atactic polystyrene . 
the nanocluster literature contains a wide variety of nanocluster stabilizing agents . In addition to the plethora of putative stabilizing additives , <nUm> claims appear of " solvent - only " stabilization of transition - metal nanoclusters - a hypothesis that is tested for the first time as part of the present studies . when the two main modes of nanocluster stabilization , electrostatic and steric are considered , " solvent - only " stabilization can only be steric ( i.e. , is not electrostatic ) . solvent - only stabilization would , therefore , require that a strongly coordinated , perhaps even kinetically nonlabile , solvent be present on the nanocluster surface . hence , an investigation has been conducted into potential sources for the stabilization of prototype ir(0)n transition - metal nanoclusters prepared from [(1,5-COD)Ir(OH3CN)2]-[BF4] in five different solvents , with a special focus on the formulation and testing of alternative hypotheses regarding the true source of the nanocluster stabilization in putative solvent - only stabilization conditions . seven total hypotheses are tested with five being initially ruled out ; they are , namely , stabilization by ( i ) trace chloride ( ii ) , surface hydrides , ( iii ) scavenged charge , ( iv ) solvent oxidative addition reactions with the nanocluster surface , or ( v ) polymerized solvent . this led in turn to two additional main alternative hypotheses : ( vi ) nanocluster surface ligation by high - donor number solvents ( i.e. , in the absence of anions ) and ( vii ) nanocluster stabilization by surface - coordination of the traditionally weakly coordinating anion BF 4- . our results reveal a significant contribution to nanocluster stability from the traditionally weakly coordinating BF 4- in high dielectric constant solvents , such as propylene carbonate . literature claims of solvent - only nanocluster stabilization are not supported by our findings . overall , DLVO ( Derjaugin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek ) theory of colloidal stability is supported and found to apply to even traditionally weakly coordinating anions . 
treatment of (silox)3Ta ( <nUm> , silox = tBu 3SiO ) with BH3*THF and BCl2Ph afforded (silox)3Ta(BH3) ( 2 ) and (silox)3Ta- ( e2-B,Cl-BCl2Ph ) ( 3 ) , which are both remarkably stable Ta (III) compounds . NMe3 and ethylene failed to remove BH3 from <nUm> , and no indication of BH3 exchange with BH 3*THF-d8 was noted via variable - temperature 1H NMR studies . addition of BH3*THF to ( silox ) 3TaH2 provided the borohydride - hydride ( silox ) 3HTa(e3-BH4) ( 5 ) , and its thermolysis released H to generate <nUm> . exposure of <nUm> to D2 enabled the preparation of isotopologues (silox)3Ta(BH3-nD n ) ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ; <nUm> , 2-D ; <nUm> , 2-D2 ; <nUm> , 2-D3 ) for isotopic perturbation of chemical shift studies , but these failed to distinguish between " inverse adduct " ( i.e. , (silox)3Ta-BH <nUm> ) or (silox)3Ta(e2-B,H-BH3) forms of <nUm> . computational models (RO)3Ta(BH3) ( r = H , 2' ; SiH3,2SiH SiMe3,2SiMe , and SitBu3 , 2SiBu ) were investigated to assess the relative importance of steric and electronic effects on structure and bonding . with small r , e2-B,H structures were favored , but for <nUm> SiMe and 2SiBu , the dative structure proved to be similar in energy . the electonic iand vibrational features of both structure types were probed . the IR spectrum of <nUm> was best matched by the e2-B,H conformer of 2SiBu . In related computations pertaining to <nUm> , small r models favored the oxidative addition of a BCl bond , while with r = Si tBu3 ( 3SiBu ) , an excellent match with its x-ray crystal structure revealed the critical steric influence of the silox ligands . 
metal nanoparticles ( NPs ) of Cu ( air - stable ) , Ag , and Au have been prepared using an atom - economy green approach . simple mechanical stirring of solid mixtures ( no solvent ) of a metal salt and ammonia borane at <nUm> ° C resulted in the formation of metal NPs . In this reaction , ammonia borane is transformed into a BNHx polymer , which protects the NPs formed and halts their growth . this results in the formation of the BNHx polymer protected monodisperse NPs . thus , ammonia borane used in these reactions plays a dual role ( reducing agent and precursor for the stabilizing agent ) . 
unlike the reaction of LiNTMS2* TMEDA ( TMS = SiMe <nUm> ; TMEDA = tetramethylethylenediamine ) with 2-cyanopyridine , which results in the nearly exclusive formation of the amidinate , ( me 3SiNC6F5)Li · TMEDA ( 1 ) reacts with 2-cyanopyridine in toluene to yield quantitatively the lithium pyridyltetrafluorobenzimidazolate complex [ C6F4N 2C(2-C5H4N)]Li · TMEDA ( 3 ) . In this work , the reactivity of complex <nUm> toward aromatic nitriles Ar-CN ( Ar = ph , o-OMeC6H4 , C6F5 , 2-pyridyl ) was examined . whereas complex <nUm> fails to react with o-methoxybenzonitrile , its reaction with benzonitrile or pentafluorobenzonitrile gives triphenyl-1,3,5- triazine ( 4 ) or the hexacoordinate lithium polymer [ LiN(4-NCC6F 4)(C6F5) · THF · TMEDA ] n ( 7 ) , respectively . when <nUm> is reacted with 2-cyanopyridine in tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) , the benzimidazolate coordination polymer { [ C 6F4N2C(2-C5H4N)]Li · THF}n ( 5 ) is obtained . herein we discuss how this diverse chemoselectivity in the reaction of the examined lithium n-silylated amides LiNRTMS · TMEDA ( r = TMS , C6F5 ) with nitriles is influenced by the electronic properties of the nitrile or amide substituents and by the ability of these substituents to interact with the lithium or silicon atoms . further , we present the syntheses and structures of zirconium tris(pyridyltetrafluorobenzimidazolate) chloride ( 10 ) and zirconium bis(dimethylamido)(pyridyltetrafluorobenzimidazolate) chloride · THF ( 11 ) complexes . these complexes , the first prepared zirconium mono-and tris(benzimidazolate)s , were crystallographically characterized and examined in the polymerization of propylene with methyl aluminoxane ( <nUm> : <nUm> Zr / Al molar ratio ) . 
the reaction of the cycloheptatrienylzirconium half - sandwich complex [ ( ν 7-C 7H 7)ZrCl(tmeda) ] ( 1 ) ( tmeda = N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine ) with Li(Im DippN ) , generated from bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin-2-imine ( im DippNH ) with methyllithium , yields the imidazolin-2-iminato complex [ ( ν 7-C 7H 7)Zr(Im DippN)(tmeda) ] ( 2 ) . the corresponding tmeda - free complex [ ( ν 7-C 7H 7)Zr(Im DippN ) ] ( 5 ) can be synthesized via the 1,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)allyl complex [ ( ν 7-C 7H 7)Zr{n 3-C 3H 3(TMS) 2}(THF) ] ( <nUm> ; TMS = SiMe <nUm> ) , which undergoes an acid - base reaction with im DippNH to form <nUm> and 1,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)propene . <nUm> exhibits an unusual one - legged piano stool ( " pogo stick " ) geometry with a particularly short Zr-N bond of <nUm> Å . addition of 2,6-dimethylphenyl or tert-butyl isocyanide affords the complexes [ ( ν 7-C 7H 7)Zr(Im DippN)(CNR) ] ( r = o-Xy , <nUm> ; r = t-Bu , <nUm> ) , while the reaction with 2,6-dimethylphenyl isocyanate results in a [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition to form the ureato(1-) complex [ ( ν 7-C 7H 7)Zr{Im DippN(C = O)N-o-Xy } ] ( 8 ) . <nUm> can also act as an initiator for the ring - opening polymerization of e-caprolactone . these reactivity patterns together with density functional theory calculations reveal a marked similarity of the bonding in imidazolin-2-iminato and conventional imido transition - metal complexes . 
high yields of the ethoxo-a-aminoacidates of the general formula M(OEt)4[OC(O)CHRNHR'-kO,kN] ( m = Nb , r = CH 2Ph , R' = H , <nUm> ; r = CHMe2 , R' = H , <nUm> ; r = CH2CHMe2 , R' = H , <nUm> ; r = H , R' = me , <nUm> ; r = CH2CH2SMe , R' = H , <nUm> ; m = Ta , r = CH2Ph , R' = H , <nUm> ; r = CH2CH2SMe , R' = H , <nUm> ) and M(OEt)4(OC(O)CH(CH2CH2CH2)NH- kO,kN ) ( m = Nb , <nUm> ; Ta , <nUm> ) have been obtained by the reaction of the l-enantiopure a-amino acid ( or sarcosine ) with a slight molar excess of M(OEt)5 ( m = Nb , 1a ; Ta , 1b ) in a dichloromethane solution . the new complexes 2-10 have been fully characterized by spectroscopic and analytical methods and by x-ray diffraction for <nUm> and 7-9 . such x-ray structures are the first ones ever reported for niobium and tantalum coordination compounds containing an a-aminoacidato ligand . the early - late heterobimetallic derivative Ta(OEt)4[O2CCH(NH2)CH 2CH2S(CH3)(AuCl) ] ( 11 ) has been prepared by the reaction of <nUm> with a stoichiometric amount of AuCClO . the bulk polymerization of d,l - lactide initiated by complexes <nUm> and <nUm> gave a slightly heterotactic enchainment ( Pr = <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ) , whereas complexes 1a and 1b formed fully atactic polylactide with Pr ≈ <nUm> . 
reaction of the quintuply bonded chromium (I) dimer [ApCrCrAp] ( ap = sterically demanding 2-aminopyridinate ) with pyrazine yields a chromium (II) complex with a e4:e4 face-on coordinated pyrazine dianion . reaction with 4,4'-bipyridine , on the other hand , completely cleaves the metal - metal bond , leading to a chromium (II) - based molecular square . XRD and magnetic measurements show ligand radical anions and a ferrimagnetic alignment of alternating metal and ligand magnetic moments . controlled polymerization of the molecular square with pyrazine yields a porous coordination polymer featuring both reduced and nonreduced linkers . 
new insights into the synthesis of high - nuclearity polycarbonatolanthanoid complexes have been obtained from a detailed investigation of the preparative methods that initially yielded the so - called " lanthaballs " [Ln13(ccnm)6(CO3)14(H2O)6(phen)18] Cl3(CO3)*25H2O [ a-1Ln ; ln = La , Ce , Pr ; phen = 1,10-phenanthroline ; ccnm = carbamoylcyanonitrosomethanide ] . from this investigation , we have isolated a new pseudopolymorph of the cerium analogue of the lanthaball , [Ce13(ccnm)6(CO3)14(H2O)6(phen)18]*Cl3*CO3 ( b-1Ce ) . this new pseudopolymorph arose from a preparation in which fixation of atmospheric carbon dioxide generated the carbonate , and the ccnm ligand was formed in situ by the nucleophilic addition of water to dicyanonitrosomethanide . from a reaction of cerium (III) nitrate , instead of the previously used chloride salt , with (Et4N)(ccnm) , phen , and CHNaO3 in aqueous methanol , the new complex Na[Ce13(ccnm)6(CO3)14(H2O)6(phen)18](NO3)6*20H2O ( 2Ce ) crystallized . A variant of this reaction in which sodium carbonate was initially added to CeN3O9 , followed by phen and (Et4N)(ccnm) , also gave 2Ce . however , an analogous preparation with (Me4N)(ccnm) gave a mixture of crystals of 2Ce and the coordination polymer [CeNa(ccnm)4(phen)3]*MeOH ( 3 ) , which were manually separated . the use of cerium (III) acetate in place of cerium nitrate in the initial preparation did not give a high - nuclearity complex but a new coordination polymer , [Ce(ccnm)(OAc)2(phen)] ( 4 ) . the first lanthaball to incorporate neodymium , namely , [Nd13(ccnm)4(CO3)14(NO3)4(H2O)7(phen)15](NO3)3*10H2O ( 5Nd ) , was isolated from a preparation similar to that of the second method used for 2Ce , and its magnetic properties showed an antiferromagnetic interaction . the identity of all products was established by x-ray crystallography . 
titanocene complexes with chelating N - heterocyclic ligand bridges react with ferrocenium salts as selective oxidants to afford air - stable cationic complexes and allow the preparation of exceptional mixed valence hexaazatrinaphthylene complexes [ ( Cp2Ti ) 3(m3-HATNMe6)]n+ ( 1n+ ) ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) . cyclic voltammograms ( CV ) and differential pulse voltammograms ( DPV ) show that nine oxidation states of <nUm> are generated without decomposition . comproportionation constants kc have been calculated in order to determine the extent of electronic communication between the titanium centers . the kc values of the mixed valence states are indicative of uncoupled ( 14+ ) , moderately coupled ( 15+ ) , and strongly coupled ( 1- , 1+ , and 12+ ) systems . small but significant structural changes occurring upon oxidation of neutral <nUm> are observed by x-ray structural analysis on 1+ - 14+ . anion-p interactions between the electron - deficient central ring of the HATNMe6 moiety and PF6- and BF4 - counterions , respectively , are found for 12+ , <nUm> 3+ , and 14+ . the short cation - anion contacts cause interesting molecular alignments in terms of molecular architecture . for <nUm> 2+ the assembly of an one - dimensional ( 1D ) polymer is observed . electrochemical investigations on the mononuclear cationic titanocene complexes [(Cp2Ti)(L)]+ ( L = 2,2'-biquinoline ( 2+ ) , 4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-biquinoline ( 3+ ) , and 5,8'-dimethyl-2,3'-biquinoxaline ( 4+ ) ) showed similar oxidation and reduction characteristics among each other . conversion to monoanionic , neutral , and dicationic states is enabled . As found for the trinuclear compounds 1n+ , the molecular structures of <nUm> +-4+ reveal significant differences compared to their neutral parents . 
the reaction of LAlMeOH [ L = CH(N(Ar)(CMe))2 , Ar = 2,6-i-Pr 2C6H3 ] with CpTiMe3 , Cp*TiMe3 , and Cp*ZrMe3 was investigated to yield LAlMe(m-O)TiMe2Cp ( 2 ) , LAlMe(m-O)TiMe 2Cp* ( 3 ) , and LAlMe(m-O)ZrMe2Cp* ( 4 ) , respectively . the resulting compounds 2-4 are stable at elevated temperatures , in contrast to their precursors such as CpTiMe3 and Cp*ZrMe3 , which already decompose below room temperature . compounds 2-4 were characterized by single - crystal x-ray structural analysis . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> were tested for ethylene polymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane . the half - metallocene complex <nUm> has higher activity compared to <nUm> . the polydispersities are in the range from <nUm> to <nUm> . A copolymerization with styrene was not observed . 
Cp*TiCI2(L) [ L = C3H 3N2 ( 1 ) , 3,5-Me2C3HN2 ( 2 ) and 3,5-iPr2C3HN2 ( 3 ) ] , and cp *Ti(C3H3N2)3 ( 4 ) were prepared in moderate yields by treating Cp*TiCl3 with the pyrazoles in the presence of Et3N or with their corresponding lithium salts in Et2O . the structures of <nUm> and <nUm> determined by x-ray crystallography indicate that these complexes fold a distorted tetrahedral geometry around Ti , and the pyrazolato ligands coordinate to Ti with e2-N,N'-coordination mode . In contrast , one of the pyrazolato ligand in <nUm> coordinates to Ti with e1-N - bonding , whereas the other two ligands were bound to Ti with e2-N , N' - fashion . the cp analogues , CpTiCl2(L) [ L = C 3H3N2 ( 5 ) , 3,5-Me2C 3HN2 ( 6 ) , 3,5-iPr2C 3HN2 ( 7 ) , and 3,5-Ph2C3HN <nUm> ( 8 ) ] , were also prepared by the reaction of CpTiCl3 with the corresponding lithium salts in Et2O or n-hexane . the crystallographic analyses of <nUm> and <nUm> revealed that the pyrazolato ligands coordinate to Ti with e2-N,N'-coordination mode . these complexes ( 1-3,5-8 ) exhibited moderate catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , and the activities were highly affected by the substituent on the pyrazolato ligand employed . complex <nUm> exhibited the highest activity affording polymer with uniform molecular weight distribution , suggesting that the polymerization proceeded with uniform catalytically active species . an increase in the steric bulk in the pyrazolato ligand led to a slight decrease in the activity by the cp * analogues , whereas the activity by the cp analogues increased upon increasing the steric bulk in the pyrazolato ligand employed . 
this report describes the reduction of a niobium (V) phthalocyanine complex and investigation of the electronic structure of the resulting products . the reduction of PcNbCl3 ( pc = phthalocyanine dianion ) with <nUm> equiv of potassium graphite in 1,2-dimethoxyethane ( DME ) resulted in the isolation of K2PcNbO*5DME ( 1a ) . addition of 18-crown-6 to 1a gave [K(18-crown-6)]2(m-DME)PcNbO ( 1b ) . both 1a and 1b were structurally characterized by single - crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . In both complexes , the niobium center adopts a square pyramidal geometry and is coordinated by four basal pc nitrogen atoms and an apical oxo ligand . notably , the pc ligand In 1a is saddle - shaped , with significant bond length alternation , rather than flat with delocalized bonding . the production of ethylene during the reduction of PcNbCl3 , detected by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry ( GC / MS ) , suggests that the oxo ligand likely results from double C-O bond activation of DME solvent . A combination of spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations were used to establish the electronic structure of 1a . the close correspondence of the electronic absorption spectrum of 1a to that of [PcZn]2- with a di-reduced pc4- ligand , indicates a similar electronic structure for the two complexes . evaluation of the electronic transitions for 1a and [PcZn] 2- by time - dependent DFT calculations further suggests a similar electronic structure for both complexes , indicating that differences in symmetry between 1a and [PcZn]2- do not significantly affect the nature of the electronic transitions . electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) spectroscopy of 1a In solution at room temperature gave a 10-line spectrum , while frozen - solution X- and q-band EPR spectra are consistent with powder - pattern spectra defined by uniaxial g and 93Nb hyperfine tensors : these imply the presence of a d1 Nb(IV) metal center . EPR and electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopy suggests that the spin density in 1a is centered almost completely on the niobium , in agreement with the DFT calculations . these results illustrate the value of pc as a chemically inert , redox - active ligand for stabilizing reactive metal centers . 
the kinetics of ethylene / norbornene copolymerization with rac-Et(1-indenyl) 2ZrCl <nUm> ( 1 ) and [ 2,2'-Me(1,3-Me 2Cp ) 2]ZrCl <nUm> ( 2 ) catalysts with modified methylaluminoxane are analyzed through experimentation and theoretical modeling . these catalysts show that the rate of norbornene incorporation into the copolymer is strongly catalyst dependent . for example , while catalyst <nUm> shows a decreasing polymerization rate with an increase in the norbornene concentration , catalyst <nUm> shows a monotonically increasing polymerization rate with an increase in the norbornene concentration for a norbornene / ethylene mole ratio up to <nUm> in the bulk liquid phase . both terminal and penultimate models are developed to describe the rate process with these catalysts . it is shown that for both catalyst systems the penultimate model yields a more accurate description of the copolymerization kinetics than the terminal model . the penultimate model has also been applied to a continuous copolymerization reactor system with catalyst <nUm> . the copolymerization was also carried out in a continuous stirred tank reactor . the model simulation results and the experimental data of norbornene conversion , solid content , and glass transition temperature profiles obtained from a laboratory - scale continuous reactor operation have been compared . interestingly , the model simulations show that the ethylene concentration in the bulk liquid phase is much lower than the saturated ethylene concentration , suggesting that mass - transfer resistance might be present for the ethylene gas in reaching the catalytic sites in the liquid phase . 
the present study focused on the application of mixed OTi 2-SiO2 - supported methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) with a zirconocene catalyst on the linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) production . At low concentrations of O2Ti present in the mixed supports , it revealed that O2Ti was decorated on the O2Si surface and acted as a spacer to anchor MAO to the O2Si surface resulting in less steric hindrance and less interaction . As a result , catalytic activities via ethylene / 1-olefin copolymerization apparently increased with the presence of O2Ti . besides increased activities , the presence of O2Ti in the mixed supports can result in a slightly lower molecular weight ( MW ) of polymers , suggesting a higher chain transfer rate . 
for two titanium - based ethylene trimerization catalysts , [ ( me 3SiC5H3CMe2C6H 3Me2)TiCl3 ] ( 1 ) and [ ( Me3SiC 5H3C(CH2)5C6H 3Me2)TiCl3 ( 2 ) , the entropies and enthalpies of activation for the ethylene trimerization reaction ( k1 ) as well as the catalyst deactivation reaction ( kd ) have been determined . using a combination of , on the one hand , experimental pressure and temperature data and , on the other hand , vapor - liquid equilibrium calculations , the 1-hexene concentration as a function of time was estimated and these data were fitted to a kinetic model to obtain the thermodynamic data . A best fit was obtained for a combination of a propagation reaction that is first order in the ethylene concentration and a catalyst deactivation reaction that is second order in the catalyst concentration . the measured entropies and enthalpies of activation are in good agreement with the previously reported calculated ones . 
linear a-olefins ( LAOs ) find industrial use as high - value chemical intermediates . most of the LAO production is based on ethylene oligomerization and does not yield a market - related product distribution . various non-ethylene-based LAO production routes have been evaluated and it was found that a process based on boron chemistry was the most likely to be successfully commercialized . process flow diagrams for a low - temperature ( 150-200 ° C ) continuous boron - based process to produce LAOs from linear internal olefins are presented , showing that it can be designed with or without a solvent in the boron cycle . experimental data are presented to illustrate progress made in understanding the chemistry associated with such a process . it is shown that ( a ) solvent exchange competes with hydroboration and is rate - controlling by regulating borane availability , ( b ) reactivity of substituted boranes is determined by the availability of the empty pz orbital of boron , ( c ) steric effects influence the rate of hydroboration and isomerization , ( d ) alkylborane isomer distribution is temperature - dependent and back - isomerization of terminally bonded alkylboranes is possible , and ( e ) thermal dehydroboration is more efficient than olefin liberation by displacement . 
A series of Cl2Mg - supported ziegler - natta catalysts was prepared by supporting Cl4Ti on ClLi - doped Cl2Mg , and these catalysts were used to polymerize propylene , using triethylaluminum as a co-catalyst . ClLi and Cl2Mg were coprecipitated from ethanol to prepare ClLi - doped MgCl2*nEtOH adducts . the ClLi - doped catalysts were prepared by dipping the adducts into a Cl4Ti solution . the crystalline and morphological structures of the adducts and catalysts were characterized by wide - angle x-ray diffraction ( WAXD ) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . two types of mixed crystals-Li2MgCl4 and Cl3LiMg - were found in the catalyst that contained <nUm> mol % ClLi ( LMSC18 ) . the molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) and isotacticity of polypropylene ( PP ) varied with the dosage of ClLi in the catalyst . PP with a broader MWD was synthesized using ClLi - doped catalysts that contained 11-18 mol % ClLi . deconvolution of the MWD profiles with multiple flory " most - probable " functions were applied to analyze the distribution of active centers . there were six types of active centers in LMSC18 : A , B , B' , C , d , and e . the combined productivity of ( e + d ) - type active centers in catalyst LMSC18 was much larger than that of the other catalysts . all the results showed that the properties and distribution of active centers of the catalysts supported on ClLi - doped Cl2Mg were markedly changed at a certain range of ClLi dosage . 
isothermal curing of endo-dicyclopentadiene ( endo-DCPD ) using the first and second generation grubbs ' catalysts as the polymerization initiators was studied by means of differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) according to model - free isoconversional and model - fitting approaches . it revealed that the two grubbs ' catalysts exhibited apparent differences in ring - opening metathesis polymerization ( ROMP ) of endo-DCPD . the second generation catalyst was more efficient in catalytic activity for overall ROMP of endo-DCPD than the first generation catalyst , as evident from the reaction rate and fractional conversion ( α ) . the model - free isoconversional method showed similar dependence of the activation energy ( ea ) on α for the two catalyst systems ; however , the second generation catalyst system involved a higher e α , up to α ≈ <nUm> , above which the ea value suddenly drops with increase of conversion . the model - fitting method of the ROMP was satisfactorily described by the decelerating reaction and the autocatalytic reaction mechanisms for the first and the second generation catalyst systems , respectively . the effect of diffusion - control was incorporated into the model - fitting method to describe the ROMP reaction throughout the entire conversion . for fully cured samples ( poly-DCPD ) , the first generation catalyst system has higher cross-linking density and lower tensile toughness relative to the second generation . dynamic mechanical behaviors were also different for poly-DCPD formed using the two catalysts . 
A high - pressure , high - temperature continuous stirred - tank reactor ( CSTR ) system having approximately an ideal residence time distribution ( RTD ) has been set up for the polymerization of olefins utilizing metallocene catalysts . preliminary experiments of ethylene polymerized with the metallocene catalyst system zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) / modified-methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) / trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) in toluene at <nUm> psig have been carried out . the reactor system showed good control over temperature , pressure , and ethylene feed rate . the steady state was obtained after four mean residence times ( <nUm> τ 's ) . with increasing Cp2ZrCl2 concentration , the molecular weight ( MW ) of polyethylene ( PE ) decreased and the catalyst activity ( kg of PE / ( [ethylene]*g of catalyst ) ) increased . with increasing temperature between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C , the MW of PE decreased and molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) polydispersity increased . EsP with weight - average molecular weight ( mw ) <nUm> 000-52 <nUm> were obtained . the catalyst activity decreased with increasing temperature with an apparent activation energy of <nUm> kJ / mol . the deactivation of the catalyst is first - order with the rate constant kd = <nUm> × 10-3 s-1 at <nUm> ° C . the rate constants of propagation and b-scission at <nUm> ° C are kp = <nUm> × <nUm> (M*s)-1 and ktr,b = <nUm> s-1 . 
A mechanism for the dehydropolymerization of hydrosilanes to polysilanes , as catalyzed by early - transition - metal metallocene derivatives , is proposed . this mechanism is based on two s-bond metathesis reactions that pass through four - center transition states : ( 1 ) the dehydrometalation of silane , H(SiHR)nH , with a metal hydride to give hydrogen and a silyl derivative , M(SiHR)nH , and ( 2 ) coupling of the metal silyl derivative with more hydrosilane , H(SiHR)mH , to produce H(SiHR)n(SiHR)mH and regenerate the active metal hydride catalyst . this proposal is based on a number of observed , stoichiometric s-bond metathesis reactions involving zirconocene and hafnocene complexes . these reactions , which involve silicon , hydrogen , and a d0 metal center , are rather facile and apparently reflect the tendency of silicon to expand its coordination sphere under these conditions . one reaction of this type is rapid MH / HSi hydrogen exchange , for example between PhSi3 and CpCp*MHCl ( <nUm> , m = Zr , or <nUm> , m = Hf ) , which is observed via deuterium labeling . hydrogenolysis of CpCp*M[Si(SiMe3)3]Cl ( <nUm> , m = Zr , and <nUm> , m = Hf ) provides a convenient route to the monomeric hydride complexes <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . the first step in the proposed polymerization mechanism , which is the reverse of M-Si bond hydrogenolysis , is observed in stoichiometric reactions of <nUm> or <nUm> with PhSi3 to give hydrogen and the phenylsilyl complexes CpCp*M(SiH2Ph)Cl ( <nUm> , m = Zr , and <nUm> , m = Hf ) . the thermolytic decomposition of <nUm> to <nUm> results in Si-Si bond formation , with the production of polysilane oligomers . this second - order reaction exhibits a deuterium isotope effect at <nUm> ° C of <nUm> ( 2 ) and activation parameters ( DH ‡ = <nUm> ( 2 ) kcal mol-1 and DS ‡ = <nUm> ( 6 ) eu ) that suggest a four - center transition state . the second - order reaction of <nUm> with PhSiH3 ( to give <nUm> and (SiHPh)n polysilanes ) was also studied kinetically and found to exhibit similar kinetic parameters . this s-bond metathesis reaction , which corresponds to the second step in the proposed mechanism , is believed to pass through a four - center transition state that results from interaction of the CpCp*(Cl)Hf-SiH2Ph and H-SiH2Ph bonds . evidence for the role of hydride complexes as true catalysts is obtained by comparing gel permeation chromatograms for polysilanes obtained from both <nUm> and <nUm> as catalysts . observed reactions of CpCp*Hf[Si(SiMe3)3]Me ( 7 ) with PhSiH3 , to give CpCp*Hf(SiH2Ph)Me ( 8 ) and then CpCp*Hf(H)Me ( 9 ) , model proposed processes for the activation of catalyst precursors . the step - growth character of the reaction is illustrated by the slow dehydrocoupling of PhSiH3 by Cp*2HfH2 , which allows observation of early polysilane intermediates ( di- , tri- , and tetrasilane ) . the participation of M(SiHPh)nH complexes as intermediates in dehydrocoupling was investigated . partly on the basis of the observed reaction of CpCp*Hf[(SiHPh)3H]Cl ( 11 ) with PhSiH3 to give <nUm> and H(SiHPh)3H , it is concluded that a preferred dehydrocoupling pathway involves monosilyl intermediates , MSiH2Ph , and chain growth by one monomer unit per catalytic cycle . implications of the proposed mechanism are discussed . 
several examples are described where in situ generated ( e2-alkyne ) group <nUm> metallocene type substrates add to X-[M2] reagents ( M2 = main group metal ) to form dimetallabicyclic products Cp2M(m-e1:e2-RCCR)(m-X)[M2] which contain a planar-tetracoordinate carbon center in the m-e1:e2-hydrocarbyl bridge . thus , (e2-cyclohexyne)(PMe3)ZrCp2 ( 4a ) reacts in this way with excess trimethylgallium to give Cp2Zr(m-e1:e2-C6H8)(m-CH3)GaMe2 ( 6a ) . complex 6a is one of the rare examples of a gallium compound containing s-hydrocarbyl bridges to this heavy main group metal . complex 6a was characterized by x-ray diffraction . it crystallizes in space group P21 / c with cell parameters a = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . complex 6a contains a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom C(2) with pertinent bond distances and angles of <nUm> ( 5 ) Å [Zr-C(2)] , <nUm> ( 5 ) Å [Ga-C(2)] , <nUm> ( 8 ) Å [C(2)-C(3)] , <nUm> ( 7 ) Å [C(1)-C(2)] , <nUm> ( 4 ) ° [C(3)-C(2)-C(1)] , <nUm> ( 3 ) ° [C(3)-C(2)-Ga] , <nUm> ( 1 ) ° [Ga-C(2)-Zr] , and <nUm> ( 3 ) ° [C(1)-C(2)-Zr] , both cp rings are disordered . zirconium and gallium seem to form a three - center two - electron bond with C(2) . the planar-tetracoordinate geometry at carbon atom C(2) is probably electronically stabilized by the s-donor properties of the attached metal centers and by a p-conjugative interaction of the C(2)-C(1)-Zr moiety normal to the s-plane . (e2-1,2-Didehydrobenzene)(PMe3)ZrCp2 ( 4b ) reacts analogously with trimethylgallium to give Cp2Zr(m-e1:e2-C6H4)(m-CH3)GaMe2 ( 6b ) in almost quantitative yield . complex 6b crystallizes isomorphously to the corresponding A1 compound in space group P21 / n with cell parameters a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , μ = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . it also contains a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom [C(2)] . the reaction of ph – C ≡ C – GaMe2 ( 7 ) with (hydrido)zirconocene chloride produces Cp2Zr(m-PhCCH)(m-Cl)GaMe2 ( 9 ) which is probably also a similarly structured “ anti-va n't hoff / LeBel complex ” . complexes 6a and 6b react with ethylene or norbornene at room temperature with liberation of Me3Ga and formation of five - membered metallacyclic products ( e.g. , bis(e-cyclopentadienyl)zirconaindane is obtained from 6b and ethylene ) . 
the olefin polymerization reaction by silylene-bridged zirconocene catalysts has been investigated theoretically . with the ab initio molecular orbital ( MO ) method the structure and energetics of the reactants , the p-complex , the transition state , and the product for insertion of ethylene into (SiH2Cp2)ZrCH3+ have been determined . the nearly Cs - symmetric transition state has a low activation barrier ( about <nUm> kcal / mol from the p-complex ) . the product shows a strong Cb-H agostic interaction . based on the above transition state structure , molecular mechanics ( MM ) calculations have been carried out to investigate the effects of alkyl substituents on olefins and methyl groups and other substituents on the cp rings as well as the effects of the alkyl group on Zr , a model polymer chain end . the regioselectivity in propylene polymerization , that the primary insertion is preferred to the secondary insertion , is reproduced well by the energy difference at the transition state but not by that of the p-complex . As to the stereoselectivity in isotactic polymerization of propylene by SiH2(CpMen)2ZrR+ , the substituents on the cp rings have been found to determine the conformation of the polymer chain end , and the fixed polymer chain end conformation in turn determines the stereochemistry of olefin insertion at the transition state . the direct steric effect of the cp methyl groups on the olefin insertion stereochemistry is negligibly small . the same direct control mechanism is operational also in syndiotactic polymerization of propylene and 4-methyl-1-pentene . 
heating norbornene in the presence of catalytic amounts of dimethyltitanocene , cyclopentadienyltrimethyltitanium(IV) , chlorodimethylcyclopentadienyltitanium(IV) , and bis[(trimethylsilyl)methyl]titanocene resulted in the ring - opening metathesis polymerization of norbornene . presumably , the in-situ generation of free or complexed titanium alkylidene intermediates is responsible for these polymerizations . the use of tetrahydrofuran as the solvent had a significant inhibitory effect that varied with the initiator used . this effect was confirmed with the measurement of kinetic data . this substituent - dependent solvent effect was attributed to changes in the relative contributions of nucleophilic and neutral resonance structures , in agreement with recent theoretical calculations . 
with the aim of a possible rationalization of the probability distributions of stereochemical configurations of the regioirregular units in isotactic polymer samples ( prepared in the presence of rac-ethylenebis(4 , <nUm> , <nUm> , 7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride or rac-ethylenebis(l-indenyl)zirconium dichloride and methylaluminoxane ) , a detailed molecular mechanics analysis on previously proposed model catalytic sites is reported . In particular , catalytic intermediates suitable for primary and secondary insertions of propene on primary and secondary polypropene chains , for both systems with rac-ethylenebis(4 , <nUm> , <nUm> , 7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl ) and rac-ethylenebis(l-indenyl) ligands , are compared . the models are able to rationalize the observed enantioselectivities , not only for the regioregular placements but also for the regioirregular placements ( secondary insertion on a primary chain and primary insertion on a secondary chain ) . moreover , the nonbonded interactions in the models give a contribution in favor of the monomer coordination suitable for the primary insertion , even after an occasional secondary insertion , and are able to account for the higher regiospecificity observed for titanocene - based , with respect to zirconocene - based , catalytic systems . 
this is the first report on the simulation of the full dynamics , at a quantum mechanical level , of a catalytic chemical reaction . ab initio molecular dynamics simulations on ethylene insertion in a bridged dicyclopentadienyl-methylzirconocene have revealed that the entire reaction path starting from the p-coordinated ethylene-zirconocene complex up to and including propyl formation takes place in about <nUm> fs , which is unexpectedly fast . this observation suggests the absence of any significant barrier of activation , as confirmed by static energy minimizations . the cp rings are very flexible . starting from a reactant structure without a-agostic interaction , at T = <nUm> K such an interaction evolves during the course of the insertion reaction and before the propyl is formed . the product state exhibits g-H agostic interaction . 
the reaction of B(C6F5)3with zirconocene dimethyl complexes L2ZrMe2in hydrocarbon solvents affords base - free cationic zirconium complexes L2ZrMe+MeB(C6F5)3- ( L = e5-C5H5 , <nUm> ; e5-Me2C5H3 , <nUm> ; e5-Me5C5 , <nUm> ; e5- (TMS)2C5H3 , <nUm> ) in quantitative yields . A similar reaction using (tBu2C5H3)2ZrMe2results in the formation of the cationic metallacyclic product tBu2C5H3 ) [ tBuC5H3(Me2)CH2Zr+MeB(C6F5)3- ( 6 ) through what is presumably an intramolecular C-H activation process . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> undergo rapid hydrogenolysis to yield the corresponding cationic hydrido complexes (Me5C5)2ZrH+MeB(C6F5)3- ( 7 ) , (Me5C5)2ZrH+HB(C6F5)3- ( 8 ) ( stepwise ) , and (tBu2C5H3)2ZrH+MeB(C6F5)3- ( 9 ) , respectively . complex <nUm> undergoes slow conversion to { [(Me2C5H3)2ZrMe]2(m- F)]+MeB(C6F5)3- ( 12 ) in C6D6under an inert atmosphere at <nUm> ° C . complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> have been characterized by x-ray diffraction ( crystal data : <nUm> , monoclinic , P21 / n , a = <nUm> a,b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , r = <nUm> ; <nUm> , monoclinic , P21 / n , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β - <nUm> ° , r = <nUm> ; <nUm> , triclinic , pi , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , r = <nUm> ; <nUm> , monoclinic , p21a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , r = <nUm> ; <nUm> , triclinic , pi , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , r = <nUm> ; <nUm> , triclinic , p1a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° ,R = <nUm> ) . these structure determinations allow detailed analysis of the metrical aspects of L2ZrMe+MeB(C6F5)3- ion pairing on the solid state . As revealed by dynamic1H NMR , complexes 1-4 undergo rapid intramolecular Zr-Me / B-Me exchange ( [?]G*(s , kcal / mol , ° C , complex ) = <nUm> ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ; <nUm> ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ; <nUm> ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ; <nUm> ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ) and for <nUm> and <nUm> , symmetrizing ion - pair dissociation - recombination processes ( [?]G*(s , kcal / mol , ° C , complex ) = <nUm> ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ; <nUm> ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ) . complexes 1-4 , <nUm> , and <nUm> are highly active homogeneous catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene with activities ( <nUm> - <nUm> x <nUm> g polyethylene / mol Zr h atm at <nUm> ° C ) comparable to methylalumoxane - based zirconocene catalysts . complexes 1-3 , <nUm> and <nUm> are also active for the atactic polymerization of propylene . In regard to polymerization chain transfer mechanisms , NMR endgroup analysis and labeling experiments using CH2 = CH13CH3indicate the predominant pathway for <nUm> and <nUm> is 0-H elimination , while for <nUm> it is 0-CH3elimination . these experiments unambiguously rule out propylene C-H activation processes as an important chain transfer pathway . complex <nUm> is highly active for the catalytic dimerization of propylene ( nt = <nUm> s-1at <nUm> ° C ) to form a mixture of 2-methyl-l-pentene and 2-methyl-2-pentene . 
In some cases zirconocene — imine complexes insert CO2 ; more generally they insert isocyanates and cyclic carbonates . isocyanates can insert into either the Zr – C or the Zr – N bond ; protonolysis of the zirconacycle resulting from Zr – C insertion gives an amide , whereas protonolysis of the zirconacycle resulting from Zr – N insertion gives a urea . steric hindrance on the imine nitrogen or the isocyanate discourages insertion into the Zr – N bond and gives clean Zr – C insertion . the molecular structure of an n-phenyl imine complex ( 5a ) has been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . A coordinated THF in 5a exchanges with free THF by a dissociative mechanism . coordination of isocyanates to the Zr of 5a has not been observed before their insertion . the isocyanate insertion reactions of imine complexes such as <nUm> are irreversible . A chelating o-methoxy substituent on the n-phenyl of an imine complex ( 18 ) also prevents insertion into the Zr – N bond and gives clean Zr – C insertion . the treatment of <nUm> with ethylene carbonate gives a spirocyclic complex ( 23 ) ; methanolysis of <nUm> in benzene gives the methyl ester of phenylglycine . A crossover experiment suggests that the free b-hydroxyethyl ester is an intermediate in the benzene methanolysis of <nUm> . 
the interaction of (e5-C5H5)2ZrX2 ( x = me , Cl ) with Al (tBu)3 and alumoxanes [ (tBu)2Al{m-OAl (Bu)2}]2 and [ (tBu)Al (m3-O)]n ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) has been investigated . the lewis acid — base complexes (e5-C5H5)2Zr ( x ) (m-X)-Al (tBu)3 [ x = me ( 1 ) , Cl ( 2 ) ] have been isolated and characterized by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy . the molecular structure of compound <nUm> has been obtained by x-ray crystallography , indicating the presence of a Zr (m-Cl)Al moiety . the Zr (m-Cl)Al interaction in compound <nUm> is compared to the Al — Cl bond in [PPN][AlCl- (tBu)3 ] ( 4 ) . [ (tBu)2Al{m-OAl (tBu)2}]2 , which contains two three - coordinate ( unsaturated ) aluminum centers , shows no reaction with (e5-C5H5)2ZrMe2and no catalytic activity toward ethylene polymerization . In contrast , the closed cage compound [ (tBu)Al (m3-O)]6reacts reversibly to give the ion pair complex [ (e5-C5H5)2ZrMe][ (tBu)6Al6 (O)6Me ] ( 7 ) . the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant keq has been determined and , hence , the enthalpy and entropy for the formation of complex <nUm> [ DH = <nUm> ( 1 ) kJ mol-1 , DS = <nUm> ( 5 ) J mol-1 K-1 ] . complex <nUm> is active as a catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene . polymerization is also observed for mixtures of (e5-C5H5)2ZrMe2with [ (tBu)Al (m3-O)]n ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) despite the lack of observable complex formation . A solution structure of <nUm> is proposed upon the basis of NMR spectroscopy and a comparison with [ (Et2O)Li]2[ (tBu)6Al6 (O)6Me2 ] ( 8 ) , formed from the reaction of f (tBu)Al (m3-O)]6with MeLi in Et2O . upon the basis of NMR spectroscopy , compound <nUm> exists as either the anti ( 8a ) or syn ( 8b ) isomer as a result of endo or exo methylation of the aluminum centers . the lithium atoms in compound <nUm> are formally two - coordinate ; however , close tert-butyl C — H***Li contacts suggest the presence of agostic stabilization . these results are discussed with respect to the commercial (e5-C5H5)2ZrMe2- methylalumoxane ( MAO ) polyolefin catalyst system , and the new concept of “ latent lewis acidity ” (GAL-O)is proposed to account for the reactivity of the cage hexamer [ (tBu)Al (m3-O)]6 . crystal data for <nUm> : orthorhombic , pnma , a = <nUm> ( 9 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , rw = <nUm> . crystal data for <nUm> : monoclinic , P21 / n , a = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 7 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , rw = <nUm> . crystal data for <nUm> : orthorhombic , pbca , a = <nUm> ( 8 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 6 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 9 ) Å , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , rw = <nUm> . 
the first high molecular weight polystannanes , H(SnR2)nH ( r = nBu , nHex , nOct ) , result from dehydropolymerization of secondary stannanes R2SnH2 by zirconocene catalysts . good catalysts include zirconocenes based on both CpCp*Zr ( cp* = e-CsMes ) and Cp2Zr fragments , and the most active catalyst with respect to production of high molecular weight polystannanes was Me2C(e5-C5H4)2Zr[Si(SiMe3)3]Me . the latter catalyst produced H(SnnBu2)nH chains ( mw / Mn = <nUm> <nUm> / <nUm> <nUm> ) that were contaminated by ca. <nUm> % ( by weight ) low molecular weight cyclic oligomers . lower molecular weights resulted from dehydropolymerizations of Me2SnH2 , PhMeSnH2 , and Ph2SnH2 . At room temperature , H(SnR2)nH ( r = alkyl group ) polystannanes have amax values at ca. <nUm> — <nUm> nm , attributed to σ — s* transitions . thermal gravimetric analyses on the polystannanes reveal that these polymers are as thermally stable as related poly(dialkylsilane)s and have onset temperatures for thermal decomposition in the range <nUm> — <nUm> ° C , under both nitrogen and air . the H(SnnBu2)nH polymer has been shown to be a good precursor to sn02 , as shown by bulk pyrolysis in air ( ceramic yield : <nUm> % ) . preliminary results also indicate that these polymers may be useful as precursors to elemental tin . the polystannanes are photosensitive , and their photobleaching behavior has been characterized by UV — vis spectrometry and 119Sn NMR spectroscopy , which demonstrated that H(SnnBu2)nH is photochemically depolymerized to a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of cyclo-(SnnBu2)5 and cyclo-(SnnBu2)6 . the polymers H(SnnHex2)nH and H(SnnOct2)nH exhibit thermochromic behavior which is visibly evident as a discoloration from yellow to colorless upon warming above room temperature . this reversible behavior is associated with an abrupt change in amax ( e.g. , from <nUm> to <nUm> nm for films of H(SnnOct2)nH ) and a phase change at ca. <nUm> ° C ( by differential scanning calorimetry ) . thin films of H(SnnBu2)nH and H(SnnOct2)nH on glass slides were doped by exposure to SbF5vapor to conductivities of 10-2and <nUm> S cm-1 , respectively . preliminary experiments suggest that the dehydropolymerization occurs by a a-bond metathesis mechanism involving four - center transition states . A previous report on production of high molecular weight poly(dibutylstannane) by the reductive coupling of nBu2SnCl2by Na / 15-crown-5 was reinvestigated and found to produce only low molecular weight material with mw / Mn = <nUm> / <nUm> . 
this contribution reports the synthesis and activity as precatalysts for stereoselective propylene polymerization of several chiral non-C2 symmetric zirconocene and hafnocene complexes , (R)- and (S)-Me2Si(Me4C5)-(C5H3R*)MR2 ( r = cl(2) or me(3) ) where R* = (1R,2S,5R)-trans-5-methyl-cis-2-(2-propyl)cyclohexyl ( (-)-menthyl ; m = Zr , ( a ) and m = Hf , ( b ) ) and (1S,2S,5R)trans-5-methyl-cis-2-(2-propyl)cyclohexyl ( (+)-neomenthyl ; m = Zr ( c ) ) . metallocene dichlorides were prepared from MCl4 and Li2Me2Si(Me4C5)(C5H3R*) and converted to the corresponding dimethyl complexes with MeLi*LiBr . all complexes were characterized by standard techniques , with absolute configuration established by circular dichroism and x-ray diffraction . for the ( r ) — R* = ( — )-menthyldichloro complex ( 2a ) : space group = F212121 ; a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> A( - <nUm> ° C ) , z = <nUm> ; R(F) — <nUm> , Rw(F) = <nUm> for <nUm> reflections having I > 3s(I) . for the ( r ) — R* = ( — )-menthyldimethyl complex ( 3a ) : space group = P21 ; a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° ( <nUm> ° C ) , z = <nUm> ; R(F) = <nUm> , RW(F) = <nUm> for <nUm> reflections having I > 3s(I) . reaction of either (R)-3a or (R)-3b with BC18F15 in toluene yields two spectroscopically discernible methyl cations . the temperature dependence of the ion - pair equilibrium constant in toluene yields DH = <nUm> kcal / mol and DS = — <nUm> eu for (R)-3a and DH = <nUm> kcal / mol and AS = <nUm> for (R)-3b . “ cationic ” propylene polymerization catalysts were generated from <nUm> + methylalumoxane or <nUm> + methylalumoxane , BC18F15 , Ph3C+B(C6F5)4_ , or HN(nBu3)+B(C6F5)4_ . polymerization activities , stereoregularities , and polymer molecular weights are strongly dependent on cocatalyst identities and concentrations , suggesting strong , structure - sensitive ion - pairing effects . polypropylene isotacticities as high as <nUm> % mmmm pentad content are observed , with stereoregularity increasing and polymerization activity falling with decreasing reaction temperature . 
A general method for the in situ production of zirconocene complexes of substituted benzynes is reported . these complexes can be trapped with nitriles to form good yields of metallacyclic compounds with extremely good regiochemical control . these compounds can be converted into ketones , a-iodo ketones , and isothiazoles by using experimentally simple procedures . In addition , generation of the benzyne complexes under <nUm> atm of ethylene produces metallacycles which can be readily converted into the corresponding benzocyclobutanes . 
bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanacyclobutanes <nUm> and <nUm> have been prepared from the reaction of norbornene ( bicyclo-[2.2.1]hept-2-ene ) with precursors of ” Cp2Ti = CH2 ” and “ Cp2Ti = C3H5 ” , respectively . on thermolysis , both <nUm> and <nUm> produce products consistent with the intermediacy of a-substituted titanocene carbene compounds . thermolysis at <nUm> ° C in the presence of excess norbornene affords ring - opened polynorbornene with a cis to trans ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> . the polymerizations are highly efficient in catalyst and yield polymers of controlled molecular weight . polymer prepared from <nUm> shows polydispersities as low as <nUm> based on gel permeation chromatography vs. polystyrene standards . the molecular weight distributions of polymers obtained with <nUm> are always broader than those obtained with <nUm> . the kinetics of both polymerizations are zero order in monomer with DG ‡ <nUm> = <nUm> kcal / mol , DH ‡ = <nUm> kcal / mol , and DS ‡ = <nUm> eu . polymerization with <nUm> shows an induction period corresponding to a first - order decay of <nUm> with t1 / <nUm> = <nUm> min at <nUm> ° C , whereas the polymerization with <nUm> is linear throughout . simultaneous incorporation of norbornene-d2into the polymer by all active sites confirms that this system is best described as a living polymer . the polymerization mechanism is discussed as an olefin metathesis with rate - limiting cleavage of trisubstituted titanacyclobutanes affording high - energy carbene intermediates . 
two new compounds , <nUm> and <nUm> , were observed by NMR spectroscopy in PhSiH3 undergoing dehydrogenative polymerization under the catalytic influence of Cp2Ti(CH3)2 . with use of slightly different reaction conditions , these two compounds were synthesized in good yields and their structures established by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography . compound <nUm> is a dimer of Cp2TiSiH2Ph in which dimerization occurs through a pair of Ti-H-Si bridges . compound <nUm> has the structure [ Cp2Ti( / u-H)(ju-HSiHPh)TiCp2 ] . under ambient conditions <nUm> spontaneously decomposes into <nUm> with production of poly(phenylsilane) . <nUm> is transformed into <nUm> in the presence of excess PhSiH3 . some chemistry and ESR spectroscopic properties of these two unusual compounds are described , and their possible involvement in the polymerization reaction is discussed . 
the formation of adducts of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane with strongly coordinating anions such as CN- and [M(CN)4]2- ( m = Ni , Pd ) is a synthetically facile route to the bulky , very weakly coordinating anions [CN{B(C6F5)3}2]- and [M{CNB(C6F5)3}4] 2- which are isolated as stable NHMe2Ph+ and CPh3+ salts . the crystal structures of [CPh3][CN{B(C6F5)3} <nUm> ] ( 1 ) , [CPh3][ClB(C6F5)3] ( 2 ) , [NHMe2Ph]2[Ni{CNB(C6F5) 3}4]*2Me2CO ( 4b*2Me2CO ) , [CPh3]2[Ni{CNB(C6F5) 3}4]*2CH2Cl2 ( 4c*2CH2Cl2 ) , and [CPh3]2[Pd{CNB(C6F5) <nUm> } 4]*2CH2Cl2 ( 5c*2CH2Cl2 ) are reported . the CN stretching frequencies in <nUm> and <nUm> are shifted by ∼ <nUm> cm-1 to higher wavenumbers compared to the parent tetracyano complexes in aqueous solution , although the M-C and C-N distances show no significant change on BC18F15 coordination . zirconocene dimethyl complexes L2ZrMe2 [ L2 = cp2 , SBI = rac-Me2Si(Ind)2 ] react with <nUm> , 4c or 5c in benzene solution at <nUm> ° C to give the salts of binuclear methyl-bridged cations , [(L2ZrMe)2(m-Me)] [CN{B(C6F5)3}2] and [(L2ZrMe)2(m-Me)]2 [M{CNB-(C6F5)3}4] . the reactivity of these species in solution was studied in comparison with the known [{(SBI)-ZrMe}2(m-Me)][B(C6F5)4 ] . while the latter reacts with excess [CPh3][B(C6F5)4] in benzene to give the mononuclear ion pair [ (SBI)ZrMe+*** B(C6F5)4- ] in a pseudo-first-order reaction , k = <nUm> × 10-4 s-1 , [(L2-ZrMe)2(m-Me)] [CN{B(C6F5)3}2] reacts to give a mixture of L2ZrMe(m-Me)B(C6F5)3 and L2ZrMe(m-NC)B-(C6F5)3 . recrystallization of [Cp''2Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2] [CN{B(C6F5)3}2] affords Cp''2ZrMe(m-NC) BC18F15 <nUm> , the x-ray structure of which is reported . the stability of [(L2ZrMe)2(m-Me)]+X- decreases in the order x = [B(C6F5)4] > [M{CNB(C6F5)3}4] > [CN{B(C6F5)3}2] and increases strongly with the steric bulk of L2 = cp2 ≪ SBI . activation of (SBI)ZrMe2 by <nUm> in the presence of AlBui3 gives extremely active ethene polymerization catalysts . polymerization studies at 1-7 bar monomer pressure suggest that these , and by implication most other highly active ethene polymerization catalysts , are strongly mass - transport limited . by contrast , monitoring propene polymerization activities with the systems (SBI)ZrMe2 / <nUm> / AlBui3 and CGCTiMe2 / <nUm> / AlBui3 at <nUm> ° C as a function of catalyst concentration demonstrates that in these cases mass - transport limitation is absent up to [metal] ≈ <nUm> × 10-5 mol L-1 . propene polymerization activities decrease in the order [CN{B(C6F5)3}2]- > [B(C6F5)4]- > [M{CNB(C6F5)3}4]2- ≫ [MeB(C6F5)3]- , with differences in activation barriers relative to [CN{B(C6F5)3}2]- of DDG ‡ = <nUm> ( B(C6F5)4- ) , <nUm> ( Ni{CNB(C6F5)3}42- ) and <nUm> - <nUm> kJ mol-1 ( MeB(C6F5)3- ) . the data suggest that even in the case of very bulky anions with delocalized negative charge the displacement of the anion by the monomer must be involved in the rate - limiting step . 
the soluble bis(cyclopentadienyl)bis(phenyl)titanium / methylalumoxane catalyst system produces isotactic polypropylene with a novel stereoblock microstructure consistent with a chain - end stereochemical control mechanism . chiral catalysts derived from the racemic enantiomers of ethylene-bridged indenyl derivatives are the first metallocene catalysts to form isotactic polypropylene with the conventional structure predicted by an enantiomorphic - site stereochemical control model . the meso achiral form of the ethylene-bridged titanium indenyl diastereomers and zirconocene derivatives produce polypropylene with an ideally atactic structure . differing regiospecificities during cis addition with soluble Ti and V chain - end controlled stereospecific systems result in Ti being isotactic specific and V being syndiotactic specific . 
ion pairs of the type Cpx2ZrMe+***A - containing various ansa - zirconocene methyl cations in contact with Me-B(C6F5)3- or B(C6F5)4- anions have been studied with regard to their anion exchange kinetics by 2D - NMR methods in benzene or toluene solutions . the results - acceleration of anion exchange by added Li+***Me-B(C6F5) 3- , substantial nonproductive exchange between added and Zr - bound Me-B(C6F5)3- anions , an increase of exchange rates at increased zirconocene concentrations , and the exclusively entropic origin of this rate increase - all indicate that anion exchange occurs by way of ion quadruples or higher ionic aggregates , rather than via dissociation to solvent - separated ions . these findings imply that solvent - separated ( i.e. anion - free ) alkyl zirconocene cations are unlikely to be relevant intermediates in reaction systems containing Cpx2ZrMe+***A - ion pairs and , hence , also in zirconocene - based catalyst systems for the polymerization of a-olefins . 
the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with <nUm> equiv of BuLi at <nUm> ° C , followed by the addition of an unsymmetrical tetra- or pentafluorophenyl substituted alkyne R1C ≡ CArf ( R1 , arf = (CH2)4Me , p-C6F4H ; me , p-C6F4H ; ph , C6F5 ) , resulted in regioselective couplings of these alkynes to zirconacyclopentadienes in which the arf substituents preferentially adopt the 3,4-positions ( bb ) of the zirconacyclopentadiene ring . with Cp2Zr(py)(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) as the zirconocene reagent , the couplings could be carried out at room temperature ; however , at higher temperatures significant quantities of the 2,4-fluoroaryl substituted ( ab ) isomers were also formed . none of the conditions employed produced the 2,5-fluoroaryl substituted ( aa ) isomers . these fluoroaryl-substituted zirconacyclopentadienes were readily converted to butadienes via reactions with acids . the zirconacyclopentadiene Cp2ZrC4-2,5-Ph2-3,4- C6F5 , which resulted from the coupling of PhC ≡ C7F5 , was converted to the corresponding thiophene by reaction with ClS , and to an arene by reaction with MeO2CC ≡ CCO2Me / ClCu . mechanistic studies on zirconocene couplings of (p-CF3C6H4)C ≡ C ( p-MeC6H4 ) indicate that the observed regioselectivities are determined by an electronic factor that controls the orientation of at least one of the two alkynes as they are coupled . additionally , these studies suggest an unsymmetrical transition state for the zirconocene coupling of alkynes , and this is supported by DFT calculations . the reaction of [ C7F5 ≡ CH ] 2CH2 with Cp2Zr(py)(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) resulted in a zirconacyclopentadiene in which the pentafluorophenyl substituents have been forced into the 2,5-positions ( aa ) . zirconocene coupling of the diyne C7F5 ≡ C-1,4-C6 H4-C ≡ C7F5 provided a route to conjugated polymers bearing electron - withdrawing pentafluorophenyl groups . 
the kinetics of propene polymerization catalyzed by ansa - metallocenes were studied using quenched - flow techniques . two catalyst systems were investigated , (SBI)ZrMe2 / AlBu3 / [Ph3C][CN{B (C6F5)3}2 ] ( <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> ) at <nUm> ° C and BCl2ISZr / methylalumoxane at <nUm> ° C ( Al : Zr = <nUm> : <nUm> ) ( SBI = rac-Me2Si(1-Indenyl)2 ) . the aims of the study were to address fundamental mechanistic aspects of metallocene - catalyzed alkene polymerizations , catalyst initiation , the quantitative correlation between catalyst structure and the rate of chain propagation , and the nature of dormant states . one of the most important but largely unknown factors in metallocene catalysis is the distribution of the catalyst between dormant states and species actively involved in polymer chain growth . measurements of polymer yield Y versus reaction time t for propene concentrations [M] = <nUm> - <nUm> mol L-1 and zirconocene concentrations in the range [Zr] = ( <nUm> - <nUm> ) × 10-5 mol L-1 for the borate system showed first - order dependence on [M] and [Zr] . up to t ≈ <nUm> s , the half - life of catalyst initiation is comparable to the half - life of chain growth ; that is , this phase is governed by non-steady-state kinetics . we propose a rate law which takes account of this and accurately describes the initial rates . curve fitting of y(t) data provides an apparent chain growth rate constant kpapp on the order of <nUm> L mol-1 s-1 . by contrast , the evolution with time of the number - average polymer molecular weight , which is independent of the concentration of catalyst involved , leads to a kp which is an order of magnitude larger , ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) × <nUm> L mol-1 s-1 . the ratio kpapp / kp = <nUm> indicates that under the given conditions only about <nUm> % of the total catalyst is actively engaged in chain growth at any one time . the system (SBI)-ZrCl2 / methylalumoxane is significantly less active , kpapp = <nUm> ± <nUm> and kp = ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) × <nUm> L mol-1 s-1 , while , surprisingly , the mole fraction of active species is essentially identical , <nUm> % . evidently , the energetics of the chain growth sequence are strongly modulated by the nature of the counteranion . increasing the counteranion / zirconium ratio from <nUm> : <nUm> to <nUm> : <nUm> has no influence on catalyst activity . these findings are consistent with a model of closely associated ion pairs throughout the chain growth sequence . for the borate system , propagation is ∼ <nUm> times faster than initiation , while for the MAO catalyst , kp / ki ≈ <nUm> . polymers obtained at <nUm> ° C show <nUm> - <nUm> mol % 2,1-regioerrors , and end - group analysis identifies 2,1- misinsertions as the main cause for chain termination ( <nUm> % ) , as compared to <nUm> % for the vinylidene end groups . the results suggest that 2,1-regioerrors are a major contributor to the formation of dormant species , even at short reaction times . 
this paper describes the synthesis of base - free (C5R5)2Zr(OtBu)+ cations , the direct observation of nonchelated alkene and alkyne adducts of these cations , and studies of the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of these novel species . reaction of Cp2'ZrMe2 ( cp' = C5H4Me ) with tert-butyl alcohol followed by [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] in benzene yields [ Cp2'Zr(O'Bu) ][B(C6F5)4] ( 1 ) , which exists as Cp2'Zr(O'Bu)(CIR)+ solvent adducts in C6D5Cl and CD2Cl2 solutions . addition of ligands L ( L = ethylene , propylene , propyne , 2-butyne , CO , phenylacetylene , allene , 1-hexene , cis-2-butene ) to <nUm> in CD2Cl2 at <nUm> ° C results in reversible formation of Cp2'Zr(O'Bu)(L)+ adducts .

the synthesis , structural characterization , and abstraction chemistry of ansa - zirconocene ester enolate complexes relevant to the isospecific polymerization of methacrylates are reported . reactions of rac - (EBI)ZrMe(OTf) and rac - (EBI)Zr(OTf) <nUm> [ EBI = C 2H 4(Ind) <nUm> ] with <nUm> and <nUm> equiv of lithium isopropylisobutyrate in toluene produce the first examples of ansa - zirconocene mono- and diester enolate complexes : rac - (EBI)ZrMe[OC(O iPr ) = CMe <nUm> ] ( 1 ) and rac - (EBI)Zr[OC(O iPr ) = CMe <nUm> ] <nUm> ( 2 ) in <nUm> % and <nUm> % isolated yields , respectively . the reaction of <nUm> with B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> was investigated in six different organic solvents ; in THF at ambient temperature , this reaction cleanly produces the isolable cationic ansa - zirconocene ester enolate complex rac - (EBI)Zr+(THF)[OC(O iPr ) = CMe 2][MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - ( 3 ) in quantitative yield . the analogous reaction of <nUm> with Al(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> in toluene , however , proceeds through a proposed novel , intramolecular proton transfer process in which propylene is eliminated from the isopropoxy group , subsequently producing a carboxylate - bridged tight ion pair rac - (EBI)Zr+(Me)OC( iPr)OAl(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> - ( 4 ) . In addition to standard spectroscopic and analytical characterizations for the isolated complexes 1-4 , complexes <nUm> and <nUm> have also been structurally characterized by x-ray diffraction studies . polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) and n-butyl methacrylate ( BMA ) has been investigated using complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> . both the isolated cationic <nUm> and neutral <nUm> ( the latter combined with B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> in situ ) are highly active ( <nUm> min for quantitative MMA conversion ) and highly isospecific ( [mm] > <nUm> % for PMMA ; [mm] > <nUm> % for PBMA ) via enantiomorphic - site control , producing polymethacrylates with extremely narrow molecular weight distributions ( m w / m n = <nUm> ) . the aluminate complex <nUm> , however , produces syndiotactic PMMA predominantly via chain - end control . 
the ansa - zirconocene dichlorides [ Me2Si(C5H 4)(3-R-C5H3)]ZrCl2 7a-e ( r = H , CH3 , cyclohexyl , -CHMe2 , -CMe3 ) were reacted with butadiene-magnesium to yield the respective ( η 4-butadiene)metallocenes 17a-e . the chiral examples give a mixture of two s-cis and two s-trans diastereomers . the strong lewis acid B(C 6F5)3 adds selectively to a terminal butadiene carbon atom to yield the (butadiene)metallocene / B(C6F 5)3 betaine complexes 18a-e . initially , the formation of the Z-18 isomers is preferred . these consecutively rearrange to the thermodynamically favored isomers E-18 . the dipolar systems <nUm> are active single component metallocene catalysts for the stereospecific polymerization of methyl methacrylate . with increasing steric bulk of the attached single alkyl substituent an increasingly isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate ) is obtained . A similar trend is observed in the methyl methacrylate polymerization at the [ Me2Si(C5H4)(3-R-C5H 3)]ZrCH3+ catalysts ( 9a-e ) that were conventionally prepared by methyl abstraction from the corresponding ansa - zirconocene dimethyl complexes by treatment with B(C6F 5)3 . A comparison of the poly(methyl methacrylates ) obtained at these two series of catalysts has revealed substantial differences in stereoselectivity that probably originate from an influence of the respective counteranions . an initial reactive intermediate of methyl methacrylate addition to the dipolar single component metallocene catalyst e-18a was experimentally observed and characterized by NMR spectroscopy at <nUm> K . the subsequently formed series of [ PMMA-C4H6-B(C 6F5)3]- anion oligomers ( at the catalyst 18c ) was monitored ( after quenching ) and characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry . 
the presence of " free " trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) in methylalumoxane ( MAO ) solutions can be highly detrimental to the performance of metallocene and " post-metallocene " olefin polymerization catalysts . the most used strategy to remove " free " TMA is to evaporate MAO solutions to dryness , until a free - flowing white powder ( " solid MAO " ) is left . this procedure is tedious and potentially hazardous , because in some cases the distillate is a concentrated hydrocarbon solution of TMA . moreover , " solid MAO " is poorly soluble in common polymerization media , and once in solution it can regenerate TMA to some extent . this communication reports on a facile alternative , which consists in the controlled addition of a sterically hindered phenol , such as 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol , effectively trapping " free " TMA . we show here that 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol / MAO solutions activate equally well the dichloro-precursors of well - known zirconocene and bis(phenoxyimine)Ti catalysts , and that their use in propene polymerization results in a substantially higher productivity , polymer stereoregularity , and / or average molecular mass compared with activation by MAO alone . the presence of " free " trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) in methylalumoxane ( MAO ) solutions can be highly detrimental to the performance of metallocene and " post-metallocene " olefin polymerization catalysts . the most used strategy to remove " free " TMA is to evaporate MAO solutions to dryness , until a free - flowing white powder ( " solid MAO " ) is left . this procedure is tedious and potentially hazardous , because in some cases the distillate is a concentrated hydrocarbon solution of TMA . moreover , " solid MAO " is poorly soluble in common polymerization media , and once in solution it can regenerate TMA to some extent . this communication reports on a facile alternative , which consists in the controlled addition of a sterically hindered phenol , such as 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol , effectively trapping " free " TMA . we show here that 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol / MAO solutions activate equally well the dichloro-precursors of well - known zirconocene and bis(phenoxyimine)Ti catalysts , and that their use in propene polymerization results in a substantially higher productivity , polymer stereoregularity , and / or average molecular mass compared with activation by MAO alone . copyright

titanium cyclopentadienyl ( cp ) complexes play important roles as homogeneous polymerization catalysts and have recently received attention as potential anticancer agents . to systematically probe the contribution of the cp to bonding in organotitanium complexes , Ti K - edge XAS has been applied to Cl4Ti and then to the mono- and bis-Cp complexes , TiCpCl3 and TiCp2Cl2 . Ti K - edge XAS is used as a direct probe of metal 3d-4p mixing and provides insight into the contribution of the cp to bonding . these data are complimented by Cl K - edge XAS data , which provide a direct probe of the effect of the cp on the bonding to the spectator chloride ligand . the experimental results are correlated to DFT calculations . A model for metal 3d-4p mixing is proposed , which is based on covalent interactions with the ligands and demonstrates that metal k-pre - edge intensities may be used as a measure of ligand - metal covalency in molecular Ti(IV) systems in noncentrosymmetric environments .

A linear dependence of molecular weight on conversion , low polydispersity , and reinitiation of the polymerization in the presence of fresh monomer indicates that the polymerization is living and that it most likely occurs by the reversible endcapping of the macroradical with Ti (III) . moreover , epoxides provide convenient access to alcohol chain ends , suitable for further transformations . epoxides and paramagnetic early transition metal complexes are introduced as two new classes of initiators and catalysts , respectively , for living radical polymerizations . thus , Ti(III)Cp2Cl synthesized in situ from the reduction of TiCp2Cl2 with Zn catalyzes the radical ring opening of oxiranes to initiate the radical polymerization of styrene .

A new general , synthetically simple , and safe method for the preparation of metal carbene complexes , which is based on diphenyl sulfonium salts as carbenoid precursors , has been developed , and its scope and applications were studied . In general , deprotonation of a sulfonium salt with a base results in a sulfur ylide , which , in turn , reacts with an appropriate metal precursor to give the corresponding metal carbene complex . thus , starting from benzyldiphenylsulfonium salt , the complexes (PCX)Rh = CHPh ( x = P , N ) were prepared in quantitative yield . syntheses of grubbs ' catalyst , ( PCy 3)2Cl2Ru = CHPh , and of werner 's carbene , [ os( = CHPh)HCl(CO)(PiPr3)2 ] , were achieved by this method . novel trans-bisphosphine Rh and Ir carbenes , ( iPr 3P)2(Cl)M = CHPh , which could not be prepared by other known methods , were synthesized by the sulfur ylide approach . the method is not limited to metal benzylidenes , as demonstrated by the preparation of the Ru vinyl-alkylidene , (PCy3)2Cl2Ru = CH-CH = CH <nUm> , methoxycarbonyl-alkylidene , (PCy3)2Cl 2Ru = CH(CO2Me) , and alkylidene ( PCy3 ) 2Cl2Ru = CH2 , ( PCy3 ) 2Cl2Ru = CH2 compounds . the problem of recycling of starting materials as well as the issue of facile purification of the product metal carbene complex were addressed by the synthesis of a polymer - supported diarylsulfide , the carrier of the carbenoid unit in the process . based on the sulfur ylide route , a methodology for the synthesis of metallocarbenes anchored to a polymer via the carbene ligand , using a commercial merrifield resin , was developed . 
poly(propylene-ran-1,3-butadiene) that contained pendant vinyl groups derived from 1,2-inserted butadiene units was selectively synthesized by rac-dimethylsilylbis(2-methyl-4-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( ph - ind ) activated with modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) in the presence of hydrogen . the copolymers obtained without hydrogen had 1,2-inserted and 1,4-inserted butadiene units . the addition of hydrogen to the copolymerization improved the activity by ∼ 1000-fold and gave the copolymer only with 1,2-inserted butadiene units , of which the content was equal to the copolymer obtained without hydrogen . the 13C NMR analysis of the copolymers clarified that butadiene also inserted into the copolymer as a tetramethylene unit , of which the content was almost the same as that of 1,4-inserted butadiene units observed in the absence of hydrogen . No signal that could be assigned to cyclic structures or long branched side chains was observed . these results indicate that p-allyl species of zirconocenes formed by 1,4-butadiene insertion at the growing polymer chain ends transformed to the tetramethylene chain end by hydrogenation and continued successive propylene insertion . poly(propylene-ran-1,3-butadiene) that contained pendant vinyl groups derived from 1,2-inserted butadiene units was selectively synthesized by rac-dimethylsilylbis(2-methyl-4-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( ph - ind ) activated with modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) in the presence of hydrogen . the copolymers obtained without hydrogen had 1,2-inserted and 1,4-inserted butadiene units . the addition of hydrogen to the copolymerization improved the activity by ∼ 1000-fold and gave the copolymer only with 1,2-inserted butadiene units , of which the content was equal to the copolymer obtained without hydrogen . the 13C NMR analysis of the copolymers clarified that butadiene also inserted into the copolymer as a tetramethylene unit , of which the content was almost the same as that of 1,4-inserted butadiene units observed in the absence of hydrogen .

the copolymerization of ethylene with styrene by Cp*TiCl2(N = CtBu2 ) ( cp* = C5Me5 ) took place in a living manner in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) cocatalyst , although the homopolymerization of neither ethylene nor styrene proceeded in a living manner . both the cyclopentadienyl fragment ( cp- ) and the anionic donor ligand ( x ) in cp - TiCl2(X) directly affect the copolymerization behavior , the catalytic activities , as well as the styrene incorporation ; only the above set showed a living copolymerization .

this contribution describes the implementation of the binuclear organotitanium " constrained geometry catalysts " ( CGCs ) , ( m-CH 2CH2-3,3'){(e5-indenyl)[1-Me 2Si(tBuN)](TiMe2)}2[EBICGC(TiMe 2)2 ; ti2 ] and ( m-CH2-3,3' ) { (e5-indenyl)[1-Me2Si(tBuN)](TiMe 2)}2[MBICGC(TiMe2)2 ; C1-Ti <nUm> ] , in combination with the bifunctional bisborane activator 1,4-(C6F5)2BC6F4B(C 6F5)2 ( BN2 ) in ethylene + olefin copolymerization processes . specifically examined are the classically poorly responsive 1,1-disubstituted comonomers , methylenecyclopentane ( C ) , methylenecyclohexane ( d ) , 1,1,2-trisubstituted 2-methyl-2-butene ( e ) , and isobutene ( F ) . for the first three comonomers , this represents the first report of their incorporation into a polyethylene backbone via a coordination polymerization process . C and d are incorporated via a ring - unopened pathway , and e is incorporated via a novel pathway involving 2-methyl-1 -butene enchainment in the copolymer backbone . In ethylene copolymerization , Ti <nUm> + BN2 enchains ∼ <nUm> times more C , ∼ <nUm> times more d , and ∼ <nUm> times more e than the mononuclear catalyst analogue [1-Me2Si(3-ethylindenyl)-(tBuN)]TiMe2 ( Ti <nUm> ) + BC18F15 ( BN ) under identical polymerization conditions . polar solvents are found to weaken the catalyst - cocatalyst ion pairing , thus influencing the comonomer enchainment selectivity . 
the reaction of Cp'2Zr(OtBu)Me ( cp' = C5H4Me ) and [Ph3C][B(C6F 5)4 ] yields the base - free complex [ cp' 2Zr(OtBu)][B(C6F5)4] ( 6 ) , which exists as Cp'2Zr(OtBu)(CIR)+ halocarbon adducts in CD2Cl2 or C6D 5Cl solution . addition of alkenes to <nUm> in CD2Cl <nUm> solution at low temperature gives equilibrium mixtures of cp'2- Zr(OtBu)(alkene)+ ( 12a-l ) , <nUm> , and free alkene . the NMR data for 12a-l are consistent with unsymmetrical alkene bonding and polarization of the alkene C = C bond with positive charge buildup at cint and negative charge buildup at cterm . these features arise due to the lack of d-p* back - bonding . equilibrium constants for alkene coordination to <nUm> in CD2Cl2 at <nUm> ° C , K eq = [12][6]-1[alkene]-1 , vary in the order : vinylferrocene ( <nUm> M-1 ) ≫ ethylene ( 7.0 ) ≈ a-olefins > cis-2-butene ( 2.2 ) > trans-2-butene ( < <nUm> ) . alkene coordination is inhibited by sterically bulky substituents on the alkene but is greatly enhanced by electron - donating groups and the b-Si effect . compounds 12a-l undergo two dynamic processes : reversible alkene decomplexation via associative substitution of a CD2Cl2 molecule , and rapid rotation of the alkene around the metal - ( alkene centroid ) axis . 
we report a molecular dynamics study of the dynamics and energetic of the [H2Si(Cp)2ZrMe+][MeB(C6F 5)3- ] , IP , and [ Me2Si(Cp) 2ZrMe+][B(C6F5)4 - ] , IP2 , ion pairs in benzene . the metrical parameters obtained for the IP ion pair are in excellent agreement with the NMR data reported for the strictly related [Me2Si(Cp)2ZrMe+][MeB(C 6F5)3- ] ion pair ( J. am. chem. soc. <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) . this validates the molecular modeling protocol we developed . simulation of the IP2 ion pair suggests that the counterion oscillates between two geometries characterized by a different coordination pattern of the F atoms to the Zr cation . In one case the BC24F20 - coordinates to the metal with two F atoms of the same aryl ring , whereas in the other case two F atoms of different aryl rings are involved in the coordination . strong solvent reorganization occurs around IP and IP2 , as well as around the two isolated cations . In the case of the two ion pairs solvent is never coordinated directly to the metal , whereas in the absence of the counterion one benzene molecule is coordinated to the metal through a cation-p interaction . free energy calculations result in ion pair free energies of separation of <nUm> and <nUm> kcal / mol for IP and IP2 , respectively . simulations with the Zr-B distance fixed at values > <nUm> Å have been also performed . this mimics the situation occurring after counterion displacement by an inserting monomer molecule during olefin polymerization by the title catalysts .

A combined experimental and DFT study of the reactions of the titanium imido methyl cation [ Ti(NtBu)(Me3[9]aneN 3)Me]+ ( 4+ ) with AlMe3 and ZnMe <nUm> is described . reaction of 4+ with AlMe3 gave [ Ti(Nt-Bu)(Me3[9]aneN3)(m-Me) 2AlMe2]+ ( T+ ) , the first structurally characterized AlMe3 adduct of a transition metal alkyl cation and a model for the presumed resting state in MAO - activated olefin polymerizations . reaction of 4+ with ZnMe2 also gave a methyl-bridged heterobinuclear species , namely [ Ti(m-NtBu)(Me 3[9]aneN3)(m-Me)2ZnMe]+ ( <nUm> + ) , the first directly observed ZnMe2 adduct of a transition metal alkyl cation . At room temperature , all three metal - bound methyls of 8+ underwent rapid exchange with those of free ZnMe <nUm> , whereas at <nUm> K only the terminal Zn-Me group exchanged significantly . addition of AlMe3 to 8+ quantitatively formed 7+ and ZnMe2 . reaction of 4+ with Cp2ZrMe2 gave [ Ti(NtBu){Me2(m- CH2)[9]aneN3}-(m-CH2)ZrCp2 ] + ( 10+ ) via a highly selective double C-H bond activation reaction in which both alkyl groups of Cp2ZrMe2 were lost . DFT calculations on models of 7+ confirmed the approximately square - based pyramidal geometries for the bridging methyl groups . calculations on 8+ found that the formation of the Ti(m-Me)2Zn moiety is assisted by an Nimide-Zn dative bond . DFT calculations for the sterically less encumbered methyl cation [ Ti(NMe)(H3[9] aneN3)Me]+ found strong thermodynamic preferences for adducts featuring Nimide-M ( m = Al or Zn ) interactions . this offers insight into recently observed structure - productivity trends in MAO - activated imido-based polymerization catalysts . calculations on the metallocenium adducts [ Cp2Ti(m-Me)2AlMe 2]+ and [Cp2Ti(M-Me)2ZnMe]+ are described , each showing a-agostic interactions for the bridging methyl groups . for these systems and the imido ones , the coordination of AlMe3 to the corresponding monomethyl cation is ca. <nUm> kJ mol-1 more favorable than for ZnMe2 . 
the mechanism of stereocontrol in the site - controlled stereospecific polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) with C2- and C s-symmetric zirconocenes is investigated with a DFT based approach . our model explains the experimentally observed isospecificity in MMA polymerization with the C2 - symmetric rac-C2H 4(Ind)2Zr - based system as well as the experimentally observed syndiospecificity in MMA polymerization with the C s-symmetric Me2C(Cp)(Flu)Zr - based system . In both cases , the chiral metallocene induces a chiral orientation of the ester enolate growing chain . In turn , the chirally oriented growing chain selects its own enantioface . comparison with the mechanism of stereocontrol operative in the case of propene polymerization by the same zirconocenes is performed to stress similarities and differences . although analogies are expected , surprising differences also exist . the most peculiar is that the in the case of 1-olefins , the enantioselective event is selection between the enantiofaces of the prochiral monomer . instead , in the case of acrylates , the enantioselective event is selection between the enantiofaces of the prochiral growing chain .

NMR spectroscopic data indicates that <nUm> has a c2v symmetric structure with a flat , kite shaped ruthenacyclobutane ring with significant Ca-Cb agostic interactions with the Ru center . intramolecular exchange of ca and C β is fast ( <nUm> s-1 at <nUm> K ) as measured by EXSY spectroscopy . intermolecular exchange of ca and C β with the methylene groups of free ethylene is much slower and first order in both [Ru] and [ CH2 = CH2 ] ( <nUm> × 10-4 M-1 s-1 ) . activation parameters for this process are DH ‡ = <nUm> kcal mol-1 and DS ‡ = <nUm> cal mol-1 K-1 , also consistent with a rate limiting associative substitution as the key step in this exchange process . on the basis of this observation , mechanisms for the intermolecular exchange process are proposed and the implications for the mechanism of the propagation steps in catalytic olefin metathesis as mediated by grubbs catalysts are discussed . 
counteranion effects on propylene polymerization rates and stereoselectivities are compared using Cs - symmetric me 2C(Cp)(Flu)ZrMe2 ( <nUm> ; cp = C5H 4,e5-cyclopentadienyl ; flu = C13H <nUm> , e5-fluorenyl ) and C1 - symmetric me 2Si(OHF)(CpR*)ZrMe2 ( <nUm> ; OHF = C13H <nUm> , e5-octahydrofluorenyl ; CpR* = e5-3-(-)-menthylcyclopentadienyl ) precatalysts activated with the mononuclear and polynuclear perfluoroarylborate , -aluminate , and -gallate cocatalysts / activators BC18F15 ( 3 ) , B(o-C 6F5C6F4)3 ( 4 ) , AI(C 6F5)3 ( 5 ) , Ph3C+B(C 6F5)4- ( 6 ) Ph3C +FAI(o-C6F5C6F4) 3- ( 7 ) , C18F15Ga ( 8 ) , and recently reported mono- and polymetallic trityl perfluoroarylhalometalates Ph3C+FB(C6F5)3 - ( 9 ) , Ph3C+FB(o-C6F 5C6F4)3- ( 10 ) , ( ph 3C-)xF x[AI(C6F 5)3]yx- ( x = <nUm> , y = <nUm> , <nUm> ; x = <nUm> , y = <nUm> , <nUm> ; x = <nUm> , y = <nUm> , <nUm> ) , Ph3C+(C6F 5)3AIFAI(o-C6F5C6F 4)3- ( 14 ) , Ph3C +XAI(C6F5)3- ( x = Cl , <nUm> ; x = Br , <nUm> ) , and Ph3C+F[Ga(C6F 5)3]2- ( 17 ) . temperature , propylene concentration , and solvent polarity dependence are surveyed in polymerizations catalyzed by <nUm> activated with cocatalysts 3-16 and with a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio of ph 3CCI and <nUm> , and with a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio of Ph3CBr and <nUm> , and by <nUm> activated with <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> . remarkable stereocontrol with high activities is observed for <nUm> + <nUm> and <nUm> + <nUm> . polypropylene samples produced using C1 - symmetric precatalyst <nUm> are subjected to microstructural analyses using stochastic models describing the relative contributions of enantiofacial misinsertion and backskip processes . A powerful technique is introduced for calculating interparametric correlation matrices for these nonlinear stochastic models . the collected results significantly extend what is known about ion - pairing effects in the case of Cs - symmetric precatalyst <nUm> and allow these findings to be applied to the case of C 1-symmetric precatalyst <nUm> as an agent of isospecific propylene polymerization . 
this work analyzes stereochemical aspects of olefin polymerization processes mediated by the C1 - symmetric constrained geometry catalyst H2Si(ind)(tBuN)TiCH3+ ( ind = indenyl ) , including the role of the cocatalyst / counteranion . the energetics of catalyst activation are first analyzed and shown to compare favorably with experiment . the energetics of heterolytic ion pair separation are next scrutinized , and the effects of solvation environment are assessed . computed thermodynamic profiles for ethylene insertion at H2Si(ind)( tBuN)TiCH3+ indicate that the kinetics of insertion processes at the H2Si(ind)(tBuN)TiR+ cation can be analyzed in terms of SCF potential energies . we next compare the energetic profile for ethylene insertion at the naked H2Si(ind)( tBuN)TiCH3+ cation with that at the related H2Si(ind)(tBuN)TiCH3+H 3CB(C6F5)3- ion pair to understand counterion effects . it is seen that the counterion , although affecting overall catalytic activity , does not significantly influence enchainment stereochemistry or polymer microtacticity . next , the second ethylene insertion at H2Si(ind)(tBuN)Ti(nC 3H7)+H3CB(C6F 5)3- is analyzed to evaluate counteranion influence on the propagation barrier . it is found that the ethylene uptake transition state is energetically comparable to the first insertion transition state and that solvation has negligible effects on the energetic profile . these findings justify analysis of the propylene insertion process within the less computationally demanding " naked cation " model . thus , monomer enchainment at H2Si(ind)(tBuN)TiR+ is analyzed for H2Si(ind)(tBuN)TiCH3+ + propylene ( first insertion ) and for H2Si(ind)(tBuN) Ti(iC4H6)+ + propylene ( second insertion ) . data describing the first insertion highlight the sterically dominated regioselection properties of the system with activation energies indicating that olefin insertion regiochemistry is predominantly <nUm> ( primary ) , while the second insertion similarly reflects the catalyst stereoinduction properties , with steric effects introduced by the growing chain ( mimicked by an isobutyl group ) preferentially favoring insertion pathways that afford isotactic enrichment , in agreement with experiment . 
for the first time commercially relevant catalysts for the copolymerization of ethylene and styrene have been identified . the catalysts maintain very high copolymer efficiencies at relatively high reactor temperatures without sacrificing styrene comonomer reactivity . the observations which led to this discovery are based upon the kinetic analysis of ethylene-styrene copolymerization using constrained geometry catalyst ( e5-C 5Me4)(SiMe2-N-t-Bu)TiMe2 ( 1 ) . this analysis revealed a substantial styrene penultimate monomer effect . inherent reactivity of <nUm> toward styrene is greatly improved when the penultimate monomer on the growing polymer chain is styrene rather than ethylene . the presence of a penultimate styrene effect led to the hypothesis that catalysts bearing aromatic moieties in close proximity to the active site could lead to enhancement of styrene reactivity for this catalyst family . this hypothesis was born out by two new constrained geometry catalysts , one having two phenyl substituents placed in the <nUm> and 3' positions of the cp ring ( 2 ) and the other with a 2,2'-biphenyl fragment attached to the cp ring ( 3 ) . both catalysts exhibit higher activity than that of <nUm> and , more importantly , much higher styrene reactivity leading to copolymers with substantially increased styrene content ( <nUm> % for <nUm> , <nUm> % for <nUm> ) as compared to <nUm> ( <nUm> % ) under the same polymerization conditions . analysis of the x-ray crystal structures of <nUm> and <nUm> shows no overriding structural arguments for the increased performance . outstanding polymerization characteristics achieved with <nUm> make this catalyst a candidate for commercial production of ethylene-styrene resins in a solution process .

the zirconocene complex [Cp2ZrMe]+ reacts with 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene to give methane and the allyl complex [Cp2Zr(e3-CH2C(CH2CHMe2)CH2)]+ . the reaction involves as an intermediate the unprecedented alkyl e1-alkene complex [Cp2Zr(Me)(e1-CH2CMeCH2CHMe2)]+ , in which C(2) is essentially carbocationic and the C(1) - C(2) bond order is sufficiently low that rotation about it occurs . the hydrogen atoms of the methyl group on C(2) are sufficiently acidic that proton transfer to the Zr-Me group occurs to generate the allylic product . it seems likely that the chemistry described here provides a rationale for deactivation of propene polymerization catalysts since the normal products of chain transfer , polymers with vinylidene end groups , should form allylic species in the same way . the zirconocene complex [Cp2ZrMe]+ reacts with 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene to give methane and the allyl complex [Cp2Zr(e3-CH2C(CH2CHMe2)CH2)]+ . the reaction involves as an intermediate the unprecedented alkyl e1-alkene complex [Cp2Zr(Me)(e1-CH2CMeCH2CHMe2)]+ , in which C(2) is essentially carbocationic and the C(1) - C(2) bond order is sufficiently low that rotation about it occurs . the hydrogen atoms of the methyl group on C(2) are sufficiently acidic that proton transfer to the Zr-Me group occurs to generate the allylic product . it seems likely that the chemistry described here provides a rationale for deactivation of propene polymerization catalysts since the normal products of chain transfer , polymers with vinylidene end groups , should form allylic species in the same way . copyright 
this contribution describes the homopolymerization of styrene and the copolymerization of ethylene and styrenic comonomers mediated by the single - site bimetallic " constrained geometry catalysts " ( CGCs ) , ( m-CH 2CH2-3,3'){(e5-indenyl)[1-Me 2Si(tBuN)](TiMe2)}2 [ EBICGC(TiMe2)2 ; ti2 ] , ( m-CH 2CH2-3,3'){(e5-indenyl)[1-Me 2Si(tBuN)](ZrMe2)}2 [ EBICGC(ZrMe2)2 ; zr2 ] , ( m-CH 2-3,3'){(e5-indenyl)[1-Me2Si( tBuN)](TiMe2)}2 [ MBICGC(TiMe2) <nUm> ; C1 - ti2 ] , and ( m-CH2-3,3' ) { (e5-indenyl)[1-Me2Si(tBuN)](ZrMe 2)}2 [ MBICGC(ZrMe2)2 ; C1-Zr <nUm> ] , in combination with the borate activator / cocatalyst ph 3C+B(C6F5)4- ( B1 ) . under identical styrene homopolymerization conditions , C1 - ti2 + Bi and ti2 + B1 exhibit ∼ <nUm> and ∼ <nUm> times greater polymerization activities , respectively , than does monometallic [1-Me2Si(3-ethylindenyl)(tBuN)]TiMe <nUm> ( ti1 ) + B1 . C1 - zr2 + B1 and zr2 + B1 exhibit ∼ <nUm> and ∼ <nUm> times greater polymerization activities , respectively , than does the monometallic control [1-Me2Si(3-ethylindenyl)(tBuN)]ZrMe2 ( Zr <nUm> ) + B1 . NMR analyses show that the bimetallic catalysts suppress the regiochemical insertion selectivity exhibited by the monometallic analogues . In ethylene copolymerization , ti2 + B1 enchains <nUm> % more styrene ( B ) , <nUm> % more 4-methylstyrene ( C ) , <nUm> % more 4-fluorostyrene ( d ) , <nUm> % more 4-chlorostyrene ( e ) , and <nUm> % more 4-bromostyrene ( F ) than does ti1 + B1 . this observed bimetallic chemoselectivity effect follows the same general trend as the p-electron density on the styrenic ipso carbon ( d > e > F > C > B ) . kinetic studies reveal that both ti2 +- B1 and Ti <nUm> + B1 - mediated ethylene-styrene copolymerizations follow second - order markovian statistics and tend to be alternating . moreover , calculated reactivity ratios indicate that ti2 + B1 favors styrene insertion more than does ti1 + B1 . all the organozirconium complexes ( C1 - zr2 , zr2 , and Zr <nUm> ) are found to be incompetent for ethylene-styrene copolymerization , yielding only mixtures of polyethylene and polystyrene . model compound (m-CH2CH2-3,3'){(e5-indenyl)[1- Me2Si(tBuN)][Ti(CH2Ph)2] } <nUm> { EBICGC[Ti(CH2Ph)2]2 ; Ti 2-(CH2Ph)4 } was designed , synthesized , and structurally characterized . In situ activation studies with cocatalyst B(C 6F5)3 suggest an e1-coordination mode for the benzyl groups , thus supporting the proposed polymerization mechanism . for ethylene-styrene copolymerization , polar solvents are found to increase copolymerization activities and coproduce atactic polystyrene impurities in addition to ethylene-co-styrene , without diminishing the comonomer incorporation selectivity . both homopolymerization and copolymerization results argue that substantial cooperative effects between catalytic sites are operative .

nanofibrils of ultrahigh molecular weight syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) have been synthesized in a silica nanotube reactor ( SNTR ) using a metallocene catalyst in conjunction with methylaluminoxane cocatalyst . very thin sPS nanofibrils ( < <nUm> nm ) grown at the catalytic sites on the pore walls aggregate to form intertwined , rope - like nanofibrils with 30-50 nm diameters , which further intertwine into even larger <nUm> nm diameter polymer nanofibrils . the extrusion of nanofibrils synthesized inside the SNTR was directly observed by scanning electron microscopy , and the individual SNTR containing a single polymer nanofibril was separated and observed by transmission electron microscopy . the sPS synthesized in the SNTR has ultrahigh molecular weight ( mw = <nUm> <nUm> g / mol ) with a large fraction of <nUm> <nUm> 000-5 <nUm> <nUm> g / mol molecular weight polymers . 
the catalytic dehydrocoupling / dehydrogenation of n-methylamine-borane , MeNH2*BH3 ( 7 ) , to yield the soluble , high molecular weight poly(N-methylaminoborane) ( 8a ) , [MeNH-BH2]n ( m W > <nUm> <nUm> ) , has been achieved at <nUm> ° C using brookhart 's Ir (III) pincer complex CH2IrO2P2 ( 5 ) ( POCOP = [ m3-1,3- (OPtBu2)2C6H3 ] ) as a catalyst . the analogous reaction with ammonia - borane , NH3*BH3 ( 4 ) , gave an insoluble product , [NH2-BH2]n ( 8d ) , but copolymerization with MeNH2*BH3 gave soluble random copolymers , [MeNH-BH2]n-r-[NH2-BH 2]m ( 8b and 8c ) . the structures of polyaminoborane 8a and copolymers 8b and 8c were further analyzed by ultrahigh resolution electrospray mass spectrometry ( ESI-MS ) , and 8a , together with insoluble homopolymer 8d , was also characterized by 11B and 1H solid - state NMR , IR , and wide - angle x-ray scattering ( WAXS ) . the data indicate that 8a-8c are essentially linear , high molecular weight materials and that the insoluble polyaminoborane 8d possesses a similar structure but is of lower molecular weight ( ca. <nUm> repeat units ) , presumably due to premature precipitation during its formation . the yield and molecular weight of polymer 8a was found to be relatively robust toward the influence of different temperatures , solvents , and adduct concentrations , while higher catalyst loadings led to higher molecular weight materials . it was therefore unexpected that the polymerization of <nUm> using <nUm> was found to be a chain - growth rather than a step - growth process , where high molecular weights were already attained at about <nUm> % conversion of <nUm> . the results obtained are consistent with a two stage polymerization mechanism where , first , the Ir catalyst <nUm> dehydrogenates <nUm> to afford the monomer MeNH BH <nUm> and , second , the same catalyst effects the subsequent polymerization of this species . A wide range of other catalysts based on Ru , Rh , and Pd were also found to be effective for the transformation of <nUm> to polyaminoborane 8a . for example , polyaminoborane 8a was even isolated from the initial stage of the dehydrocoupling / dehydrogenation of <nUm> with [Rh(m-Cl)(1,5-cod)]2 ( 2 ) as the catalyst at <nUm> ° C , a reaction reported to give the N,N,N-trimethyl borazine , [MeN-BH]3 , under different conditions ( dimethoxyethane , <nUm> ° C ) . the ability to use a variety of catalysts to prepare polyaminoboranes suggests that the synthetic strategy should be applicable to a broad range of amine - borane precursors and is a promising development for this new class of inorganic polymers . 
the ansa - zirconocene complex rac-Me2Si(1-indenyl) 2ZrCl2 ( BCl2ISZr ) reacts with diisobutylaluminum hydride and trityl tetrakis(perfluorophenyl)borate in hydrocarbon solutions to give the cation [ (SBI)Zr(m-H)3(Al iBu2)2]+ , the identity of which is derived from NMR data and supported by a crystallographic structure determination . analogous reactions proceed with many other zirconocene dichloride complexes . [ (SBI)Zr(m-H)3(AliBu 2)2]+ reacts reversibly with AlCl iBu2 to give the dichloro-bridged cation [(SBI)Zr(m-Cl)2AliBu2]+ . reaction with AlMe3 first leads to mixed - alkyl species [ (SBI)Zr(m-H) <nUm> ( AlMex iBu2 - x)2 ] + by exchange of alkyl groups between aluminum centers . At higher AlMe3 / Zr ratios , [(SBI)Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2] + , a constituent of methylalumoxane - activated catalyst systems , is formed in an equilibrium , in which the hydride cation [ (SBI)Zr(m-H) 3(AlR2)2]+ strongly predominates at comparable HAliBu2 and AlMe3 concentrations , thus implicating the presence of this hydride cation in olefin polymerization catalyst systems . 
accurate active - site counts are necessary for the establishment of olefin polymerization kinetics , yet current techniques are often tedious and limited in sensitivity . herein , we describe the development of a novel method for determining the fraction of initiated catalyst using standard gel - permeation chromatography ( GPC ) . the first insertion of monomer into the chromophore - bearing zirconocene <nUm> generates a single equivalent of a labeled polymer chain . the polymer - bound label can be quantified as a function of polymer molecular weight using a GPC with a UV detector ; simultaneous RI detection allows both the extent of monomer conversion and the molecular - weight distribution to also be established . we estimate that monomer to catalyst ratios of as high as <nUm> : <nUm> can be measured using this technique .

Cp2ZrCl2 and complexes <nUm> to <nUm> possess relatively narrow central transition powder patterns which allows for magic - angle spinning ( MAS ) 91Zr solid - state NMR spectra to be acquired at a moderate field strength of <nUm> T . complexes <nUm> to <nUm> possess ultrawideline central transition SSNMR spectra necessitating piece-wise acquisition techniques . from the static and MAS 91Zr SSNMR spectra , it is possible to measure 91Zr electric field gradient ( EFG ) and chemical shift ( CS ) tensor parameters , as well as the euler angles which describe their relative orientation . basis sets and methods for the accurate quantum chemical calculation of 91Zr EFG and CS tensors have been identified . the origin of the observed EFG and CS tensor parameters are further investigated by visualization of the EFG and CS tensor orientations within the molecular frames . correlations between the observed and calculated NMR tensor parameters and molecular symmetry and structure are made . all of these observations suggest that 91Zr SSNMR spectroscopy can be utilized to probe the molecular structure of a variety of homogeneous and heterogeneous olefin polymerization catalysts . 
poly(phenylacetylene) ( PPA ) has versatile electrical and optical properties due to its intriguing p-conjugated backbone , configuration , stereoregularity , and helical conformation . detailed DFT , ONIOM , and ONIOM-MD studies are presented to understand the mechanisms of Rh - catalyzed polymerization of phenylacetylene and the factors that control its regioselectivity and stereochemistry . the polymerization proceeds via the IRh insertion mechanism ( dH ‡ ≈ <nUm> kcal / mol ) , although all the IRh , RhIII , and rh-carbene types of active species are thermodynamically and kinetically plausible in solution ; the RhIII insertion and the rh-carbene metathesis mechanisms both have higher activation enthalpies ( ∼ <nUm> and ∼ <nUm> kcal / mol , respectively ) . phenylacetylene prefers a 2,1-inserion , leading to head - to - tail regioselective PPA via a unique p-conjugative transition state . this p-conjugative characteristic specifically favors the 2,1-insertion due to the steric repulsion . kinetic factors play a key role in the stereoregularity . the polymerization adopting a cis-transoidal conformation is the most favorable . the kinetic difference for the insertion originates in the conformational constraints of the parent propagation chain in the transition state . these fundamental guidelines should help advance the development of efficient and structurally tailorable PPA catalysts . 
we report a detailed examination of the effect of the steric and electronic properties of the ancillary ligand and the alkene reactant on the rate of migratory insertion of unactivated alkenes into the palladium-nitrogen bond of isolated palladium amido complexes . A series of THF - bound and THF - free amidopalladium complexes ligated by cyclometalated benzylphosphine ligands possessing varied steric and electronic properties were synthesized . the THF - free complexes react with ethylene at <nUm> ° C to form olefin - amido complexes that were observed directly and that undergo migratory insertion , followed by b-hydride elimination to generate enamine products . the effect of the steric properties of the ancillary ligand on the binding of the alkene and the rate of migratory insertion were evaluated individually . the relative binding affinity of ethylene vs THF is larger for the less sterically hindered complex than for the more hindered complex , but the less hindered complex undergoes the insertion of ethylene more slowly than does the more hindered complex . these two changes in relative equilibrium and rate constants cause the rates of reaction of ethylene with the two THF - ligated species having different steric properties to be similar to each other . reactions of the complexes containing electronically varied ancillary ligands showed that the more electron - poor complexes underwent the migratory insertion step faster than the more electron - rich complexes . reactions of a THF - ligated palladium - amide with substituted vinylarenes showed that electron - poor vinylarenes reacted with the amido complex slightly faster than electron - rich vinylarenes . separation of the energetics of binding and insertion indicate that the complex of an electron - rich vinylarene is more stable in this system than the complex of a more electron - poor vinylarene but that the insertion step of the bound , electron - rich vinylarene is slower than the insertion step with the bound , electron - poor vinylarene . 
coordination polymerization of renewable a-methylene-g-(methyl) butyrolactones by chiral C 2-symmetric zirconocene catalysts produces stereo - random , highly stereo - regular , or perfectly stereo - regular polymers , depending on the monomer and catalyst structures . computational studies yield a fundamental understanding of the stereocontrol mechanism governing these new polymerization reactions mediated by chiral metallocenium catalysts . 
the synthesis of rigid - rod , helical isocyanate - based macromonomers was achieved through the polymerization of hexyl isocyanate and 4-phenylbutyl isocyanate , initiated by an exo-norbornene functionalized half - titanocene complex . sequential ruthenium - mediated ring - opening metathesis polymerization of these macromonomers readily afforded well - defined brush block copolymers , with precisely tunable molecular weights ranging from high ( <nUm> kDa ) to ultrahigh ( <nUm> kDa ) , while maintaining narrow molecular weight distributions ( PDI = <nUm> - <nUm> ) . the self - assembly of these brush block copolymers to solid thin - films and their photonic properties were investigated . due to the rigid architecture of these novel polymeric materials , they rapidly self - assemble through simple controlled evaporation to photonic crystal materials that reflect light from the ultra-violet , through the visible , to the near - infrared . the wavelength of reflectance is linearly related to the brush block copolymer molecular weight , allowing for predictable tuning of the band gap through synthetic control of the polymer molecular weight . A combination of scanning electron microscopy and optical modeling was employed to explain the origin of reflectivity . 
borane - amine adducts have received considerable attention , both as vectors for chemical hydrogen storage and as precursors for the synthesis of inorganic materials . transition metal - catalyzed ammonia - borane ( H3N-BH <nUm> , AB ) dehydrocoupling offers , in principle , the possibility of large gravimetric hydrogen release at high rates and the formation of B-N polymers with well - defined microstructure . several different homogeneous catalysts were reported in the literature . the current mechanistic picture implies that the release of aminoborane ( e.g. , Ni carbenes and shvo 's catalyst ) results in formation of borazine and <nUm> equiv of H , while <nUm> equiv of H <nUm> and polyaminoborane are obtained with catalysts that also couple the dehydroproducts ( e.g. , Ir and Rh diphosphine and pincer catalysts ) . however , in comparison with the rapidly growing number of catalysts , the amount of experimental studies that deal with mechanistic details is still limited . here , we present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study about the mechanism of AB dehydrocoupling to polyaminoborane with ruthenium amine / amido catalysts , which exhibit particularly high activity . on the basis of kinetics , trapping experiments , polymer characterization by 11B MQMAS solid - state NMR , spectroscopic experiments with model substrates , and density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations , we propose for the amine catalyst [ Ru(H)2PMe3{HN(CH2CH2PtBu 2)2 } ] two mechanistically connected catalytic cycles that account for both metal - mediated substrate dehydrogenation to aminoborane and catalyzed polymer enchainment by formal aminoborane insertion into a H-NH 2BH3 bond . kinetic results and polymer characterization also indicate that amido catalyst [ Ru(H)PMe3{N(CH2CH 2PtBu2)2 } ] does not undergo the same mechanism as was previously proposed in a theoretical study . 
dinickel bisphenoxyiminato complexes based on highly substituted p- and m-terphenyl backbones were synthesized , and the corresponding atropisomers were isolated . In the presence of a phosphine scavenger , Ni(COD)2 , the phosphine - ligated syn-dinickel complexes copolymerized a-olefins and ethylene in the presence of amines to afford <nUm> - <nUm> % a-olefin incorporation and copolymerized amino olefins and ethylene with a similar range of incorporation ( <nUm> - <nUm> % ) . the present rigid catalysts provide a bimetallic strategy for insertion polymerization of polar monomers without masking of the heteroatom group . the effects of the catalyst structure on the reactivity were studied by comparisons of the syn and anti atropisomers and the p- and m-terphenyl systems . 
the transient titanium neopentylidyne , [ NP2Ti ≈ CtBu ] ( A ; PNP- ≈ N[2-PiPr2-4-methylphenyl] 2- ) , dehydrogenates ethane to ethylene at room temperature over <nUm> h , by sequential 1,2-CH bond addition and b-hydrogen abstraction to afford [ (PNP)Ti(e2-H2C-CH2)(CH 2tBu ) ] ( 1 ) . intermediate A can also dehydrogenate propane to propene , albeit not cleanly , as well as linear and volatile alkanes C 4-C6 to form isolable a-olefin complexes of the type , [ (PNP)Ti(e2-H2C-CHR)(CH2 tBu ) ] ( r = CH3 ( 2 ) , C2H5 ( 3 ) , nPr ( 4 ) , and nBu ( 5 ) ) . complexes 1-5 can be independently prepared from [(PNP)Ti-CHtBu(OTf)] and the corresponding alkylating reagents , LiCH2CHR ( r = H , CH3(unstable) , CH 2CH3 , nPr , and nBu ) . olefin complexes <nUm> and 3-5 have all been characterized by a diverse array of multinuclear NMR spectroscopic experiments including 1H- 31P HOESY , and in the case of the a-olefin adducts 2-5 , formation of mixtures of two diastereomers ( each with their corresponding pair of enantiomers ) has been unequivocally established . the latter has been spectroscopically elucidated by NMR via C-H coupled and decoupled 1H-13C multiplicity edited gHSQC , 1H- 31P HMBC , and dqfCOSY experiments . heavier linear alkanes ( C <nUm> and C8 ) are also dehydrogenated by A to form [ (PNP)Ti(e2-H2C-CHnPentyl)(CH 2tBu ) ] ( 6 ) and [ (PNP)Ti(e2-H 2C-CHnHexyl)(CH2tBu) ] ( 7 ) , respectively , but these species are unstable but can exchange with ethylene ( <nUm> atm ) to form <nUm> and the free a-olefin . complex <nUm> exchanges with d 2C-CD2 with concomitant release of H2C-CH <nUm> . In addition , deuterium incorporation is observed in the neopentyl ligand as a result of this process . cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane can be also dehydrogenated by transient A , and in the case of cyclohexane , ethylene ( <nUm> atm ) can trap the [(PNP)Ti(CH2tBu)] fragment to form <nUm> . dehydrogenation of the alkane is not rate - determining since pentane and pentane-d12 can be dehydrogenated to <nUm> and 4-d12 with comparable rates ( KIE = <nUm> at ∼ <nUm> C ) . computational studies have been applied to understand the formation and bonding pattern of the olefin complexes . steric repulsion was shown to play an important role in determining the relative stability of several olefin adducts and their conformers . the olefin in <nUm> can be liberated by use of N2O , organic azides ( N3R ; r = 1-adamantyl or SiMe3 ) , ketones ( O-CPh2 ; <nUm> equiv ) and the diazoalkane , N2CHtolyl2 . for complexes 3-7 , oxidation with N2O also liberates the a-olefin . 
the enantioselective polymerization of propylene oxide ( PO ) using biaryl-linked bimetallic salen Co catalysts was investigated experimentally and theoretically . five key aspects of this catalytic system were examined : ( 1 ) the structural features of the catalyst , ( 2 ) the regio- and stereoselectivity of the chain - growth step , ( 3 ) the probable oxidation and electronic state of Co during the polymerization , ( 4 ) the role of the cocatalyst , and ( 5 ) the mechanism of monomer enchainment . several important insights were revealed . first , density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations provided detailed structural information regarding the regio- and stereoselective chain - growth step . specifically , the absolute stereochemistry of the binaphthol linker determines the enantiomer preference in the polymerization , and the interaction between the salen ligand and the growing polymer chain is a fundamental aspect of enantioselectivity . second , a new bimetallic catalyst with a conformationally flexible biphenol linker was synthesized and found to enantioselectively polymerize PO , though with lower enantioselectivity than the binaphthol linked catalysts . third , DFT calculations revealed that the active form of the catalyst has two active exo anionic ligands ( chloride or carboxylate ) and an endo polymer alkoxide which can ring - open an adjacent cobalt - coordinated epoxide . fourth , calculations showed that initiation is favored by an endo chloride ligand , while propagation is favored by the presence of two exo carboxylate ligands . 
the heterobimetallic complexes , (I*5-indenyl)[1- Me2Si(tBuN)TiCl2]-3-CnH 2n-[N,N-bis(2-(ethylthio)ethyl)amine]CrCl3 ( n = <nUm> , Ti-C0-CrSNS ; n = <nUm> , Ti-C2-CrSNS ; n = <nUm> , Ti-C6-CrSNS ) , (I*5-indenyl)[1- Me2Si(tBuN)TiCl2]-3-C2H 4-[N,N-bis((o-OMe-C6H4)2P)amine] Cl3Cr ( Ti-C2-CrPNP ) , and ( I* 5-indenyl)[1-Me2Si(tBuN)TiCl 2]-3-C2H4-[N,N-bis((diethylamine)ethyl)-amine] Cl3Cr ( Ti-C2-CrNNN ) , are synthesized , fully characterized , and employed as olefin polymerization catalysts . with ethylene as the feed and MAO as cocatalyst / activator , SNS - based complexes Ti-C 0-CrSNS , Ti-C2-CrSNS , and Ti-C 6-CrSNS afford linear low - density polyethylenes ( LLDPEs ) with exclusive n-butyl branches ( <nUm> - <nUm> branches / <nUm> C ) , while under identical polymerization conditions Ti-C2-CrPNP and Ti-C2-CrNNN produce polyethylenes with heterogeneous branching ( C2 , C4 , and ca%0Y= <nUm> ) or negligible branching , respectively . under identical ethylene polymerization conditions , Ti-C0-CrSNS produces polyethylenes with higher activity ( <nUm> × and <nUm> × , respectively ) , Mn ( <nUm> × and <nUm> × , respectively ) , and branch density ( <nUm> × and <nUm> × , respectively ) , than Ti-C2-CrSNS and Ti-C 6-CrSNS . versus a CGCEtTi + CrNS2 tandem catalyst , Ti-C0-CrSNS yields polyethylene with somewhat lower activity , but with <nUm> × higher Mn and <nUm> × greater branching density under identical conditions . In ethylene + <nUm> - pentene competition experiments , Ti-C0-CrSNS yields <nUm> % n-propyl branches and <nUm> % n-butyl branches at [1-pentene] = <nUm> m , and the estimated effective local concentration of 1-hexene is ∼ <nUm> m . In contrast , the tandem CGCEtTi + CrNS2 system yields <nUm> % n-propyl branches under identical reaction conditions . the homopolymerization and 1-pentene competition results argue that close Ti***Cr spatial proximity together with weak C-H***Ti and C-H***S interactions significantly influence relative 1-hexene enchainment and chain transfer rates , supported by DFT computation , and that such effects are conversion insensitive but cocatalyst and solvent sensitive . 
two new precatalysts for ethylene and a-olefin trimerization , (FI)Ti(CH2SiMe3)2Me and (FI)Ti(CH2CMe3)2Me ( FI = phenoxy-imine ) , have been synthesized and structurally characterized by x-ray diffraction . (FI)Ti(CH2SiMe3)2Me can be activated with <nUm> equiv of BC18F15 at room temperature to give the solvent - separated ion pair [(FI)Ti(CH2SiMe3)2][MeB(C6F5)3] , which catalytically trimerizes ethylene or 1-pentene to produce 1-hexene or C15 olefins , respectively . the neopentyl analogue (FI)Ti(CH2CMe3)2Me is unstable toward activation with BC18F15 at room temperature , giving no discernible diamagnetic titanium complexes , but at <nUm> ° C the following can be observed by NMR spectroscopy : ( i ) formation of the bis-neopentyl cation [(FI)Ti(CH2CMe3)2]+ , ( ii ) a-elimination of neopentane to give the neopentylidene complex [ (FI)Ti( = CHCMe3)]+ , and ( iii ) subsequent conversion to the imido-olefin complex [ ( MeOAr2N = )Ti(OArHC = CHCMe3)]+ via an intramolecular metathesis reaction with the imine fragment of the ( FI ) ligand . if the reaction is carried out at low temperature in the presence of ethylene , catalytic production of 1-hexene is observed , in addition to the titanacyclobutane complex [(FI)Ti(CH(CMe3)CH2CH2)]+ , resulting from addition of ethylene to the neopentylidene [ (FI)Ti( = CHCMe3)]+ . none of the complexes observed spectroscopically subsequent to [(FI)Ti(CH2CMe3)2]+ is an intermediate or precursor for ethylene trimerization , but notwithstanding these off - cycle pathways , [(FI)Ti(CH2CMe3)2]+ is a precatalyst that undergoes rapid initiation to generate a catalyst for trimerizing ethylene or 1-pentene .

this contribution focuses on the distinctive center - to - center cooperative catalytic properties exhibited by bimetallic " constrained geometry catalysts " ( CGCs ) , and analyzes metal - metal proximity effects on ethylene polymerization processes mediated by ( m-CH 2-3,3' ) { ( η 5-indenyl)[1-H 2Si( tBuN)](ZrMe <nUm> ) } <nUm> ( Zr 2)- derived catalysts using density functional theory . precatalyst geometries are first discussed , and then ion- pair formation / heterolytic dissociation processes involving the binuclear bis(borane) cocatalyst 1,4-(C 6F <nUm> ) 2BC 6F 4B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ( BN <nUm> ) , are analyzed and compared with those in the parent mononuclear analogue . it is found that , on proceeding from the mononuclear to binuclear catalyst system , ion - pair dissociation energies increase due to the stronger catalyst center - counterdianion interactions . moreover , in the binuclear case , the interaction energies are markedly sensitive to geometrical matching between the binuclear bis(borane) and the precatalyst zr-methyl positions . binuclear catalytic effects between the metal centers are then explored , with the specific contribution from the proximity of the second metal center . possible agostic interactions of a-alkenes p-coordinated to one Zr center with the second Zr center of the binuclear catalyst are scrutinized for the case of 1-octene . it is argued that these agostic interactions are at least partly responsible for the unusual enchainment properties of the bimetallic catalysts . In particular , the greater polyethylene product branch densities found experimentally for the bimetallic catalysts can be correlated with an intramolecular reinsertion process , assisted by agostic interactions . moreover , these same agostic interactions involving a chain growing at one metal site with the second metal site of the binuclear catalyst modify the environment to increase propagation / termination rate ratios , in turn favoring increased product molecular weight ( m n ) . these effects are observed experimentally at closer Zr · Zr proximities in olefin polymerizations mediated by binuclear CGC catalysts . 
by reaction of the dichloride rac - (ebthi)HfCl2 [ ebthi = 1,2-ethylene-1,1'-bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl) ] with lithium in the presence of bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene , the hafnacyclopropene rac-(ebthi)Hf(e2- Me3SiC2SiMe 3)(1 - Hf ) was obtained . the reaction of the blue - green complex 1-Hf with an excess of ethylene at room temperature leads by insertion of the olefin to the yellow - green hafnacyclopentene 2-Hf which is only stable in solution and eliminates the alkyne at <nUm> ° C under ethylene to form the corresponding yellow hafnacyclopentane 3-Hf , which was characterized by x-ray crystal structure analysis . the reaction of 1-Hf to give stepwise via 2-Hf the complex 3-Hf was investigated in detail and compared to the formation and stability of the corresponding zirconacyclopropene 1-Zr , zirconacyclopentene 2-Zr , and zirconacyclopentane 3-Zr . moreover , the reaction of the titanocene alkyne complex 1-Ti with ethylene was studied . for investigating the reaction behavior of the alkyne complexes 1-M , NMR spectroscopy was used and the results were compared with UV / vis spectroscopy , suggesting the existence of a bis-p - complex prior to the formation of the hafnacyclopentene 2-Hf . 
cationic titanium(IV) complexes with ansa-(n5-cyclopentadienyl , n6 - arene ) ligands were synthesized and characterized by x-ray crystallography . the strength of the metal - arene interaction in these systems was studied by variable - temperature NMR spectroscopy . complexes with a C-! bridge between the cyclopentadienyl and arene moieties feature hemilabile coordination behavior of the ligand and consequently are active ethylene trimerization catalysts . reaction of the titanium(IV) dimethyl cations with CO results in conversion to the analogous cationic titanium(ll) dicarbonyl species . metal - to - ligand backdonation in these formally low - valent complexes gives rise to a strongly bonded , partially reduced arene moiety . In contrast to the n 6-arene coordination mode observed for titanium , the more electron - rich vanadium (V) cations [cyclopentadienyl-arene]V(N'Pr 2)(NC6H4-4-Me)+ feature n 1-arene binding , as determined by a crystallographic study . the three different metal - arene coordination modes that we experimentally observed model intermediates in the cycle for titanium - catalyzed ethylene trimerization . the nature of the metal - arene interaction in these systems was studied by DFT calculations . 
structures of zeolite - anchored organorhodium complexes undergoing conversions with gasphase reactants were characterized by infrared spectra bolstered by calculations with density functional theory and analysis of the gas - phase products . structurally well - defined zeolite - supported rhodium diethylene complexes were synthesized by chemisorption of Rh(C2H 4)2(acac) ( acac ) C5H7O2 ) on dealuminated Y zeolite , being anchored by two Rh-O bonds , as shown by extended x-ray absorption fine structure ( EXAFS ) spectroscopy . In contrast to the nonuniformity of metal complexes anchored to metal oxides , the near uniformity of the zeolite - supported species allowed precise determination of their chemistry , including the role of the support as a ligand . the anchored rhodium diethylene complex underwent facile , reversible ligand exchange with deuterated ethylene at <nUm> K , and ethylene ligands were hydrogenated by reverse spillover of hydrogen from support hydroxyl groups . the supported complexes reacted with CO to form rhodium gem-dicarbonyls , which , in the presence of ethylene , gave rhodium monocarbonyls . the facile removal of ethylene ligands from the complex in H2-N2 mixtures created coordinatively unsaturated rhodium complexes ; the coordinative unsaturation was stabilized by the site isolation of the complexes , allowing reaction with N to form rhodium complexes with one and with two N ligands . the results also provide evidence of a new rhodium monohydride species incorporating a C 2H4 ligand . 
( chemical equation presented ) two group-4 boryl complexes , boryltitanium <nUm> and borylhafnium <nUm> , were synthesized via nucleophilic borylation using boryllithium <nUm> . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> are the first examples of group-4 borylmetals . theoretical calculations on model molecules <nUm> and <nUm> indicated that the boron - metal bond in both complexes has a covalent character . complex <nUm> has activity for polymerization of ethylene or hex-1-ene . 
the reaction of dimethyltitanocene ( Cp2TiMe2 ) with PhSiH3 in hexane in the presence of Cy2PH ( cy = cyclohexyl ) is photoinitiated to give paramagnetic Cp2Ti(SiH2Ph)(PHCy2) , characterized in solution by EPR spectroscopy ( a(H) of phosphine = <nUm> g , a(P) = <nUm> g , g(iso) = <nUm> ) . under the same conditions , a similar reaction with Ph2SiH2 gives a crystalline solid , shown by an x-ray structure determination to be [(Cp2Ti)2(m-H)(m-PCy2)] ( 1 ) . under continuous photolysis Cp2TiMe2 reacts with CyPH2 , in the presence of either PhSiH3 or Ph2SiH2 , to give crystals of [Cp2Ti(m-PHCy)]2 ( 2 ) . rac-[(EBTHI)Ti(m-H)]2 ( EBTFII = ethylene-1,2-bis(e5-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl) ) reacts with PhPH2 to give crystals of the complex (EBTHI)Ti(P2Ph2) ( 4 ) . In this reaction , excess PhPH2 is polymerized by dehydrocoupling to a mixture of linear and cyclic oligophosphanes . the diphosphane is produced as an equal mixture of the two diastereoisomers . due to precipitation of the highly insoluble <nUm> , the catalytic reaction eventually ceases . the mechanisms of these reactions are discussed in terms of the oxidative addition of phosphines to Cp2Ti(II) , conproportionation of Cp2Ti(II) and Cp2Ti(IV) to Cp2Ti(III) , and s-bond metethesis reactions of P-H , Ti-H , and Ti-P compounds . 
In polymers made from (E)- or (Z)-[1-D]propene with methyl alumoxane (MAO)-activated ansa - zirconocene catalysts , signals of deuterium - labeled mrrm pentads document that stereoerrors arise mainly from an isomerization of the Zr - bound chain end . reduced d - atom redistribution in poly( [2-D]propene ) indicates a kinetic isotope effect of k(H) / k(D) ~ <nUm> for the b-H / d transfer associated with the isomerization reaction . In all poly([1- and [2-D]propenes ) studied , d - labeled mmmm pentads occur with a probability similar to that of d - labeled mrrm pentads ; this observation requires further mechanistic clarification . olefinic chain ends of polymers obtained with C <nUm> H <nUm> ( thind ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> -MAO from (E)- or (Z)-[1-D]propene deviate in their d - label distributions from the expected stereochemistry . isomerization of the Zr - bound chain end , probably via a Zr - bound tertiary alkyl intermediate , thus contributes also to chain - growth termination . with the sterically hindered catalyst me <nUm> Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> -MAO , almost all chain terminations appear to occur via chain - end isomerization , which does not lead to stereoerrors here . with the high - performance catalyst me <nUm> Si(2-Me-benz[e]indenyl) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> -MAO , finally , no d - label is found in the mrrm and mmmm pentad signals ; here , Zr - alkyl isomerization can apparently not compete with the high rate of olefin insertion . 
the mechanism of diimine-Ni - catalyzed ethylene polymerization reaction has been studied theoretically using the B3LYP density functional method . the chain initiation reaction proceeds with the coordination of ethylene to the model active catalyst [L2NiCH3]+ , L2 - CH2N , followed by ethylene insertion into the metal - alkyl bond with a rate - determining <nUm> kcal / mol free energy barrier to form a g-agostic intermediate , which with a small barrier rearranges to a more stable b-agostic intermediate and then forms an olefin alkyl complex upon coordination of the next ethylene . linear polymer propagation takes place from this olefin alkyl complex , the resting state in the catalytic cycle , via the same insertion , rearrangement , and coordination pathway . an alternative pathway from the olefin alkyl complex passes over a 14-15 kcal / mol barrier for b-hydride elimination and reinsertion for branched polymer propagation . these energetics suggest that the Ni (II) - catalyzed reaction is expected to produce more linear than methyl-branched polymers , and that higher temperature increases and higher ethylene pressure decreases the branching . hydrogenolysis is an energetically favorable termination pathway , proceeding via coordination of a hydrogen molecule to the metal center , followed by H-H activation though a four - centered ' metathesis - like ' transition state and reductive elimination of alkane . A comparison with zirconocene - catalyzed ethylene polymerization shows that the Ni(II)catalyzed polymerization should be slightly slower and should give more branching . 
the reactions of so called ' tuck-in ' permethyl zirconocene compounds Cp*(e5-e1-C5Me4CH2)ZrX ( x = cl(1a) , C6H5 ( 1b ) , CH3 ( 1c ) ) with the highly electrophilic boranes BC12F10H and BC18F15 are described . the products are zwitterionic olefin polymerization catalysts . reactions with 1a and 1b yielded single products cleanly , but reactions with tuck-in methyl starting material 1c gave mixtures . spectroscopic and structural studies showed that the electrophilic zirconium center in the product zwitterions was stabilized by a variety of mechanisms . In the products of reaction between 1a and 1b with BC12F10H , Cp*[e5,e1-C5Me4CH2B(C6F5)2(m-H)]ZrX ( x = Cl ( 2a ) , <nUm> % ) , C6H5 ( 2b , <nUm> % ) ) , the metal is chelated by a pendant hydridoborate moiety . chloride product 2a was characterized crystallographically . In the reaction of BC18F15 with 1a , the fluxional zwitterionic product Cp*[e5-C5Me4CH2B(C6F5)3]ZrCl ( 3a , <nUm> % ) is stabilized by a weak donor interaction between one of the ortho-fluorine atoms of the -CH2B- C6F5 counteranion and the zirconium center ( Zr-F = <nUm> Å ) . In the product of the reaction between lb and BC18F15 , Cp*[e5-C5Me4CH2B(C6F5)3]ZrC6H5 ( 3b , <nUm> % ) , a similar ortho- fluorine interaction was found in a yellow kinetic product ( y-3b ) , which converted upon heating gently to a thermodynamic orange polymorph ( o-3b ) in which the zirconium center is compensated via an agostic interaction from an ortho C-H bond of the phenyl group and an interaction between the methylene group of the -CH2B C6F5 counteranion . these compounds were both characterized by x-ray crystallography . zwitterion o-3b reacts with H to form the zwitterionic hydride Cp*[e5-C5Me4CH2B(C6F5)3]ZrH ( <nUm> , <nUm> % ) , characterized by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography to reveal a return to the ortho-fluorine mode of stabilization . compounds 2a , 3a , o-3b , and <nUm> were all found to be active ethlyene polymerization catalysts ; the chloride derivatives required minimal amounts of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) to alkylate the zirconium center . polymerization data are discussed in light of the structural findings for the catalysts employed . 
A new class of isospecific and highly regiospecific C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes , characterized by a bisindenyl ansa ligand with bulky substituents in the <nUm> position of indence and a single carbon bridge is disclosed : variation of the size of the substituent in C(3) has a strong effect on the extent of chain transfer and isospecificity in propene polymerization . In fact , while rac-[Me2C(1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 produces low molecular weight and moderately isotactic polypropene ( iPP ) also containing some regioirregularities ( m(n) = <nUm> , mmmm ca. <nUm> % and 2,1(tot) = <nUm> % at <nUm> ° C in liquid monomer ) , rac-[Me2C(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 produces iPP with molecular weights between <nUm> ( t(p) = <nUm> ° C ) and <nUm> ( t(p) = <nUm> ° C ) and a fairly high isotacticity ( mmmm ca. <nUm> % at <nUm> ° C ) , with no detectable <nUm> units . the influence of polymerization temperature on the catalyst performance has been investigated by polymerizing liquid propene in the temperature range of 20-70 ° C : the experimental DDE values for enantioface selectivity have been estimated for two members of the new class ( rac-[Me2C(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 DDE(enant) = <nUm> kcal / mol ; rac-[Me2C(3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 DDE(enant) = <nUm> kcal / mol ) . for comparison , brintzinger 's moderately isospecific , benchmark catalyst rac-[ethylene(1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 ( DDE(enant) = <nUm> kcal / mol ) , the single carbon bridged , unsubstituted rac-[Me2C(1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 ( DDE(enant) = <nUm> kcal / mol ) , and the C2 - symmetric , practically aspecific , rac-[ethylene(3-methyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 ( DDE(enant) = <nUm> kcal / mol ) are also reported . the molecular structures of rac-[Me2C(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 and rac-[Me2C(3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 have been determined . 
the zirconocene - coupling of diynes with internal silicon substituents , MeC ≡ CMe2SiArSiMe2C ≡ CMe ( <nUm> : Ar = 1,4-C6H4 ; <nUm> : Ar = 1,3-C6H4 ; <nUm> : Ar = 1,3-C6H4 ; <nUm> : Ar = 4,4'-C6H4C6H4 ) , generates regiospecific polymers containing zirconacyclopentadiene in the main chain ( 5-7 ) . these organometallic polymers hydrolyze cleanly to butadienediyl polymers of the type [ Me2SiArSiMe2CH = CMeCMe = CH](n) ( 11-13 ) , and polymer <nUm> reacts with iodine to give the iodine - containing polymer [ 1,4-Me2SiC6H4SiMe2C(I) = CMeCMe = C(I)](n) ( 14 ) . the organometallic polymers undergo facile and high - yield degradations to macrocycles under mild conditions ( refluxing tetrahydrofuran solution ) . the size and shape of the resulting macrocycles depend upon the nature of the diyne spacer group . thus , polymers <nUm> and <nUm> containing parallel diyne units convert to the trimeric macrocycles [Me2SiArSiMe2C4Me2ZrCp2]3 ( <nUm> : Ar = 1,4-C6H4 ; <nUm> : Ar = 4,4'- C3H2 ) , while polymer <nUm> gives the dimeric macrocycle [ 1,3- Me2SiC6H4SiMe2C4Me2ZrCp2]2 ( 18 ) . the dimeric macrocycle [Me2SiC6H4SiMe2C6H4SiMe2C4Me2ZrCp2]2 ( 20 ) was obtained directly from the zirconocene coupling of Me2Si[(1,4-C6H4)- SiMe2(C ≡ CMe)]2 ( 4 ) by heating the reaction mixture to reflux . In a similar manner , the diyne Me2Si(C ≡ CMe)2 was converted in high yield to the hexameric macrocycle [Me2SiC4Me2ZrCp2]6 ( 22 ) . the macrocycles <nUm> , [1,4-Me2SiC6H4SiMe2C4Me2H2]3 ( 16 ) , and <nUm> were characterized by single - crystal x-ray crystallography . molecules of <nUm> adopt a nearly planar C3 macrocyclic structure with a cavity described by an average transannular Si***Si distance of <nUm> Å , while the hydrolyzed macrocycle <nUm> has a chair conformation . this conformation change results from conversion of cis diene groups in the zirconacyclopendiene fragments to trans diene groups in <nUm> . the high- yield formation of macrocycles apparently results from the reversible nature of the alkyne - coupling reaction , which allows for a low - energy pathway to the smallest macrocycle possessing minimal ring strain . 
the synthesis and dialkyl abstraction chemistry as well as the unusual cocatalytic characteristics in metallocene - mediated polymerization of two distinctive borane and aluminate cocatalysts tris(2,2',2'nonafluorobiphenyl)borane ( PBB ) and triphenyl carbenium tris(2,2',2 - nonafluorobiphenyl)fluoroaluminate , ( ph <nUm> C+PBA - ) are reported . reaction of PBB with Cp'2ThMe2 ( cp ' = η <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> ) , CGCZrMe <nUm> ( CGC = me <nUm> si(e <nUm> -Me <nUm> C <nUm> )((l)BuN) ) , and Cp'MMe <nUm> ( m = Zr , Hf ) cleanly affords base - free cationic complexes cp ' <nUm> ThMe + MePBB - ( 1 ) , CGCZrMe + MePBB - ( 5 ) , and Cp'MMe <nUm> + MePBB - ( m = Zr , <nUm> ; Hf , <nUm> ) . In case of CGCTiMe <nUm> and dimethyl zirconocenes , m-methyl dinuclear cationic complexes [ ( CGCTiMe ) <nUm> ( m- me ) ] + MePBB(6) and [ ( L <nUm> ZrMe ) <nUm> ( m-Me ) ] + MePBB - ( L = e5-C <nUm> H <nUm> ( cp ) , <nUm> ; e- 1,2-Me <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> ( cp ' ) , <nUm> ; cp ' , <nUm> ; L <nUm> = me <nUm> Si(Ind) <nUm> , ind = η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> , <nUm> ; L <nUm> = me <nUm> C(Flu)(Cp) , flu = e5-C <nUm> H <nUm> , <nUm> ) are formed . A similar reaction with ph <nUm> C + PBA - results in the corresponding complexes CGCZrCH <nUm> + PBA - ( m = Zr , <nUm> ; Ti , <nUm> ) and L <nUm> CHZr <nUm> + PBA - ( L = cp , 15b ; cp , <nUm> ; η <nUm> -1,3- ( SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> , <nUm> ; cp ' , <nUm> ; L <nUm> = me <nUm> Si(Ind) <nUm> , <nUm> ; L <nUm> = me <nUm> C(Flu)(Cp) , <nUm> ) . two dinuclear complexes <nUm> and <nUm> ( [ me <nUm> C(Flu)(Cp)Zr(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) ] <nUm> ( m- F ) + MeB(C <nUm> F <nUm> )3 - ) derived from borane PBB and B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> , respectively , and three other PBA b ased monomeric complexes <nUm> ( ph <nUm> C + PBA - ) , <nUm> , and <nUm> have been characterized by x-ray diffraction , and these determinations allow detailed analysis of the ion pairing in the solid state . In combination with solution dynamic NMR , all data indicate MePBB - - cation interactions to be considerably weaker than those involving MeB(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> - , while the strongly ion - paired chiral PBA - converts previously enantiomeric cations into pairs of diastereomers . As revealed by dynamic <nUm> H NMR studies , ion pair reorganization / symmetrization in <nUm> is significantly more rapid than in the MeB(C <nUm> F <nUm> )3 - analogue , suggesting much looser ion pairing in <nUm> . on the other hand , PBA - racemization is a rapid process ( e.g. , DG[?](58 ° C ) = <nUm> kcal / mol for <nUm> ) , while cation - PBA - ion pairs have higher barriers for ion pair symmetrization than in analogous fluoroaryl borates . dinuclear complexes <nUm> and <nUm> initiate efficient polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) to produce syndiotactic poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) , while <nUm> produces highly isotactic PMMA , and stericalty more accessible complexes <nUm> and <nUm> exhibit no activity . for olefin polymerization and copolymerization , PBB - derived cationic complexes , both monomeric and dinuclear , generally exhibit higher catalytic activity and comonomer incorporation levels than the MeB(C <nUm> F <nUm> )3 - analogues , with CGC catalysts exhibiting the greatest activity contrasts . on the other hand , PBA - derived complexes exhibit a remarkable sensitivity of olefin polymerization characteristics and ion pairing to ancillary ligand bulk , with activity differences of up to <nUm> <nUm> -fold observed . In regard to stereospecific polymerization , PBA - derived chiral complex <nUm> produces highly isotactic polypropylene while B(C <nUm> F <nUm> )A - derived analogue produces isotactic polypropylene with lower isotacticity under similar conditions . microstructure analyses of poly(ethylene-co-1-hexene) samples indicate that PBB enhances comonomer incorporation randomness . 
bis(e-methylcyclopentadienyl)(e4-butadiene)zirconium adds <nUm> equiv of the organometallic lewis acid BC18F15 to yield the metallocene- (mC4H6)-borate betaine <nUm> , which is an active , homogeneous , one - component ziegler catalyst for the polymerization of 1-alkenes . the metallacyclic metallocene betaine <nUm> undergoes a degenerate p=s=p-allyl interconversion on the NMR time scale in toluene solution ( DG([?])(m(obs))-(toluene) = <nUm> kcal mol-1 ) which becomes markedly faster in the presence of added reactive 1-alkenes ( DG([?])(m(obs)) = <nUm> ( 1-hexene ) , <nUm> ( 1-pentene ) , <nUm> ( 1- buterie ) , <nUm> kcal mo1-1 ( propene ) ) . this lowering of the activation barrier is probably due to an increased stabilization of the (s-alkyl)(p- alkene)metallocene betaine intermediate <nUm> , which at the same time is passed as the essential intermediate stage of the insertion of these alkenes into the reactive zirconium carbon bond of <nUm> to yield the mono olefin insertion products <nUm> . the gibbs activation energies of this chemical insertion reaction ( DG([?])(chem) = <nUm> ( 1-hexene ) , <nUm> ( 1-pentene ) , <nUm> ( 1-butene ) , <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( propene ) ) are similar in magnitude to the activation energies of magnetical exchange ( DG([?])(m(obs)) ) . this creates the interesting situation that in the presence of these reactive 1-alkenes , the ( reversible ) magnetical exchange rate ( k(m(obs)) ) , as determined by the dynamic NMR experiment , is dependent on the rate of the competing ( irreversible ) overall chemical addition reaction ( k(chem) ) . the rate constants k(m(obs)) and k(chem) were measured in the presence of these 1-alkenes , which allowed for a determination of the height of the first , i.e. , the complexation barrier ( DG([?])1 = <nUm> ( 1-hexene ) , <nUm> ( 1-pentene ) , <nUm> ( 1-buterie ) , <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( propene ) ; standard state c(Th) = <nUm> mol L-1 ) and its difference ( DDG([?])2 ) to the top of the actual insertion barrier ( DDG([?])2 = <nUm> ( 1-hexene ) , <nUm> ( 1-pentene ) , <nUm> ( 1-butene ) , <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( propene ) ) . these values , together with the activation energy of the degenerate allyl ligand interconversion of the model system (s-allyl)(p-allyl)zirconocene ( 10 ) ( DG([?])3 = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ) , allowed for a good experimentally based estimate of the intrinsic activation energy ( reaction <nUm> → <nUm> ) of the insertion of these 1-alkenes into the zirconium carbon bond at this group <nUm> bent metallocene unit . the thus obtained insertion barrier is DG([?]) / ( ins ) ≃ 10-11 kcal mol-1 for the 1-alkenes used in this study . the alkene decomplexation barrier ( reaction <nUm> → <nUm> ) is lower by ca , 1-2 kcal mol-1 . 
A series of substituted poly(p-phenylenediyne)s ( 1a-f ) was synthesized by the palladium - catalyzed cross-coupling condensation of terminal dialkynylalkanes with substituted diiodobenzenes . polymerizations were conducted with 1,4-diiodo-5-hexoxy-2-methoxybenzene or 1,4-diiodo-5-hexyl-2- methylbenzene and with 1,6-hexadiyne , 1,7-heptadiyne , or 1,8-octadiyne . thus , six different poly(p-phenylenediyne)s ( 1a-f , [ ArC ≡ C(CH2)(n)C ≡ c](m) ; Ar = 5-hexoxy-2-methoxyphenylene or 5-hexyl-2-methylphenylene , and n = <nUm> , <nUm> , or <nUm> ) were obtained . intramolecular zirconocene couplings of 1a-f afforded zirconacyclopentadiene - containing polymers 2a-f . these metal - containing polymers were then cleanly hydrolyzed to the substituted poly(p-phenylene- dieneylene)s ( 3a-f , [ ArCH = C(CH2)(n)C = CH](m) ; Ar = 5-hexoxy-2- methoxyphenylene or 5-hexyl-2-methylphenylene , and n = <nUm> , <nUm> , or <nUm> ) . variation of the polymer structure allows for manipulation of the absorption and emission maxima over the ranges of 316-524 nm and 437-619 nm , respectively . the optical properties of model compounds 9a-f , ( ArCH = C(CH2)(n)C = ArCH ; Ar = phenyl or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl , and n = <nUm> , <nUm> , or <nUm> ) are very similar to those for polymers 3a-f . the structures of 9c ( Ar = 2,5-dimethoxy-4- methylphenyl , n = <nUm> ) and 9d ( Ar = phenyl , n = <nUm> ) were determined by single- crystal x-ray crystallography . molecules of 9c are almost completely planar , while molecules of 9d are twisted and have poor ap-orbital overlap . the conformation of the diene unit in polymers 3a-f and the model compounds 9a-f are largely responsible for the observed variations in optical properties . finer tuning of the optical properties for poly(p-phenylenedienylene)s may be achieved via synthesis of copolymers from mixtures of 1,6-heptadiyne and 1,7- octadiyne . the optical properties of the resulting copolymers represent weighted averages for the corresponding homopolymers . investigation of the photophysical properties of polymers retaining some of the diyne units suggest that defects play a major role in defining the emissive properties of the poly(p-phenylenedienylene)s described here . 
bis(2-arylindenyl)zirconium dichlorides activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) produce elastomeric polypropylene . the elastic properties of this material are proposed to arise from a stereoblock microstructure . the silyl bridged catalysts rac- and meso-dimethylsilyl(bis(2-phenylindenyl))zirconium dichloride were prepared and used to model the polymerization behavior of the unbridged catalysts . the meso isomer is approximately twice as productive as the rac isomer in propylene polymerization . additionally , blends of isotactic and atactic polypropylene were prepared by using varying amounts of the rac and meso isomers until the IR and NMR characteristics matched polypropylenes produced from bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride . these studies suggest ( 1 ) that the rac isomer is favored in the isomerization equilibrium for the unbridged catalysts and ( 2 ) that the larger fraction of atactic polymer in the elastomeric polypropylene is a consequence of the higher rate of polymerization for the meso isomer . 
double [ SiMe <nUm> ] - bridged metallocenes ( 1,2-SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> { η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> -4- r}{e <nUm> -C <nUm> H-3,5-(CHMe <nUm> ) <nUm> }ZrCl <nUm> ( r = H ( 1a ) , CHMe <nUm> ( 1b ) , SiMe <nUm> ( 1c ) , CHMe(CMe <nUm> ) ( 1d ) , (+)-menthyl ( 1e ) ) , when activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , catalyze propylene polymerization with high activities . the preparations and x-ray structures of the dilithio salt of an enantiopure , double silylene-bridged bis(cyclopentadienyl) ligand , Li <nUm> [ ( 1,2-Me <nUm> Si ) <nUm> - { C <nUm> H <nUm> -4-(1R,2S,5R-menthyl)}{(C <nUm> H-3,5-(CHMe <nUm> ) <nUm> )}]*3THF , as well as the corresponding zirconocene dichloride , [ ( 1,2-Me <nUm> Si ) <nUm> { η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> H <nUm> -4- (1R,2S,5R-menthyl)}{e <nUm> -C <nUm> H-3,5-(CHMe <nUm> ) <nUm> }]ZrCl <nUm> ( 1e ) , are reported . the C ( s ) - symmetric systems 1a-c are highly regiospecific and syndiospecific ( > <nUm> % ) in neat propylene . At lower propylene concentrations , polymers with lower molecular weights and tacticity ( mostly m - type steroerrors ) are obtained . the microstructures of polymers produced under differing reaction conditions are consistent with stereocontrol dominated by a site epimerization process , an inversion of configuration at zirconium resulting from the polymer chain swinging from one side of the metallocene wedge to the other without monomer insertion . the relative importance of chain epimerization ( at the β carbon ) has been established by parallel polymerization of 2,d <nUm> -propylene and d <nUm> -propylene with 1b / MAO at low propylene concentrations . the C <nUm> -symmetric systems 1d,e / MAO display an unusual dependence of sterospecificity on propylene concentration , switching from isospecific to syndiospecific with increasing propylene pressure , consistent with a competitive unimolecular site epimerization process and a bimolecular chain propagation . the microstructures of the polypropylenes produced by 1d / MAO and 1e / MAO with [r] ≃ <nUm> % resemble the hemiisotactic microstructure produced by me <nUm> c(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> -3-Me)(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> ( 2b ) / MAO . contrastingly , the hemiisotactic polypropylene microstructure obtained with 2b / MAO is found to be maintained at all propylene concentrations examined . 
the new C1 - symmetric complexes rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(2- methylbenz[e]-1-e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 14a ) , rac-[1-(9- e5-fluorenyl)-2-(4,5-cyclohexa-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 14b ) , and rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl- 1-e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 15 ) were prepared in up to <nUm> % yield . these compounds , activated with methyl aluminoxane , exhibit high active propene polymerization rates which remain constant over hours , even at elevated polymerization temperatures of <nUm> and <nUm> ° C . the two different coordination sites of these ' dual - side ' catalysts lead to isotactic polypropenes with variable amounts of stereoerrors , depending on the monomer concentration . the 2-methyl substituent of the indenyl ligands results , at the same time , in significantly increased molecular weights of the polymer products ( up to <nUm> x <nUm> g mol-1 ) , the bulk properties of which can be adjusted from flexible , semicrystalline thermoplastic to excellent thermoplastic elastic . 
this contribution reports the first chemoselective , stereospecific , and living polymerization of polar divinyl monomers , enabled by chiral ansa - zirconocenium catalysts through an enantiomorphic - site controlled coordination - addition polymerization mechanism . silyl-bridged-ansa-zirconocenium ester enolate <nUm> has been synthesized and structurally characterized , but it exhibits low to negligible activity and stereospecificity in the polymerization of polar divinyl monomers including vinyl methacrylate ( VMA ) , allyl methacrylate ( AMA ) , 4-vinylbenzyl methacrylate ( VBMA ) , and N,N-diallyl acrylamide ( DAA ) . In contrast , ethylene-bridged-ansa-zirconocenium ester enolate <nUm> is highly active and stereospecific in the polymerization of such monomers including AMA , VBMA , and DAA . the polymerization by <nUm> is perfectly chemoselective for all four polar divinyl monomers , proceeding exclusively through conjugate addition across the methacrylic C = C bond , while leaving the pendant C = C bonds intact . the polymerization of DAA is most stereospecific and controlled , producing essentially stereoperfect isotactic PDAA with [mmmm] > <nUm> % , m < inf > n < / inf > matching the theoretical value ( thus a quantitative initiation efficiency ) , and a narrow molecular weight distribution ( crossed d sign = <nUm> - <nUm> ) . the stereospecificity is slightly lower for the AMA polymerization but still leading to highly isotactic poly(allyl methacrylate ) ( PAMA ) with 95-97 % [mm] . the polymerization of VBMA is further less stereospecific , affording PVBMA with 90-94 % [mm] , while the polymerization VMA is least stereospecific . several lines of evidence from both homo- and block copolymerization results have demonstrated living characteristics of the AMA polymerization by <nUm> . mechanistic studies of this polymerization have yielded a monometallic coordination - addition polymerization mechanism involving the eight - membered chelating intermediate . post-functionalization of isotactic polymers bearing the pendant vinyl group on every repeating unit via the thiol - ene " click " reaction achieves a full conversion of all the pendant double bonds to the corresponding thioether bonds . photocuring of such isotactic polymers is also successful , producing an elastic material readily characterizable by dynamic mechanical analysis .

the articulation of the notion of frustrated lewis pairs ( FLPs ) , which emerged from the discovery that H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > can be reversibly activated by combinations of sterically encumbered lewis acids and bases , has prompted a great deal of recent activity . perhaps the most remarkable consequence has been the development of FLP catalysts for the hydrogenation of a range of organic substrates . In the past <nUm> years , the substrate scope has evolved from bulky polar species to include a wide range of unsaturated organic molecules . In addition , effective stereoselective metal - free hydrogenation catalysts have begun to emerge . the mechanism of this activation of H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > has been explored , and the nature and range of lewis acid / base combinations capable of effecting such activation have also expanded to include a variety of non-metal species . the reactivity of FLPs with a variety of other small molecules , including olefins , alkynes , and a range of element oxides , has also been developed . although much of this latter chemistry has uncovered unique stoichiometric transformations , metal - free catalytic hydroamination , CO < inf > <nUm> < / inf > reduction chemistry , and applications in polymerization have also been achieved . the concept is also beginning to find applications in bioinorganic and materials chemistry as well as heterogeneous catalysis . this perspective highlights many of these developments and discusses the relationship between FLPs and established chemistry . some of the directions and developments that are likely to emerge from FLP chemistry in the future are also presented . 
this contribution presents evidence for new pathways manifested in the reactions of the phenylhydrosilanes PhnSiH4-n with the pincer complexes (POCsp2OP)Ni(OSiMe3) , 1-OSiMe3 , and (POCsp3OP)Ni(OSiMe3) , 2-OSiMe3 ( POCsp2OP = 2,6-(i-Pr2PO)2C6H3 ; POCsp3OP = (i-Pr2POCH2)2CH ) . excess PhSiH3 or Ph2SiH2 reacted with 1-OSiMe3 to eliminate the disilyl ethers PhnH3 - nSiOSiMe3 ( n = <nUm> or <nUm> ) and generate the nickel hydride species 1-H . subsequent reaction of the latter with more substrate formed corresponding nickel silyl species 1-SiPhH2 or 1-SiPh2H and generated multiple Si - containing products , including disilanes and redistribution products . the reaction of 1-OSiMe3 with excess Ph2SiH2 / Ph2SiD2 revealed a net KIE of ca. <nUm> - <nUm> at room temperature . treating 1-OSiMe3 with excess Ph3SiH also gave 1-H and the corresponding disilyl ether Ph3SiOSiMe3 , but this reaction also generated the new siloxide 1-OSiPh3 apparently via an unconventional s-bond metathesis pathway in which the Ni center is not involved directly . the reaction of excess PhSiH3 and 2-OSiMe3 gave polysilanes of varying solubilities and molecular weights ; NMR investigations showed that these polymers arise from ni(0) species generated in situ from the reductive elimination of the highly reactive hydride intermediate , 2-H . the stoichiometric reactions of 2-OSiMe3 with Ph2SiH2 and Ph3SiH gave , respectively , siloxides 2-OSiPh2(OSiMe3) and 2-OSiPh3 . together , these results demonstrate the strong influence of pincer backbone and hydrosilane sterics on the different reactivities of 1-OSiMe3 and 2-OSiMe3 toward PhnSiH4-n ( dimerization , polymerization , and redistribution vs formation of new siloxides ) . the mechanisms of the reactions that lead to the observed Si-O , Si-C , and Si-Si bond formations are discussed in terms of classical and unconventional s-bond metathesis pathways . 
chiral polymers are ubiquitous in nature , and the self - assembly of chiral materials is a field of widespread interest . In this paper , we describe the formation of chiral metallopolymers based on poly(cobaltoceniumethylene) ( [PCE]n+ ) , which have been prepared through oxidation of poly(cobaltocenylethylene) ( PCE ) in the presence of enantiopure n-acyl-amino-acid - derived anionic surfactants , such as n-palmitoyl-l-alanine ( C16-l-Ala ) and n-palmitoyl-d-alanine ( C16-d-Ala ) . it is postulated that the resulting metallopolymer complexes [PCE][C16-l / d-Ala]n contain close ionic contacts , and exhibit chirality through the axially chiral ethylenic CH2 - CH2 bridges , leading to interaction of the chromophoric [CoCp2]+ units through chiral space . the steric influence of the long palmitoyl ( C16 ) surfactant tail is key for the transmission of chirality to the polymer , and results in a brushlike amphiphilic macromolecular structure that also affords solubility in polar organic solvents ( e.g. , EtOH , THF ) . upon dialysis of these solutions into water , the hydrophobic palmitoyl surfactant substituents aggregate and the complex assembles into superhelical ribbons with identifiable " handedness " , indicating the transmission of chirality from the molecular surfactant to the micrometer length scale , via the macromolecular complex . 
C-H bond activation via s-bond metathesis is typically observed with transition - metal alkyl compounds in d <nUm> or d <nUm> f n electron configurations , e.g. , biscyclopentadienyl metal alkyls . related C-H activation processes are also observed for transition - metal alkyls with higher d-electron counts , such as W (II) , Fe (II) , or Ir (III) . A s-bond metathesis mechanism has been proposed in all cases with a preference for an oxidative addition - reductive elimination pathway for Ir (III) . herein we show that , regardless of the exact mechanism , C-H activation with all of these compounds is associated with p-character of the M-C bond , according to a detailed analysis of the <nUm> C NMR chemical shift tensor of the a-carbon . p-Character is also a requirement for olefin insertion , indicating its similarity to s-bond metathesis . this observation explains the H <nUm> response observed in d <nUm> olefin polymerization catalysts and underlines that s-bond metathesis , olefin insertion , and olefin metathesis are in fact isolobal reactions . 
the precise size- and shape - controlled synthesis of monodisperse Al nanocrystals remains an open challenge , limiting their utility for numerous applications that would take advantage of their size and shape - dependent optical properties . here we pursue a molecular - level understanding of the formation of Al nanocrystals by titanium(IV) isopropoxide - catalyzed decomposition of AlH <nUm> in lewis base solvents . As determined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of intermediates , the reaction begins with the formation of Ti 3+ -AlH <nUm> complexes . proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicates isopropoxy ligands are removed from Ti by Al , producing aluminum(III) isopropoxide and low - valent Ti 3+ catalysts . these Ti 3+ species catalyze elimination of H <nUm> from AlH <nUm> inducing the polymerization of AlH <nUm> into colloidally unstable low - valent aluminum hydride clusters . these clusters coalesce and grow while expelling H <nUm> to form colloidally stable Al nanocrystals . the colloidal stability of the Al nanocrystals and their size is determined by the molecular structure and density of coordinating atoms in the reaction , which is controlled by choice of solvent composition . 
the title reaction has been surveyed for a number of substrates with differing substitution patterns . with a few exceptions , the methodology provides a one - pot synthesis of the 1,2-diamines from widely available and inexpensive starting materials , and in high yields . In addition , the coupling of 1,4-and 1,3-bis-(N,N,N',N'-tetraalkyl)arylenediamides is shown , under the same experimental conditions , to yield oligomers : R2NC(O)C 6H4CH(NR2)-[CH(NR2)C 6H4CH(NR2)]n-CH(NR 2)C6H4C(O)-NR2 ( r = methyl and ethyl ; n = <nUm> to ca. <nUm> ) . the chemical structures of these unprecedented oligomers are determined by comparison of NMR and MS spectra to those of vicinal diamines , prepared from the analogous N,N-dialkylbenzamides . the origin of the limitation of oligomer chain length is probably due to a specific effect of the internal benzylic amine group , since the substrate 4-Me2NCH 2C6H4C(O)NMe2 was found to be uniquely unreactive compared to the other 4-substituted N,N-dialkylbenzamides investigated . N-Methylphthalimide was briefly studied as a monomer and analysis by MS showed that oligomers are formed . attempts to fully characterize these polymers were unsuccessful . 
A series of chromium - incorporated MSU-x mesoporous molecular sieves were synthesized under different templates , initial Si / Cr molar ratios , aging times , and temperatures in acid solution . the synthesis was performed by using sodium silicate , chromium nitrate , and nonionic poly(ethylene oxide ) surfactant as the source of silicone , metal , and the template , respectively . the Cr-MSU-x products were analyzed by inductively couple plasma - optical emission spectrometry to determine the actual Cr content and were characterized by x-ray diffraction , N adsorption - desorption , scanning electron microscopy , high - resolution transmission electron microscopy , diffuse reflectance UV - visible , x-ray adsorption near - edge spectroscopy , and temperature - programmed reduction techniques . the Cr species were mostly formed as Cr (VI) in tetrahedral coordination . two kinds of Cr (VI) species with different reduction abilities were distinguished . the catalytic activities of Cr-MSU-x in the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with CO2 were investigated at the same time . the synthesis parameters explored strongly influence the chromium content in Cr-MSU-x and , subsequently , the catalytic activities . the Cr-MSU-x synthesized with Si / Cr = <nUm> , aging at <nUm> ° C for <nUm> h , and templating by fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene ether gave the best activities , resulting in <nUm> % ethane conversion and <nUm> % ethylene selectivity . the Cr species in Cr-MSU-x are more efficient in activating and converting ethane molecules than are conventional catalysts . 
Poly(N-vinylcarbazole) films can be deposited at the three - phase boundary when the organic phase contains only monomer , n-vinylcarbazole , while the aqueous phase contains supporting electrolyte . A cylindrical platinum microelectrode is immersed into the two - liquid system in such a way that a part of it is located in one liquid and the other part resides in the second liquid . the thickness of the reaction layer , or the width of the microelectrode zone where the polymer grows , depends on the kind of ions present in the aqueous phase and the time of the experiment . the structure of the deposited polymer may be very different and depends on the distance from the three - phase boundary and the type of the anion present in the aqueous phase . the key parameters here are the local electrode potential and the local concentration of the anions . the list of obtained polymer structures includes , among others , arrays of perfectly arranged deep oval channels and groups of microcrystals . the porosity of the polymer deposits increases with the distance from the aqueous phase . 
A nonconjugated methacrylate copolymer ( PCzOxEu ) containing carbazole moieties ( electron donors ) , 1,3,4-oxadiazole moieties ( electron acceptors ) , and europium complexes in the pendant groups was synthesized via free radical copolymerization of methacrylate monomers containing the respective functional groups . the molecular structure and composition of PCzOxEu was characterized by elemental analysis , FT-IR , 1H NMR , 13C NMR , UV - vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies , gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) , x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) , and cyclic voltammetry ( CyV ) . the resulting copolymer exhibited a relatively high glass transition temperature ( tg ≈ <nUm> ° C ) and good solubility in common organic solvents . it could be cast into transparent films from solutions . for a thin film of PCzOxEu sandwiched between an indium - tin oxide ( ITO ) electrode and an Al electrode ( ITO / PCzOxEu / Al ) , the structure behaved as a nonvolatile flash ( rewritable ) memory with accessible electronic states that could be written , read , and erased . the polymer memory exhibited an ON / OFF current ratio up to <nUm> <nUm> , switching response time of ∼ <nUm> ms , more than <nUm> <nUm> read cycles , retention time of more than <nUm> h , and write / erase voltages of about <nUm> V / <nUm> V under ambient conditions . the roles of oxadiazole moieties in improving the response time and retention time of the memory device were elucidated from the molecular simulation results . 
for a class of p-complexes as energy donors , with the use of highly emissive d0 metallocenes Cp2MCl2 where m = Zr and Hf , it is shown that radiationless triplet energy transfer to unsaturated hydrocarbons in a rigid nonpolar methylcyclohexane ( MCH ) matrix ( where molecular diffusion is absent ) obeys the perrin equation , occurs at radii R0 , being close to the diameter of interacting molecules , and is well described by an electron - exchange resonant ( dexter ) mechanism of interaction . principle correlation between values of the critical radius and a number of C atoms in a linear a-olefin is for the first time reported , viz. R0 ( Å ) = <nUm> + 1.35n ( obtained for systems [ Cp2HfCl2 + CnH2n + MCH ] at <nUm> K ) . pronounced blue shifts ( up to <nUm> cm-1 ) of low - temperature emission spectra of cp 2ZrCl2 in MCH in the presence of dienes , possessing nonconjugated C = C bonds , are observed , thus suggesting inner - sphere diene coordination . In view of the experimental data , inner- and outer - sphere coordinative interaction between the components of catalytic systems for polymerization ( d0 metallocene precatalysts and alkenes and dienes ) is rationalized . 
the electrochemical synthesis of a new dithienylcyclopentadienone- derivative / 3-methylthiopene copolymer was performed by cyclic voltammetry . the obtained material shows redox processes very close to those from the pristine DTCPD . A new redox process at <nUm> V , with a large anodic shift ( <nUm> V ) related to the poly(3-methylthiophene) reduction , indicates the existence of a copolymer with a strong influence of the neighboring ( n - doped ) DTCPD comonomer . the new copolymer is electrochemically n - doped at more cathodic potentials than <nUm> mV and p - doped at more anodic potentials than <nUm> mV , with a bandgap of <nUm> eV . the cation 's entrance in the film from the solution during n - doping and anion 's entrance during p - doping for charge balance was checked by QCM . the reduction of the DTCPD part suffers a partial trapping of the negative charges that can be reoxidized only at high overpotentials ( > <nUm> V related to the reduction potentials ) . after polarization of the material at any potential inside the band gap , subsequent p- or n - doping reactions performed by potential steps start by nucleation - relaxation kinetic control , followed by anodic or cathodic , respectively , chronoamperometric maxima . At the maxima , both reactions were checked to occur under chemical kinetic control , allowing the determination of the reaction orders for p- and n - doping processes . 
palladium(0) nanoclusters having an average particle size of <nUm> nm were generated in situ from the reduction of palladium (II) acetylacetonate in the presence of oleylamine ( AmO ) during the dehydrogenation of ammonia - borane ( AB ) in THF under inert gas atmosphere at room temperature . AmO - stabilized palladium(0) nanoclusters were stable enough to be isolated as solid materials and characterized by TEM , HRTEM , XRD , UV - vis , and FT-IR techniques . they were found to be highly active catalysts in the hydrogen generation from the dehydrogenation of AB ; in total , <nUm> equiv of hydrogen gas per AB was generated even at low catalyst concentration and room temperature . the first and second equivalent of H generation from AB were completed in ∼ <nUm> and <nUm> min , respectively , from the dehydrogenation of AB in the presence of palladium(0) nanoclusters corresponding to an initial turnover frequency of <nUm> h-1 . 11B NMR study of the reaction shows that hydrogen evolution likely takes place in one or both of two parallel routes : ( i ) through formation of cyclopolyborazane followed by its polymerization to polyborazylene and ( ii ) through formation of long - chain B-N linear polymers . carbon disulfide poisoning experiments indicate that the dehydrogenation of AB catalyzed by AmO - stabilized palladium(0) nanoclusters is heterogeneous catalysis . moreover , the work reported here includes a wealthy collection of kinetic data to determine the rate law and apparent activation energy for the catalytic dehydrogenation of AB . 
ultrathin films of poly[N-(2-cyanoethyl)pyrrole] and poly(N-methylpyrrole) and their composites with Au nanoparticles were used for the electrochemical detection of small concentrations ( <nUm> mM - <nUm> mM ) of dopamine , a neurotransmitter related with neurological disorders . results indicated that Au nanoparticles improve the sensing abilities of the two polymers , even though they are not essential to obtain effective and fast responses toward the presence of dopamine . furthermore , although both polymers have been found to be highly sensitive to low concentrations of dopamine , the response of poly[N-(2-cyanoethyl)pyrrole] is better and more effective than the response of poly(N-methylpyrrole) . experimental results were corroborated with quantum mechanical calculations on model systems , which also indicated that the interaction of oxidized dopamine with poly[N-(2-cyanoethyl)pyrrole] is stronger than that with poly(N-methylpyrrole) . this behavior has been attributed to two different factors : ( i ) the flexibility of the cyanoethyl groups , which allows maximize the number of attractive van der waals interactions , and ( ii ) the dipole of the cyano group , which interacts favorably with the dipole of the C = O bonds of oxidized dopamine . finally , theoretical results were used to propose an atomistic model that explains the interaction behavior between the oxidized dopamine and the conducting polymers . 
we studied the electrical memory characteristics of the following nitrogen - linked poly(2,7-carbazole)s : poly(9-hexadecyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-N,N-(4- hexadecyloxy)aniline ) , poly(9-hexadecyl-N,N-diphenylcarbazole-2,7-diamine-alt-1 , 3-benzene ) , and poly(9-hexadecyl-N,N-diphenylcarbazole-2,7-diamine-alt-4,4- biphenyl ) . these polymers are amorphous ; however , in thin films , they are slightly oriented in the film plane . all polymers in devices with aluminum top and bottom electrodes were found to exhibit similar dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ) behaviors without polarity . they are operable with a low voltage ( less than ± <nUm> V ) and a high ON / OFF current ratio ( 105-10 <nUm> , depending on the polymer ) over the thickness range 8-60 nm . the memory behaviors were found to be governed by space - charge limited conduction and local filament formation . these memory characteristics might originate from the electron - donating carbazole and triphenylamino units in the polymer backbones , which act as charge - trapping sites but have weak electric polarization because of the absence of counterparts . overall , these polymers are suitable active materials for the mass production at low cost of high - performance , programmable volatile memory devices . 
we propose routes for the catalytic cycle and possible termination reactions for the polymerization of ethylene with cationic chromium complexes of the type [CpCr(L)R] + which contain donor ligands with phosphorus or nitrogen ( L = PR <nUm> or NR <nUm> ) . we confirm the rate - determining character of the insertion of ethylene into the chromium - alkyl bond . contrary to the situation with late transition metals , the resulting agostic isomers will readily isomerize . the termination of the polymerization reaction by b-hydrogen elimination to the chromium center and subsequent dissociation of the resulting olefin is found to require about <nUm> kcal / mol and to be thermodynamically much less feasible than the alternative termination process by b-hydrogen transfer to a monomer . the latter process involves spin change ; two minimum - energy crossing points as well as further transition states and intermediates have been identified . our calculations predict that adduct formation with the polymerization additive 9-BBN should be feasible both from a cp - quinoline - based chromium catalyst and a zirconocene catalyst . however , only the latter undergoes exergonic chain transfer , which is in accordance with the experimentally observed formation of ultrahigh m W polyethylene when using 9-BBN as polymerization additive in combination with Cr catalysts . for the first time , quantum dynamics simulations of such open - shell systems have been performed , which give a lifetime of the Cr - alkyl complex with regard to ethylene insertion of only <nUm> fs . the simulations indicate that the dissociation of ethylene from the chromium center should be relatively insignificant compared to migratory insertion . 
reduction of titanium and vanadium compounds is a process accompanying the activation of coordinative olefin polymerization catalysts . four density functional theory ( DFT ) functionals , coupled cluster with single , double , and perturbative triple excitations method CCSD(T) as well as complete active - space second - order perturbation theory method CASPT2 with a complete active - space self - consistent field CASSCF reference wave function were applied to investigate the thermodynamics of titanium and vanadium reduction . the performance of these theoretical methods was assessed and compared with experimental values . the calculations indicate that vanadium(IV) chloride is more easily reduced by trimethylaluminum than the corresponding titanium compound ; the energies of reaction calculated at the CCSD(T) level are equal <nUm> and <nUm> kcal / mol , respectively . the calculations deal with the redox reactions of metal chlorides in the gas phase , rather than solvated ions in the aqueous solution . this approach may be more appropriate for olefin polymerization , usually carried out in nonpolar solvents . 
some metallocene methyl cations made of zirconium , that have been used as catalysts in polymerization of ethylene , were studied by means of the conceptual density functional theory ( DFT ) . up to now , catalytic activity , a pure experimental parameter , that measures the kilograms of polyethylene produced per gram of metallocene , per time unit , per temperature unit , and per pressure unit , has been mainly explained in terms of steric hindrance at least qualitatively , meaning that a catalyst having a higher steric hindrance will present a lower catalytic activity . however , there has not been a satisfactory explanation for those few cases in which the steric effect can not be linked with the catalytic activity , thus meaning that the electronic inductive effect predominates over the steric effect . As a consequence , the electronic inductive effect must be quantified through the use of a proper descriptor based on quantum chemical calculations and , in addition , this descriptor should be able to explain high values of catalytic activities even when the steric effect seems to play an unfavorable role . this work has demonstrated that a local reactivity descriptor called local hyper - softness coming from the conceptual DFT is a suitable pure theoretical parameter that explains such anomalies in some values of catalytic activity . it is expected that the findings exposed here can help to estimate catalytic activity and lead to a more rational design of new catalysts by means of computational chemistry . 
ethene polymerization with bis(2-dimethylsilyl-indenyl)zirconium(IV) dichloride ( 1 ) / MAO and bis(2-trimethylsilyl-indenyl)zirconium(IV) dichloride ( 2 ) / MAO and ethene-co-1-hexene polymerization with <nUm> / MAO are presented . the end group analysis of homopolymers reveals a pronounced dependence of the termination rate on temperature changes . In combination with the high molecular weights obtained , these results are in accord with theoretical predictions . gel permeation chromatography , fourier transform infrared , and 13C NMR analyses of copolymerization products from <nUm> / MAO as a function of comonomer concentration at two different temperature series denote its tendency to form inhomogeneous polymer blends . thermal analysis and fractionation results of one such blend indicate an inhomogeneity in the enchainment process and the existence of multiple active sites of differing geometry . these indications are further supported by AMBER force field and density functional theory studies of the catalyst precursors and the active site of <nUm> / MAO . for this system , d-agostic interactions for the stabilization of the zirconium cation are favored over b-agostic interactions , which , in contrast to the situation in studies on bis-Cp systems , is a sparsely populated species . the gap in activation enthalphies for b-hydride transfer and elimination is marginalized for these bulky zirconocenes , and conceptually new mechanisms for the isomerization of the vinyl end groups are discussed . further , unexpected activation of the silicon-hydrogen bond within the ligand framework is observed with an activation enthalpy as low as <nUm> kcal / mol . 
this paper reports for the first time the programmable digital memory characteristics of the nanoscale thin films of a fully p-conjugated polymer , poly(diethyl dipropargylmalonate ) ( pDEDPM ) in the absence of doping . this p-conjugated polymer was found to exhibit good solubility in organic solvents and to be easily processed to form nanoscale thin films through the use of conventional solution spin- , roll- , or dip - coating and subsequent drying . films of the p-conjugated polymer with top and bottom metal electrodes exhibit excellent dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ) characteristics or write-once-read-many-times ( WORM ) memory behavior without polarity , depending on the film thickness . all the PI films are initially present in the OFF - state . films with a thickness of <nUm> nm were found to exhibit very stable WORM memory characteristics without polarity and an ON / OFF current ratio of <nUm> , whereas films with a thickness of 62-120 nm were found to exhibit excellent DRAM characteristics without polarity and an ON / OFF current ratio as high as <nUm> <nUm> . these memory characteristics are governed by trap - limited space - charge limited conduction and heterogeneously local filament formation . In these polymer films , both the ester units and the conjugated double bonds of the polymer backbone can act as charge trapping sites . the excellent bistable switching properties and processibility of this p-conjugated polymer mean that it is a promising material for the low - cost mass production of high density and very stable digital nonvolatile WORM memory and volatile DRAM devices . 
A conductive polypyrrole ( PPy ) film was successfully synthesized in a homogeneous supercritical carbon dioxide ( scCO2 ) / acetonitrile ( AN ) system . the occurrence of a homogeneous supercritical state was confirmed by observations of the phase behavior of the system through a high - pressure cell with a viewing window . the concentration of a supporting electrolyte , tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate ( TBAPF6 ) , significantly changed the phase behavior of the scCO2 / AN system . the polymerization rate of the film in that system decreased with further addition of CO2 . this result suggested that the low viscosity of scCO2 did not play an important role in improving the growth rate of the PPy film . the low polymerization rate might have been due to the electron - transfer resistance arising from the low dielectric constant of scCO2 / AN mixture . the roughness of the film prepared in the homogeneous scCO2 / AN system was <nUm> / <nUm> that synthesized in AN itself as a solvent . the slow growth of film and the high diffusion rate of the monomer seemed to account for the smooth flat film formation . 
A functional polymer ( PVK - C60 ) , containing carbazole moieties and fullerene moieties in a molar ratio of about <nUm> : <nUm> , was synthesized by covalent tethering of C60 to poly(N-vinylcarbazole) ( PVK ) . the molecular structure and composition of PVK - C60 were characterized by FTIR , raman , and UV - vis absorption spectroscopy , gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) , x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) , and cyclic voltammetry ( CyV ) . it was observed that the C60 - modified PVK exhibited an enhanced glass - transition temperature and good solubility in organic solvents such as toluene , tetrahydrofuran , chloroform , and N,N-dimethylformamide ( DMF ) . the polymer memory exhibited an ON / OFF current ratio of more than <nUm> and write / erase voltages around <nUm> V / <nUm> V . both the ON and OFF states were stable under a constant voltage stress of <nUm> V for <nUm> h and survived up to <nUm> read cycles at <nUm> under ambient conditions . 
new methods for the preparation of silver nanoparticles / polymer nanocomposite materials by thermal cationic polymerization of e-caprolactone ( e-CL ) or a-pinene oxide ( a-PO ) at room temperature ( RT ) and under air were developed . the new initiating systems were based on silanes ( Si ) , starch nanocrystals ( StN ) and metal salts . excellent polymerization profiles were revealed . it was shown that silver nanoparticles ( ag(0) NPs ) were in situ formed and that the addition of StN improves the polymerization efficiency . the as-synthesized nanocomposite materials contained spherical nanoparticles homogeneously dispersed in the polymer matrices . polymers and nanoparticles were characterized by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) , x-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) , and UV - vis spectroscopy . A coherent picture of the involved chemical mechanisms is presented . 
ethylene ( e ) / propylene ( P ) solution copolymerizations with low propylene ratios were carried out using constrained geometry catalyst , [C5Me4(SiMe2NtBu)]TiMe2 ( CGC ) , and ansa - zirconocene , rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( EBI ) , at 130-150 ° C and <nUm> × <nUm> kPa . ethylene / propylene copolymers with long chain branch ( LCB ) densities from <nUm> to <nUm> carbons per <nUm> <nUm> carbons , molecular weight distributions close to <nUm> , and narrow comonomer composition distributions were synthesized with CGC . broad molecular weight and comonomer composition distributions were found in the EBI copolymers . reactivity ratios showed that CGC was more active for propylene incorporation than EBI . terminal group analysis indicated that more terminal unsaturation occurred with EBI than with CGC . two additional types of terminal unsaturated groups , vinylidene with side group having more than three carbons ( 2VD ) and trans-vinylene ( VE ) , were found with EBI while the terminal vinyl ( V ) and vinylidene with methyl side group ( 1VD ) were determined in both CGC and EBI copolymers . long chain branch structures were formed by the V type macromonomer incorporation . the long chain branching rate constants were also estimated . 
the hydro-oligomerization of cyclopentene in toluene solution using [ethylenebis(e5-indenyl)]-zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) or bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride and methylaluminoxane as catalysts was studied . the crude oligomer mixture obtained using the former catalyst was extracted with hot toluene to provide a fraction consisting predominantly of dimer , trimer , and tetramer . distillation provided trimer of <nUm> % purity . pure tetramer was precipitated from methanol-toluene as a crystalline solid . hydro-oligomerization of cyclopentene with zirconocene dichloride as catalyst provided two tetramers , one of which was identical to that produced using the chiral catalyst . the structure of the trimer , including stereochemistry , was established by total synthesis . these results conclusively demonstrate that the original structure assigned to poly(cyclopentene) is incorrect and that enchainment of cyclopentene occurs predominantly by cis-1,3-insertion . A mechanism for the polymerization of cyclopentene using catalyst <nUm> is discussed . 
this paper discusses a new family of syndiotactic polystyrene ( s-PS ) derivatives containing the amino group , including poly(4-aminostyrene) , poly(4-aminomethylstyrene) , and poly(4-aminoethyl-styrene) . these semicrystalline polymers exhibit high melting temperatures ( approx. <nUm> ° C ) and relatively fast crystallization rates . these functional syndiotactic polymers are prepared in two steps . syndiospecific polymerization of a styrene derivative containing a masking N,N-bis(trimethylsilyl)amino group is achieved by using a half - sandwich titanocene / perfluoroborane catalyst system . this study focused on the catalyst system ( catalyst and cocatalyst ) that can polymerize functional monomers with high catalyst activity and syndiotacticity . acid hydrolysis leads to the complete recovery of primary amino groups in s-PS derivatives . 
the termination processes of zirconocene - MAO olefin polymerization catalyst under high pressure of 100-1500 MP were studied . it was found that the ratios of olefinic polymer ends depend on the reaction pressure , and trans-vinylene groups predominantly form under high pressures . the b-hydrogen transfer to olefin was accelerated under <nUm> MPa in hexene polymerization with (C5H4Me)2ZrCl2 . 
the diastereoselectivity of the cyclization step in the cyclopolymerization of 1,5-hexadiene with homogeneous catalysts based on zirconocene / methylalumoxane systems is investigated through the analysis of the nonbonded interactions on model catalytic sites analogous to those proposed for a-olefin polymerizations . A model which does not include any cyclopentadienyl ring presents a small trans specificity : the minimum energy intermediate brings the formation of trans rings and resembles a cyclohexane chair in which the growing chain occupies a pseudoequatorial position ( trans-chair conformation ) . the addition of two cyclopentadienyl rings to the Zr atom , due to interactions with the growing chain which occupies a pseudoaxial position , disfavors the two most stable cis conformations ( a cis-chair and a cis-boat ) . As a consequence , the model with two cyclopentadienyl rings shows a higher trans specificity than the “ bare ” model . In the presence of two pentamethylcyclopentadienyl rings , the steric interactions of the aromatic ligands tend to disfavor the trans-chair with respect to a cis-twist conformation and the model becomes cis-specific . A good qualitative agreement between the modeling and polymerization results is observed . 
substantial transfer of growing polypropyl chains to methylalumoxane and trimethylaluminum occurs with the highly substituted , isospecific zirconocene catalyst Me2Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C5H2)2ZrCl2 / MAO , while little if any such chain transfer is observed for the more open isospecific catalyst Me2Si(2-MeInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO , for aspecific H4C2(Flu)2ZrCl2 / MAO , and for syndiospecific Ph2C(Cp)FluZrCl2 / MAO . propene polymerization with MAO - activated mixtures of Me2Si(2-MeInd)2ZrCl2 and H4C2(Flu)2ZrCl2 gives completely separable mixtures of the isotactic and atactic polymers characteristic for each of the individual catalysts . MAO - activated mixtures of Me2Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C5H2)2ZrCl2 and H4C2(Flu)2ZrCl2 , however , give polypropene mixtures that contain , besides isotactic and atactic polymers , polymer fractions in which isotactic and atactic polypropene chain segments are inseparably linked . while clear evidence for isotactic - syndiotactic stereoblock formation was not obtained , some polymeryl exchange between isospecific and syndiospecific catalyst sites in MAO - activated mixtures of Me2Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C5H2)2ZrCl2 and Ph2C(Cp)-FluZRCl2 is indicated by increased stereoerror frequencies in some fractions of the polymer product mixture obtained by temperature - rising elution fractionation . structural prerequisites for an efficient transfer of growing polymer chains between different types of catalyst centers are discussed . 
the correlation between relative reactivity of the two styrene enantiofaces and geometry of ansa - zirconocene systems has been determined by 13C NMR microstructural analysis of the poly(propylene-co-styrene-ethylene) ( P / S-E ) obtained in the presence of C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocene catalysts . the chemical shifts assignment accomplished by using configurational additivity rules suggests that secondary styrene insertion with C2 - symmetric metallocene occurs with the opposite enantioface with respect to primary propylene insertion . on the contrary the analysis of 13C enriched copolymer obtained in the presence of Cs - symmetric catalyst seems to indicate that the secondary styrene insertion occurs with same enantioface with respect to propylene . this stereochemistry is what one expects for a simple olefin inserting in secondary fashion despite the peculiar behavior of the aromatic monomer toward zirconocene - based catalysts . 
In order to study the formation and the nature of Ti / Al adducts that play a role in the olefin polymerization activity of the group <nUm> metallocene-methylaluminoxane catalytic systems , the reactions of AlMe3 and / or methylaluminoxane with Cp2TiMeCl and Cp2TiMe2 have been monitored by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy . temperatures between <nUm> and <nUm> K and Al / Ti ratios from <nUm> to <nUm> have been used . the change in 13C NMR signals has been found the most diagnostic . several adducts have been observed and identified . the kind of adducts changes both with the reaction temperature and the Al / tiratio . by comparing the MAO and AlMe3 reactions with Cp2TiMeCl it is possible to deduce that , with respect to AlMe3 , MAO is a better alkylating agent and it has a greater capacity for producing and stabilizing cation - like complexes . At the Al / Ti ratio of <nUm> a complex that we tentatively assign as a solvent separated ion pair prevails . the fact that , after the addition of CCl2H2 to the toluene solution , this complex is present in greater amounts is consistent with this assignment . 
copolymerization of ethylene with 5-vinyl-2-norbornene ( VNB ) using the dicyclopentadienylzirconium dichloride / methylaluminoxane ( zirconocene / MAO ) catalyst system has been shown to occur with regioselective insertion of the endocyclic double bond of VNB into the copolymer chain , leaving the exocyclic vinyl double bond as a pendant unsaturation . the pendant vinyl group in the copolymer can be readily converted to the hydroxy / epoxy group with complete conversion under mild reaction conditions , giving rise to the corresponding functionalized copolymers . the copolymers ( parent and functionalized ) have been characterized using IR , NMR , TGA , DSC , and intrinsic viscosity measurements . 
the influence of the ligand structure of zirconocene polymerization catalysts on the accessibility of the active reaction center was studied by an ab initio hartree - fock method . the variations in the accessibility were elucidated by comparing molecular structures and relative stabilities of <nUm> bridged zirconocene catalysts with <nUm> different bridging units , <nUm> ancillary cp' ligands , and <nUm> ligand substituents . ligand variations gave rise to various steric and electronic effects affecting both the nature and the concentration of active metal centers in the system , such as steric blocking or shielding of the metal center , and stabilization or destabilization of the active cationic species . comparisons to experimental work demonstrated clear correlations between accessibility of the active reaction center and observed polymerization activity . furthermore , interactions between the lewis acidic aluminum centers and lewis basic functionalities were observed . the consequences of such interactions are discussed . 
poly(l-butene) was obtained by polymerization of 1-butene at <nUm> ° C using rac-(dimethyl-silyl)bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( I ) as catalyst and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst . the product was characterized by NMR ( 1H and 13C ) , size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) , and vapor pressure osmometry ( VPO ) . the number - average molecular weight of the polymer was determined as <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> by SEC , VPO , and NMR , respectively . the poly(l-butene) is <nUm> % isotactic and has high regioselectivity ( ca. <nUm> % 1,2-addition ) . both saturated and unsaturated end groups were characterized by NMR . vinylidene and trisubstituted double bonds comprise approximately <nUm> % and <nUm> % , respectively , of the unsaturated end groups with the remainder consisting of vinylene , vinyl , and tetrasubstituted double bonds . n-Butyl and sec-butyl groups constitute the saturated end groups in the approximate ratio <nUm> : <nUm> . there is a slight excess of saturated end groups relative to unsaturated end groups . these results are discussed in terms of a reaction mechanism of initiation and propagation with various chain - transfer reactions ( b-hydride transfers with and without rearrangement , transfer to aluminum , transfer to vinylidene end groups , and b-alkyl transfer ) . 
polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) was conducted with the catalyst systems of rac-Et(Ind)2Zr(CH3)2 / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 , rac-Et(IndH4)2Zr(CH3)2 / ph3CB(C6F5)6 , and rac-Me2Si(Ind)2Zr(CH5)2 / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 . these catalysts only weee found to be inactive . however , the addition of suitable lewis acids like alkylzinc and alkylaluminum compounds gave highly isotactic PMMA . the isotactic pentad [mmmm] in PMMA as well as the propagation rate constant ( kp ) depended significantly upon the zirconocene compounds . both the microstructure ( [mmmm] ) and propagation rate constant ( kp ) increased in the following order : Me2Si(Ind)2 < Et(IndH4)2 < Et(Ind)2 . the microstructure of PMMA was also affected slightly by alkylzinc compounds : C3H5 = CH2 < C2H5 > C4H9 . when the polymerization was initiated by the rac-Et(Ind)2Zr(CH3)2 / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 / Zn(C2H4CH = CH2)2 catalyst system at <nUm> ° C in toluene , the molecular weight of PMMA increased in proportion to the conversion of MMA . the increase of temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C caused a decrease in isotactic pentad content by approximately <nUm> % . the isotactic polymerization of MMA was revealed to proceed by an enantiomorphic site - controlled mechanism . 
the olefin polymerization catalyst based on CpaTi13CH3Cl / MAO has been studied . reaction equilibria and polymerization of 13C - enriched ethylene were followed by 13C NMR spectroscopy , and the catalytic activity was determined . evidence has been obtained that MAO alkylates the transition metal and produces stable cationlike species Cp2TiMe+Cl*[Al(Me)O]n- ( 3 ) . complex <nUm> has been shown to be active for olefin polymerization . two types of ion pairs have been detected for the low Al / Mt ratios . we assume that they are more or less tight ion pairs . it has also been possible to relate polymerization activity to the composition of the catalyst mixture . temperature ( <nUm> ÷ <nUm> ° C ) , Al / Mt mole ratios ( <nUm> ÷ <nUm> ) , and catalyst dilution have been shown to influence the concentration of active species such as <nUm> and thus to affect polymerization activity . dilution decreases the formation of nonactive species such as Cp2Ti(Me)-OAl(Me)-MAO ( 4 ) . 
c2v-symmetric ethylenebis(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) and its C2 - symmetric bis-[9-(1-methyl)fluorenyl] derivative ( 2 ) have been synthesized in good yields using a convenient synthetic route . precursor <nUm> activated with triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( 3 ) catalyzes propylene polymerization with a constant activity of ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) × <nUm> g of PP / ( ( mol of Zr)*[C3H6]*h ) between <nUm> and + <nUm> ° C . the polypropylene is ideally atactic and has the same of ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) × <nUm> . the above system catalyzes ethylene polymerization with a maximum activity of <nUm> × <nUm> g of PE / ( ( mol of Zr)*[C2H4]*h ) at <nUm> ° C which decreases exponentially with an increase of tp . all the polyethylenes produced between <nUm> and + <nUm> ° C have the same of ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) × <nUm> . In contrast , precursor <nUm> catalyzed the formation of anisotactic polypropylene of low stereoregularity . molecular mechanics calculations indicated that substituents on the fluorenyl rings have little effect on both diastereomeric ratios in the synthesis and stereoselectivities in the polymerization . 
we report the stereospecific polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) with single - component cationic zirconocene catalysts . the complexes Me2CCpIndZrMe(thf)+BPh4- ( 1 ) and Me2CCp2-ZrMe(thf)+BPh4- ( 2 ) are active catalysts for the polymerization of MMA , in remarkable contrast to other cationic zirconocenes . while <nUm> yields highly isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) , <nUm> is syndiospecific at low temperatures . this is the first example for a rational control of PMMA microstructure via catalyst symmetry . polymerization kinetics and stereospecificity control in MMA polymerization with <nUm> and <nUm> are discussed . on the basis of the experimental data , a possible polymerization mechanism is proposed . 
A new poly(oxyphenylene) derivative containing a 3-(trialkylammonio)propyl substituent was synthesized via hydroiodinated poly(oxy-2-allyl-6-methyl-1,4-phenylene) followed by quaternization with trialkylamine . poly(oxy-2-allyl-6-methyl-1,4-phenylene) obtained by oxidative polymerization of 2-allyl-6-methylphenol was allowed to react with bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium chloride hydride ( ZrCp2 - ClH ) at room temperature in inert atmosphere in which the allyl group was converted to a terminally zirconocene - substituted propyl group . the activated propyl group can react with I2 to yield the 3-iodopropyl group . the quaternization of the resulting polymer was performed through the menshutkin reaction with a series of trialkylamines to obtain the poly[oxy-2-[3-(trialkylammonio)propyl]-6-methyl-1,4-phenylene iodide ] . the resulting polyammonium salt as an ion exchange resin exhibits higher thermal stability than poly[oxy-2-[(trimethylammonio)methyl]-6-methyl-1,4-phenylene salt ] , e.g. , no decomposition in water below <nUm> ° C for <nUm> h . 
A new monocyclopentadienylamido complex , [ e5:e1-(2,3-Me2 Benz[e]Ind)SiMe2NtBu]TiCl2 ( I ) , was synthesized as catalyst precursor . the studies on the homopolymerization and copolymenzation of 4-methyl-1-pentene ( P ) and ethylene ( e ) were presented , by comparing complex I with other CpA complexes and Cp2M zirconocenes . the complex I , activated with methylaluminoxane , provided an enhanced copolymerization activity , an excellent incorporation of 4-methyl-1-pentene into the polyethylene chain , and an increased copolymer molecular weight . analysis of 13C NMR spectra of polymers , combined with the monomer reactivity ratios and the polymerization results , demonstrated that the regioselectivity of monomer insertion , tacticity , productivity , molecular weights , and polymer microstructure are significantly dependent on the ligand substitution pattern and the metal atom in CpA complexes . the CpA I - derived poly(4-methyl-1-pentene-co-ethylene)s contained a significant amount of regioirregular arrangement of 4-methyl-1-pentene unit , but with no virtually consecutive 4-methyl-1-pentene sequence . In contrast , the [ e5:e1-(Me4C5) SiMe2NtBu]TiCl2 (IV)-derived copolymers revealed the small clustered sequence ( e.g. , EPPE ) but without any regioirregular arrangement of 4-methyl-1-pentene units . the copolymers prepared with [e5:e1-(Flu)SiMe2NtBu] Cl2Ti ( VI ) not only showed quite different microstructure from that based on catalysts I and IV but also manifested the more pronounced tendency to form an alternating distribution of monomers in the polymer chains . furthermore , the VI - derived copolymer contained neither a regioregular insertion of comonomer nor the consecutive 4-methyl-1-pentene sequences . 
A structural analysis of the oriented γ form of isotactic polypropylene ( iPP ) is presented . the x-ray diffraction intensity distribution in the oriented γ form is quantitatively evaluated for the first time . the structural analysis is performed on a new , poorly stereoregular ( [mmmm] = <nUm> % ) polypropylene material , prepared with a novel C2 - symmetric zirconocene based catalytic system , showing elastomeric properties . the sample , initially amorphous , partially crystallizes upon aging . In the oriented crystalline materials , obtained by stretching the aged sample , the crystallites tend to assume a preferred orientation with the chain axes parallel to the draw direction . disorder is present in the structure . for low draw ratios ( less than twice the initial length ) disordered crystalline modifications , very close to the γ form of iPP , are obtained ; increasing the draw ratio , crystalline modifications , closer to the α form of iPP , are observed . the structural disorder occurring in our stretched samples originates from the random succession of bilayers of chains with chains parallel ( like in the α form ) or tilted ≈ <nUm> ° each other ( like in the γ form ) . the results of this analysis are the follows . for the sample stretched at a low draw ratio , ≈ <nUm> % of the bilayers of chains are faced each other like in the γ form so that the fraction of bilayers with chain axes pointing preferentially along the draw direction is on the order of 60-65 % ( the remaining 35-40 % , being oriented with the chain axes tilted ≈ <nUm> ° to the draw direction ) . for the samples stretched at higher draw ratios , the fraction of bilayers facing each other like in the γ form is reduced to 20-30 % , so that only 10-15 % of the bilayers results oriented with the chain axes nearly normal to the draw direction . this is as if , in all cases , the regions of the crystals with chains arranged like in the α form tend to be oriented with the chain axes parallel to the stretching direction rather than tilted ≈ <nUm> ° . A continuum of disordered modifications intermediate between the pure γ and α forms could exist . the possible inclusion in the crystalline domains of stereo defects ( mainly of the kind mrrm ) , which would favor the γ , - like packing situations on the local scale , is discussed . 
A metallocene / MAO - based solid olefin polymerization catalyst has been developed using chemically functionalized nanoparticles ( carboxylate-alumoxanes ) as well - defined substrate . reaction of p-hydroxybenzoate-alumoxane ( p-HB-A ) nanoparticles , formed from the acid with boehmite , with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) results in a solid nanoparticle - based MAO ( n-MAO ) , which in combination with zirconocenes [ including Cp2ZrCl2 , Cp2ZrMe2 , and (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 ] produces an active solid catalyst for olefin polymerization . the catalytic activity of the n-MAO - based catalyst is comparable to the homogeneous analogue and a traditional silica - supported catalyst under identical reaction conditions and with the same Al(MAO) : Zr ratio . the n-MAO approach offers the potential of the MAO being easily chemically modified . 
In order to gain further insight into dicarbollide - catalyzed ethylene-norbornene polymerization , the behavior of the (e5-C2B9H11)- Zr(NRt2)2(NHEt2) - TIBA catalyst was studied and preliminary compared with that of Me2Si(3-tBuCp)(adamantylamido)- Cl2Zr / MAO ( 2 ) and (e5-C5Me5)- Cl3Zr - MAO ( 3 ) . several ethylene-norbornene copolymerizations were carried out over a wide range of monomer compositions . the resulting polymer products were analyzed by 13C NMR spectroscopy to gain information about the copolymer microstructure . 
rac-[Methylene(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 activated by MAO , employed as catalyst in the ethylene-styrene copolymerization , shows a peculiar behavior . actually , it produces block copolymers , whereas the homogeneous catalytic systems known to copolymerize these monomers preferentially give rise to alternating sequences of ethylene and styrene . the polystyrene blocks are isotactic and show crystallinity , also when their average length is as short as <nUm> units . some evidence suggests the primary styrene insertion into the metal-carbon bond of the growing chain : this unusual regiochemistry could account for the observed tendency to give homosequences . 
polyethylene and isotactic polypropylene having 1,2- or 1,3-disubstituted cyclopentane structures were prepared by copolymerization of ethylene or propylene with cyclopentene ( CPE ) or 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) using zirconocene catalysts . effect of the cyclopentane structures on the melting point and crystalline structure of the copolymers was investigated . In the case of ethylene-based copolymers , polyethylene containing 1,3-disubstituted cyclopentane structure , poly(ethylene-co-HD) , showed a lower degree of melting - point depression and decreasing crystallinity with increasing cyclopentane contents than polyethylene containing 1,2-disubstituted cyclopentane structure , poly(ethylene-co-CPE) . expansion of crystalline unit cell , especially along the a-axis , with increasing cyclopentane content was observed in the wide - angle x-ray diffraction patterns of the poly(ethylene-co-HD) . the phenomenon indicated incorporation of 1,3-disubstituted cyclopentane structure in the crystalline phase of polyethylene . on the other hand , both poly(propylene-co-CPE) and poly(propylene-co-HD) showed similar profiles in the relationship between the comonomer content and the melting point or the crystallinity of the copolymers . 
lowest energy ligand - to - metal charge - transfer ( LMCT ) transitions of racemic siloxy-substituted ethylene-bridged bis(indenyl) - type zirconocenes reacted with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) were studied using UV / vis spectroscopy in combination with the ab initio hartree - fock method . the LMCT absorptions were recorded at various [Al] / [Zr] ratios , representing dichloride , methylated , and cationic forms of the zirconocenes . the experimental LMCT absorption energies of each intermediate were compared to the calculated energies of the indenyl ligand - based HOMO and the zirconium - based LUMO . the lowest energy LMCT absorptions were directly proportional to the calculated LUMO - HOMO energy gaps . furthermore , the LMCT absorption energies were demonstrated to correlate with ethylene polymerization activity of the siloxy-substituted complexes . this correlation was clarified by a frontier orbital analysis , suggesting that decreasing absorption energy is related to the feasibility of the activation of the catalyst . 
density functional ( DFT ) calculations were carried out on the B3LYP level of theory on bridged and unbridged cationic zirconocene complexes to clarify why unbridged [Zr(Cp)2(Me)(thf)][BPh4] is not active in the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) , whereas [Zr{(Cp)2CMe2}(Me)(thf)][BPh4] polymerizes MMA readily , as we showed experimentally . it is shown , that the initial step of the polymerization - the transfer of the metallocene bound methyl group to the first MMA molecule-is endothermic for [Zr(Cp)2(Me)(MMA)]+ but exothermic for [Zr{(Cp)2CMe2}(Me)(MMA)]+ . furthermore - and more important - the activation energy is higher for the reaction of the unbridged compound compared to the activation energy of the bridged compound . from these results and an estimation of the rate constants it follows that in the temperature range investigated experimentally ( <nUm> to + <nUm> ° C ) either the endothermic product is not formed at all and / or the reversed reaction to the reactant is much faster than the reaction with the next MMA molecule . these results are confirmed by the inclusion of solvent effects by the CPCM solvation model ( also known as COSMO ) . alternative reaction paths for both cations were also investigated and found to be energetically much less favorable . 
an investigation of the ethylene polymerization with meso ansa metallocenes of group <nUm> allows clarifying some aspects of the branching formation observed in the polyethylene produced with these catalysts . the meso structure of the zirconocene precursor is more effective in promoting the chain growing isomerization when indenyl ligands bear no substituents . but the same coordinating neighborhood when surrounding the Ti(IV) or Hf(IV) ion gives rise to complexes not effective in the ethyl-branched polyethylene synthesis . on the other hand , several activators in combination with meso-ethylenebis(1-indenyl)Zr(CH3)2 produce catalysts able to polymerize ethylene to ethyl-branched polyethylene . No difference has been detected in the amount of branches with respect to that observed with MAO - activated meso-ethylenebis(1-indenyl)ZrCl2 . 
stereoregular PPs having a hydroxyl group at the side chain were easily synthesized . the method employed is the stereospecific propene polymerization by zirconocene dichlorides-[Ph <nUm> C][B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] combined with ODIBA , in place of usual trialkylaluminum , followed by quenching with O <nUm> . 
ethene homopolymerization and copolymerization in toluene solution with varying amounts of 1-hexene were catalyzed by the methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) activated zirconocene catalysts (1,2,4-Me3-Cp)2ZrCl2 and (Me5Cp)2ZrCl2 and a mixture of these two in a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio . the dual site catalyst ( <nUm> : <nUm> mixture ) has a homo- and copolymerization activity intermediate between the individual catalysts . deviations from the expected average behaviour taking into account the ca. 6-fold higher <nUm> h yield of (1,2,4-Me3Cp)2 Cl2Zr are observed . the dual site system results in a copolymer with ca. <nUm> % too low comonomer incorporation . the melting endotherm attributed to (Me5Cp)2ZrCl2 is found to be ca. 30-70 % too high , and the observed molecular weights for the copolymers are higher than expected and even higher than for the two individual catalysts . chain transfer to trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) is found to become less important at high comonomer concentrations concurrent with an increase of the concentration of vinyl and trans-vinylene unsaturations . further , it is noteworthy that with the dual site system it is possible to produce ethene / 1-hexene copolymers with narrow molecular weight distribution as a mixture of chains containing low and high comonomer contents . the observed discrepancies in the mixed system from the average of the (1,2,4-Me3Cp)2ZrCl2 and (Me5Cp)2ZrCl2 catalysts are provisionally explained by chain transfer between the sites coupled with an activity increase of the latter of these sites . 
the copolymerizations of propylene with allyl monomers carrying alcohol or amine were conducted by the rac-dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride / methylaluminoxane catalyst system . the allyl monomers were pretreated by alkylaluminum before the polymerization . although the efficiency of the introduction of allyl alcohol - based comonomer was extraordinary low ( <nUm> - <nUm> mol % in polymer ) , the trimethylaluminum - treated allylamine was found to be introduced more effectively ( <nUm> mol % in polymer ) . the 13C NMR study indicated that the position of allylamine unit in the copolymer was influenced by the kind of alkylaluminum used at the polymerization . In the presence of trimethylaluminum , the terminally aminated polypropylene was obtained ( [ amino end polymer ] / [ whole polymer ] = <nUm> ) . In the presence of triisobutylaluminum , however , the allylamine unit is located both on the main chain and at the chain end . the end - aminated polymer was probably obtained due to the formation of dormant species after the insertion of the comonomer followed by the chain transfer to alkylaluminum . 
vinyl chloride monomer ( VCM ) has been employed as a chain transfer agent to yield polyolefins with one vinyl end group per chain ; subsequent incorporation of these macromonomers has resulted in the formation of branched polyolefins . the use of VCM as a comonomer in transition - metal - catalyzed olefin polymerizations results in b-chloride elimination , yielding polymers that contain vinyl end groups and a chlorinated catalyst . through reactivation of the catalyst by advantageous MAO , or other aluminum alkyl , reinitiation of the olefin polymerization can occur ; the combination of elimination and reactivation allows for VCM to behave as a chain transfer agent . the use of VCM as a chain transfer agent results in the exclusive formation of vinyl end groups ( no vinylidene or internal vinyl end groups ) in polyethylenes , both homopolyethylene and copolymers with octene ; in propylene polymerizations , vinyl end groups are formed in addition to vinylidene end groups , the result of b-hydride elimination which occurs even in the absence of VCM . the chain transfer constants for VCM in ethylene polymerizations for a variety of single site catalysts were determined and found to be very similar , with Cs × <nUm> ∼ <nUm> ; for a propylene polymerization using a zirconocene catalyst , Cs × <nUm> ∼ <nUm> . it was further observed that the resulting macromonomers formed in the polyethylene polymerizations could be incorporated into the growing polymer chains , resulting in the formation of long chain branches . 
the cationic zirconocene trihydrides [ Cp'4Zr2H (m-H)2]+X- , generated from [Cp'2ZrH2]2 with various trityl salts of weakly coordinating anions , are powerful initiators for the polymerization of isobutene ( IB ) and its copolymerization with isoprene ( IP ) ( cp' = C5H4SiMe3 ) . this study is concerned with the quantification of the effects of the counteranion and of trace moisture on IB / IP copolymers and the nature of the initiating species . polymer molecular weights increase with decreasing anion nucleophilicity in the order x = [B(C6F5)4] ≈ [H2N{B(C6F5)3}2] > [CN{B(C6F5)3}2] . using [Cp'4Zr2H3]- [CN{B(C6F5)3}2]- , high copolymer molecular weights are found ( mw ≈ <nUm> × <nUm> g / mol at <nUm> ° C ) . there is little reduction in either rate or molecular weight on addition of isoprene . polymer molecular weights are substantially higher than with the Et2AlCl / BuCl initiator system under identical conditions . water was shown to be an important chain - transfer agent ; substoichiometric quantities of water reduced activity , and copolymer molecular weights decreased linearly with increasing [H2O] . mechanistic studies suggest that [ Cp'4Zr2H- (m-H)2]+ does not itself act as a cationic initiator but is transformed into one or more other binuclear ( polynuclear ? ) species , accompanied by alkene insertion into the Zr-H bond and a monomer hydrogenation step . tentative structures for these reactive intermediates are suggested . 
highly syndiotactic propene polymerization in the presence of Cs - symmetric metallocene cations is much less obvious that it may appear based on asymmetry considerations alone . effectively preventing the generation of m stereodefects requires the assistance of a counterion able to slow site epimerization more than monomer insertion , but also seconding chain - migratory insertion . 
isotactic poly-1,2-(4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene) ( poly(1,2-4-MPD) ) was synthesized by a homogeneous titanium catalyst . the polymer was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy , fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ) , x-ray diffraction , and thermal analysis . the polymerization of 4-MPD was performed by C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the results show that homogeneous titanium catalyst promotes the isospecific polymerization of 4-MPD with a high degree of stereocontrol . 
copolymerizations of ethylene with 1,3-butadiene in the presence of catalytic systems based on some C2 - symmetric zirconocenes ( rac-[CH2(3-R-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 where r = -C(CH3)3 ( 1 ) , -CH(CH3)2 ( 2 ) , -CH2CH3 ( 3 ) , -CH3 ( 4 ) , and -H ( 5 ) ) are compared . the chemical nature and the relative amount of constitutional comonomer units from butadiene are strongly affected by the bulkiness of the substituent in positions <nUm> and 3' . DFT calculations indicate that the observed dependence of constitutional units from butadiene on the bulkiness of the alkyl ligand substituent can be easily rationalized by the occurrence of an unusual insertion mechanism for butadiene . this mechanism , involving butadiene if primary coordination followed by its primary vinyl insertion , becomes largely predominant for catalytic systems based on the zirconocenes ( 1-4 ) , which present r ≥ CH3 . this kind of butadiene insertion mechanism is also able to account for the high stereoregularity which is observed for adjacent methylene-1,2-cyclopropane units . 
poly(propylene-ran-1,3-butadiene) that contained selectively inserted 1,4-butadiene units was successfully synthesized by ind-1 activated with MAOs . the average amounts of 1,4-BD per polymer chain and thus the average length of propylene units between 1,4-BDs of the copolymer could be controlled by the butadiene concentration in the feed . the copolymers with high molecular weight were converted to a,o-divinyl isotactic PP by ethenolysis . 
the synthesis of a vinyl-terminated , hyperbranched polysilane and the additional hydroboration with bis(pentafluorophenyl) borohydride are reported . quantitative transformation was proved by 1H NMR and FT-IR analysis . the polymeric borane was tested as cocatalyst in the metallocene - catalyzed polymerization of propylene . the corresponding catalyst system comprising rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1- e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconocene dichloride and the polymeric borane was activated in situ in the presence of triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) . polymerizations were performed at temperatures of <nUm> and <nUm> ° C with a propylene concentration of <nUm> mol / L in toluene solution using various cocatalyst : catalyst ratios ( <nUm> : <nUm> , <nUm> : <nUm> , and <nUm> : <nUm> ) . this polymer - supported catalyst system produces polypropylenes with excellent activities and good molecular weights . these results were compared with an additional set of polymerization experiments using molecular dispersed BC18F15 as cocatalyst , resulting in significantly reduced polymerization activities . this indicates a hindered catalyst mobility inside the hyperbranched cocatalyst matrix , leading to a higher concentration of active species within the hyperbranched nanostructure . 
substituted half - titanocenes bearing coordinative ether and ester moiety in their side chains , m5:m1-C5H 4(CH2CH2OMe)TiCl3 ( 5b ) , m5-C5H4(CH2CH2CH 2OMe)TiCl3 ( 5c ) , and m5:m1- C5H4(CH2COOMe)TiCl3 ( 5d ) , were prepared , and then their catalytic performances for the stereospecific living polymerization of 1,3-butadiene in the presence of the methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) were investigated . the introduction of intramolecular coordination between central titanium and the ether or ester moiety ( 5b,d ) caused acceleration of polymer propagation rate and enhancement of cis-specificity . the catalyst 5d / MAO showed <nUm> times larger propagation rate constant than that of the parent nonsubstituted m5-C5H5TiCl3 ( 5f ) / MAO catalyst . the 5b / MAO catalyzed 1,3-butadiene polymerization gave high cis-polybutadiene ( <nUm> % cis content ) with narrow molecular weight dispersity ( 1.14 ) . the single - crystal x-ray crystallographic analysis of 5d and reaction pathway are also discussed . 
addition of aluminum or zinc alkyls ( AIRs or ZnR2 , r = me or et ) lowers the molar masses of norbornene - ethene ( N / e ) copolymers obtained with the catalyst systems Me2C(Ind)(Cp)ZrCl2 / MAO or rac-C 2H4(2-tBuMe2SiO-Ind) 2ZrCl2 / MAO to different degrees . these chain - shortening effects and changes in relative end - group abundance indicate the degree to which e / N copolymers growing at a Zr catalyst center are transferred to Al or Zn centers by alkyl-polymeryl exchange . increased molar masses of copolymers obtained in the presence of added Al(iBu)3 indicate that this reagent suppresses polymer chain exchange between Zr catalyst centers and methylaluminum species contained in the MAO activator . these observations are interpreted in terms of reversible adduct formation between Al or Zn alkyls and cationic zirconocene alkyl species . 
mechanistic studies of isospecific polymerization of methacrylates by a cationic , chiral ansa - zirconocene ester enolate complex , rac - (EBI)Zr +(THF)[OC(O iPr ) = CMe 2][MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) 3]- [ <nUm> ; EBI = C 2H 4-(Ind)2 ] , are reported . complex <nUm> effects isospecific and living (co)polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) and re-butyl methacrylate ( BMA ) , producing highly isotactic homopolymers and block copolymers with narrow molecular weight distributions and high initiator efficiencies . investigations of statistical copolymerizations of MMA and BMA have yielded monomer reactivity ratios of τ MMA = <nUm> and τ BMA = <nUm> ( the kelen - tudos method ) , indicating that the copolymer formed instantaneously has a somewhat alternating character . studies of MMA polymerization kinetics have shown that propagation is first order in both concentrations of the monomer and the active species . the single MMA addition product , rac - (EBI)ZrMe[OC(OMe) = C(Me)CH 2C(Me <nUm> ) C(O iPr)-O ] ( 3 ) , has been isolated from the reaction between the neutral roc - (EBI)ZrMe[OC(O iPr ) - C(Me) <nUm> ] ( 2 ) and MMA ; however , subsequent MMA additions do not proceed , unless the single addition product is further treated with B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> to generate the eight - membered - ring cyclic ester enolate species , rac - (EBI)Zr +[OC(OMe) = C(Me)CH 2C(Me 2)C(O iPr)-O][MeB-(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - ( 4 ) , which corresponds to the structure of the intermediate for the single MMA addition product of <nUm> . all results presented here are consistent with the conclusion that isospecific polymerization of methacrylates by 1-which models the proposed isospecific propagating species for the methacrylate polymerization by chiral ansa - zirconocene complexes-is enantiomorphic site controlled and proceeds in a monometallic , intramolecular michael addition mechanism . 
A new method to prepare polypropylene-graft-polystyrene copolymers with tailored structure has been developed . the ability of a series of copolymers with variable structure to compatibilize the polypropylene-polystyrene blends was evaluated through microscopic observation of the morphology of the blends . the synthesis is a two - step process , the first one being the preparation , in the presence of ansa - zirconocene - based catalyst , of the backbones formed by i-PP sequences spaced by p-methylstyreneethylene units . In the second step , the methyl groups in the aromatic rings are reacted with sec-butyllithium , and the resulting metalated polymers allowed to add the styrene to initiate the side polystyrene chains growth . this synthesis turns out versatile both in the first step because by changing monomers feed ratio , backbones with different number of the sites of growth of the grafts and with different length of the polypropylene sequences can be obtained , and in the last step because , by tuning styrene concentration and reaction time , the side chains length can be regulated . the PP-g-PS copolymers with PP sequences varying in the range of 24-98 units , with number of the side chains from <nUm> to <nUm> and with PS side chains length from <nUm> × <nUm> to <nUm> × <nUm> units , were obtained and afterward tested as compatibilizers in the PP / PS blends . the morphologies of the blends , analyzed and compared by scanning electron microscopy , suggest that the compatibility of PP / PS blends is improved with increasing either the PP sequences length or the PS side chains length or the number of the side chains in the PP-g-PS copolymer . 
A number of novel C1 - symmetric metallocenes based on substituted fluorenyl and indenyl ligands , [ dimethylsilyl(2,7-di-tert-butyl-9-e5-fluorenyl)(1-e 5-indenyl)]zirconium dichloride ( 3 ) , [ dimethylsilyl(1,1,4,4,7,7,10,10-octamethyl-1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10-octahydrodibenzo[b , h]-9-e5-fluorenyl)(1-e5-indenyl)]zirconium dichloride ( 5 ) , and [ dimethylsily(1,1,4,4,7,7,10,10-octamethyl-1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10-octahydrodibenzo[b , h]-9-e5-fluorenyl)(2-methyl-1- η 5-indenyl)]zirconium dichloride , and the analogue complexes with a Ph2Si bridge ( <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> ) have been synthesized and used for alternating ethene / propene copolymerizations and compared to the unsubstituted complexes <nUm> and <nUm> . with growing sterical demand of the substituents , the activities of the catalysts at moderate temperatures decrease strongly , but a very high - temperature stability is achieved . usage of catalyst species with a Ph2Si instead of a Me2Si bridge leads to higher activities and molar masses . the percentages of alternating triads are high for all catalysts and are decreasing with growing polymerization temperature . surprisingly , the catalysts with the bulky substitution at the fluorene ring ( 5-8 ) yield at <nUm> and <nUm> ° C copolymers with a lower alternating part than at <nUm> ° C . 
homogeneous tandem catalysis involving a highly selective , aluminoxane - activated bis(2-decylthioethyl)amine-CrCl3 complex for the synthesis of 1-hexene in tandem with a number of metallocene catalysts is discussed . analysis by means of DSC , CRYSTAF , HT - GPC , 13C NMR , and FTIR suggests that copolymers of 1-hexene and ethylene are produced with significant selectivity toward 1-hexene as comonomer . the selectivity of 1-hexene incorporation by the metallocene catalysts follows the trend in the order [Me2Si(2-Me-Ind)2]ZrCl2 > [ me 2Si(2,3,4,5-Me-Cp)(t-Bu-N)]TiCl2 > cp 2ZrCl2 . the highly selective nature of the ethylene trimerization catalyst employed in this study means that the industrial application of tandem catalysis is becoming increasingly viable since it approaches conventional 1-hexene LLDPE in terms of polymer microstructure control . 
n-Propylsulfonic acid - functionalized porous and nonporous silica materials are evaluated in the ring - opening polymerization of e-caprolactone . all catalysts allow for the controlled polymerization of the monomer , producing polymers with controlled molecular weights and narrow polydispersities . polymerization rates are low , with site - time yields generally 1-3 orders of magnitude lower than metal - based systems . the catalysts are easily recovered from the polymerization solution after use and are shown to contain significant residual adsorbed polymer . solvent extraction techniques are useful for removing most of the polymer , although the extracted solids are not effective catalysts in recycle experiments under the conditions used here . these new materials represent a green alternative to traditional metal - based catalysts , as they are recoverable and leave no metal residues in the polymer . 
the coordination acrylamide polymerization by the cationic , chiral ansa - zirconocene ester enolate complex was discussed . the features of the polymerization include the high degree of control over polymerization stereochemistry and polymer molecular weight distribution . Poly(N,N- dimethylacrylamide ) ( PDMMA ) with unprecedented isotacticity , high m n , low polydispersity index ( PDI ) and T m as high as <nUm> ° C is synthesized . the efforts are underway to synthesize other types of stereoregular polyacrylamides using this technique . 
A comparative analysis of the structure and mechanical properties of two elastomeric amorphous and semicrystalline polypropylenes samples , produced with c2v-symmetric and chiral C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocene catalysts , respectively , is presented . the poorly isotactic polypropylene ( iam-PP ) of medium molecular weight , prepared with the chiral C 2-symmetric catalyst , slowly crystallizes , by aging at room temperature or by stretching , in a continuum of disordered modifications intermediate between α and γ forms of isotactic polypropylene . structural and morphological transformations occur during stretching . disordered α / γ modifications , containing a high fraction of perpendicular chains , present in the unoriented film , transform by stretching at high deformations into structures more similar to the α form with a high content of parallel chains . the development of the small level of crystallinity induces elastic properties . the small crystalline domains in the amorphous matrix , indeed , act as physical knots of the elastomeric lattice . this poorly isotactic iam-PP sample shows , instead , poor elastic properties and viscous flow at high deformations in the amorphous state , before crystallization , because of the not high molecular weight . the unique crystallization mode of the iam-PP sample explains the remarkable enhancement of elastic properties in low stereoregular polypropylene upon development of crystallinity . the fully amorphous high molecular weight atactic polypropylene ( a-PP ) , prepared with the c2v-symmetric catalyst , presents elastic behavior only in a small deformation range ( up to <nUm> % strain ) and experiences viscous flow of the chains at high deformations . the elasticity arises from the physical network generated by the high degree of entanglement of the polymeric chains generated by the high molecular weight of the sample . the poorly isotactic iam-PP sample , before crystallization , presents much poorer elastic properties than the a-PP sample because of the lower molecular weight . after crystallization , it shows better elastic properties in a large range of deformation with higher strength , notwithstanding the lower molecular weight , due to the presence of crystallinity . 
polymerization of 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) by the nonbridged half - titanocene complex is discussed . the remarkable difference in the selectivity of repeated 1,2-insertion is also discussed . dynamic mechanical analysis ( DMA ) are explored to observe differences in both the microstructure and the thermal properties for resultant polymers . it is shown that half - titanocene complex favored repeated <nUm> insertion rather than cyclization , affording a polymer with an olefinic double bond in the side chain . 
unbridged zirconocene catalysts , where a seven- or eight - membered ring fused to a cyclopentadiene is associated with a phenyl substituent in position <nUm> ( C7Ph-Zr and C8Ph-Zr ) , were tested , under the same polymerization conditions , to produce polypropenes with microstructure , molecular properties , and thermal behavior similar to those prepared with (IndPh)2ZrCl2 ( w-Zr ) , the " classical " waymouth catalyst . different results were obtained from the homologue titanium catalysts ( C7Ph-Ti and C8Ph-Ti ) and from the titanium benzyl derivative ( C7Bn-Ti ) , which produced quite heterogeneous materials with broad molecular weight and that can be separated into fractions spanning from completely atactic to fractions characterized by the presence of long isotactic blocks . A quite interesting behavior is observed with the zirconium benzyl derivative C7Bn-Zr , which produces good yields of a polymer with narrow polydispersity , which , despite its rather high isotacticity , shows a hardly detectable melting peak and is completely ether soluble . quite surprisingly , the same sample , after prolonged annealing , shows a narrow melting peak at low temperature ( 55-65 ° C ) . this result , together with the x-ray analysis , is in favor of a quite homogeneous material , capable of giving crystallites of small size . 
we describe here the implementation of methylene-bridged binuclear " constrained geometry catalyst " ( m-CH 2-3,3' ) { ( η 5-indenyl)[1-Me 2Si( tBuN)](ZrMe <nUm> ) } <nUm> ( Cl-Zr <nUm> ) to produce high-M w branched polyethylene . In ethylene homopolymerization , ∼ 70x increases in molecular weight are achieved with ( C1-Zr <nUm> ) vs ( m-CH 2CH 2-3,3'){(e 5-indenyl)[1-Me 2Si( tBuN)](ZrMe <nUm> ) } <nUm> ( C2-Zr <nUm> ) under identical polymerization conditions using ( ph 3C + ) 2[1,4-(C 6F <nUm> ) 3BC 6F 4B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] 2- ( B <nUm> ) as the cocatalyst for both . with MAO as the cocatalyst , ∼ 600x increases in polyethylene molecular weight are achieved with ( m-CH 2CH 2-3,3'){(e 5- indenyl)[1-Me 2Si( tBuN)](ZrCl <nUm> ) } <nUm> ( C2-Zr 2Cl <nUm> ) and ( m-CH 2-3,3' ) { ( η 5-indenyl)[1-Me 2Si( tBuN)](ZrCl <nUm> ) } <nUm> ( C1-Zr 2Cl <nUm> ) vs mononuclear [ 1-Me 2Si(3-ethylindenyl)( tBuN)]ZrCl <nUm> ( Zr 1Cl <nUm> ) . In the ethylene + 1-hexene copolymerization , C1-Zr <nUm> enchains 3x more 1-hexene than does C2-Zr <nUm> under identical polymerization conditions ( B <nUm> as cocatalyst ) . with MAO as the cocatalyst , C2-Zr 2Cl <nUm> enchains 3.5x more , and C1-Zr 2Cl <nUm> 4.2x more , 1-hexene than does Zr 1Cl <nUm> . when the polar solvent C 6H 5Cl is used as the polymerization medium , dramatic compression in the dispersion of polymerization activities and molecular weights is found . both homopolymerization and copolymerization results argue that achievable Zr-Zr spatial proximity significantly influences chain transfer rates and selectivity for comonomer enchainment and that such proximity effects are highly cocatalyst and solvent sensitive . 
the mechanism and scope of the isospecific , coordinative - anionic polymerization of acrylamides , including N,N-dimethylacrylamide ( DMAA ) , N,N-dimethylmethacrylamide ( DMMA ) , and n-isopropylacrylamide ( IPAA ) , using chiral ansa - zirconocenium ester and amide enolates , are reported . the zirconocenium ester enolate , rac - (EBI)Zr +(THF)[OC(O iPr ) = CMe 2][MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - [ <nUm> ; EBI = C 2H 4(Ind) <nUm> ] , effects highly isospecific and living polymerization of DMAA via a monometallic , intramolecular coordinative - conjugate - addition mechanism , with the resting intermediate during a " catalytic " propagation cycle being the cyclic amide enolate . the results leading to these key conclusions were derived from investigations of polymerization kinetics , polymer microstructures and chain - end groups , and block copolymerization behavior as well as modeling and isolation of the active propagating species . specifically regarding the active species modeling , isolation , and characterization , neutral chiral amide enolate rac(EBI)ZrMe[OC(NMe <nUm> ) = CMe <nUm> ] ( 2 ) has been synthesized and structurally characterized and its corresponding cationic complex rac - (EBI)Zr +(THF)[OC(NMe <nUm> ) = C(Me) 2][MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> - ( 3 ) isolated ; cation <nUm> is highly active for DMAA polymerization , serving as a structural model for the active propagating species . both ester and amide enolates <nUm> and <nUm> are inactive for polymerizations of DMMA and IPAA ; however , <nUm> equiv of IPAA or DMMA is readily added to <nUm> or <nUm> , forming the eight - membered - ring cyclic amide enolates mc - (EBI)Zr +[OC(NH iPr ) = CHCH 2C(Me 2)C(O iPr ) = O][MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) 3]- ( 4 ) or rac - (EBI)Zr +[OC(NMe <nUm> ) = C(Me)CH 2C(Me 2)C(NMe <nUm> ) = O][MeB(CsF <nUm> ) 3]- ( 5 ) , which correspond to the structures of the first acrylamide addition products and the resting propagation intermediates . 
density functional calculations have been performed on different conformers and isomers of the propyl group in alkyl cations [L2Zr-Pr] - ( L = cp , cp* ; Pr = n-propyl ) , corresponding to two catalysts with different observed rate orders ( n ) for ethylene polymerization , to explore the single - center , two - state kinetic model for olefin polymerization . for L = cp ( n ≈ <nUm> ) , the b-agostic conformer is found to be the most stable structure and also the most reactive with respect to ethylene coordination , which is commensurate with unity rate order . for L = cp* ( n ≈ <nUm> ) , the favored propagation route involves the g- and a-agostic conformations of the alkyl complex , with coordination taking place to an a-agostic conformation in order to minimize the steric hindrance experienced by the incoming ethylene . the barriers to rearrangement from the a- and g-agostic conformers to the more stable b-agostic structure are significantly lower than those of propagation . moreover , no structure was found to be of lower energy than the b-agostic conformation , and the latter thus takes the role of the resting state for both catalysts in the present study . assuming that the single - center , two - state model applies to zirconocene - catalyzed ethylene polymerization , our calculations thus suggest that the corresponding fast and slow , or dormant , states do not originate from equilibria of the alkyl group as investigated here . 
the copolymerization of vinylcyclohexane ( VCH ) with ethylene using an original complex analyst of nonbridged half - titanocenes containing an aryloxo ligand was described . the observed catalytic activities based on the polymer yields decreased at higher VCH / ethylene molar ratios under lower ethylene pressure , whereas the VCH contents in the resultant copolymer increased under VCH / ethylene molar ratios . the glass transition temperature values increased upon increasing the VCH contents , suggesting that the resultant copolymers are amorphous . it was shown that both the cyclopentadienyl fragment and the anionic donor ligand directly affect the VCH incorporation . 
crystalline styrene-butadiene-styrene ( SBS ) triblock copolymers consisting of elastic cis-polybutadiene ( cis-PB ) chemically bonded with crystallizable syndiotactic polystyrene ( syn-PS ) were synthesized through a stereospecific sequential triblock copolymerization of S with B catalyzed by C 5Me5TiMe3 / BC6F5 <nUm> / trioctylaluminum ( al(oct)3 ) under controllable polymerization conditions . the first polymerization step was conducted at <nUm> ° C , yielding syn-PS with controllable molecular weight by changing the polymerization time . the second one was started with the addition of excess B to the progressing syn-PS polymerization at <nUm> ° C , yielding syn-PS / cis-PB diblock copolymer with high block efficiencies . the third one was conducted at <nUm> ° C just by removal of the unreacted B in order to enhance the reinsertion and propagation of the remained S , yielding crystalline SBS triblock copolymers with relatively high PS compositions . the livingness of the whole polymerization process was confirmed through a linear increase of the molecular weights of the polymer products obtained in each step against their polymer yields , while keeping the polydispersity values almost constant . the 13C NMR analysis of the copolymer product proves that the PS blocks were highly syndiotactic ( [rrrr] > <nUm> % ) , and the PB block was primarily cis-1,4 structure ( > <nUm> % ) . cross-fractionation chromatography ( CFC ) was used to evaluate the contamination of the dead polymers in the crystalline SBS . transmission electronic microscopy ( TEM ) was used to observe the phased separation morphology of the PS and PB blocks in the crystalline SBS . the existence of the syn-PS blocks in the crystalline SBS was further confirmed with the observation of a strong endothermic peak at <nUm> ° C in their differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) curves . preliminary results on the heat deformation stability as well as the chemical resistance property of this new material have also been evaluated in comparison with those of the corresponding anionic SBS materials . 
A protocol is described in which zirconocene - catalyzed alkene polymerization reactions are terminated by bromine to give polymers containing brominated end groups , Br - polymeryl . using NMR spectroscopy , the Br - polymeryl groups can be identified as primary or secondary , thus providing information concerning the nature of the Zr - polymeryl linkage ( s ) , and ( via integrations ) quantified , thus giving information about the relative concentration ( s ) of the Zr - polymeryl linkage ( s ) . the procedure can in principle give very useful information concerning the nature and concentrations of Zr - polymeryl groups in existence during polymerization processes and is tested through ethylene polymerization by the Cp2ZrMe2 / B(C6F 5)3 catalyst system and propylene polymerization by the Cp2ZrMe2 / BC18F15 , (indenyl)2 - ZrMe2 / BC6F5 <nUm> , and rac-{C2H4(1-indenyl)2} ZrMe2 / BC18F15 catalyst systems . to this point the resulting data concerning Zr - polymeryl concentrations are generally consistent with data in the literature but are rather more easily obtained . 
unlike the living polymerization of methacrylates and acrylamides by the monometallic propagating , chiral ansa - zirconocenium ester enolate rac - (EBI)Zr +(THF)[OC(O iPr ) = CMe 2][MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - [ <nUm> ; EBI = C 2H 4(Ind) <nUm> ] , the polymerization of acrylates such as n-butyl acrylate ( n-BA ) by <nUm> proceeds in an uncontrolled fashion to only moderate monomer conversions , producing poly(n-BA) with three types of chain structures - one major linear and two minor cyclic b-ketoester - terminated poly(n-BA) chains . the combined polymerization , chain structure , and model reaction studies have shown the presence of substantial chain termination processes in this system that prevent it from achieving high monomer conversions and producing only the living linear chain structure . the proposed overall three - step mechanism , involving isomerization of the cyclic reactive intermediate , backbiting cyclization to eliminate an alcohol , and chain termination by the alcohol , explains the catalyst deactivation pathways as well as the resulting polymer chain structures . chain transfer reactions involving acidic a-protons are insignificant as compared to backbiting cyclizations involving the activated antepenultimate ester group of the growing polymer chain , which is the chief catalyst deactivation pathway for the current monometallic catalyst system . 
the cp 2TiCl - catalyzed SET reduction of aliphatic , a,b-conjugated , and aromatic aldehydes generates reactive a-titanoxy radicals which add readily to styrene and initiate a radical polymerization . the linear dependence of molecular weight on conversion in conjunction with the relatively narrow molecular weight distributions and linear kinetics support the living character of the process which is mediated by the reversible termination of the growing chains with cp 2TiCl . investigations of the reaction variables reveal a living polymerization in all cases , but with progressively narrower molecular weight distributions ( m w / m n ∼ <nUm> ) and larger initiator efficiencies ( <nUm> - <nUm> ) with increasing the cp 2TiCl <nUm> / aldehyde , aldehyde / styrene , and Zn / cp 2TiCl 2ratios at 70-90 ° C for a wide variety of aldehyde structures . aldehydes are thus introduced as a new class of initiators for living radical polymerizations and may also provide novel avenues for the synthesis of block and graft copolymers . 
polymerization of 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) by Cp*TiCl2(OAr) ( <nUm> , Ar = 2,6-Pr2C6H3 ) , [ Me2Si(C 5Me4)(N'-Bu)]TiCl2 ( 2 ) , [ me 2Si(Ind)2]ZrCl2 ( 3 ) , and cp 2ZrCl2 ( 4 ) was explored in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . both <nUm> and <nUm> exhibited the remarkable catalytic activities , and the resultant poly(HD)s were insoluble and possessed a sole glass transition temperature . on the basis of the DSC thermograms , 13C CPMAS spectra , and the dynamic mechanical analysis ( DMA ) results , it turned out that <nUm> favored repeated 1,2-insertion rather than cyclization , affording a polymer - containing olefinic double bond ( butenyl group ) in the side chain with uniform distribution , whereas the polymerization by metallocenes ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) favored cyclization . linked half - titanocene <nUm> showed lower catalytic activities with favored repeated insertion , affording high molecular weight poly(HD)s which possessed internal olefinic double bonds . ( BuC5H 4)TiCl2(OAr) ( 5 ) exhibited lower catalytic activities and favored the repeated insertion ; the cp* - ketimide analogue , Cp*TiCl2(N = CBu2 ) ( 6 ) , also favored the repeated insertion , but the degree of the subsequent cross-linking was significantly higher than that by <nUm> . both cross-linking and cyclization occurred in the polymerization by CpTiCl2(N = CBu2 ) ( 7 ) , and the distribution was not uniform . these results strongly suggest that nature of both cyclopentadienyl and anionic ancillary donor ligands directly affects selectivity for the repeated insertion as well as the microstructure in the resultant poly(HD)s . 
the ethylene / styrene copolymerization by Cp*TiCl2(N = C tBu2 ) ( cp* = C5Me5 , <nUm> ) -methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) catalyst proceeded in a living manner , and the living nature maintained under various conditions ( Al / Ti molar ratios , ethylene pressure , styrene concentrations , temperature ) . poly(ethylene-co-styrene)s were obtained exclusively in the polymerization using <nUm> , Cp*TiX 2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) [ x = Cl ( 3 ) , me(5) ] -MAO , and 5-[PhN(H)Me2][B(C6F 5)4 ] catalysts under the same conditions , and both the styrene incorporation and the microstructures were highly influenced by the anionic donor ligand employed . the resultant polymers prepared by Cp*TiX3 [ x = Cl ( 4 ) , me ( 6 ) ] -MAO catalysts were a mixture of polyethylene and syndiotactic polystyrene ( SPS ) , whereas the resultant polymer did not contain SPS in the polymerization by <nUm> - [PhN(H)Me2][B(C 6F5)4 ] catalyst . these facts clearly indicate that the anionic donor ligand strongly affects the styrene incorporation and the polymerization behavior and that catalytically active species for the syndiospecific styrene polymerization and the copolymerization are apparently different . 
A kinetic model based on the coordination - insertion mechanism was developed to characterize metallocene - catalyzed propylene polymerization using two different catalyst systems : rac - Et(Ind) 2ZrCl <nUm> / MAO ( I / MAO ) and rac-Et(4,7-Me 2-1-Ind ) 2ZrCl <nUm> / MAO ( II / MAO ) . slurry propylene polymerizations were performed in a semibatch reactor at <nUm> ° C to investigate the effects of propylene partial pressure and MAO / Zr ratio . the kinetic model accounts for the formation of regioirregularities , the occurrence of chain transfer to trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) , and b-hydride chain transfer to both monomer and metal to predict the effects of propylene partial pressure and the MAO concentration on polymer molecular weight and the formation of isobutyl end groups . A systematic optimization strategy was applied to estimate the kinetic parameters from on - line measurements of the reaction rate and end - of - batch measurements of the molecular weights and percentages of end groups . the formation of <nUm> , 1-insertions was more frequent for catalyst II / MAO ( k s = <nUm> L mol <nUm> s <nUm> vs k s = <nUm> L mol <nUm> s <nUm> for I / MAO ) . the m w of polymer produced with I / MAO decreased at low pressures due to the high rate of monomolecular b-hydride transfer to the metal ( k H = <nUm> s <nUm> ) . chain transfer to TMA was more significant with the catalyst II / MAO ( k Al = <nUm> × <nUm> + <nUm> L mol <nUm> s <nUm> vs k Al = <nUm> × <nUm> + <nUm> L mol <nUm> s <nUm> for I / MAO ) . 
the living cationic polymerization of a novel bicyclic conjugated diene monomer , tetrahydroindene ( THI ) ( bicyclo[4.3.0]-2,9-nonadiene ) , was achieved using the Cl4Sn - based initiating system , in which the lewis acid works as an activator for the dormant C-Cl terminal originating from the hydrogen chloride adduct of the 2-chloroethyl vinyl ether as an initiator ( 1 ) in the presence of a nucleophilic additive such as ethyl acetate . the number - average molecular weights of the obtained polymers increased in direct proportion to the monomer conversion , and the MWDs were narrow throughout the reactions ( mw / Mn ∼ <nUm> ) . the well - defined terminal structure of the obtained poly(THI) was confirmed by the 1H NMR and MALDI - TOF MS analysis , which shows the presence of the initiator moiety at the α end and the chlorine at the ω end . the living cationic block copolymerization of isobutyl vinyl ether ( IBVE ) followed by THI led to the di- and triblock copolymers consisting of the hard nonpolar THI and soft polar IBVE segments for possible application of the triblock copolymer as a thermoplastic elastomer . 
the ring - opening metathesis polymerization ( ROMP ) of functional norbornenes , i.e. , exo,endo-5-norbornene-2-carbonitrile ( 3 ) , methyl ( exo,endo-5-norbornene-2-carboxylate ) ( 4 ) , norborn-5-ene-2-yl acetate ( 5 ) , 2-propyl exo,endo-5-norbornene-2-carboxylate ( 6 ) , norborn-5-ene-2-carboxylic acid ( 7 ) , exo,endo-5-norbornene-2-methanol ( 8 ) , exo,endo-5-norbornene-2-ylmethyl bromide ( 9 ) , exo,endo-5-norbornene-2-ylmethylamine ( 10 ) , exo,endo-5-norbornene- 2-triethoxysilane ( 11 ) , dimethyl exo,endo-5-norbornene-2-yl phosphonate ( 12 ) , exo,endo-5-norbornene-2-ylcarboxyethyl-3-ethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ( 13 ) , exo,endo-5-norbornene-2-ylcarboxyethyl- 3-ethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ( 14 ) , 7-oxanorborn-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride ( 15 ) , was performed in a variety of pure ionic liquids ( ILs ) in the absence of any cosolvent . both imidazolium , i.e. , [1-butyl-3-methylIM] +X- and [1-butyl-2,3-dimethylIM]+X- ( IM+ = imidazolium , X- = PF6- , CF3SO3- , ( CF3O2S ) 2N- , CF3COO- , NO3 - , BF4- , br- ) , and phosphonium - based ILs , i.e. , [ P+(C6H13)3(C 14H29)]X- ( X- = F6P - , BF4- , cl- ) , were used . In this context , the principal compatibility of an IL with a series of ruthenium - based catalysts , i.e. RuCl2Py2(IMesH2)(CHPh) ( 1 ) and RuCl2(IMesH2)(2-(2-PrO-C6H4) ( 2 ) ( py = pyridine , IMesH2 = 1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-4,5- dihydroimidazolin-2-ylidene ) was shown . the influence of temperature , concentration of both the initiator and the monomer and nature of the IL on ROMP was investigated . ROMP of norbornene derivatives in ionic solvents proceeded with high speed and offered access to high molecular weight polymers ( m w up to <nUm> <nUm> <nUm> g / mol ) in high yields . most important , ILs allowed for the synthesis of polymers from monomers that are hardly polymerizable in organic solvents , e.g. of <nUm> . the use of <nUm> in [1-methyl-3-butylIM] +PF6- as the reaction medium along with 2-(2-propoxy)styrene allowed for the recycling of the ruthenium catalyst . the interaction of catalyst <nUm> with different ILs , which allowed for an explanation of the influence of the IL 's nature upon the polymerization process , was investigated by IR- and UV - vis spectroscopy . these investigations will facilitate the choice of the optimum IL in future investigations . 
the realization of insertion polymerization of cyclobutene derivatives by using the circumventing pericyclic reactions are discussed . the unwanted pericyclic ring - opening of cyclobutene to the more stable butadiene is considered to provide limited advancement and the approach is to eliminate the pericyclic ring opening reaction . titanium complexes , based on bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium catalyze the ring opening metathesis polymerization of norbornene . gel permeation chromatography showed a trimodal polymer distribution of relatively low molecular weight . the source of the olefin peak in the NMR samples was investigated , which shows that the olefin formation occurs through b-hydride elimination . thermogravimetric analysis revealed that both poly-1 and poly-2 have thermal stability close to <nUm> ° C even with a low molecular weight . glass transition temperature were found to be lower than that of addition polymer of norbornene . 
this work studies the mechanism and application of the novel diastereospecific ion - pairing polymerization ( DIPP ) effected by a catalyst system comprising chiral zirconocene bis(ester enolate ) rac-(EBI)-Zr[OC(O iPr ) = CMe <nUm> ] <nUm> [ <nUm> , EBI = C 2H 4(Ind) <nUm> ] and <nUm> equiv of lewis acid A1(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> . the <nUm> / 2Al(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> system effectively promotes DIPP of functionalized alkenes such as methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) , producing polymers having various stereoregularities , including isotactic , syndiotactic , and isotactic-e-syndiotactic multiblock microstructures , depending on the [monomer] / [catalyst] ratio employed . our detailed investigations into the polymerization characteristics and kinetics , elementary reactions , characterization and behavior of the isolated key intermediates , as well as temperature and lewis acid effects have yielded a mechanism for the DIPP of MMA by the l / 2Al(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> system . this mechanism consists of four manifolds - isospecific , syndiospecific , anion - monomer exchange , and chain - transfer domains - and satisfactorily explains the formation of various polymer stereomicrostructures under given conditions . the most significant part of this overall mechanism is for the production of the isotactic-b-syndiotactic stereomultiblock structure , which is made possible by two pathways that can interconvert diastereospecific propagating manifolds : exchange between the coordinated anion and monomer as well as chain transfer . this unique polymerization technique has also been applied to the copolymerization of MMA with methacrylates having longer alkyl chains , leading to functionalized polymeric materials with tunable properties that are controlled by their stereomicrostructures and nature of the comonomer . 
the first example of the use of epoxides in radical grafting copolymerizations was exemplified by the grafting of poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) , poly(butyl methacrylate ) ( PBMA ) , poly(butyl acrylate ) ( PBA ) , and poly(styrene) ( PSt ) from poly(glycidyl methacrylate ) ( PGMA ) and from copolymers of GMA with MMA and st as well as by the iterative synthesis of mixed arm graft copolymers such as (PGMA-g-PMMA)-g-PSt and ((PGMA-g-PMMA)-g-PSt)-g-PBMA with a wide range of molecular weights and compositions . the grafting was demonstrated by a combination of gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) , NMR , and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) investigations . the polymerization is initiated by the Cp2TiCl - catalyzed radical ring opening of the epoxide group of GMA and is optionally controlled by Br2Cu / bipyridyl . this methodology does not require any epoxide protection / deprotection steps and provides the typical advantages of radical polymerizations and convenient access to complex macromolecular architectures . 
copolymerization of ethylene ( e ) with 2-methyl-1 -pentene ( 2M1P ) took place with rather efficient 2M1P incorporation by using the Cp*TiCl 2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) (1)-MAO catalyst system , whereas the 2M1P incorporations by the Cp2ZrCl <nUm> , [ Me2Si(C5Me4)(N tBu)]TiCl2 , Cp'TiCl2(N = C tBu2 ) [ cp' = cp ( 3 ) , cp* ( 4 ) ] , and Cp*TiCl3 - MAO catalyst systems were negligible under the same conditions . the effects of substituents in both the cyclopentadienyl and the aryloxide ligands toward the catalytic activities and the 2M1P incorporations were explored , and use of both cp* and 2,6-diisopropylphenoxy ligands was found to be important to obtain poly-(ethylene-co-2M1P)s with rather efficient and uniform 2M1P incorporations as well as with notable catalytic activities . No distinct differences in the 2M1P incorporations were seen in the copolymerization by <nUm> in the presence of various cocatalysts [ methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , methylisobutylaluminoxanes ( MMAOs ) , borates ] , and the nature of ligands directly affects the 2M1P incorporation . copolymerizations of ethylene with 7-methyl-1,6-octadiene ( MOD ) by 1,3,4-MAO catalyst systems proceeded at remarkable rates with efficient exclusive incorporation of monoolefins ( without incorporating trisubstituted olefin ) , affording high molecular weight unsaturated poly(ethylene-co-MOD)s with high MOD contents . the MOD contents in the resultant copolymers in the ethylene / MOD copolymerization by 1,3,4-MAO catalyst systems were thus closely related to those in the ethylene / 1-octene copolymerizations under similar conditions . 
homopolymerization and block copolymerization of n-butyl acrylate ( nBA ) was catalyzed by titanium complex / BC18F15 system to produce syndiotactic and high molecular weight polymers with relatively narrow molecular weight distributions . full conversion of monomers obtained in the temperature range of <nUm> to <nUm> ° C shows that polymer yield decreases significantly at <nUm> ° C and the resulting P(nBA) exhibits unimodal molecular distribution with narrow PDI values . the NMR spectra of P(nBA) shows a syndiotactic - enriched microstructure at lower stereoselectivity than that achieved for polymethyl methacrylate ( PMMA ) under same conditions . diblock copolymerization of MMA and nBA shows a high degree of control at <nUm> and <nUm> ° C and forms a narrow polydispersity and an average molecular weight and monomer composition . 
A series of novel polymers have been obtained by the condensation polymerization of different dibromoarenes with different primary aromatic diamines via palladium - catalyzed aryl amination reaction . the structures of polymers are characterized by means of FT-IR , 1H NMR spectroscopy , and elemental analysis ; the results show an agreement with the proposed structure . DSC and TG measurements show that polymers possess high glass transition temperature ( tg > <nUm> ° C ) and good thermal stability with high decomposition temperatures ( TD > <nUm> ° C ) . thesis novel polymers also exhibit good mechanical behavior and good solubility . 
we present the synthesis , characterization , x-ray molecular structure , and catalytic activity of a [(HOEt)Ti(m-OEt)OEt(Cl)2]2 ( 1 ) dimeric complex . complex <nUm> was found to undergo , in solution , a succession of fluxional processes involving the rotation of the ligands , rapid exchange between the anionic ethoxide ligands , and exchange of the hydroxylic hydrogen . the complex , when activated by methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , undergoes an abstraction of the ligands through a heterobimetallic intermediate with ethoxide bridges between the aluminum and titanium atoms . we propose that this intermediate is the active species in the polymerization of a-olefins . the complex displays unexpectedly a single site behavior in contradiction to other titanium alkoxide complexes . the resulting polymers were found to show elastomeric properties with intermediate tacticities . 
the calculations based on the density functional theory ( DFT ) to investigate the experimental differences observed in the molecular weights of the polymers obtained using different zirconocene catalysts have been performed . geometric structures and gibbs free energy profiles were obtained using the B3LYP hybrid DFT functional and LANL2DZ basis set for all atoms . all calculations were performed using the gaussian03 package , while thermodynamic data were calculated for <nUm> bar ethylene pressure and <nUm> K using standard statistical thermodynamic methods implemented in the gaussian package . it was observed that the silyl-bridged bis-indenyl catalysts containing linear alkyl substituents in the 3-position of the indenyl ligand yield polyethylenes with different molecular weights depending on the alkyl chain length . the corresponding product presents a metallacycle structure and the polymer chain ejected from the catalyst . 
the use of photoinitiated polymerization is continuously growing in industry as reflected by the large number of applications in not only conventional areas such as coatings , inks , and adhesives but also high - tech domains , optoelectronics , laser imaging , stereolithography , and nanotechnology . In this perspective , the latest developments in photoinitiating systems for free radical and cationic polymerizations are presented . the potential use of photochemical methods for step - growth polymerization is also highlighted . the goal is , furthermore , to show approaches to overcome problems associated with the efficiency , wavelength flexibility , and environmental and safety issues in all photoinitiating systems for different modes of activation . much progress has been made in the past <nUm> years in the preparation of complex and nano-structured macromolecules by using photoinitiated polymerizations . thus , the new and emerging applications of photoinitiated polymerizations in the field of biomaterials , surface modification , preparation of block and graft copolymers , and nanocomposites have been addressed . 
four metal - based photoinitiating systems ( benzene-tricarbonylchromium(0) , ArC3CrO3 , cyclopentadienylmolybdenum tricarbonyl dimer , cp 2Mo2(CO)6 , diiron nonacarbonyl , Fe 2(CO)9 , and bis(cyclopentadienylruthenium dicarbonyl ) , Cp2Ru2(CO)4 ) are investigated by laser flash photolysis ( LFP ) and ESR - spin trapping ( ESR-ST ) experiments and checked as photoinitiators for both free radical promoted cationic photopolymerization ( FRPCP ) and free radical photopolymerization ( FRP ) . new combinations with silanes instead of alkyl halides improve both the polymerization rates and the final conversions upon irradiation with UV / visible or visible light and laser diodes ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> nm ) under air . the enhancement of the photopolymerization reaction under air in the presence of the selected compounds is ascribed to the reuse of the inherently present hydroperoxides through a set of reactions leading to additional initiating species . these systems are particularly attractive for FRPCP with excellent polymerization rates and final conversions . 
an approach for the cationic ring - opening polymerization of epoxy monomers using a system based on ru(bpy)32+ and a very convenient green fluorescence bulb irradiation device was proposed . the EPOX films ( <nUm> mm thick ) deposited on a BaF2 pellet were irradiated under air inside the IR spectrometer cavity . the stability of the prepared formulations was excellent when the two silanes , tris(trimethylsilyl) silane ( TTMSS ) , diphenylsilane ( DPS ) , were used as additives for the cationic photo - polymerization . ESR - spin trapping ( ST ) experiments were carried out using x-band spectrometer and the radicals were produced under a xenon lamp exposure and trapped by phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone ( PBN ) . A good to excellent polymerization was observed when a green bulb irradiation and the Ru / TTMSS / diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate ( Ph2I+ ) three - component photoinitiating system was used . 
zirconium salicylaldiminates in the presence of AliBu <nUm> / [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] are inactive for the homopolymerization of p-tert-butylstyrene ( TBS ) , but the addition of hexene leads to a highly active system . analysis of the polymers by NMR and MALDI indicates surprisingly that most of the product chains contain no hexene , while some contain a single hexene unit . addition of dihydrogen also leads to the production of poly(TBS) without substantial reduction in molecular weight and with main - chain end - group unsaturation . these and other observations lead us to two related mechanisms for the hexene- and dihydrogen - promoted reactions . synthetic and catalytic studies indicate that the active species is not a typical bis(salicylaldiminato) compound but an amido / alkoxido system . an authentic compound of this class is highly active for the TBS polymerization even in the absence of added aluminum alkyl . 
A series of well - defined functional polyethylene graft copolymers with high molecular weights have been conveniently synthesized via the combination of ethylene / 5-norbornene-2-methyl propargyl ether ( NMPE ) copolymerization using bis(b-enaminoketonato)titanium catalysts and following click coupling reaction . bis(b-enaminoketonato)titanium catalysts have been proved to be the potent catalysts for ethylene / NMPE copolymerization , producing high molecular weight copolymers with unimodal molecular weight distributions . 13C NMR ( dept ) and 1H NMR spectra reveal the copolymerization proceeds in a regioselective way with alkynyl group retained near the main chain . the following click coupling reactions between ethylene / NMPE copolymer and azido-terminated polymer ( PEO-N3 , PS-N3 ) have been achieved under mild conditions independent of the chemical structure and molecular weight of azido-terminated polymer , providing functional polyethylene with well - defined structure and high molecular weight . 
the polymerization of 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) and its copolymerization with styrene and ethylene by a series of half - sandwich scandium dialkyl complexes bearing various auxiliary ligands have been examined . significant ligand influence on the catalytic activity and selectivity has been observed . the THF - free aminobenzyl scandium complex with a sterically demanding ligand , such as (C5Me4SiMe3)Sc(CH2C 6H4NMe2-o)2 ( 4e ) , in combination with an equivalent of [Ph3C][B(C6F5) <nUm> ] , serves as an excellent catalyst for the cyclocopolymerization of HD with styrene to afford a new family of polymer materials containing methylene-1,3-cyclopentane ( MCP ) units , vinyltetramethylene ( VTM ) units , and unique syndiotactic styrene - styrene sequences . by use of this catalyst , the terpolymerization of HD , styrene , and ethylene has also be achieved for the first time to afford novel cyclopolymer materials containing the five - member ring MCP units , ethylene-ethylene blocks , and syndiotactic styrene - styrene sequences . the composition of the copolymers can be controlled in a wide range simply by changing the comonomer feeding ratios . most of the resulting copolymers show high melting points originating from the syndiotactic polystyrene blocks and polyethylene blocks well as in the case of the terpolymers . 
the silyl radical chemistry is used here for the free radical promoted cationic polymerization ( FRPCP ) of epoxy monomers ( (3,4-epoxycyclohexane)methyl 3,4-epoxycyclohexylcarboxylate EPOX and limonene dioxide LDO ) and the free radical photopolymerization FRP of an acrylate monomer ( trimethylolpropane triacrylate TMPTA ) . the new three - component photoinitiating systems are based on violanthrone derivatives , diphenyl iodonium salt and a silane . the use of very soft irradiations ( household fluorescent and LED bulbs , sunlight and xenon lamp as visible light sources ) is described . excellent polymerization profiles are obtained . addition of ruthenium tris(bipyridine) still enhances the performance . A sunlight irradiation of <nUm> min leads to a conversion ∼ <nUm> % of EPOX . the specific role of the silyl radicals generated in this system is investigated and discussed . comparative assessments with existing initiating systems are also provided evidencing the very high efficiency of the new proposed approach . 
A titanocene derivative ( bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) dichloride cp 2TiCl <nUm> ) , for visible light induced polymerization of cationic resins working through a free radical promoted process is presented . this new photoinitiating system is based on the cp 2TiCl <nUm> free radical initiator , a silane ( tris(trimethylsilyl)silane : TTMSS ) , and an onium salt ( diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate : ph 2I + ) and appears suitable under long wavelength irradiation ( λ > <nUm> nm ) . the polymerization reaction is highly efficient in aerated conditions ( almost <nUm> % conversion ) and dramatically better than in laminate . the system works under exposure to a Xe lamp , a diode laser or a household LED bulb . the mechanisms are investigated by ESR experiments . the specific role of the generated free radicals is highlighted . 
b-Diketiminato and 1-aza-1,3-butadienyl-imido complexes [ MCl 3{TbtNC(Me)CHC(Me)NMes}(thf) n ] ( 1a , 1b , 1c ) and [ M( = NTbt)Cl 2{C(Me)CHC(Me)NMes}Li(tmeda) ] ( 3a , 3b , 3c ) ( m = Ti , Zr , Hf ) bearing an extremely bulky substituent , tbt group ( tbt = 2,4,6-[(Me 3Si ) 2CH ] 3C 6H <nUm> ) showed high activities for ethylene polymerization and ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization ( up to <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> g of polymer*mol m <nUm> h <nUm> ) . complexes 1a , 1b , 3a , 3b , and 3c could produce ultrahigh molecular weight ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers ( m w > <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> ) that were hardly soluble in o-dichlorobenzene under the molecular weight measurement conditions . 
photoinduced copper (I) - catalyzed huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition ( CuAAC ) via photoinduced electron transfer using free radical photoinitiators has been developed as a new platform to serve as orthogonal click system . photoinitiators acting at near UV and visible range , namely <nUm> , 2-dimethoxy-2-phenyl acetophenone , 2-benzyl-2-dimethylamino-4'-morpholino butyrophenone , 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)diphenylphosphine oxide , dicyclopentadienyl bis[2,6-difluoro-3-(1-pyrrolyl)phenyl] titanium ) and camphorquinone / benzyl alcohol were tested with copper (II) chloride / N,N,N',N'',N''- pentamethyldiethylenetriamine complex to catalyze the CuAAC via photoinduced electron transfer reaction . this strategy has been applied in construction of various macromolecular architectures including telechelic polymers and block copolymers . spectroscopic and chromatographic investigations revealed that successful macromolecular syntheses have been achieved by this technique . 
the discovery of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) was the start for investigations and innovations of new classes of highly active olefin polymerization catalysts . different transition metal complexes together with MAO as cocatalyst allow the synthesis of polymers with a highly defined microstructure , tacticity , and stereoregularity as well as new cycloolefin , long chain branched , or blocky copolymers with excellent properties . these new polyolefins could not be obtaind with such a purity before by ziegler - natta catalysts . the single site catalyst character of metallocene and other transition metal complexes activated by MAO leads to a better understanding of the mechanism of the olefin polymerization . 
13C NMR spectroscopy is used to characterize the microstructure of polypropylene ( PP ) obtained using a nickel a-keto-b-diimine initiator activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) at different reaction temperatures ( T rxn ) . the product prepared at <nUm> ° C has structural features that resemble an ethylene-propylene copolymer . we find that the main sequences present in this sample arise as a result of normal 1,2-insertion and that propylene sequences are predominantly isotactic ( m = <nUm> % , mmmm = <nUm> % ) . there is also evidence of ethylene-like sequences as a result of 3,1-enchainment , and from 2,1-insertion . A reduction in T rxn to <nUm> ° C results in a polymer that has undetectable regioirregularities and is highly isotactic ( m = <nUm> % , mmmm = <nUm> % ) . moreover , the application of stereo propagation models gives indication that the isospecificity is a result of enantiomorphic site control . 
different polyaromatic structures ( truxene derivatives and tris(aza)pentacene ) are presented as new metal - free organic photocatalysts ( OPC ) to promote free radical polymerization FRP and ring - opening polymerization ( ROP ) under halogen lamp , household LED bulb , and laser diode ( <nUm> nm ) . these CsOP exhibit interesting light absorption properties and lead , through an oxidative catalytic cycle , to the formation of radicals and ions that can initiate both free radical polymerization FRP and ring - opening polymerization ROP . interestingly , excellent polymerization profiles are obtained even upon visible light exposure . using these very soft irradiation conditions , acrylate / epoxide blends are also easily polymerized under air and lead to the formation of interpenetrated polymer networks IPN exhibiting no phase separation . 
we report a method for the synthesis of multisegmented polycarbonate graft copolymers . using a b-diiminate zinc catalyst with a norbornene carboxylate initiator , we achieved living block copolymerizations of functionalized cyclohexene oxides and CO <nUm> , yielding norbornenyl-terminated macromonomers with variable block sequences . subsequent ring - opening metathesis polymerization of the norbornenyl-terminated macromonomers produced segmented graft copolymers . this method provides a facile route to core - shell structures with readily controllable molecular parameters . 
photoinduced electron transfer reactions of highly conjugated thiophene derivatives , 4,7-di(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)benzo[1,2,5] thiadiazole ( DTDT ) and 5,8-bis(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)-2,3- di(thiophen-2-yl)quinoxaline ( DTDQ ) , with diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate ( ph 2I +PF <nUm> - ) and triphenylsulfonium hexafluorophosphate ( ph 3S +PF <nUm> - ) were investigated by laser flash photolysis , fluorescence and phosphorescence spectroscopy , and polymerization studies . high fluorescence quantum yields , long fluorescence lifetimes ( ∼ <nUm> ns in aprotic solvents ) , and absence of detectable phosphorescence at <nUm> K for both compounds indicate inefficient intersystem crossing into the triplet state and dominant role of singlet excited state . photolysis of DTDT or DTDQ in the presence of iodonium salt with visible light results in the formation of radical cations of DTDT and DTDQ as detected by laser flash photolysis . sulfonium salts do not undergo such electron transfer reactions due to the unfavorable redox potentials . the importance of the described photoinduced electron transfer process with respect to the initiation of cationic polymerization and formation of conjugated polymers was demonstrated . 
we report a combined , experimental and theoretical , study of styrene polymerization to clarify the regio- and stereocontrol mechanism operating with a C 6F 5-substituted bis(phenoxyimine) titanium dichloride complex . styrene homopolymerization , styrene - propene and styrene-ethene-propene copolymerizations have been carried out to this aim . A combination of 13C NMR analysis of the chain - end groups and of the microstructure of the homopolymers and copolymers reveals that styrene polymerization is highly regioselective and occurs prevalently through 2,1-monomer insertion . DFT calculations evidenced that steric interaction between the growing chain and the monomer in the transition state insertion stage is at the origin of this selectivity . the formation of isotactic polystyrene with a chain - end like microstructure is rationalized on the base of a mechanism similar to that proposed for the syndiospecific propene polymerization catalyzed by bis(phenoxyimine) titanium dichloride complexes . finally , a general stereocontrol mechanism operative in olefin polymerization with this class of complexes is proposed . 
trifunctional photoinitiators ( tPIs ) based on benzophenone , anthracene , and pyrene chromophores linked to a triazine moiety are proposed as new initiating systems . In combination with an iodonium salt and a silane , these structures are able to initiate the radical polymerization RP of acrylates and the cationic polymerization CP of epoxides and vinylethers under Xe-Hg lamp , LED and very soft irradiation ( i.e. , halogen lamp ) . upon addition of an amine , these new photoinitiators were also able to start the radical polymerization of acrylates . excellent RP and CP polymerization profiles are obtained i.e. better than those recorded using the reference compounds ( benzophenone , anthracence and pyrene ) . In CP , some of these compounds combined with thianthrenium salts can also be used . the mechanisms involved in the different multicomponent initiating systems were analyzed by ESR , fluorescence , steady state photolysis , and laser flash photolysis experiments . 
polyolefins , including polyethylene ( PE ) and polypropylene ( PP ) , represent more than half of commercial polymers produced in the world . they are known to be cost - effective and good performing materials used in a broad range of commodity applications that influence our everyday lives . on the other hand , less attention has been paid to their specialty applications , commonly requiring the material to have multiple performance functions . the limitations and shortcomings of polyolefins have stemmed from lack of functionality and structure diversity , which are compounded with the long - standing challenges in the chemical modification ( functionalization ) of polyolefins . In the past two decades , in conjunction with advances in metallocene catalysis , a new method based on the reactive polyolefin approach has emerged , which affords a new class of functional polyolefins with high molecular weight and well - controlled molecular structures that have functional groups located at chain ends , side chains , and block / graft segments . In addition to forming distinctive multiple phase morphology with shape hydrophobic-hydrophilic microphase separation and surface properties , some functional polyolefins with flexible polar ( or ionic ) groups offer excellent mobility for polarization , ion conductivity , etc . they present potentials for polyolefins in high - value , specialty applications . In this paper , I will cover three energy - related areas , including polymer film capacitors for electric energy storage , ion exchange membranes for hydrogen energy , and oil superabsorbent polymers for oil spill recovery , to discuss the effects of new polyolefin structures on their performances and the future perspectives . the objective is to provide examples that reveal underlying benefits of this new class of high - performance , cost - effective functional polyolefin materials and hopefully inspire more researchers to explore their applications . 
newly synthesized indanedione derivatives combined with an iodonium salt , n-vinylcarbazole , amine , phenacyl bromide , or 2,4,6-tris(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5- triazine have been used as photoinitiating systems upon very low visible light intensities : blue lights ( e.g. , household blue LED bulb at <nUm> nm ) or even a halogen lamp exposure . one of them ( ID2 ) is particularly efficient for cationic , radical and thiol - ene photopolymerizations as well as for the synthesis of interpenetrated polymer networks ( IPNs ) . it can be useful to overcome the oxygen inhibition . ID2 based photoinitiating systems can also be selected for the reduction of ag+ and the in situ formation of ag(0) nanoparticles in the synthesized polymers . the (photo)chemical mechanisms are studied by electron spin resonance spin trapping , fluorescence , cyclic voltammetry , laser flash photolysis , and steady state photolysis techniques . 
two push - pull dyes ( a julolidine derivative DCJTB and a fluorenone-co-amino phenyl derivative h-B3FL ) , incorporated in multicomponent photoinitiating systems have been investigated for the cationic polymerization of epoxides or the radical polymerization of acrylates under visible light irradiations ( household halogen lamp or green laser diode at <nUm> nm ) . the DCJTB / iodonium salt ( and optionally n-vinylcarbazole ) based systems are pretty efficient for the cationic polymerization of epoxides . both dyes , when combining with an amine and 2,4,6-tris(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5-triazine , exhibit a good efficiency in the radical polymerization of acrylates . the photochemical mechanisms are studied by steady state photolysis , fluorescence , cyclic voltammetry , laser flash photolysis , and electron spin resonance spin trapping techniques . 
this paper discusses the synthesis of a new family of well - controlled isotactic polypropylene ionomers ( iPP-NH <nUm> + Cl - ) containing up to <nUm> mol % of NH <nUm> + Cl - ionic groups , with high molecular weight and narrow molecular weight and composition distributions , as well as good processability in melt and solution . A systematic study was conducted using various isospecific ziegler - natta and metallocene catalysts in the copolymerization of propylene and a high a-olefin comonomer containing a silane - protected amino group and the subsequent work-up procedures that can prevent undesirable side reactions in forming iPP-NH <nUm> + Cl - ionomers in a one - pot process . the resulting copolymers were carefully monitored by polymer solubility and a combination of NMR , GPC - triple detectors , DSC , and mechanical property measurements . evidently , the most suitable reaction process requires a combination of the rac-Me <nUm> Si[2-Me-4-Ph(Ind)] <nUm> ClZr <nUm> metallocene catalyst system with a purified d-MAO ( TMA - free ) , 6-bis(trimethylsilyl)amino-1-hexene comonomer during the copolymerization reaction and a work-up procedure to directly interconvert the silane - protected amino groups ( -N(SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> ) into -NH <nUm> + Cl - ionic groups before exposing to air . the attempt of isolating both iPP - N(SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> and iPP-NH <nUm> intermediates resulted in the insoluble ( cross-linked ) products . on the other hand , the resulting iPP-NH <nUm> + Cl - ionomers were melt processed in air and showed a systematic increase of mechanical properties and high - temperature stability with the increase of NH <nUm> + Cl - content . 
A series of well - defined titanium - containing random , diblock , and triblock copolymers were prepared by ruthenium - catalyzed living radical polymerization of glycidyl methacrylate followed by amination of the epoxy group with diethanolamine and titanium complex loading , which was achieved by reacting the resulting triethanolamine pendent group with CpTiCl3 or CpTiCl <nUm> ( cp : cyclopentadienyl ; cp : pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ) . the titanium - containing unit obtained by this procedure possessed a discrete atrane structure , which contributed to the formation of soluble well - defined polymers without cross-linking via uncontrolled intermolecular multisite ligation to the titanium center . In addition , the cp* derivatives were highly stable to moisture . the same strategy was used successfully to construct well - defined titanium end - functionalized polymers , and an epoxy-functionalized initiator was used in the ruthenium - catalyzed living radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate , followed by postreactions with diethanolamine and CpTiCl <nUm> . the titanium - containing block copolymers were analyzed by electron energy loss spectroscopy , transmission electron microscopy , and transmission electron microtomography to directly observe titanium - containing phases in the microphase - separated block copolymers . 
half - titanocene (CpCH2CH2OCH3)TiCl <nUm> ( 1 ) , ( cp = cyclopentadienyl ) , activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , has been tested in the polymerization of styrene in a suitable range of temperatures , obtaining a new material consisting of syndiotactic - atactic stereoblocks of polystyrene . the monoanionic bidentate ancillary ligand of the titanium based catalyst , consisting of a cyclopentadienyl bearing an alkyl ether , is a hapto - flexible ligand because the ether group can either be coordinated or not to the metal , depending on reaction temperature . thus , the ether group can give rise to two possible catalytic sites : ( i ) syndiospecific , when the ether group is not coordinated to the metal center , and ( ii ) aspecific , when it is coordinated to titanium . consequently , it produces polymer chains having syndiotactic and atactic stereoblocks . In fact , in the range of temperature considered ( 0-19 ° C ) , syndiotactic polystyrene was produced at <nUm> ° C , atactic polystyrene at <nUm> and <nUm> ° C , and syndiotactic - atactic stereoblock polystyrene at <nUm> and <nUm> ° C . 
the rare - earth metal complexes bearing NSN - bidentate b- diimidosulfonate ligands (RNSNdipp)Ln(CH2SiMe 3)2(THF)n ( r = ph , ln = Lu ( 1a ) , n = <nUm> , Y ( 1b ) , n = <nUm> , Sc ( 1c ) , n = <nUm> ; r = PhNMe2 , ln = Lu ( 1d ) , n = <nUm> ) were synthesized by treatment of the ion - pairs [ Ln(CH2SiMe 3)2(THF)x][BPh4] with equimolar amount of the ligand lithium salts (RNSNdipp)Li(THF)2 ( NSNdipp = S(NC6H4iPr 2-2,6)2 ) . addition reaction between lutetium tris(alkyl)s , Ln(Z)3(THF)n and NSNdipp gave the corresponding dialkyl complexes (ZNSNdipp)Lu(Z)2(THF) n ( z = CH2SiMe3 , n = <nUm> ( 1e ) ; z = o-CH 2C6H4NMe2 , n = <nUm> ( 1f ) ) . deprotonation of b-imidophosphonamido ligands H-NPNdipp and H-NPNEt ( NPNdipp = Ph2P(NC6H 3iPr2-2,6)2 , NPNEt = PPh2(NC6H3iPr2-2,6) ( NC6H4-Et-2 ) ) with Lu(CH2SiMe3) 3(THF)2 yielded the corresponding dialkyl complexes (NPNdipp)Lu(CH2SiMe3)2(THF) ( 2 ) and (NPNEt)Lu(CH2SiMe3)2(THF) ( 3 ) . all the complexes had been structurally well - defined , and 1a , 1b , 1e , <nUm> , and <nUm> were further characterized by x-ray diffraction analysis where the almost planar NSN rare - earth metal unit is Cs ( or pseudo Cs ) symmetry with the two alkyl groups arranging on both sides and a coordinated THF against it . upon activation with [PhMe2NH][B(C6F5) <nUm> ] and AliBu3 , all these complexes exhibited high 3,4-regioselectivity ( ranging from <nUm> % to > <nUm> % ) for the polymerization of isoprene . moreover , the excellent isospecific selectivity up to mmmm > <nUm> % have been achieved with complexes <nUm> depending on the electronics of the sulfur substituents to give crystalline polyisoprene with the highest Tm ( <nUm> ° C ) reported to date . the NPN - bidentate b-imidophosphonamide ligated rare - earth metal complexes provide both high syndio- and iso- 3,4-selectivities ( <nUm> > <nUm> % , rr = <nUm> % , mmmm = <nUm> % ) depending on the frameworks , steric environment and geometry of the ligands . the regio- and stereo- selective mechanisms proceeded in these systems were explicated by DFT simulation . 
by use of two sequential coordination - insertion polymerizations , a series of ethylene-co-propylenebased comb polymers was synthesized . first , poly(ethylene-co-propylene) macromonomers featuring one unsaturated chain end were synthesized using a titanium bis(phenoxyimine) catalyst . the macromonomers were then homopolymerized using a living nickel a-diimine catalyst . the molecular weights and corresponding number of arms for each poly(macromonomer) were determined using size - exclusion chromatography with viscometry detection and universal calibration . viscosity - molecular weight conformation plots for the poly(macromonomer)s revealed compact solution structures . furthermore , viscometric radii for each poly(macromonomer) ( rv ) and corresponding linear macromonomer (Rv)a were determined and the ratio ( rv ) / (Rv)a for each pair was compared to those of a variety of polyisoprene - based star polymers with similar functionality . the comparison revealed that despite the obvious comb topology of the poly(macromonomer)s their dilute solution conformations correspond reasonably well to the bona fide polyisoprene stars . 
the effect of cyclopentadienyl ring substitution on the immobilization and activation of zirconocenes on supports of type Cl2Mg / AlR n(OEt)3-n has been investigated . comparison of the activity of immobilized zirconocenes (RCp)2ZrCl2 in ethylene polymerization , using simple aluminum alkyls such as AlEt3 or AliBu3 as a cocatalyst , revealed a remarkable effect of the substituent r in the cyclopentadienyl ring . low activity ( < <nUm> kg / mol bar h ) was obtained with r = H or et , but longer alkyl substituents , notably n-Pr or n-Bu , gave more than an order of magnitude increase in activity . zirconocenes with branched substituents ( i-Pr , t-Bu ) were less easily immobilized and gave relatively low activity , while the activities of zirconocenes of composition cp - (RCp)ZrCl2 ( r = n-Pr , n-Bu , n-pentyl ) were intermediate between those of Cp2ZrCl2 and (RCp)2ZrCl2 . experiments carried out under homogeneous conditions with aluminoxane cocatalysts indicated that the effect of cyclopentadienyl ring substitution can be related to differences in the ease of formation of the active species . an inverse relationship between activity and the catalyst loading on the support was found . At a low loading of <nUm> mmol (n-PrCp)2ZrCl2 / g support , an activity greater than <nUm> <nUm> kg / mol bar h was obtained in ethylene polymerization at <nUm> ° C , with AliBu3 as the cocatalyst . the results demonstrate that with certain Cl2Mg - immobilized zirconocenes it is possible to achieve very high polymerization activity without the use of methylaluminoxane or a borate activator , but the strong effect of catalyst loading on activity implies the presence of a relatively low number of active species . 
ethylene was polymerized on Cp2ZrCl2 activated by methylalumoxane ( MAO ) supported on boehmites modified with arylsulfonic acids . In comparison with unmodified boehmites , boehmites modified with arylsulfonic acids gave significantly higher MAO uptakes . Cp2ZrCl2 activated with arylsulfonic acid - modified boehmites / MAO gave notably higher catalyst activities compared with those of homogeneous Cp2ZrCl <nUm> / MAO and Cp2ZrCl2 activated with unmodified boehmite / MAO and O2Si / MAO . according to 13C CP - MAS NMR investigations of MAO supported on p-toluenesulfonic acid - modified boehmite , partial alkylation of p-toluenesulfonate by MAO accounted for the formation of methyl p-tolyl sulfone as an electron - donating catalyst modifier . polymer particle morphologies and size distributions were examined off - line by means of scanning electron microscopy , light scattering on dry powder dispersions , and CCD - mediated powder particle image analysis . the mechanism of polymer particle formation via deagglomeration of boehmite particles was elucidated by means of on - line monitoring using focused beam reflectance measurement . As evidenced by transmission electron microscopy , polyethylene particles contained uniformly dispersed boehmite crystallite aggregates with average diameters of <nUm> nm . 
A new semicrystalline polynorbornene was obtained by stereospecific polymerization with CrCl2(dppa) - MAO catalyst ( dppa = bis(diphenylphosphino)amine ) . NMR , x-ray diffraction , and modeling techniques were used , concentrating on the soluble lower molecular weight fractions , to characterize the polymer structure . the polymer presents a 2,3-exo- diheterotactic stereochemistry never observed before in the polymerization of alkenes . high symmetry , low energy chain conformations accounting for 13C NMR data are devised . efficient crystalline packing models consistent with powder x-ray diffraction patterns and density requirements are proposed . 
isotactic polypropylene and elastomeric stereoblock polypropylene nanocomposites containing <nUm> - <nUm> wt % multiwall carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs ) have been synthesized via the in situ polymerization approach using MAO - activated C2- and C1 - symmetry ansa - zirconocenes , a technique that has not been previously reported in literature . fracture morphology examination of the nanocomposites revealed very efficient distribution of the MWCNTs within the isotactic polypropylene matrix , yet interfacial adhesion level and the reinforcement efficiency were dependent on the nanotube loadings . the elastomeric stereoblock polypropylene / MWCNT and the isotactic polypropylene-based nanocomposites exhibited different morphologies depending on the synthesis peculiarities . for isotactic polypropylene , young 's modulus increased by ∼ <nUm> % even at <nUm> wt % MWCNT loading , and further modulus growth was observed at higher filler contents . relatively low permittivity values and considerable dielectric losses in microwave range infer that the obtained nanocomposites can find use as efficient electromagnetic shielding materials and microwave absorbing filters . outstanding improvement of thermal stability ( ∼ <nUm> ° C at maximum weight loss rate temperature ) has been achieved for isotactic polypropylene upon incorporating only <nUm> wt % of carbon nanotubes . 
the mechanism of stereoselectivity in methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) monometallic polymerization promoted by the C1 - symmetric ansa-Me 2C(Cp)(Ind)Zr - based zirconocene , presenting two diastereotopic coordination sites , was investigated within density functional theory . At variance from the case of propene polymerization , our results suggest that MMA addition is stereoselective when the growing chain is in the more hindered as well as in the more open diastereotopic coordination site . In both cases the same enantioface of the enolate bond of the ester enolate growing chain is selected , although selectivity is higher when the growing chain is in the more hindered diastereotopic coordination site . further , there is no substantial energy difference between these two situations , which indicates that the moderate isotacticity of the produced PMMA is consistent with an almost regular chain - migratory mechanism . the different stereoselectivity of the two diastereotopic sites is due to different steric interaction between the growing chain ( chain effect ) or MMA ( monomer effect ) with the indenyl ligand . this decomposition of stereoselectivity into chain and monomer effects is used to reinvestigate the stereoselectivity of strictly related C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocenes . 
A liquid crystalline phase has been discovered in a polyolefin of poly(methylene-1,3-cyclopentane) ( PMCP ) having low molecular weight , which was obtained with cyclization polymerization of 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) using a zirconocene catalyst in the presence of chain transfer reagents . PMCP clearly shows fluidity and birefringence above the glass transition temperature under the ambient conditions . schlieren - like texture , which indicates nematic liquid crystalline phase , has been detected in places . clear diffraction pattern is observed in wide - angle x-ray diffraction analysis below the isotropization temperature . the isotropization temperature decreases with decreasing of molecular weight of the PMCP . PMCP with the higher molecular weight takes the longer time for liquid crystallization from isotropic phase . Non-Newtonian viscosity region in the range of low share rate , which is a characteristic of liquid crystal , has been detected below the isotropization temperature . 
this contribution reports a combined experimental ( with kinetics and tangible effects on syndioselectivity ) and theoretical ( with density functional theory ) study of (CGC)M catalysts [ m = Ti , Zr ; CGC = Me2Si(e 5-Me4C5)(tBuN) ] , addressing a need for a fundamental understanding of the stereoselectivity observed for such catalysts in polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) and an explanation for the chain - end control nature of the syndioselective MMA polymerization by the chiral (CGC)Ti catalyst . the living / controlled MMA polymerization by (CGC)TiMe+MeB(C6F5)3- ( 1 ) follows the zero - order kinetics in [MMA] , implying a faster ring - opening process of the cyclic chelate relative to MMA addition within the catalyst - monomer complex in a unimetallic propagation cycle . the syndioselectivity of <nUm> is insensitive to monomer and catalyst concentrations as well as to ion - pairing strength varied with counterion structure and solvent polarity . comparative studies using identical (CGC)M bis(isopropyl ester enolate ) structures show that the (CGC)Ti system exhibits noticeably higher syndioselectivity than the isostructural Zr system at ambient temperature . density functional calculations rationalize the higher syndioselectivity observed for the (CGC)Ti catalyst and lend a theoretical support for the mechanism of MMA- or counterion - assisted catalyst site epimerization after a stereomistake , which accounts for the formation of the predominately isolated m stereoerrors . 
the copolymerization of ethylene and styrene at <nUm> ° C was investigated with a series of titanocenes : Cp'TiCl <nUm> L [ <nUm> , <nUm> : cp ' = cyclopentadienyl ( cp ) versus <nUm> , <nUm> : cp ' = { -(dimethylamino)ethyl }cyclopentadienyl ( cp N ) ; <nUm> , <nUm> : L = C1 versus <nUm> , <nUm> : L = 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-JV-oxyl ( TEMPO ) ] , in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . At <nUm> ° C , titanocenes bearing a pendant amine ligand ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) are effective catalysts for the ethylene-styrene ( ES ) copolymerization , whereas complexes lacking the pendant group ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) afford only mixtures of polyethylene ( PE ) and atactic polystyrene ( aPS ) . At these temperatures , copolymerization with complexes <nUm> and <nUm> yields mixtures of ES copolymers and atactic polystyrene that are not readily separated by solvent extraction or gel permeation chromatography as both components of the mixture exhibit similar molecular weights and solubility in THF and acetone . the source of the atactic polystyrene was the autopolymerization of styrene as deduced by carrying out the copolymerization in the presence of a catalytic chain transfer agent , cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin ( co(tpp) ) . the addition of co(tpp) caused a decrease in the molecular weight of the atactic polystyrene but had no effect on the molecular weight of the ES copolymer . 
we assayed the polymerization of 1-octene in toluene-d <nUm> polymerized by a pyridylamidohafnium catalyst precursor activated by the cocatalyst tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron . In situ small angle neutron scattering and 1H NMR spectroscopy were used together with time - resolved SEC to investigate the polymerization process . the catalyst system contains several polymerization active species . about <nUm> % of the active catalyst is of uniform activity . the resulting polymers show relatively narrow molecular weight distributions . the residual catalyst exhibits an increased activity , leading to the formation of notably higher molecular weights than is generated by the majority of available active centers . with the help of NMR and SEC results the small angle neutron scattering data could be interpreted quantitatively . good agreement was found between the expected scattering profile for nonaggregated chains and their measured counterparts . At no stage during the polymerization process could more than single polymer chains be detected . 
syndiotactic polystyrene samples end capped with bromine atoms in benzylic position have been synthesized by terminating the syndiospecific styrene polymerization catalyzed by Cp*TiBn3 / B(C6F 5)3 / Al - oct3 ( cp* '5 -C5(CH3)5 ; bn CH2Ph , oct ( CH 2)7CH3 ) with n-bromosuccinimide ( NBS ) and 2-bromo-2-phenylethylisocyanate ( BPEI ). the chemical structure of the different polymer end groups was assessed by mono and bidimensional NMR techniques.The evaluation of the relative concentrations of the end groups permitted to give new insights into the bromination reaction and syndiospeci ? c styrene polymerization mechanism . A specific bromination of the methine carbon of the growing polymer chain bound to the titanium catalyst was observed when NBS was used as terminating agent.The formation of Ti (III) hydrido complexes in the activation reaction was proved as well as the role of these species as active catalyst in syndiospecific styrene polymerization . 
this contribution reports the first successful coordination addition polymerization of N,N- dialkylmethacrylamides and the first example of kinetic resolution of a racemic methacrylamide by chiral metallocene catalysts . the polymerization of methacryloyl-2-methylaziridine ( MMAz ) by rac - (EBI)Zr - (THF)[OC(Oi Pr)dCMe2][MeB(C6F5)3] ( 1 ) is stereospecific and also exhibits a high degree of control over polymerization . this polymerization follows first - order kinetics in both concentrations of monomer and catalyst , consistent with a monometallic propagation mechanism involving the fast step of intramolecular conjugate addition within the catalyst monomer coordination complex leading to the eight - membered - ring resting intermediate . substituents on the highly strained aziridine ring stabilize the aziridine moiety against thermally induced cross-linking through its ring - opening reaction ; thus , the polymer derived from methacryloyl-tetramethyleneaziridine ( MTMAz ) exhibits greatly enhanced resistance toward thermal cross-linking over poly(MMAz) , marking <nUm> and <nUm> ° C higher onset cross-linking and maximum cross-linking temperatures , respectively . enantiomeric catalyst (S,S)-1 demonstrates experimentally and theoretically its ability to kinetically resolve the racemic MMAz monomer with a low stereoselectivity factor s of <nUm> . polymerizability of several methacrylamide monomers has been investigated via a combined experimental and theoretical ( DFT ) study that examines the degree of conjugation between the vinyl and carbonyl double bonds , relative polymerization reactivity , and relative energy for the formation of amide enolate intermediates . 
half - titanocenes (CpCH2CH22)TiCl2 ( 1 ) and (CpCH2CH2OCH3)TiCl3 ( 2 ) , ( cp cyclopentadienyl ) , activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , have been tested in the polymerization of styrene , p-methylstyrene , and p-chlorostyrene.Both catalysts produce syndiotactic polystyrene and poly-p-methylstyrene in the whole range of explored temperatures and concentrations.In the polymerization of p-chlorostyrene , however , catalyst <nUm> affords a syndiotactic polymer only at the low temperature and the high monomer concentrations ; and catalyst <nUm> gives only an atactic product.The results have been compared to those obtained in the presence of the catalytic system CpTiCl3 ( 3 ) / MAO and have been discussed considering the possible oxidation states of the titanium species and the geometries of the active sites . 
the copolymerization of ethylene with tert-butylethylene ( TBE , 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene ) using various half - titanocene [ cp' TiCl2X ( x = O-2,6-iPr2C6H <nUm> , N = CtBu2 ) ] - cocatalyst systems has been carried out . the aryloxo-containing half - titanocenes , Cp'TiCl 2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) ( cp' = cp* , tBuC5F4 , 1,2,4-Me3C5H2 ) , displayed the capability to bring about TBE incorporation in the presence of MAO as a cocatalyst , while their ketimide analogues , Cp'TiCl2(N = CtBu <nUm> ) ( cp' = cp , cp * , tBUC5H4 ) , could not accomplish TBE enchainment in ethylene / TBE copolymerization . among aryloxo derivatives , those carrying tert-butyl and trimethyl substituents on the cyclopentadienyl moiety , Cp'TiCl2(O-2,6- iPr2C6H3 ) ( cp' = tBuC5H4 , 1,2,4-Me3C 5H2 ) , exhibited efficient TBE incorporation and moderate catalytic activity in the presence of MAO , affording ethylene / TBE copolymers with relatively high molecular weight and uniform molecular weight distribution . however , the copolymerization conducted by employing constrained geometry catalyst ( linked half - titanocene ) , [ Me2Si(C5Me 4)(NtBu)]TiCl2 , and zirconocene [ cp 2ZrCl2]-MAO catalyst systems resulted in polyethylene without TBE incorporation . furthermore , the copolymerization of 1-hexene ( 1-Hex ) with TBE and vinyltrimethylsilane ( VTMS ) , by ( tBuC5F 4OTiC12(O-2,6-iPr2C 6H3 ) and CpTiCi2(N = CtBu <nUm> ) - MAO catalyst systems , indicated a considerably higher reactivity of VTMS . the 1-Hex / VTMS copolymerization has been elucidated to proceed via 1,2-insertion as manifested by the remarkably efficient VTMS enchainment , hence revealing the difference in the reactivity of TBE and VTMS to arise from that in their electronic and / or steric nature . 
ethylene copolymerizations with various pentenes [ 1-pentene , 4-methyl-l-pentene ( 4M1P ) , 3-methyl-1-pentene ( 3M1P ) , 4,4-dimethyl-1-pentene ( NHEP ) ] using CpTiCl2(0-2,6-'Pr2C6H <nUm> ) ( 1 ) , CpTiCl2(N = CBu2 ) ( 2 ) , [ Me2Si(C5Me 4)(Nu)]TiCl2 ( 4 ) - MAO catalyst systems have been explored . both <nUm> and <nUm> exhibited high catalytic activities affording high molecular weight copolymers with unimodal molecular weight distributions ; the rErc values ( rE e = ethylene ; C = comonomer ) by <nUm> were small , suggesting that the monomer incorporations were rather alternating , whereas the copolymerization by <nUm> proceeded in a random manner ( ErXc = ca. <nUm> ) except the copolymerization with 3MlP . <nUm> exhibited remarkable both catalytic activities and 3MlP incorporation in the ethylene / 3MlP copolymerization , and the rE value ( 8.73 ) was much smaller than that by <nUm> ( 92 ) , <nUm> ( 28.3 ) . both <nUm> and <nUm> showed better NHEP incorporations than <nUm> in the ethylene / NHEP copolymerization , and the rather large value by <nUm> ( 6.77 ) compared to those by <nUm> ( <nUm> - <nUm> ) was also obtained in the copolymerization with 4MlP . these results clearly indicate that the monomer reactivities ( rE values ) are influenced not only by the substituent in the olefins , but also by the nature of the catalytically active species ( structure , and ligand set employed ) . both <nUm> and <nUm> also exhibited notable catalytic activities in the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-dodecene , 1-hexadecene , affording high molecular weight copolymers with unimodal molecular weight distributions . No notable differences toward the rB values by <nUm> were seen , although the values were slightly affected by both the steric bulk of olefins ( linear branching ) and the catalyst structure employed . 
copolymerizations of ethylene with vinylcyclohexene ( VCHen ) by using ARTiCl2(X) [ x = O- 2,6-iPr2C 6H3 , AR = AR ( 1 ) ; x = NdCiBu <nUm> , AR = AR ( 2 ) and AR ( 3 ) ] catalyst systems with MAO have been explored . the copolymerizations proceeded via vinyl addition / insertion affording high molecular weight copolymers containing cyclohexenyl side chains ( with uniform compositions as well as with unimodal molecular weight distributions ) accompanied with certain degree of side reaction ( intramolecular cyclization after VCHen insertion ) . degree of the side reaction ( cyclization ) was dependent upon the catalyst employed , polymerization temperature , but was not affected by the time course , the Al / Ti molar ratios . the AR - ketimide analogue ( 3 ) showed the best catalyst performance in terms of both the catalytic activity and the selectivity ( lowest degree of the subsequent intramolecular cyclization ) in the copolymerization . quantitative epoxidation of the olefinic double bonds in the resultant copolymer has been achieved by using m-chloroperbenzoic acid under mild conditions ; a facile , precise synthesis of functionalized polyolefin has thus been demonstrated by adopting this approach . 
copolymerization of ethylene with 4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene ( h4 - MPD ) catalyzed by 1,4- dithabutanediyl-linked bis(phenolato) titanium complexes <nUm> and <nUm> activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) produced exclusively ethylene-4-MPD copolymers with high activity . the copolymer microstructure can be varied by changing the ratio between the monomers in the copolymerization feed , affording copolymers with 4-MPD content up to <nUm> % . the resulting copolymer are crystalline as shown by thermal analysis and by the x-ray powder diffraction profiles . the microstructural features were fully elucidated by <nUm> C NMR spectroscopy revealing that the copolymers with various 4-MPD content show a strong tendency to the alternating microstructure which was confirmed by the kinetic elaboration . 
poly(methylene-1,3-cyclopentane) ( PMCP ) , which is composed with alternating linkage of methylene and 1,3-cyclopentane unit , was synthesized by cyclization polymerization of 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) with various metallocene catalysts . the optically active PMCP samples were prepared by cyclization polymerization of HD with an optically active zirconocene catalyst , [ (+)-(S,S)-ethylene-1,2- bis(n5-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)- 1,1'-bi-2-naphtholate ] , combined with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as a cocatalyst in the presence of triethylaluminum ( A1Et3 ) as a chain transfer reagent to control the molecular weight in toluene at room temperature . the PMCP samples obtained with the optically active zirconocene catalyst show optical rotation in chloroform solution . the MnS of the PMCP samples were measured by gel - permeation chromatography and relatively calibrated with standard polystyrene samples . the birefringent texture of PMCP with relatively high molecular weight showed the fingerprint texture indicating cholesteric liquid crystal . 
bisphenolate ligands with pyridine- and benzene-diyl linkers have been synthesized and metalated with group <nUm> and <nUm> transition metals . the solid - state structures of some of the group <nUm> complexes have been solved . the titanium , zirconium , hafnium , and vanadium complexes were tested for propylene polymerization and ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization activities with methylaluminoxane as cocatalyst . the vanadium (III) precataly st is the most active for propylene polymerization and shows the highest <nUm> -octene incorporation for ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization . the zirconium(IV) precatalyst was the most active for propylene polymerization of the group <nUm> precatalysts . Titanium(IV) and zirconium(IV) precatalysts with pyridine-diyl linkers provided mixtures of isotactic and atactic polypropylene while titanium(IV) precatalysts with benzene-diyl linkers gave atactic polypropylene only . the hafnium(IV) precatalyst with a pyridine-diyl linker generated moderately isotactic polypropylene . 
A new system for visible light induced polymerization of cationic resins working through a free radical promoted process under air is presented . this system is based on a fluorinated titanocene free radical initiator bis(cyclopentadienyl)bis[2,6-difluoro-3-(l-pyrryl)phenyl]titanium Ti , a silane ( tris(trimethylsilyl)silane TTMSS ) together with an onium salt ( diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate ) . the polymerization process is highly efficient , and better under aerated than under laminated conditions ; it appears as a suitable system for long wavelength cationic photopolymerization under air . this system could also be efficient for the polymerization under sunlight irradiation . the involved mechanisms investigated by laser flash photolysis and ESR spin trapping experiments are detailed . 
the 2,1-insertion of propylene which was controlled by the bridging substituents to produce high molecular weight polypropylene ( PP ) , and additionally found reasonable correlation between mw and 2,1-content of PP has been demonstrated . single - site polymerization catalysts have attracted great interest in terms of their highly controllable polymerization performance based on precise design of catalyst architecture and their industrial applications . all PHENICS-Ti similarly exhibited high polymerization activities , and generally afforded high molecular weight PP . silicon atom . the proposed mechanisms are also applicable to the copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene , where PHENICS ligand hampers 2,1-insertion of <nUm> -hexene to yield high molecular weight copolymer . the mechanisms described are also applicable to the copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene , where PHENICS ligand hampers 2,1-insertion of 1-hexene to yield high m wcopolymer . 
the role of silanes , germanes , and stannanes R3XH as co-initiators and additives to overcome the oxygen inhibition usually encountered in photopolymerization reactions in aerated media is demonstrated in experimental conditions where both a low light intensity and thin and low - viscosity samples are used . these results concerned with silanes as co-initiators are compared to data previously obtained in more viscous media where a lower effect of oxygen is expected . the striking role of R3XH here is their use as additives in both type I and II photoinitiating systems . it allows to dramatically increase the polymerization rates and the final monomer conversions in the above - selected conditions . the mechanisms investigated by laser flash photolysis ( LFP ) and electron spin resonance ( ESR ) experiments are discussed . 
the recently developed silyl radical chemistry is used here for the free - radical - promoted cationic polymerization process ( FRPCP ) of two epoxy monomers ( epoxidized soybean oil and limonene dioxide ) that are representative of green monomers . the new developed photoinitiating systems are highly efficient under air upon a solar irradiation in autumn french weather and , for example , lead to <nUm> % conversion after <nUm> mn and form a completely tack - free and uncolored coating after <nUm> h . polymerization profiles obtained upon a visible light irradiation delivered by a xenon lamp or a <nUm> nm diode laser under air show that <nUm> % conversion can be easily achieved after <nUm> s of exposure . excited - state processes are investigated and discussed . 
the 2-phosphinophenolate nickel catalyzed oligo- or polymerization of ethylene in the presence of olefins usually leads to improved conversion or copolymerization . the outcome depends strongly on the nature of the p-substituents and olefins . the diphenylphosphinophenolate ligand ( PPHH ) favors improved yields of waxy linear ethylene oligomers , whereas the more p-basic dicyclohexylphosphinophenolate ( CCHH ) induces incorporation of alkyl- , aryl- , and ester - substituted a-olefins into a growing ethylene polymer chain and larger molar masses of the polymers . depending on the nature of the olefin , the reaction rate and the conversion are lowered by olefin incorporation . ester groups are tolerated if distant to the C = C bond but block the catalyst if close to the olefinic group . A remarkable increase of activity accompanied by small branching was observed in the copolymerization with ethyl undecenoate by the nickel diphenylphosphinophenolate catalyst . 13C and 1H NMR spectra give evidence that ethylene copolymers with isolated side groups , imbedded into linear polyethylene blocks with vinyl end groups , are formed . 
copolymerization of ethylene and styrene in the presence of the catalytic system e5-C5Me5-Ti(CH2Ph) 3-B(C6F5)3 has been investigated . independently from the feed composition , basically alternating ethylene - styrene copolymers are obtained , together with some polyethylene and syndiotactic polystyrene , from which the former can be separated by solvent extraction . NMR analysis of suitably 13C - enriched end groups shows that the regiospecificity of styrene insertion in the initiation step is largely secondary . A tentative explanation for the preferentially alternating comonomer incorporation is proposed . 
low molecular weight ( ca. <nUm> ) ethylene - 1-butene copolymers were synthesized at <nUm> ° C using rac-(dimethylsilyl)bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( I ) catalyst and methyl-aluminoxane ( MAO ) cocatalyst . comonomer composition , triad sequence distribution , and end groups were analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR . the average polymer molecule contains about one double bond and one saturated end group . the unsaturated end groups were formed almost exclusively by transfer from propagating chains containing 1-butene as the terminal unit . At least <nUm> % of the unsaturated end groups are vinylidene and trisubstituted double bonds , which are present in the approximate ratio <nUm> : <nUm> . saturated end groups result from the initiation process . both ethylene and 1-butene are involved in initiation , but ethylene more than 1-butene . the product is a random copolymer with very short blocks ( no longer than 2-3 monomer units ) of both ethylene and 1-butene . the comonomer sequence distributions determined by 13C NMR were fitted to first - order markovian statistics , which allowed calculation of the monomer reactivity ratios . the results are discussed in terms of a reaction mechanism consisting of initiation , propagation , and chain transfer reactions . 
A molecular mechanics analysis on model metallocene complexes , as possible intermediates for the propene polymerization , in which the two coordination positions available for the monomer and the growing chain are diastereotopic , is presented . the energy difference between the corresponding diastereoisomeric preinsertion intermediates appears to be relevant for the model complexes based on the meso-ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl) ligand ( 1 ) , the isopropylidene[(3-methyl(e5-cyclopen > r tadienyl))(e5-9-fluorenyl) ligand ( 2 ) , and the rac-ethylene[1-(e5-9-fluorenyl)-1-phenyl-2-(e 5-1-indenyl ) ] ligand ( 3 ) , while it appears to be small for those based on the rac-ethylene[1-(e5-cyclopentadienyl)-1-phenyl-2-(e 5-1-indenyl ) ] ligand ( 4 ) . it is suggested that these energy differences can be related to an increased probability of a back - skip of the growing chain toward the outward coordination position after the monomer insertion and prior to the coordination of a new olefin molecule . the kinetic competition between the back - skip of the chain outwards and the monomer coordination is able to rationalize the kinds of defects in prevailingly hemi-isotactic chains obtained with systems based on <nUm> , as well as the increased stereoregularity at decreasing monomer concentration for systems based on <nUm> ( not shown by systems based on <nUm> ) . the molecular mechanics analysis shows that the nonbonded interactions are also able to account for the influence of the ethylene bridge conformation on the stereospecificity of the propene polymerization in ansa - zirconocene complexes . 
the copolymerization of styrene and ethylene has been performed using a titanocene - based catalytic system of cyclopentadienyltitanium triphenoxide ( CpTi(OPh)3 ) and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the catalyst system exhibited a high catalytic activity of 104-105 g ( mof ti*h)-1 and was found to selectively ( more than <nUm> wt % ) give an elastoplastic and amorphous styrene-ethylene ( S-E ) copolymer with a well - defined random / alternating microstructure and a single glass transition ( tg ) as thoroughly characterized by solvent fractionation , GPC , 13C NMR , DSC , and WAXD . under the reaction conditions employed , up to <nUm> mol % of styrene could be introduced into the copolymer chains . the composition , microstructure , molecular weight of the copolymers , and catalytic activity of the copolymerization are strongly dependent upon the comonomer feed ratio , polymerization temperature ( tp ) , CpTi(OPh)3 / MAO mole ratio , and trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) content or structure in MAO . for <nUm> ≤ ALTi < <nUm> , the copolymerization product was essentially the random S-E copolymer . for <nUm> < Al / Ti ≤ <nUm> , the copolymerization product was significantly SPS homopolymer . the results showed that <nUm> - <nUm> mol % TMA content in MAO ( oligomerization degree ( n ) ≈ 18-20 ) was optimum for the copolymerization , but <nUm> - <nUm> mol % TMA in MAO ( oligomerization degree ( n ) ≈ 24-28 ) for styrene syndiospecific homopolymerization , even in the presence of ethylene feed monomer . the external addition of TMA or triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) inhibited the copolymerization but promoted the styrene homopolymerization . ESR spectroscopic analysis combined with copolymerization results suggests the presence of a Ti(IV) active center which is responsible for the formation of polyethylene , a Ti (III) species which is active in the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene , and , moreover , the presence of a third intermediate which contributes to promoting the copolymerization of styrene with ethylene to produce S-E copolymer . 
the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) , initiated by zirconocene complexes cp2 - ZrMe2 ( 1 ) and [Cp2ZrMe(THF)][BPh4] ( 2 ) , provides partially syndiotactic poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) in high yield and with a narrow molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) . the kinetics of this process were studied and reveal that in this system , the rate of initiation is much slower than that of propagation . initiation appears to involve the rate - limiting reaction of complex <nUm> with monomer to generate a cationic enolate complex ( 3 ) . the latter compounds also initiate polymerization of MMA , albeit at a much slower rate than that observed using initiators <nUm> and <nUm> . the mechanism for propagation in polymerizations initiated by complexes <nUm> and <nUm> has a rate - limiting step involving the reaction of neutral zirconium enolate species ( 4 ) , produced in situ from <nUm> and <nUm> , with monomer , activated by coordination to complex <nUm> . neutral enolate complexes <nUm> and complex <nUm> function as effective initiators of MMA polymerization in which the rate of initiation is greater than or equal to the rate of propagation . under these conditions . PMMA can be produced with very narrow MWD and the polymerization process is living at or below <nUm> ° C . the rate of this process is highly sensitive to the presence of impurities and thus the degree of polymerization is practically limited by initiator concentration . the polymerization of MMA , using initiators <nUm> and <nUm> , in the presence of trialkylaluminum compounds was studied with a view to overcoming these limitations . alkylaluminum compounds appear to act as chain transfer termination reagents in these polymerizations , although the rate of this process is much slower than the rate of propagation . In particular , triisobutylaluminum can be used to purify monomer and solvent and allows production of PMMA with a narrow MWD at high conversion . the polymerization of n-butyl acrylate ( BuA ) , initiated by complexes <nUm> and <nUm> , was studied . poly(n - butyl acrylate ) ( P(BuA) ) can be prepared in high yield at low temperatures with a narrow MWD . this process is not living and the principal termination process involves back - biting cyclization as revealed by MALDI - TOF mass spectra of low-MW polymer . At higher temperatures , the growing chains are deactivated by this process and also by competitive a-hydrogen transfer , such that high monomer conversions are not obtained . 
the zirconocene coupling of conjugated dines is a versatile route to a new family of polymers with primarily cross-conjugated structures . this partially cross-conjugated and irregular structure result in the relatively wide band gaps of the polymers which appear to be responsible for the observed emission of blue light . 
A kinetic study of the ethylene-styrene copolymerization in the presence of rac-(ethylenebis-(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride activated by MAO shows the peculiar behavior of this catalytic system that is known to produce crystalline nearly alternating copolymers . some inferences on the monomer - metal interactions are made on the basis of this study . the parallel investigation on the catalyst based on isopropylidene(1-cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride allows us to produce a stereoregular nearly alternating ethylene-styrene copolymer also with this catalytic system . the same main tacticity seems to characterize the copolymers obtained with the C2 and Cs symmetric catalysts in accordance with the generally accepted mechanism of stereocontrol in the 1-alkene polymerizations . 
unbridged 2-arylindenylmetallocene complexes such as bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) are catalyst precursors for the synthesis of elastomeric polypropylenes . these catalysts are also active for the copolymerization of ethylene and propylene . addition of small amounts of ethylene to a polymerization system derived from the 2-arylindene metallocenes results in a large and nonlinear increase in the polymerization rate . this increase in rate can not be explained by the faster rate of ethylene insertion but is likely the result of the activation of dormant catalyst sites by ethylene . this ` ethylene effect ' is much larger for bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride / MAO ( (2PhInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO , <nUm> / MAO ) and bis[2-(3',5'-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)indenyl]-zirconium dichloride / MAO ((CF3)2PhInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO , <nUm> / MAO ) metallocene catalysts than for bridged rac-ethylene-bis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride / MAO ( EBIZrCl2MAO , <nUm> / MAO ) metallocene . copolymerization parameters for 1-3 / MAO reveal that the unbridged 2-arylindene catalysts show a tendency toward random or slightly blocky incorporation of comonomers ( rerp = <nUm> - <nUm> ≥ <nUm> ) , whereas the ansa - metallocene <nUm> / MAO exhibits a tendency toward alternating comonomer distribution ( rerp = <nUm> < <nUm> ) . 
cationic metallocene / borate catalysts , generated from zirconocene dimethyl compounds , LnZrMe2 , and anilinium borate , [HNMe2Ph]+[B(C6F5)4] - , were used to polymerize 5-amino-1-pentenes and one 4-amino-1-butene with dimethyl , diethyl , diisopropyl , or diphenyl substitution patterns on nitrogen . the monomer 5-(N,N-diisopropylamino)-1-pentene showed the highest activity with Cp*2ZrMe2 / borate and was used for all further investigations . the catalytic system Cp*2ZrMe2 / borate was <nUm> times more active than the corresponding methylaluminoxane - based system and <nUm> times more active than the heterogeneous system , Cl3Ti / Al(i-Bu)3 . 1-Hexene and 5-(N,N-diisopropylamino)-1-pentene were polymerized with Cp*2ZrMe2 and rac-ethylenebis(tetrahydroindenyl) zirconium dimethyl , rac-EB(THI)-ZrMe2 . polymerization of both monomers with Cp*2ZrMe2 displayed similar activities . hexene polymerizations with rac - EB(THI)ZrMe2 were <nUm> times more active than those with aminopentene . 5-(N,N-Diisopropylamino)-1-pentene polymerizations gave rise to isotactic poly(aminopentene) with C2 symmetric catalysts , syndiotactic polymer with a Cs symmetric catalyst , and atactic polymer with achiral catalyst precursors . 
the reaction of pentamethylcyclopentadienyltris((trimethylsilyl)methyl)titanium ( Cp*Ti-(CH2SiMe3)3 ) with <nUm> equiv of BC18F15 was almost quantitative to give the " cationic " compound [Cp*Ti(CH2SiMe3)2]+[B(CH 2SiMe3)(C6F5)3 ] - ( 1 ) , which was readily identified spectroscopically . the complex <nUm> , prepared in situ by reacting the precursor with BC18F15 , has also been found to be active for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene , producing over <nUm> % syndiotactic PS at an activity of <nUm> × <nUm> g of PS / ( mol of ti*mol of styrene*h ) . both activity and syndiospecificity significantly increased when triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) was used to scavenge the polymerization system . the maximum polymerization activities for the cationic complex were found at tp = <nUm> ° C . the electron - withdrawing substituents on the aromatic solvent ring could increase the activity and s-PS yields , although toluene is the polymerization medium of best choice in the styrene polymerization . through the comparison of various lewis acids as cocatalysts by virtue of their difference in both lewis acidity and ion - pair interactions , the role of the key titanocene - cocatalyst interaction was unambiguously demonstrated , suggesting that the nature of lewis acids and the structure of their corresponding counteranions were important . 
synthesis of " meso " - and " racemic " - like diastereomers of Me2Si(3-MeInd)(Ind)ZrCl2 ( <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ) was achieved through either metathetical reactions between the dianion of Me2(3-MeIndH)-(IndH) ( 4 ) with Cl4Zr or via amine elimination reactions , followed by fractional crystallization . propylene polymerizations using meso-5 in the presence of methyl aluminoxane under a variety of conditions leads to the formation of low molecular weight , semicrystalline , low tacticity , poly(propylene) ( PP ) . the dominant chain transfer mechanism in this case is shown to involve b-H transfer to monomer . In contrast , rac-6 provides higher molecular weight , semicrystalline , elastomeric poly(propylene) ( elPP ) under a variety of conditions ; chain transfer in this case involves , predominantly , b-H transfer to Zr . the properties of elPP produced using catalyst <nUm> show a gradual change from a lightly , cross-linked elastomer to a poorly crystalline thermoplastic , depending on both polymer molecular weight and crystallinity as revealed by differential scanning calorimetry and tensile testing . In particular , more crystalline material exhibits a higher initial modulus , yielding behavior and lower strain to break than less crystalline material of equivalent molecular weight . these findings further define polymer properties for the synthesis of flexible elastomers using this class of catalysts . 
titanocene complexes based on an amido-fluorenyl ligand bridged by a dimethylsilylene group , (e1:e5-C13H8SiMe2NCMe3)TiCl2 ( 3 ) and (e1:e5-C13H8SiMe2NCMe3)TiMe2 ( 5 ) , have been synthesized . reaction of <nUm> with <nUm> equiv of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] ( 2 ) was almost quantitative to give the ` cationic ' compound [ ( e1:e5-C13H8SiMe2NCMe3 ) TiMe]+[B(C6F5)4]- ( 1 ) , as identified on the basis of elemental analyses and spectroscopic properties . the ` cation ' <nUm> was highly active and stereoselective in the copolymerization of ethylene ( e ) and styrene ( S ) , depending upon the polymerization conditions , to produce predominantly a new microstructural E-S copolymer ( together with some polyethylene homopolymer ) with an activity of ( <nUm> - <nUm> ) × <nUm> g of bulk polymer / ( mol of ti*mol of total monomers*h ) . As thoroughly characterized by solvent extraction , GPC , 13C NMR , DSC , and DMA , the E-S copolymer obtained by catalyst <nUm> proved to be a perfectly alternating copolymer with well - defined isotactic polystyrene structure , together with a single glass transition ( tg = <nUm> ° C ) and melting temperature of <nUm> ° C . the findings obtained by catalyst <nUm> suggest that the structure of the active species with the bulkier fluorenyl substituent and the following alternating site migratory insertion of comonomer in the chain propagation is responsible for the preferentially alternating , isotactic comonomer incorporation . 
the zirconocene complexes CP2ZrMe2 and Cp*2ZrMe2 activated with BC18F15 initiate the carbocationic polymerization of isobutene and isobutene - isoprene copolymerizations to IIR rubbers at temperatures as high as <nUm> ° C . unlike conventional metal halide initiators , these metallocene - based initiator systems produce both homo- and copolymers of broadly similar molecular weights . copolymers prepared in the presence of ca. <nUm> mol % isoprene show a diene incorporation rate of <nUm> - <nUm> % , with the typical 1,4-trans structure . comparison of the effectiveness of zirconocene dialkyls with that of the metallocene hydrolysis products Cp*2Zr(OH)2 and (Cp2ZrMe)2(m-O) in the presence of BC18F15 suggests that initiation by traces of protons is less efficient than initiation by cationic metallocene alkyl species , while oxo-bridged complexes (Cp'2ZrMe)2(m-O) / B(C6F 5)3 ( cp' = CH or C5H4SiMe3 ) are inactive . 
A possible rationalization of the dependence of regiospecificity of propene polymerization for catalytic systems based on C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes ( and hafnocenes ) on the p-ligand alkyl substitutions is presented . with this aim , models of preinsertion intermediates and transition states for primary and secondary monomer insertion reactions are compared through molecular mechanics analyses . the nonbonded energy contributions to the regioselectivity , as well as the enantioselectivities of regioregular and regioirregular insertion steps have been investigated . nonbonded energy interactions are able to account for the increases of regiospecificity experimentally observed for zirconocene - based catalytic systems when the p-ligands are alkyl substituted in position <nUm> or <nUm> as well as the decrease of regiospecificity observed when the p-ligands are dimethyl substituted in positions <nUm> and <nUm> . 
the properties of three elastomeric stereoblock polypropylene ( PP ) samples made with unbridged 2-phenylindene zirconocene catalysts were investigated . one of the characteristics of these catalysts is the ability to control the structure and properties of the polypropylenes by manipulation of the reaction conditions . samples PP1 and PP2 were prepared to have similar tacticities ( as indicated by IR and NMR spectroscopy ) yet different molecular weights . the molecular weight of PP2 is approximately half the molecular weight of PP1 . sample PP3 has a molecular weight similar that of PP2 but is lower in isotactic pentad content . all three samples were separated into fractions that differ in their solubilities in boiling ether and heptane . the fractionation appeared to be governed by tacticity and molecular weight . thermal analysis by differential scanning calorimetry showed very broad melting endotherms . the broadness of the transitions and the relatively large standard deviations calculated for the enthalpy of fusion are indicative of a multiphase material . x-ray powder diffraction patterns of the three samples and their fractions ( except the ether - soluble fractions ) all showed characteristic peaks of the α crystalline phase . the heptane - insoluble fractions of both PP1 and PP2 also exhibited g-phase reflection , whereas in the heptane - soluble fractions , that reflection is less evident . tensile tests performed on PP1 and PP2 yielded a similar tensile modulus for the two , indicating similar degrees of crystallinity . PP1 exhibited better recovery properties , as measured in tests at <nUm> % and <nUm> % elongation . 
A kinetic model for chain propagation that can account for reaction orders higher than one on monomer concentration , observed for several insertion polymerizations , is discussed . this model is based on the presence of a ` single - center , two - state catalyst ' system , where the slower state is of lower energy and the interconversion rate between the two states is intermediate between the fast and slow propagation rates . this kinetic model fits available experimental data on polymerization rates , as a function of propene concentration , in the presence of zirconocene catalysts . different possibilities for the chemical nature of the two catalyst states are discussed . 
the solid - state structure and physical behavior of an elastomeric polypropylene ( PP1 ) synthesized with unbridged 2-phenylindene zirconocene catalyst were examined using solid - state 13C NMR spectroscopy , differential scanning calorimetry , wide - angle x-ray powder diffraction , and birefringence measurements of relaxation behavior . extraction of these elastomeric polypropylenes with boiling ether and heptane yielded three fractions of different molecular weight and tacticity . the ether - soluble fraction is the lowest in isotactic pentad content and exhibits no detectable crystallinity . for the other fractions and the parent homopolymer , the degrees of crystallinity estimated from DSC and WAXD results are similar . the amount of the immobile phase determined by solid - state NMR , however , appears much higher than the degree of crystallinity . an increase in temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C results in a loss in the relative fraction of mobile and immobile phase as measured by solid - state NMR and a corresponding loss in the percent crystallinity as measured by DSC . the relaxation of polymer samples subjected to step shear as a function of increasing temperature was investigated using polarized optical birefringence measurements . these studies revealed that the elastic network remains stable up to temperatures of <nUm> ° C . blends of atactic and isotactic polypropylene with similar average isotactic pentad contents as PP1 and its heptane - insoluble fraction were examined in comparison . despite their similar taciticities and degrees of crystallinity , the blends show no evidence of a network structure after being subjected to a step shear but instead relax back to an isotropic orientation . 
A butyl-branched polyethylene having the features of LLDPE was synthesized from an ethylene feed without any added comonomer by using the Cp*TiMe3-B(C6F5)3 catalytic system . this unexpected result was rationalized by detecting the in situ formation of 1-hexene . 
RHF / 3-21G ab initio , density functional theory ( B3LYP / 3-21G ) , and single - point calculations using an effective core potential ( B3LYP / 6-31G*-ECP(S) / / 3-21G ) are performed for different mechanisms of polymerization of acrylic acid and methyl acrylate by dicyclopentadienyl-zirconocene enolate complexes . polymerization is considered involving a cationic zirconocene complex and a neutral zirconocene complex , respectively . In addition , a mechanism proposed by collins is treated which involves a neutral and a cationic zirconocene complex in the CC bond - forming step at the same time . catalytic cycles can be devised in all cases which suggest that all three mechanisms may be realizable under suitable conditions . however , the ' bimetallic ' mechanism proposed by collins shows the lowest energy of activation for the propagation step . it is shown that bridging of the cyclopentadienyl rings should be important not only with respect to reactivity but also with respect to the possible catalytic cycle . methyl methacrylate is not included in the treatment ; i.e. , the problem of tacticity in these polymerizations is not addressed . 
an experiment was conducted to show the presence of ethylene as catalyst reactivator in the propene - styrene copolymerization . the copolymerizations have been performed by bubbling the gaseous monomers at atmospheric pressure into a flask containing a styrene solution of the prototypical ansa - zirconocene complex rac-(ethylene)bis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride activated by methylalumoxane . In structure A one tertiary carbon atom bearing the phenyl ring is surrounded in both sides by sequences of two methylene groups while in structure B the junction is characterized by the presence of two tertiary carbon atoms bearing the phenyl ring separated by three methylene groups . by reducing the styrene content in the comonomer feed composition ( [E] / [P] / [S] ) <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> in the liquid phase ) a copolymer with a <nUm> % styrene units is obtained . the results reported show that it is possible to introduce some styrene units in an isotactic polypropylene sequence by using a small amount of ethylene to reactivate the catalyst after the styrene insertion . 
the ligand effects of homogeneous Ti - based catalysts for the copolymerization of styrene ( [M1] ) with 4-[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]styrene ( TBDMSS ; [M2] ) were investigated by the UV / visible spectroscopic analysis . concerning the higher yields from the copolymerization of styrene with TBDMSS , the half - sandwich type of titanocene having p-ligands compared to titanium ( IV ) butoxide ( Ti(OBu)4 ) having s-ligands was a more effective catalysts . the silyloxy group exhibiting a negative σ value in the hammett s-r relationship reduced the activities of titanocenes . the stronger electron - donating substituent on the p-ligand leading to the increase in the catalytic activity in syndiospecific polymerization of styrene contributed to the decrease of the reactivity of the ` cationlike ' metal center due to both electronic and steric effects . the reactivity ratios , r1 and r2 , in the e5-indenyl trichlorotitanium ((Ind)TiCl3)-catalyzed copolymerization of styrene with TBDMSS in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) ( [Al] / [Ti] = <nUm> ) were <nUm> and <nUm> from the evaluation of finmann and ross , respectively . the r1r2 product value ( 7.25 ) indicates that a block type of copolymer may be produced in a relatively high feed range of TBDMSS to styrene . 
A method for the preparation of new functionalized s-polystyrene ( S-PS ) polymers - s-PS containing a terminal polar group and a s-PS diblock copolymer containing a s-PS and a polar polymer block - is presented . the in situ chain transfer reaction to borane during titanocene - catalyzed styrene polymerization provides a convenient and effective route for preparing borane - terminated s-PS , which is a very valuable intermediate for preparing functionalized s-PS with a polar end group or diblock copolymer containing a polyolefin and functional polymer segments . 
the synthesis and polymerization behavior of a new C1 - symmetric bridged indenyl-fluorenyl zirconocene dimethylsilylene [9-fluorenyl][(2,4,7-trimethyl)indenyl]zirconium dichloride ( 5 ) is reported . the complex when activated by MAO was found to polymerize ethylene and propylene , although the activity and stereoselectivity of <nUm> for propylene were found to be lower than for the previously prepared ethylene-bridged analogue <nUm> and several other ethylene-bridged precursors . it has been found that , depending on both the substitution patterns on the indenyl ligand and the nature of the bridge in this series of asymmetric zirconocenes , polypropylenes with varying microstructures from aspecific to highly isospecific are obtained . the propylene polymerization behavior of the new complexes has been studied in detail , and the mechanistic aspects of polymerization are discussed . 
various techniques were applied to study thermoplastic elastomeric polypropylene derived from oscillating bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconocene in order to provide information on the morphology of this stereoblock polymer . multiple melting fractions in the differential scanning calorimetry scans of thermally fractionated samples characterized the polydispersity of the crystallizable block lengths . crystal morphologies of these materials and their change during and after tensile extension were observed using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . In addition , AFM and acid digestion studies provided estimated of the crystallizable sequence lengths in these elastomers . 
copolymerization of ethylene and styrene with the catalytic system Cp*TiMe3-B(C6F5)3 under suitable conditions affords a new polymer having a polyethylenic backbone with 4-phenyl-1-butyl branches as the main solid product . analysis of the polymerization mixtures evidences the formation of significant amounts of unsaturated ethylene-styrene co-oligomers . A detailed characterization of the oligomeric fraction by GC-MS and NMR analysis suggests some selectivity of the co-oligomerization , i.e. , the prevailing formation of phenylhexenes and the absence of phenylbutenes . these unexpected results have been ascribed to the multisite nature of the catalytic system , containing a species able to co-oligomerize ethylene and styrene to phenylhexenes and another species able to copolymerize the formed 6-phenyl-1-hexene with ethylene . A mechanism involving Ti (II) active species and metallacycle intermediates has been proposed to explain the observed selectivity in the co-oligomerization , by analogy with the mechanism proposed for the selective trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene by the same catalyst . extension of this study to catalysts based on other half - titanocenes activated by methylalumoxane results in similar findings ; optimization of the reaction conditions for the CpTiCl3 - MAO catalyst results in styrene conversions to unsaturated co-oligomers > <nUm> % . dual - catalyst systems , with one component co-oligomerizing ethylene and styrene and the other copolymerizing the formed 6-phenyl-1-hexene with ethylene , have been used to selectively produce polyethylenes with 4-phenyl-1-butyl branches . use of substituted styrenes , i.e. , p-methylstyrene , p-tert-butylstyrene , p-chlorostyrene , and m-methylstyrene , as the comonomers results in the formation of polyethylenes having the corresponding 4-aryl-1-butyl branches as well as oligomeric fractions analogous to those obtained from styrene . 
As modifications of the effective catalyst precursor for syndiospecific styrene polymerization , namely [2-Me-thBenz[e]Ind]TiCl3 ( ic ) , [2,3-Me2-thBenz[e]Ind]TiCl3 ( IIc ) , [1,2,3-Me3-thBenz[e]Ind]TiCl3 ( IIIc ) , and [2-Me-3-Ph-thBenz[e]Ind]TiCl3 ( IVc ) have been synthesized to examine the influence of ligand pattern on the catalyst activity and polymer properties . these complexes , activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , showed high activities compared with previously employed titanocene catalysts . of all titanocenes examined , [2-Me-3-Ph-thBenz[e]Ind]TiCl3 ( IVc ) / MAO showed the highest activity and stability at an even fairly low Al / Ti ratio of <nUm> , revealed the excellent control over the stereoregular insertion of monomer , and exhibited a significant increase of the ratio of the propagation rates to chain transfer termination as evidenced by the kinetic results , thus producing polymers with the highest syndiotacticity and molecular weight . the kinetic investigations , combined with the EPR spectrum and polymerization experiments , showed that the higher activity of tetrahydrobenz[e]indenyl-based systems is due to a great number of active species . 
A new organic photocatalyst ( 9,10-bis- [(triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl] anthracene , An-Si ) is proposed here for the formation of free radicals under very soft irradiation conditions under air through a photoredox catalysis . it works according to an oxidative cycle that uses the combination of An-Si , a diphenyl iodonium salt along with a silane . this behavior is highlighted through an investigation of its excited state and redox properties . the different chemical intermediates are characterized by ESR experiments . In addition , the reversibility of the oxidation reaction of An-Si was investigated by cyclic voltammetry . this three - component system is able to promote the ring - opening photopolymerization of an epoxide as well as the free radical photopolymerization of an acrylate upon household LED bulb and Xe lamp exposure . excellent polymerization profiles ( mainly in ROP ) are obtained . the specific properties of this catalyst are outlined . 
N-Vinylcarbazole is proposed as an additive for epoxy ring - opening polymerization ROP upon visible light exposure . this compound can convert hardly oxidizable radicals to carbon centered radicals by an addition process onto the n-vinylcarbazole double bond . the generated radicals can be further easily oxidized by an iodonium salt thereby leading to efficient initiating cations for the ROP of epoxides . different visible light photoinitiating systems have been investigated : type I photoinitiators ( derived from phosphine oxides ) and dye / iodonium salt couples . the underlying chemical mechanisms are investigated by electron spin resonance ( ESR ) experiments . 
( matrix presented ) copolymerization of bis(4-vinylbenzylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride and styrene in a test tube , followed by extraction of the bulk polymer and slicing into " disks " <nUm> mm thick and <nUm> mm in diameter , gives a supported zirconocene species that exhibits both stoichiometric and catalytic chemical activity . the disks catalyze reaction of trimethylaluminum and phenylacetylene to give a-methylstyrene with modest turnover numbers and are active over at least six recyclings . 
the functionalized (fluoroaryl)borate salts Ph3C+B(C6F4TBS)4 - and Ph3C+B(C6F4TIPS)4 - ( TBS = tBuMe2Si ; TIPS = iPr3Si ) are prepared in three steps from 1,4-HC6F4Br , reaction with zirconocene dimethyls yields crystalline , thermally stable , soluble L2ZrCH3 +B-(C6F4SiR3)4 - and L'2ZrH+B(C6SiR3)4 - salts ( L = e5-C5H5 ; e5-1,2-Me2C5H3 ; L ' = e-Me5C5 ) which function as highly active ethylene polymerization catalysts . 
(2-Methylcyclopenta[l]phenanthryl)2ZrCl2 and (2-phenylcyclopenta[l]phenanthryl)2ZrCl2 were synthesized and used , after activation with MAO , as catalysts for the polymerization of propene . the resulting polymers had low isotacticities ( 8-18 % [mmmm] ) . ligand rotation barriers for the corresponding zr-dibenzyl derivatives were determined by dynamic NMR spectroscopy . pathways and transition states for ligand rotation in this series of complexes were studied by molecular - mechanics calculations and are discussed in relation to the microstructure of the respective polymer products . 
synthesis of rac-[((1,2,3,4-tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene-1,4-diyl)germylene)bis(1-e5-indenyl)]dichlorozirconium ( 1 ) was achieved with substantial suppression of the undesired meso diastereomer as predicted by MM2 force field calculations . the corresponding zirconocenium ion of <nUm> polymerizes propylene with high catalytic activity and stereospecificity to very high molecular weight . the characteristics of this catalysis are essentially independent of polymerization temperature over a broad temperature range . 
the synthesis of seven new bridged zirconocenes is described , which make isotactic polypropylene when used in polymerizations of propylene with methylaluminoxane as cocatalyst . their polymerization behavior in propylene and ethylene polymerizations is examined and discussed . aromatic substituents in appropriate positions of the zirconocene ligand frame result in catalysts with activities , stereospecificities , and polypropylene molecular weights much higher than those of any previously described metallocene system . by structure variations it is demonstrated that the effectiveness of these substitutions strongly depends on their position and on a nonincremental synergism with alkyl substituents on the ligand frame . the high activities of the systems can be explained well by electronic effects , whereas steric effects obviously play the more important role for the high stereospecificities and high molecular weights of the polymers . 
the intramolecular zirconocene coupling of 4,4-bis(hexyloxymethyl)-1,7-bis-p-halophenyl-1,6-heptadiynes provides 2,5-bis-p-halophenylzirconocyclopentadienes ( bromo and chloro derivatives ) , which undergo efficient transmetalation reactions with Br4Ge . methylation of the resulting dihalogermoles with MeLi provided bis-p-halophenyl-2,5-germole monomers . these functionalized germoles were polymerized via nickel coupling to give oligo- and poly(2,5-diphenylgermole) materials ( 7 ) . investigations of optical properties reveal that the monomers and a model 2,5-bisphenylgermole are somewhat photoluminescent ( φ = <nUm> - <nUm> ) , while the high molecular weight polymer ( Mn ≈ <nUm> ) exhibits very efficient photoemission ( φ = <nUm> ) . electrochemical studies indicate that delocalization in <nUm> is accompanied by a modest lowering of the LUMO level relative to that of the monomer . 
an ethylene-bridged zirconocene complex , (Cp2ZrMe)2(CH2CH2) , was prepared by the reaction of Cp2ZrMe2 with a zirconocene - ethylene complex , [ cp2- ZrEt(CH2 = CH2)]MgBr , and the structure of this complex was determined by a single - crystal x-ray diffraction study . the structure of this complex showed one methyl group on each zirconium and an ethylene ligand simultaneously coordinating to the two zirconocene moieties . 
As part of our continued investigation of the polymerization behavior of substituted asymmetric indenyl-fluorenyl metallocenes , three new zirconocenes bearing 2,4-disubstitution on the indenyl moiety have been synthesized and evaluated as a-olefin polymerization catalysts . for the new complex ethylene-1-(9-fluorenyl)-2-[1- (2-methyl-4-phenyl)indenyl]-zirconium dichloride ( 11 ) , highly isotactic polypropylene with [mmmm] = <nUm> % and mw <nUm> × <nUm> at tp = <nUm> ° C was produced in very high yield . the dimethylsilylene analogue ( 13 ) gave similar results in terms of stereoregularity with a 2-fold increase in mw . In addition , dimethylsilylene(9-fluorenyl)[1-(2,4-dimethyl)indenyl]zirconium dichloride ( 12 ) was prepared and found to be an effective catalyst precursor , although the smaller methyl substituent at the 4-position resulted in polypropylenes of lower stereoregularity . 
A series of chiral enantiopure group <nUm> metallocene dichlorides (CpSi(*))2MCl2 [ CpSi(*) = e5-C5H4SiMe2(1R)-endo-(+)-OC10H17 , m = Zr , <nUm> ; Hf , <nUm> ] and Cp(CpSi(*))MCl2 [ cp = e5-C5H5 , m = Ti , <nUm> ; Zr , <nUm> ] were synthesized as precatalysts for the dehydropolymerization of PhSiH3 . the time - averaged C2 - asymmetric metallocene dichlorides (CpSi(*))2MCl2 ( m = Zr , Hf ) were prepared by the metathesis reaction of <nUm> equiv of (CpSi(*))Li , <nUm> , with the appropriate metal tetrachloride MCl4*2THF . the C1 - symmetric compounds Cp(CpSi(*))MCl2 ( m = Ti , Zr ) were synthesized by a similar metathesis reaction of (CpSi(*))Li and the precursor CpMCl3 ( m = Ti , Zr*2THF ) . all compounds were characterized by elemental analysis and 1H , 13C{1H} , and 29Si{1H} NMR spectroscopy in addition to various 2D NMR spectroscopy techniques . A crystalline sample of <nUm> was studied by x-ray diffraction , which confirmed the pseudo-tetrahedral geometry of the Zr metal center and the C1 symmetry of the overall complex . A <nUm> mol % loading of the chiral precatalysts 3-6 was combined with <nUm> mol % of n-BuLi to provide an in situ catalyst for the dehydropolymerization of PhSiH3 to polyphenylsilane . the performance of each chiral catalyst was assayed with respect to polymer molecular weight properties and polymer microstructure . substituted zirconocenes <nUm> and <nUm> were found to produce higher average molecular weight polymers ( mw = <nUm> ) by GPC analysis . the characterization of each by 29Si{1H} NMR spectroscopy indicated that all polyphenysilanes consisted of atactic micro-structures ( mm = <nUm> , mr = <nUm> , rr = <nUm> ) . 
doubly bridged zirconocene derivatives with C2 symmetrically disposed substituents , ((CH3)2-Si)2(3,4-dimethyl-1,2-cyclopentadienediyl)2ZrCl2 ( <nUm> A ) and ((CH3)2Si)2(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1,2-indenediyl)2ZrCl2 ( 4B ) were synthesized by reactions of the corresponding ligand dilithium salts with Cl4Zr in toluene ; the racemic isomers were obtained by fractionated crystallization of the diastereomeric product mixtures . x-ray diffraction studies give space group P1 with a = <nUm> ( 5 ) Å b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> ( 9 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 4 ) ° , β = <nUm> ( 4 ) ° , γ = <nUm> ( 4 ) ° , and z = <nUm> ( two crystallographically independent molecules ) for <nUm> A and space group P21 / n with a = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , and z = <nUm> for 4B . both complexes show the expected C2 - axial symmetry . In combination with methylalumoxane , <nUm> A and 4B are slowly converted to catalysts for the polymerization of propene , which yield polymers with low and medium isotacticities , respectively . control experiments indicate that conversion of these complexes to active catalysts involves degradation of their strained ligand frameworks ; intact <nUm> A and 4B do not appear to give rise to catalytic activity . 
novel synthetic approaches to chiral ethylene-bridged ansa - titanocenes possessing stereogenic centers on the bridging carbon chain are described . A key step in the preparation of these compounds is the double - skattebol rearrangement of bis(vinyldibromocyclopropane) intermediates derived from 1,4-disulfones . the influence of tether substitution on the diastereo - selection in ansa - titanocene formation has been examined through stereospecific 2,3-dimethyl substitution on the ethylene bridge of b-methyl-substituted bis(cyclopentadienyl) ligands . the ethylene-bridged bis(cyclopentadienes) were converted to their dilithium salts and treated with TiCl3*3THF to afford mixtures of meso and racemic ansa - titanocenes . several isomers were isolated , and their structures were determined by x-ray diffraction . the meso configuration of tether-methyl substituents was found to promote the formation of a racemic configuration of b-methyl cyclopentadienide ligands whereas the racemic configuration of tether-methyl substituents was found to have little effect on the racemic to meso ratio relative to ethylenebis-[e6-1-(3-methylcyclopentadienyl)]titanium dichloride . the spectral and physical characteristics of these compounds are discussed . 
this paper outlines the generation of the transient monomeric imido complexes Cp2ZrNR ( 1a – e ) , their successful trapping with unsaturated organic molecules and dative ligands , and their use in activating C — H bonds . the generation of Cp2ZrNR has been accomplished by thermolysis of the alkyl amides Cp2Zr(NHR)(R') ( 2a – d ) and bis(amides) Cp2Zr(NHR)2 ( 3a – c ) via a-abstraction of alkane and amine , respectively . the imido intermediate 1a , generated from alkyl amide 2a ( r = 4-tert-butylphenyl , R' = me ) in THF , resulted in the formation of the bridging imido dimer 4a in <nUm> % yield . In contrast , the generation of intermediates 1b – d ( 1b r = tert-Bu ; 1c r = 2,6-dimethylphenyl ; 1d r = Si(CMe3)Me2 ) under similar conditions furnished the monomeric imido THF complexes 5b – d in <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> % yields . imido dimer 4a and monomer 5b were characterized crystallographically . the THF ligands of 5b – d are weakly bound , as demonstrated by the exchange of bound and free THF in 5c on the NMR time scale and by facile substitution of Ph3PO for THF in 5b , giving the triphenylphosphine oxide adduct Cp2Zr(NCMe3)(OPPh3) ( 6b ) . thermolysis of the alkyl amides 2b and 2d at <nUm> – <nUm> ° C in benzene resulted in the addition of the C — H bond of benzene across the Zr — N linkage to provide the phenyl amides 7b and 7d . similarly , the THF adduct 5b reacted with benzene under the same conditions to give the C — H activation product 7b . the imido intermediates Cp2ZrNR undergo cycloaddition reactions with a variety of unsaturated organic compounds . In addition to formation of azametallacyclobutenes ( e.g. , 8b , 8c , 9c , 10b ) from alkynes , certain olefins react with cp2 - ZrNR to give azametallacyclobutanes . thus , upon reaction of norbornene or ethylene with imido complex 5b an equilibrium mixture of 5b , free olefin , free THF , and the metallacycles 12b and 13b , respectively , were observed . addition of a large excess of norbornene shifted the equilibrium almost entirely to the azametallacyclobutane 12b and facilitated its isolation . the structure of 12b was determined after crystallization from hexamethyldisiloxane . complex 5b also reacted with benzophenone and tert-butyl isocyanate to provide the tert-butylimine of benzophenone and di-tert-butylcarbodiimide in <nUm> and <nUm> % yields , respectively . monomer 5b reacted with tert-butyl isocyanide to provide the coupling / trapping product Cp2Zr-(N(CMe3)CNCMe3)(CNCMe3) ( 16 ) , while reaction of 5b with isobutene oxide gave the epoxideopened product Cp2Zr(NHCMe3)(OCH2C(Me)CH2) ( 17 ) . finally , heating the alkyl amide Cp2Zr(NHCHPh2)(CH2CH2CMe3) ( 2e ) ( which contains hydrogens both α and β to nitrogen ) with diphenylacetylene yielded the azametallacyclobutene product formed via a-abstraction in <nUm> % yield . 
by means of a multinuclear NMR study of the complexes formed between AlCl3 and either Cp2TiCl2 or Cp2Ti(CH2SiMe3)Cl in chloroalkane solution , isomeric forms of the resulting <nUm> : <nUm> complexes have been detected . the influence of temperature , concentration , ratio of the titanocene chloride to aluminum chloride , and the nature of the solvent upon the 1H , 13C , and 27Al NMR spectra has been investigated . the spectral changes caused by the foregoing factors give compelling evidence for an equilibrium in such Cp2Ti(R)Cl*AlCl3 complexes ( r = Cl , CH2 - SiMe3 ) between comtact ion pairs ( CIP ) , Cp2TiR ⋯ Cl ⋯ AlCl3 , and solvent - separated ion pairs ( SSIP ) , Cp2TiR+[?] AlCl4- . more polar media and higher dilution have been shown to favor the solvent - separated ion pair isomer over the contact ion pair isomer . In p-basic solvents , such as arenes , evidence is offered that a <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> complex of Cp2Ti(R)Cl , AlCl3 , and arene is formed reversibly . the isolation of such a complex with mesitylene and the failure to detect the formation of a complex with hexamethylbenzene indicate the operation of significant steric hindrance to complexation . these observations lead to the proposal that arenes form σ or e1 complexes with the titanocenium cation and thus generate a third type of ion pair , the solvated cation – anion pair ( SCAP ) Cp2Ti(e1-arene)R+AlCl4- . since these NMR studies of the soluble ziegler polymerization catalyst system Cp2TiRCl – AlCl3 have permitted the determination of three types of ion pairs in solution , contact ( CIP ) , solvent - separated ( SSIP ) , and solvated cation – anion ( SCAP ) , an attempt was made to correlate the polymerization activity toward ethylene of an analogous catalyst system , Cp2TiMeCl-MenAlCl3-n , with the dominant type of ion pair present under different experimental conditions . the following variations in the conditions of polymerization were made : polarity and donor character of the solvent , concentration of the catalyst , temperature , ratio of the titanium to the aluminum component , and the nature of the lewis acid , MenAlCl3-n ( n = <nUm> − <nUm> ) . from these studies it has been concluded that the solvent - separated ion pair is the most active catalyst and that the arene - solvated SCAP ( when the polymerization is conducted in arene solution ) , Cp2Ti(arene)Me+AlCl4- , is the least active catalyst . 
anions of the type [(C2B9H11)2M]-(M = Fe , Co , Ni ) are suitable for use as “ noncoordinating ” anions with [Cp2ZrMe]+ cations.Catalysts generated from Cp2ZrMe2 and[PhNMe2H] [(C2B9H11)2M] are active for the polymerization and copolymerization of ethylene and a-olefins . spectroscopic examination of the cobalt complex indicates that the anion is weakly coordinated to the metal at room temperature . At low temperatures , however , the aniline - coordinated adduct [Cp2ZrMe(NMe2Ph)][(C2B9H11)2M] is present . these catalysts are active in toluene or hexane for the polymerization of ethylene and the copolymerization of ethylene and 1-butene . 
the metathetical reaction between the lithium 1-azaallyl compound [{HMPA*LiN(H)C(t-Bu)CH2}2] ( 1 ) with zirconocene dichloride ( 2 ) results in the formation of the zirconocene ketimide [ Cp2Zr(Cl)N double bond C(t-Bu)CH3 ] ( <nUm> ; cp = cyclopentadienyl ) and lithium chloride . after it is transferred to the transition metal , the azaallyl ligand isomerizes to a ketimido variation . an energetic preference of <nUm> kcal mol-1 in favor of the zirconocene ketimide over its theoretical azaallyl isomer was determined by ab initio molecular orbital calculations ( at the HF / LanL2DZ level ) . these studies , in combination with an x-ray diffraction analysis of <nUm> , suggest that the preference for the ketimide isomer is due to the presence of a heteroallenic ( Zr-N-C ) interaction . this bonding mode is consistent with the short Zr-N bond length of <nUm> angstroms found in the crystal structure of <nUm> . treatment of <nUm> with MeLi affords the corresponding methyl derivative [ Cp2Zr(Me)N double bond C(t-Bu)CH3 ] ( 4 ) . 1H NMR spectroscopic experiments reveal that addition of the lewis acid BC18F15 to <nUm> results in methide abstraction , with retention of the ketimide unit on the cationic zirconocene . ab initio molecular orbital calculations confirmed the energetic preference for the e1-ketimide cation [ Cp2ZrN double bond c(t - Bu)CH3]+ over either the e1-azaallyl isomer [Cp2Zr{e1-N(H)C(t-Bu)CH2}]+ or the e3-azaallyl isomer [Cp2Zr{e3-N(H)C(t-Bu)CH2}]+ ( by <nUm> and <nUm> kcal mol-1 , respectively ) . both <nUm> and <nUm> have been shown to be active catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene in combination with a MAO cocatalyst . In addition , <nUm> polymerizes ethylene in combination with a mixed BC18F15 / i-Bu3Al cocatalyst . 
several new , novel bridged and unbridged bis-tetrahydrofluorenyl zirconocenes were synthesized and evaluated as ziegler - natta type catalysts for ethylene and propylene polymerization . the complexes were found to be highly stable compared to some bisfluorenylzirconocenes . polypropylene and polyethylene were produced in good yield using the new catalyst precursors with MAO or trityl / TIBA as cocatalysts . both the unsubstituted and substituted bridged bis-tetrahydrofluorenyl zirconocenes were isolated as <nUm> : <nUm> mixtures of rac and meso isomers , which produced mostly atactic polypropylene . partially crystalline polypropylene was obtained at low temperatures with bis(3-methyltetrahydrofluorenyl)-zirconium dichloride . 
monitoring the interaction of ( (trimethylsilyl)methykl ) titanocene chloride with aluminum chloride in polar halocarbons by 1H , 13C , and 27AI NMR spectroscopy has yielded direct spectral evidence for the generation of equilibrating solvent - separated and contact ion pairs , Cp2TKCH2SIMe3)+ and AlCl4 − . such ion pairs are effective catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene , and as re quired by this action , Me3Si fragments from the titanoc - ene component are incorporated into the linear , high - density polyethylene formed . x-ray diffraction data on ((trimethylsllyl)methyl)tltanocene chloride ( space group P21 / n ; r = <nUm> ; rw = <nUm> ; p(max) = <nUm> e / A3 ) reveal an unusually short Ti - CH2 bond ( <nUm> Å ) and an anti conformational arrangement of the Me3SiCH2 group with the Ti-CI bond . 
A variety of chiral and achiral zirconocene complexes were investigated for the stereoselective dehydrogenative coupling of phenylsilane . polymerization of PhSiH3 with rac - (EBI)ZrCl2 / 2BuLi or Cp2Zr(H)CI yields a stereoregular polymer by 29Si NMR spectroscopy . these results suggest that the stereogenic centers of the growing polymer chain may play a role in the stereo chemistry of phenylsilane polymerization . A syndiotactic microstructure for the polyphenylsiianes is tentatively as signed on the basis of comparisons of their 29Si NMR chemical shifts with those of known stereoregular cyclic oligomers . 
alternative reaction modes for a-olefin insertion in a zirconocene alkyl cation are investigated by the extended huckel MO method . agostic interaction of one of the a-H atoms of the migrating alkyl group with the Zr center is found to stabilize the transition state of the preferred reaction mode . essential contributions to this preference are identified by fragment-MO analysis . implications of these findings for stereoselective olefin polymerization by chiral ansa - metallocene derivatives are discussed . 
poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide ) containing cyclopentadienyl ligands attached to the benzyl carbons was prepared by the reaction of cyclopentadienylsodium with polymer that had been brominated at the benzyl position . cross-linking took place during the reaction through the cyclopentadiene group . the reaction of 2-norbornen-7-one with poly(2,6-diphenyl-1,4-phenylene oxide ) lithiated at the 3-position gave the norbornen-7-ol derivative which was converted to the polymer - attached 7-chloronorbornene . cyclopentadiene ligands were generated via a retro diels - alder reaction of the anion produced from the 7-chloronorbornene . these polymers were converted to polymer - bound cyclopentadienyldicarbonylcobalt , cyclopentadienyldicarbonylrhodium , and titanocene catalysts . the cobalt and rhodium complexes were effective hydroformylation catalysts while the immobilized titanocene hydrogenated cyclohexene <nUm> – <nUm> times faster than the homogeneous analogue . 
the title compound <nUm> ( Cp2Zr(Cl)CH(CH3)OCH2CH3 , cp = e5-C5H5 ) has been prepared in good yield by treatment of Cp2ZrCl2 with (1-ethoxyethyl)lithium . compound <nUm> is the first example of a stable , structurally characterized secondary zirconocene alkyl derivative which shows no tendency to rearrange to the primary alkyl derivative at room temperature . carbon monoxide and isocyanides react with <nUm> to give migratory insertion products without rearrangement of the 1-ethoxyethyl fragment . At high temperatures , <nUm> decomposes to give ethylene and Cp2Zr(Cl)OCH2CH3 , the same products obtained at ambient conditions from the reaction of Cp2ZrHCl ( schwartz 's reagent ) with ethyl vinyl ether . 
attempts to develop a ring - opening polymerization ( ROP ) approach to polymeric zirconocene complexes are reported . A new silicon - bridged [1][1]zirconocenophane , (SiMe2)2(e5- C5H3)2Zr(NEt2)2 ( 3a ) , was synthesized by reaction of Zr(NEt2)4 with (C5H4)2(SiMe2)2 ( 4 ) . single - crystal x-ray diffraction revealed a highly tilted structure with an angle of <nUm> ° , a significant increase over the untethered compound (e5-MeC5H4)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , which possesses a tilt angle of <nUm> ° . this and the related compounds (SiMe2)(e5-C5H4)2 MCl2 ( 1a , m = Ti ; 1b , m = Zr ) and (SiMe2)2(e5-C5 H3)2ZrCl2 ( 3b ) were tested for transition - metal catalyzed ROP behavior in the presence of pt(0) catalysts but were found to be inactive . the novel spirocyclic silacyclobutane - bridged monomer (CH2)3Si(e5-C5 H4)2ZrCl2 ( 7b ) was prepared via a " fly trap " amine elimination reaction between cyclotrimethylenedicyclopentadienylsilane ( 8 ) and Zr(NMe2)4 ; this initially yielded (CH2)3Si(e5-C5 H4)2Zr(NMe2)2 ( 7a ) , which was converted to 7b by reaction with a slight excess of Me3SiCl . 7a and 7b were characterized by 29Si , 13C , and 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry as well as single - crystal x-ray diffraction . both showed moderate tilt angles ( <nUm> ° and <nUm> ° , respectively ) as well as highly strained silacyclobutane rings with C-Si-C bond angles of <nUm> ° and <nUm> ° , respectively . transition - metal - catalyzed ROP of 7b led to the formation of the polycarbosilane [ (CH2)3Si(e5-C5 H4)2ZrCl2]n ( 10 ) . both the soluble and insoluble fractions of <nUm> were characterized by CP - MAS 29Si and 13C NMR , and the soluble , oligomeric fraction was further characterized by solution 29Si , 13C , and 1H NMR . complexes 7a , 7b , and polyzirconocene <nUm> were found to exhibit moderate activity as ethylene polymerization catalysts . 
bis(e <nUm> -cyclopentadienyl)titanium titanocene η <nUm> -thioformaldehyde trimethylphosphine ( 3 ) was prepared from titanocene methylidene trimethylphosphine and either sulfur - containing compounds ( e.g. , alkene sulfides , triphenylphosphine sulfide ) or elemental sulfur . the product <nUm> crystallized in the orthorhombic system , in space group pnma ( no. <nUm> ) , with a = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , V = <nUm> ( 6 ) Å <nUm> ; z = <nUm> . the reaction with trans-styrene sulfide-d <nUm> produced an equimolar mixture of trans- and cis-styrene-d <nUm> as byproducts , suggesting a stepwise reaction . the formation of a six - membered ring from titanocene methylidene trimethylphosphine and trimethylene sulfide also supports the stepwise mechanism . A biradical mechanism is preferred in view of the biradical mechanism observed in the analogous reaction with styrene oxide . the complex <nUm> reacted with methyl iodide to produce the cationic titanocene η <nUm> -thiomethoxymethyl trimethylphosphine complex 5a , which crystallized with acetonitrile in the orthorhombic system , space group pbca ( no. <nUm> ) with a = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 14 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , V = <nUm> ( 14 ) Å <nUm> , z = <nUm> . complexes 5b,c having a less coordinating anion such as BF <nUm> or BPh <nUm> were obtained , and complex 5c was converted to a trimethylphosphine - free complex by equilibration with copper (I) chloride . this cationic species ( 7c ) does not catalyze the polymerization of ethylene or methyl vinyl ether in dichloromethane . 
the compounds cp <nUm> ScR ( cp = r = H , me , p-tol ) react readily with nitriles R'CN to provide azomethine complexes cp <nUm> ScNC(R)R ‘ containing a C = N double bond <nUm> – <nUm> cm <nUm> ). if is used , further reaction may occur to give products containing two nitriles . the related complex cp <nUm> HZr <nUm> will insert two nitriles in a stepwise manner ; however , the dimethyl analogue is unreactive toward nitriles . the compounds cp <nUm> ScNC(H)R may be hydrogenated under relatively mild conditions to yield the corresponding amide complexes this transformation is reversible ; addition of ethylene leads to dehydrogenation of the amide complex and production of ethane . the amide complexes may be independently synthesized by reaction of cp <nUm> ScR ( r = H , me ) and the corresponding amine , with resultant elimination of hydrogen or methane , respectively . cp <nUm> CH2NSc <nUm> CMe <nUm> will catalytically hydrogenate ( <nUm> atm of H <nUm> ) me <nUm> CCN to me <nUm> CCH <nUm> NH <nUm> ; however , termination occurs by insertion of the nitrile into the scandium - amide bond to form cp <nUm> ScNC(CMe <nUm> )NHCH <nUm> CMe <nUm> , the NC bond of which is not hydrogenated under these conditions . labeling experiments show that hydrogen can add reversibly across the Sc-N bond of the amide , and this step is believed to play a crucial role in the catalytic reaction . 
the ansa - borane complex (Me2S)(C6H5)B C10Cl2H8Zr ( 1 ) reacts selectively with <nUm> equiv of C6F5Li to give (Me2S)(C6H5)B (C5H4)2Zr(C6 F5)2 ( 2 ) and with <nUm> equiv C6F5Li to form the borato-bridged complex [Li(Et2O)3][(C6F5)(C6 H5)B(C5H4) 2Zr(C6F5)2 ] ( 3a ) . the C6F5 groups are exchanged for me by reaction with AlMe3 to form [Li(Et2O)x][(C6F5)(C6 H5 ) B(C5H4)2ZrMe2 ] ( 4 ) . treatment of BCl3 with (SiMe3)(SnMe3)C5H4 affords BCl(C5H4SiMe3)2 ( 5 ) , which undergoes a dehalosilylation reaction with ZrCl4(Me2S)2 to give Cl(Me2S)B(C5H4)ZrCl2 ( 6 ) . the reaction of <nUm> with C6F5Li proceeds in a fashion similar to that of <nUm> , leading first to (Et2O)ClB(C5H4)2Zr(C6 F5)2 ( 7 ) and with <nUm> equiv of C6F5Li to [Li(Et2O)4][(C6F5)2 BC10H8Zr C6F5 ] ( 9a ) in <nUm> % yield . the yield is improved through the use of BrC6F5Mg at <nUm> ° C . C6F5 groups are readily exchanged for me through reaction with LiMe to give [Li(Et2O)4] [ BC12F10 (C5H4)2ZrMe2 ] ( 10a ) . complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> are catalysts for ethene polymerization when activated with MAO or AlBu3i / [CPh3] [B(C6F5)4] . 
the effect of counterion on the kinetics and mechanism of ethylene polymerization by the zirconocene - boron catalytic system was examined using the density functional theory approach . A comparative study of three model catalytic species , namely , ethylzirconocene cation , Cp2ZrEt+ , and two ion pairs of composition Cp2ZrEt+A- ( A- = CH3B(C6F5)3- , B(C6F5)4- ) was carried out . it was shown that the nature of counterion affects mainly the ratio between the most stable b-agostic and nonagostic Cp2ZrEt+A- isomers , the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of ethylene addition to the Cp2ZrEt+A- ion pairs , and the chain propagation kinetics . the weaker the nucleophilicity of the counterion , the higher the fraction of the b-agostic isomer , the higher the exotermicity , and the lower the activation barrier to ethylene addition to Cp2ZrEt+A- , and the lower the activation energy of chain propagation . all possible pathways of the interaction between Cp2ZrEt+CH3B(C6F5) 3- and ethylene molecule were examined and compared . among all species of composition Cp2ZrEt+CH3 B(C6F5)3- , the nonagostic isomer was found to be the most reactive toward ethylene . 
sequential additions of NaOEt and benzyl chloride ( BzCl ) to diethyl adipate in THF afforded EtOOCCH(Bz)CH2CH2CH(Bz)COOEt ( 3 ) in high yield via successive dieckmann condensations . this was converted to CH2CH2(2-indene)2 ( 2 ) using standard synthetic methodology , from which <nUm> g of CH2CH2(2-indenyl)2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) was prepared . incorporation of a 1-alkyl substituent gave rac and meso isomers CH2CH2(1-R-2-indenyl)2ZrCl2 ( r = me , 12r , <nUm> m ; r = et , 14r , <nUm> m ) . methylation gave rac- and meso-CH2CH2(1-Me-2-indenyl)2-ZrMe2 ( 15r , <nUm> m ) and CH2CH2(2-indenyl)2ZrMe2 ( 16 ) . CH2CH2(4-Ph-2-indene)2 ( 20 ) was prepared similarly to <nUm> using 2-phenyl benzylbromide and diethyladipate / NaOEt , from which rac- and meso-CH2CH2(4-Ph-2-indenyl)2ZrCl2 ( 19r and <nUm> m ) were prepared . alkylation of <nUm> m gave meso-CH2CH2(4-Ph-2-indenyl)2ZrMe2 ( <nUm> m ) . the 4-phenyl metallocenes rac- and meso-CH2CH2(1-Me-4-Ph-2-indenyl)2 Cl2Zr ( 25r and <nUm> m ) were prepared via <nUm> . C2 - symmetric CH2CH2(1,3-Me2-2-indenyl)2 Cl2Zr ( 29 ) was prepared to compare its polymerization behavior with <nUm> . these zirconocenes displayed activities of up to <nUm> kg PE / ( g zr*h ) for the polymerization of ethylene ( <nUm> bar , <nUm> ° C , hexane ) to linear PE . the activity was much lower ( 2-20 kg / ( g zr*h ) ; liquid propylene , <nUm> ° C ) for the polymerization of propylene to low molecular weight atactic polypropylene . alkyl groups in the 1- and / or 3-positions led to a significant reduction of 2,1-insertions from <nUm> % in the polymer from <nUm> / MAO , and <nUm> % from <nUm> / MAO , to <nUm> - <nUm> % . attempts to prepare an isospecific catalyst were unsuccessful ; substituent variation i.e. , 4-phenyl in <nUm> , did not provide effective enantiomorphic site control . addition of H has a dramatic activation effect ( > 100-fold ) in propylene polymerization and afforded saturated propylene oligomers with activities up to <nUm> kg / ( g zr*h ) . the low polymer molecular weights allowed detailed NMR analysis of the end groups , which enabled the chain transfer and metallocene activation mechanisms to be identified . copolymerization of ethylene and propylene ( in liquid propylene at <nUm> ° C with <nUm> mol % ethylene ) afforded copolymers with activities of 1300-12500 kg / ( g zr*h ) . reactivity ratios ( rE = 41-98 , rp = <nUm> - <nUm> , rErP = <nUm> - <nUm> ) indicate a very high preference for sequential ethylene insertions . copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene ( <nUm> bar ethylene , heptane , <nUm> ° C ) gave copolymers with activities of up to <nUm> kg / ( g zr*h ) using 12r / MAO . the copolymer microstructure showed highly preferential sequential ethylene incorporation : rE = ca. <nUm> , rH = <nUm> . 
possible structural candidates for the active ( III ) and dormant ( IV ) species in dimethyl-zirconocene - catalyzed , MAO (methylaluminoxane)-activated olefin polymerization have been studied via density functional theory ( DFT ) . these species are [Cp2ZrMeAlMe3]+[MeMAO] - ( III ) and [Cp2ZrMe]+[MeMAO]- ( IV ) , respectively , where me = CH3 and cp = n5-C 5H5 . relative energies in gas phase and toluene solution as well as 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts have been calculated . these chemical shifts have been compared with 1H and 13C NMR data from new experimental investigations studying the interaction between Cp2ZrMe2 and MAO in toluene solution.1 by combining experimental and theoretical results , we have been able to identify the most likely candidates for both the dormant and active species . moreover , we are able to predict that an Al / Zr ratio of ~ <nUm> : <nUm> at <nUm> K is necessary in order for all of the Cp2ZrMe2 to bind to MAO as the structures we propose for III and IV . this ratio corresponds to the disappearance of the following species from solution : free Cp2ZrMe2 , the weak complex of Cp2ZrMe <nUm> and MAO ( I ) , and [ Cp2ZrMe(m-Me) cp 2ZrMe]+-[MeMAO]- ( II ) . such a mixture would have a IV / III ratio of ~ <nUm> : <nUm> . 
reaction of me <nUm> si(e <nUm> -Me <nUm> C <nUm> )( t BuN)TiCl <nUm> with lithium indenide and methyllithium in a one - pot fashion produces a chiral ansa - titanocene imido complex , which is an effective initiator for syndiospecific polymerization of MMA . 
an ansa - zirconocene compound , [2,2'-meth-ylenebis(1,3-dimethylcyclopentadienyl)]zirconium dichloride ( 5 ) , bearing methyl substituents on the carbons adjacent to a bridgehead carbon , was synthesized by key steps of the catalytic pauson - khand reaction and the retro-Diels-Aider reaction . the crystal structure of <nUm> was determined . the small angle ( <nUm> ° ) between the two centroids of the cyclopentadienyls and a zirconium atom and the absence of any substituents on the positions β with respect to the bridgehead carbon indicate that the coordination site for catalysis is widely opened . compound <nUm> , when activated with MAO , showed good performance for copolymerization of ethylene with a bulky monomer such as norbornene . the activity and norbornene incorporation ability are much better than those of [Ph2C(Fluo)(Cp)]ZrCl2 . 
A remarkably stable diborate anion as the metallocene polymerization catalysts was investigated . the multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonding was obtained in the molecular structure of the amidodiborate anion . In regard with it , the treatment of zirconocene dimethyls that resulted in the obtaining of highly active alkene polymerization catalysts was reported . 
the synthesis and use of the ansa - zirconocene complexes [ Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5 -C5H3R)]-ZrCl2 ( r = H ( 5 ) , me ( 6 ) , et ( 7 ) , iPr ( 8 ) , tBu ( 9 ) , SiMe3 ( 10 ) ) as catalysts in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene has been studied . the alkyl complexes [ Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5 -C5H3R)]-ZrMe2 ( r = H ( 11 ) , me ( 12 ) , et ( 13 ) , iPr ( 14 ) , tBu ( 15 ) , SiMe3 ( 16 ) ) have also been prepared . the reaction of 11-16 with BC18F15 gave the cationic species [ { Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5 -C5H3R)}-ZrMe]+ ( r = H ( 17 ) , me ( 18 ) , et ( 19 ) , iPr ( 20 ) , tBu ( 21 ) , SiMe3 ( 22 ) ) . In the absence of cocatalyst , 17-22 have been shown to act as catalysts in the polymerization of ethylene . the molecular structures of <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies . 
the reaction of Cl4Ti with (chlorodimethylsilyl)(trimethylsilyl)cyclopentadiene results in the chemoselective elimination of Me3SiCl and cleanly affords ((chlorodimethylsilyl)cyclopentadienyl)titanium trichloride ( 2 ) . likewise , the reaction of Cl4Ti with (chlorodimethylsilyl)(trimethylsilyl)tetramethylcyclopentadiene ( 6 ) also results in the chemoselective elimination of Me3SiCl and cleanly affords ((chlorodimethylsilyl)tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)titanium trichloride ( 7 ) . this observation is in sharp contrast to the reaction of <nUm> with Cl4Zr , which results in the chemoselective elimination of Me3SiCl but affords a mixture of half - sandwich and zirconocene complexes . support of complex <nUm> or <nUm> on (aminomethyl)polystyrene ( AMPS , <nUm> % cross-linking , <nUm> wt % N , <nUm> mmol of N / g of support ) , where the mole ratio of amine content of the support to precursor catalysts was selected to be <nUm> : <nUm> , leads to the assembly of the constrained - geometry catalyst ( CGCs ) <nUm> or <nUm> , respectively . from the 29Si NMR , the presence of a single silicon species was observed in complex <nUm> , which has been attributed to the CGC form . however , for <nUm> two silicon resonances were observed , one of which has been attributed to the CGC form and the other to a titanium amide moiety . the Ti : Si : Cl ratio for both <nUm> and <nUm> was found to be <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> through elemental analyses . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> , in conjunction with MAO as the cocatalyst , were tested for ethylene homopolymerization and ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization . the thermal properties and the molecular weights of the resulting polymers were determined . the observation of ethylene-co-1-octene provides independent evidence for the formation of supported CGC from the synthetic protocol . 
cyclopenta[b]indole - based ansa - zirconocenes were prepared and studied as catalysts for propylene polymerization . substituted 2-methyl-4-R-1,4-dihydrocyclopenta[b]indoles ( r = ph , 7a ; r = o-Tol , 7b ; r = me , 7c ) were synthesized and converted into the racemic forms of the corresponding ansa - zirconocenes Me2Si(2-Me-4-R-cyclopenta[b]indolyl)2ZrCl2 ( r = ph , 10a ; r = o-Tol , 10b ; r = me , 10c ) . the structure of 10a was determined by x-ray analysis . the effectiveness in polymerization catalysis of the metallocenes compared to benchmark metallocenes rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 11 ) and rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4,5-BzInd)2ZrCl2 ( 12 ) was investigated in liquid propylene at <nUm> ° C . both 10a and 10b with MAO cocatalyst afforded highly isospecific ( mmmm <nUm> , <nUm> % , respectively ) and highly regisospecific polypropylene ( <nUm> , <nUm> % imbedded regioerrors ) , which exhibited a high melting point ( tm2 = <nUm> , <nUm> ° C ) . the polymer properties were intermediate between those of <nUm> and <nUm> , with the molecular weight , stereospecificity , and melting point increasing in the order <nUm> < 10a,b < <nUm> . although activities 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than for <nUm> and <nUm> were found at high MAO / Zr ratios , at low cocatalyst levels activities were similar . 10a,b were also successfully activated with alternative aluminoxanes based on branched alkylaluminums ( e.g. Al(CH2CHMePh)3 , obtained from a-methylstyrene ) , with measured activities up to <nUm> TON / ( ( g of Zr ) h ) ( 10a / AKO ) . surprisingly , no consistent effect on polymer properties of varying either the 4-aryl substituent of the cyclopenta[b]indole group or the cocatalyst was found . 
novel C1 - symmetric group <nUm> ansa - metallocene complexes Me2Si(C5Me4)(2-R-Ind)MCl2 ( r = H , m = Ti ( 5a ) , Zr ( 5b ) ; r = me , m = Ti ( 6a ) , Zr ( 6b ) ) were prepared from the reaction of dilithium salt of the corresponding ligands Me2Si(C5Me4H)(2-R-IndH) ( r = H , me ) with appropriate group <nUm> metal halides . crystal structures of 5a , 6a , and 6b determined by x-ray diffraction studies reveal chiral C1 - symmetric nature irrespective of the type of metal and ligand . the complexes 5a , 5b , 6a , and 6b were tested for the polymerization of propylene in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) at various temperatures . all of them exhibit good activity and afford moderate to high isotactic polypropylenes . In the case of titanocenes ( 5a and 6a ) , polymerization activity , molecular weight , and isotacticity of polypropylene sharply increase as the polymerization temperature decreases , while the increase of polymerization activity and the decrease of isotacticity and molecular weight of polypropylene were observed upon increasing the polymerization temperature in the case of zirconocenes ( 5b and 6b ) . the effect of a 2-Me substituent at the indenyl ring on propylene polymerization was apparent in terms of polymerization activity and molecular weight of polypropylene , especially for zirconocenes , but was minor for titanocenes . 
the sequential reaction of 9-fluorenyllithium and CpNa with ( iPr ) 2NBCl <nUm> followed by the sequential treatment with LDA and ClZr <nUm> afforded [ ( η 5-C 13H 8)BN( i-Pr ) <nUm> ( η 5-C 5H 5H 4)ZrCl <nUm> ( 2e ) . the structure of 2e was determined by x-ray diffraction , which shows that the molecule has C s symmetry . on activation by excess methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) 2e was converted to an active catalyst for polymerization of ethylene and propylene . the polypropylene is syndiotactic ( <nUm> % rr triads ) . 
unbridged bis(2-arylindenyl)metallocene complexes , such as biB(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1a ) , when treated with appropriate activators are active catalyst precursors for the production of elastomeric polypropylene . the proposed mechanism for polymerization involves isomerization of the catalyst between geometries of differing stereoselectivity on a time scale slower than polymer chain growth . As the rotation of the 2-arylindenyl ligand is proposed to result in the different catalyst geometries , the rate at which this rotation occurs is of interest for the interpretation of the behavior of these complexes . A series of zirconocenes { bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dimethyl ( 1b ) , bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dibenzyl ( 1c ) , bis(2-(3,5-di-tert- butylphenyl)indenyl)zirconium dimethyl ( 2b ) , and bis(2-(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl) indenyl)zirconium dibenzyl ( 2c ) } , varying both in the indenyl ligand framework and the s-ligand , has been synthesized . the rotation rates of the methyl-substituted metallocenes are too fast to be determined by standard NMR techniques such as EXSY , line - shape analysis , or magnetization transfer experiments . on - resonance spin - lattice relaxation in the rotating frame ( T 1r ) has been used to determine the rate of rotation of the aryl ligands in 1b , le , and 2b and allowed comparison with the rates obtained for the benzylated species by line - shape analysis . the nature of both the π and the σ ligand systems affects the rate , with sterically bulky substituents resulting in slower rotation . the effect of the σ ligand is substantially stronger than that of the π ligand . 
the dual - site zirconocene dichlorides rac - and meso-SiMe2(3- benzylindenyl)(indenyl)ZrCl2 have been synthesized and used , after a methylaluminoxane activation , in propene polymerization . these diastereomers produce isotactic polypropenes with similar microstructures and molar masses under equivalent polymerization conditions . 
bridged zirconocenes bearing seven - membered rings dichlorodimethylsilylenebis(2-methyl-4-phenyl-4-H-azulenyl)zirconium ( 8a ) and dichlorodimethylsilylenebis(2-methyl-4-phenyl-4-H-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroazulenyl) zirconium ( 4 ) were synthesized . A silylene-bridged ligand was obtained by the reaction of 2-methylazulene , phenyllithium , and dichlorodimethylsilane . after lithiation of the ligand by n-butyllithium , reaction with zirconium tetrachloride gave a rac and meso mixture of <nUm> . the structure was confirmed by x-ray crystallographic analysais . it was found that both of the phenyl groups at the 4-position are oriented outside toward the metal center and the seven - membered ring is not planar . furthermore , reaction with hydrogen in the presence of platinum oxide gave <nUm> . when activated with methylaluminoxane , these complexes showed high catalytic activity for polymerization of propene to give isotactic polypropylene . 
the alkylation and insertion reactions in dichloro azatantalacyclopropane complexes were analyzed . the ethylene and propene insertion reactions into the Ta-C bond of the azatantalacyclopropane system lead to dichloro azatantalacyclopropane complexes . A plausible decomposition process could consist in a b-hydrogen activation and a subsequent rupture of the Ta-C and N-C bonds into a concerted four - center transition state . the alkyne insertion reaction is faster and gives dichloro azatantalacyclopropane complexes which are more stable than the azatantalacyclopropane complexes due to the delocalization of the electronic density along the Ar-N-Ta-C = C bond system . 
the racemic isomers of C 2H 4(1-Ind) 2TiCl <nUm> and me 2Si(2-Me-Benzind) 2TiMe <nUm> were synthesized and structurally characterized . reactions of these and related ansa - titanocene complexes with methylaluminoxane or with the cationizing reagent [ CPh <nUm> ] +[B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] -Ak-Me <nUm> were monitored by UV / vis , 1H NMR , and EPR methods . under conditions approaching those typically used in olefin polymerizations , heterobinuclear cations of the type [ dian Ti IV(m-Me) 2AlMe <nUm> ] + ( with dian = bridged ligand dianion ) dominate in each of these reaction systems , which catalyze the polymerization of propene at temperatures below ambient . above <nUm> ° C , these cations are reduced , mainly to neutral heterobinuclear species DianTi III(m-Me) 2AlMe <nUm> , which appear to be inactive with regard to polymerization catalysis . In the absence of monomer , the main reducing agent appears to be ethyl aluminum admixtures in Al 2Me <nUm> . addition of monomer increases the rate of reduction rather drastically , probably via formation of titanium hydrides . 
A series of chiral ansa zirconocene compounds that feature ( i ) [ me 2Si ] and [ me 4Si <nUm> ] bridges and ( ii ) two tert-butyl substituents on each cyclopentadienyl ring , namely , rac- [ me 2Si(CpBu <nUm> t ) <nUm> ] - ClZr <nUm> , rac - [ me 2Si(CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]Zr(Ph)Cl , rac - [ me 2Si(CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]ZrMe <nUm> , rac - [ me 2Si(CpBu <nUm> t ) 2],Zr(CO) <nUm> rac - [ me 4Si <nUm> ( CpBu <nUm> <nUm> ) 2]ZrCl <nUm> , and rac - [ me 4Si <nUm> ( CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]Zr(CO) <nUm> , has been synthesized . In each case , the complex exists as the racemo isomer due to inter-ring steric interactions between the bu t substituents proximal to the ansa bridge that destabilize the meso isomer . rac - [ me 4Si 2-(CpBu <nUm> t ) 2ZrCl <nUm> is the first structurally characterized ansa zirconocene complex with a [ me 4-Si <nUm> ] bridge that adopts a racemo geometry . IR spectroscopic studies on the dicarbonyl complexes ( cp 1,3-Bu <nUm> t ) 2Zr(CO) <nUm> rac - [ me 2Si(CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]Zr(CO) <nUm> , and rac - [ me 4Si <nUm> ( CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]Zr(CO) <nUm> demonstrate that the [ me 2Si ] and [ me 4Si <nUm> ] ansa bridges have opposite electronic influences in this system , with the [ me 2Si ] bridge exerting an electron - withdrawing effect and the [ me 4-Si <nUm> ] bridge exerting an electron - donating effect . the [ me 2Si ] and [ me 4Si <nUm> ] bridges also exert a different influence with respect to olefin polymerization , with { rac - [ me 2Si(CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]ZrCl <nUm> / MAO } being a more active catalyst system for polymerization of ethylene than is either { ( cp 1,3-Bu <nUm> t ) 2ZrCl <nUm> / MAO } or { rac - [ me 4Si <nUm> ( CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]ZrCl <nUm> / MAO } . 
A detailed computational exploration is presented of the catalytic abilities of heavier group <nUm> ( m = Zr , Hf ) mono(boratabenzene-arene) compounds for linear ethylene oligomerization with the cationic [ ( n6-BC 5H5)-(bridge)-C6H5)M II(C2H4)2]+ complex as active catalyst species , employing a gradient - corrected DFT method . the influence of the boron substitution on the cyclopentadienyl moiety and the length of the boratabenzene-arene connecting bridge on the energy profile of the oxidative coupling and the competing metallacycle growth and decomposition steps has been elucidated . this allowed us to suggest promising modifications of the parent cp - based Ti analogue , which has been described by hessen and co-workers as a catalyst for ethylene trimerization , thereby contributing to the computer - based rational design of improved group <nUm> oligomerization catalysts . the boratabenzene Zr compound bearing a CMe2 - bridge is indicated to be an efficient trimerization catalyst , which should exhibit an activity that exceeds what is reported for the established Ti system . the computational probing reveals for the Hf counterpart a catalytic ability that is different . this system is suggested to possess catalytic potential for production of 1-octene besides the prevalent 1-hexene oligomer product . electronic modification of the substituent on boron can act to modulate the a-olefin product composition toward an enhanced 1-octene portion , although not as the predominant product . 
the indenyl iron compound ( e5-C9H 7)Fe-(e5-C5H5) ( 1 ) was found to react with benzyne , generated from o-trimethylsilylphenyl triflate by fluoride - induced 1,2-elimination , to afford the diels - alder adduct 1,2-(1,4-dihydro-naphthalen-1,4-diyl) ferrocene ( 2 ) . when the bis-(indenyl) iron complexes (e5-R-C9H6)2Fe [ r = H ( 3 ) ; 2-Me ( 6 ) ; 1-SiMe3 ( 9 ) ] reacted with benzyne , the bisadducts [ r = H ( 5 ) ; 2-Me ( 8 ) ; 1-SiMe3 ( 11 ) ] were obtained along with the corresponding monoadducts [ r = H ( 4 ) ; 2-Me ( 7 ) ; 1-SiMe3 ( 10 ) ] . the reaction of tetramethyl-disilylene-bridged bis(indenyl) iron ( me 2SiSiMe2)(e5-C9H 6)2Fe ( 12 ) with benzyne gave only the monoadduct ( 13 ) . complex <nUm> was also tested for ring - opening metathesis polymerization ( ROMP ) in the presence of grubbs ' catalyst [ (PCy3)2 ) 2RuCl2 = CHPh ] but was found to be inactive under normal conditions . the molecular structures of <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> have been determined by x-ray diffraction . 
the synthesis ( 4a-d ) and structure ( 4a,c ) of the four crystalline , water - stable , hydrocarbon- and perfluorocarbon (PFC)-soluble fluorous zirconocene(IV) dichloride precatalysts [ Zr-{n5-C 5H4SiMe3-n(RF)n } 2Cl2 ] ( n = <nUm> , RF = C2H3 2C6F13 ( 4a ) , C8F17 ( 4b ) , C7F5H2 ( 4c ) ; n = <nUm> , RF = CH 2C6F5 ( 4d ) ) , possessing one to three fluorous alkyl or aryl groups attached to the cyclopentadienyl ligand through a silicon atom and an additional methylene ( 4c,d ) or ethylene ( 4a ) spacer or no spacer at all ( 4b ) , are reported . A nonfluorous analogue of 4a , [ zr{n5- C5H4-SiMe2C8H17 } 2Cl2 ] ( 4e ) , was prepared for comparison , and 4a was easily converted to its dimethyl derivative [ Zr{n5-C5H 4SiMe2CH2CH2C6F 13}2Me2 ] ( 5a ) . the ethylene polymerization activities of the zirconocene dichlorides were compared to those of the known bis-{(trimethylsilyl)cyclopentadienyl}zirconium dichloride [ zr{n5- C5 H4SiMe3}2Cl2 ] ( 4f ) , in both toluene and fluorous biphasic solvent ( FBS ) systems . In the case of 4b a PE with a bimodal molecular weight distribution and a significantly lower molecular weight was obtained . polymerization data and polymer properties for 4a-d , compared to data for 4f , show a marked influence of the fluorous groups and the alkyl spacer ( e.g. methylene in 4c or ethylene in 4a ) . FBS conditions result in PE with a higher average molecular weight . evidence on the nature of the active species formed when these precatalysts were treated with an excess of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) is presented . 
summary : In reactions of the zirconocene 2-vinylpyridine complex cp 2Zr(2-vipy) ( 1 ) with iBu2AlH and iBu2AlF the isostructural complexes [ cp 2Zr(m-e1:e2-2-CH2CH- C5H4N)-(m-W][iBu2Al] ( 3 ) and [ Cp2Zr(m-e1:e2-2-CH 2CH-C5H4N)(m-F)][iBu 2Al ] ( 5 ) were formed . these complexes can serve as models for the transfer of fluorine from zirconium to aluminum ( Zr-F with Al-H to Zr-H and Al-F ) found in the reaction of rac - (ebthi)ZrF2 with iBu2AlH to form the dimeric complex [ rac-(ebthi)ZrH(m- H)]2 ( 6 ) . the compounds are important in obtaining an understanding of the activation of zirconocene fluoro complexes by ' BusAl and of the role of iBu2AlH in activation processes for the catalytic polymerization of olefins . 
C1 - bridged and Me2Si - bridged 2,5-dimethylcylcopentadienyl ansa - zirconocene complexes , [ Me(H)C(C5H4)(2,5-Me 2C5H2)]ZrCl2 ( 6 ) , [ ( CH 3CH2CH2)(H)C(C5H4)(2,5- Me2C5H2)]ZrCl2 ( 9 ) , [(Me)(H)C(2,5-Me2C5H2)2]ZrCl <nUm> ( 13 ) , and [ Me2Si(2,5-Me2C5H2) 2]ZrCl2 ( 15 ) , are prepared by using 2-bromo-3-methoxy-2,5- dimethylcyclopentene ( 7 ) as a starting material . solid structures of <nUm> and <nUm> were determined by x-ray crystallography . the C1 - bridged zirconocene complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> are highly active for ethylene / norbornene copolymerization with high incorporation of norbornene , while the Me2Si - bridged complex <nUm> shows relatively low activity . complex <nUm> shows the highest activity and the highest incorporation of norbornene among the complexes , but the molecular weight of the obtained polymer is relatively low . 
the complex Ti(Ph2PNpy)(NEt2)2 ( 2 ) was prepared by the reaction between <nUm> equiv of the neutral ligand Pt 2PNHpy ( 1 ) and <nUm> equiv of the homoleptic titanium tetrakis(diethylamine) . complex <nUm> exhibits two dynamic processes as a function of the temperature . an equilibrium among the diphenylphosphino moieties and a strong agostic interaction between the titanium atom and one of the hydrogens of each of the methylene groups of the diethylamido ligand . the strength of the chelating ligand was studied by its reaction with ethylamine , producing the imido complex <nUm> , showing that during the transformation <nUm> → <nUm> the pyridine rings of the ligand are able to dissociate and recoordinate with different stereochemistries . In the polymerization of propylene by complex <nUm> activated by MAO , elastomeric polymers are obtained . the elastomeric polymers are a result of monomer insertions into two enantiomerically close configuration complexes , as is encountered in cationic nonbridged metallocenes . 
interaction of iPr2NP(C9H 7)(C2B10H11) with <nUm> equiv of M(NR2)4 in toluene gave constrained - geometry group <nUm> metal amides [ e5:s-iPr2NP(C 9H6)(C2B10H10)]M(NMe 2)2 ( r = me , m = Ti ( 1 ) , Zr ( 2 ) , Hf ( 3 ) ; r = et , m = Hf ( 4 ) ) in good yields . compound <nUm> reacted with <nUm> equiv of PhNCO to produce the tri-insertion product [ e5:s-iPr 2NP(C9H6)(C2B10H 10)]Zr[e2-OC(NMe2)NPh] [ η 2-OC(NMe2)N(Ph)C = (NPh)O ] ( 5 ) . No further insertion reaction occurred with another equivalent of PhNCO . instead , the trimer (PhNCO)3 was isolated . compound <nUm> reacted with <nUm> equiv of n-BuLi in toluene to afford , after recrystallization from DME / toluene , the dilithium salt [Li(DME)3] [ e5:s-iPr 2NP(C9H6)(C2B10H 10)Li(DME) ] ( 6 ) . an equimolar reaction of <nUm> with acetylacetone resulted in the formation of zr(acac)4 . <nUm> exhibited an ethylene polymerization activity of <nUm> × <nUm> g PE mol-1 atm-1 h-1 upon activation with MMAO . furthermore , <nUm> was also able to efficiently initiate the polymerization of e-caprolactone to give polymers of high molecular weights ( Mn > <nUm> <nUm> ) and low polydispersities ( MwMn < <nUm> ) through the action of the nucleophilic amido-nitrogen atom , which represents the first example of the polymerization of e-caprolactone catalyzed by group <nUm> metal amides . 
the mechanism of the transition metal catalyzed olefin metathesis reaction with the schrock catalyst is investigated with pure ( BP86 ) and hybrid ( B3LYP ) density functional theory . on the free - energy surface there is no adduct between ethylene and model catalyst (MeO)2Mo(CH2)NH but instead a single transition on a flat surface giving a metallacyclobutane with a trigonal bipyramidal conformation that has a sizable barrier for conversion to the square pyramidal form . the model was expanded to the active asymmetric schrock catalyst and investigated with QM / MM , using BP86 for the QM part and AMBER <nUm> for the MM part , for the experimentally known ring - closing metathesis of a symmetrical triene . the factors effecting chiral induction to the observed product are delineated . 
enolizable ketones and thiols have been investigated as potential transfer agents for methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) polymerization mediated by the cp <nUm> ZrMe <nUm> / B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> system . addition of 1-10 equiv of acetophenone , acetone , or thiophenols inhibits polymerization , while the system tolerates the presence of tert-butylthiol ( tBuSH ) . In this case , a moderate decrease in the molecular weight of the PMMAs is observed . the stoichiometric reactivity of these organic acids toward the cationic ester enolate complex [ cp <nUm> Zr(THF)(O(tBuO)C = CMe <nUm> ) ] + [ MeB-(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - ( 1 ) , which models the active species for MMA polymerization , has been investigated . ketones undergo aldolization reactions with <nUm> to generate species that are inactive in MMA polymerization . thiols readily cleave the Zr-O bond of <nUm> to give [ cp <nUm> Zr(SR)(THF) ] + cations ( r = tBu , <nUm> ; SC <nUm> H <nUm> -p-Cl , <nUm> ; SC <nUm> H <nUm> -o-OMe , <nUm> ) . the crystal structure of <nUm> has been determined . In the presence of a tert-butyl ester R'CO <nUm> tBu , thiolato complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> smoothly decompose into the corresponding cationic carboxylato complex [ cp <nUm> Zr(THF)(O <nUm> CR' ) ] + ( R' = iPr , <nUm> ; CH <nUm> , <nUm> ) and thiol RSH , with release of isobutene . tert-Butylthiolato complex <nUm> and the in situ combination cp <nUm> Zr(StBu)Me / B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> polymerized quantitatively MMA in toluene to yield PMMAs with narrow dispersity ( m n / m w = <nUm> - <nUm> ) , but with molecular weight much higher than the expected m n values , consistent with poor initiation efficiency and / or instability . 
the synthesis of a series of titanium dichloro and di(isopropoxy) complexes with a 1,4-dithiabutanediyl-linked bis(4,6-disubstituted phenolato ) ligand was analyzed . the NMR spectra of the dichloro complexes with small ortho substituents R1 = H , me , 1Pr were in agreement with C 2-symmetrical helical structure and the complexes became fluxional at higher temperature . the corresponding di(isopropoxy) complexes were fluxional in solution at room temperature due to rapid interconversion between the δ and λ isomers . the results show that upon activation with methylaluminoxane , the stereorigid derivatives efficiently polymerize styrene to give isotactic polystyrene . 
reactions of alkyllithium compounds RLi ( r = me , et , i-Pr , Np ) with BC18F15 result in the formation of the alkylborate salts Li[RB(C6F5)3] . metathesis reactions of these with ph3 - CCl and chloride salts of ( ph 3P)2N+ , PMePh3+ , and HNMe2Ph+ proceed with varying degrees of success , as shown by NMR spectroscopy and electrospray mass spectrometry , and the compounds [PPN][EtB(C6F5)3] , [PMePh3] [NpB(C6F5)3]3 , and [ HNMe 2Ph][NpB(C6F5)3] have been characterized crystallographically . all three anions assume the expected pseudotetrahedral structures with normal B - aryl bond lengths and R-B-aryl and aryl - B - aryl bond angles . the compound [HNMe2Ph] [ NpB(C 6F5)3 ] reacts with Cp2ZrMe <nUm> , (Indenyl)2ZrMe2 , and SBIZrMe2 to give propylene polymerization catalysts that are significantly more active and give higher molecular weight polypropylene than do the catalysts obtained using BC18F15 . thus the [ NpB(C6F 5]- anion is for steric reasons more weakly coordinating than is [MeB(C6F5)3]- . 
A kinetics study of b-methyl elimination reactions of the compounds Cp2ZrNp(m-Me)B-(C6F5)3 ( in various solvents ) and Cp*2ZrNp(m-Me)B(C6F 5)3 ( in CD2Cl2 ) shows that the reactions are accelerated by polar solvents and by steric crowding in the cp* system , results consistent with previous findings and conclusions that the methyl migrations are accompanied in a concerted process by borate anion departure from the inner coordination sphere of the metal ion . surprisingly , however , the isobutyl compound Cp*2Zr(i-Bu)(m-Me)B(C 6F5)3 , which is expected to undergo / ? -methyl elimination by analogy with an extensive literature on chain transfer processes during propylene polymerization , undergoes very rapid b-hydrogen elimination only . 
reactive intermediates in living olefin polymerization over homogeneous catalysts based on bis[N-(3-tert-butylsalicylidene)-2,3,4,5,6- pentafluoroanilmato]titanium(IV) dichloride ( L2 - Cl2Ti ) have been studied . outer sphere ion pairs [L2TiMe(S)] +[Me-MAO]- and [L2TiMe(S)]+- [B(C6F5)4]- ( S = solvent molecule ) , formed by activation of L2TiCl2 with MAO or with AlMe <nUm> / [CPh3]+[B(C6F5)4] - , and reactions of these ion pairs with ethene to afford chain - propagating species [L2TiP]+[Me-MAO]- and [ L 2TiP]+[B(C6F5)4] - ( P = growing polymeryl chain ) have been characterized by 1H , 13C , and 19F NMR spectroscopy . 
chromium - based ethylene trimerization catalyst precursors ( ( PNP OMe-d 12)CrPh <nUm> ( 4 ) and ( PNP OMe-d 12)CrPh 2Cl ( 7 ) ) having a bis(diphenylphosphino)amine ligand ( o-CD 3OC 6H <nUm> ) 2PN(CH 3)P(o-CD 3OC 6H <nUm> ) <nUm> ( ( PNP OMe-d <nUm> ) = <nUm> ) have been prepared and characterized . A thioether analogue ( o-CD 3SC 6H <nUm> ) 2PN-(CH 3)P(o-CD 3SC 6H <nUm> ) <nUm> ( ( PNP SMe-d <nUm> ) = <nUm> ) and its triphenylchromium complex ( PNP SMe)CrPh <nUm> ( 5 ) have also been synthesized . the solid - state structures of <nUm> and <nUm> display octahedral geometries with a κ 3-(P,P,O) coordination of pNP OMe ligands having chromium-oxygen bond lengths of <nUm> - <nUm> Å . compound <nUm> differs , exhibiting (S,P,S)-k <nUm> coordination of the PNP SMe ligand . the deuteromethyl groups allow for 2H NMR characterization of these paramagnetic complexes in solution . dynamic exchange processes occur in solution at room temperature to render all four of the methoxy or thioether groups equivalent on the 2H NMR time scale ; two distinct coalescence processes are observed by variable - temperature 2H NMR spectroscopy for all compounds . the neutral species <nUm> and <nUm> react with ethylene ( <nUm> atm ) by insertion into chromium-phenyl bonds with the release of styrene and ethylbenzene , but 1-hexene is not observed under these conditions . activation of <nUm> by protonation and activation of <nUm> by halide abstraction in the presence of ethylene provide active trimerization catalysts that give turnover numbers for 1-hexene as high as <nUm> mol 1- hexene*mol <nUm> Cr . these catalysts display comparable activity and selectivity for 1-hexene compared to the original BP system , where the catalyst is generated in situ from ClCr 3(THF) <nUm> , <nUm> , and MAO . both the well - defined systems and the ClCr 3(THF) <nUm> / PNP OMe / MAO system provide catalysts that undergo an initiation period followed by an apparent first - order decomposition process . activated complexes <nUm> and <nUm> initiate trimerization primarily through ethylene insertion into the chromium-phenyl bond , followed by b-hydrogen elimination and reductive elimination to give the active species , rather than via reductive elimination of biphenyl . 
seven new conjugated symmetric and unsymmetric fulvene ligands L1-L7 were synthesized . thirteen new organometallic coordination polymers and supramolecular complexes were obtained through selfassembly based on these new fulvene ligands in the benzene / toluene mixed solvent system . compounds 1-13 have been fully characterized by infrared spectroscopy , elemental analysis , and single - crystal x-ray diffraction . the results indicate that the coordination chemistry of new fulvene ligands is versatile . they can adopt either a cis or a trans conformation to bind Ag (I) ion through not only the terminal -CN and thiophene functional groups but also the fulvene carbon atoms into organometallic coordination polymers or discrete complexes . In addition , the luminescent properties of L1 , L3 , L5 , and L7 and some of their Ag (I) complexes were investigated preliminarily in EtOH and the solid state . 
benzyl-substituted bis(amido)cyclodiphosph(III)azane complexes [(RN)(t-BuNP)]2M(CH2Ph)nCl2-n ( m = Zr , Ti ; n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) bearing t-Bu or bulky aryl substituents on amido nitrogens were prepared by direct alkylation of corresponding dichloro derivatives with PhCH2MgCl . the alkylation of Zr complexes proceeded selectively . In the solid state of [(t-BuN)(t-BuNP)]2Zr(CH2Ph)2 the zirconium atom adopts a distorted trigonal - bipyramidal configuration . the alkylation of [(t-BuN)(t-BuNP)]2TiCl2 with PhCH 2MgCl in the presence of THF led to [(t-BuN)(t-BuNP)] 2Ti(CH2Ph)2 simultaneously with [(t-BuN)(tBuNP)]2Ti(CHPh)(THF) . according to NMR and x-ray single - crystal studies , the latter contains a Ti-C double bond . activation of the benzyl complexes with BC12F10 led to the generation of the corresponding " cationic " species , which were further investigated by 1H , 13C , 31P , and 19F NMR methods . In the solid state the metal center of { [(t-BuN)(t-BuNP)]2Zr(e2-CH2Ph)(Et 2O)}+[PhCH2B(C6F5) 3]- has a distorted trigonal bipyramidal configuration , where the benzyl group coordinates to Zr in a e2-fashion . In ethene polymerization the mono- and dibenzyl Ti and Zr derivatives showed moderate to high catalytic activities ( up to <nUm> kg / ( mol x h ) ) . the correlation between polymerization results and activation experiments , especially in terms of electrophilicity of the metal center , is discussed . 
A series of half - sandwich aryloxide titanium complexes , [ CpTi(OAr)Me <nUm> ] ( cp = CH ; ArO = C6HO 3Me2-2,6 , OC6H3Et2-2,6 , OC6H3iPr2-2,6 , C6HO 3tBu2-2,6 , and OC6HPh 4-2,3,5,6 ) , have been synthesized . these compounds react with BC18F15 to give thermally unstable complexes [CpTi(OAr)Me][MeB(C6F5)3] . two different deactivation pathways have been identified within the series . the tetraphenylphenoxide cationic methyl compound decomposes cleanly at room temperature to give [ CpTi(OC6HPh4-2,3,5,6)(C 6F5){CH2B(C6F5) <nUm> } ] and methane with a first - order rate constant of <nUm> × 10-4 s-1 at <nUm> ° C . for relatively smaller aryloxide ligands , ArO = OC6H3iPr2-2,6 , OC6H3tBu2-2,6 , a me / C 6F5 exchange takes place , yielding CpTi(OAr)Me(C 6F5 ) and MeB(C6F5)2 . the cationic titanium complexes are shown to be active for the polymerization of 1-hexene . At <nUm> and <nUm> ° C , first - order dependence on the concentration of 1-hexene is observed . the rate of polymerization decreases with increasing steric hindrance of aryloxides except for ArO = OC6HPh 4-2,3,5,6 . 
the 1-metallacyclopent-3-ynes Cp2Ti(e4-H 2C4H2 ) ( 1 ) ( cp = e5- cyclopentadienyl ) and rac(ebthi)Zr(e4-H2C 4H2 ) ( 2 ) ( ebthi = 1,2-ethylene-1,1'- bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl) react with B(C6F 5)3 under ring opening of the metallacycle and formation of the zwitterionic complexes [Cp2Ti]+-CH 2C ≡ CCH2-[B-(C6F 5)3 ] ( 3 ) and [rac-(ebthi)Zr]+-CH 2C ≡ CCH2-[B-(C6F5) <nUm> ] ( 4 ) . crystal structures of <nUm> and <nUm> show a but-2-yne-1,4-diyl ligand bridging the metallocenium center and the formed boranate . complex <nUm> is an active catalyst for ethylene polymerization . 
In the reaction of the decamethylzirconocene-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complex Cp*2Zr(e2-Me3-SiC 2SiMe3 ) ( 1 ) with i-Bu2AlH , CH bond activation , an electrophilic substitution , and alumination of the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand resulted in formation of the e5-C5Me4CH2-Al(i-Bu) 2H ligand . the final product contains an alkenyl complex that shows an agostic C-H ⋯ Zr interaction , Cp*Zr[ - C(SiMe3) = CH(SiMe3)](m-H)[e5-C5Me 4CH2-Al(i-Bu)2 ] ( 2 ) . heating complex <nUm> gives the heterobimetallic complex Cp*Zr[ - C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe 3)Al(i-Bu)(m-H)(CH2-e5-C 5Me4 ) ] ( 3 ) , which is formed by an intramolecular reaction , analogous to intermolecular reactions of titanocene- and zirconocene - alkyne complexes with i-Bu2AlH , which yield the well - known heterobimetallic complexes with tetracoordinated planar carbon atoms . both complexes were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystal structure analysis . complex <nUm> catalyzes the ethene polymerization and the ring - opening polymerization of e-caprolactone . 
combined car - parrinello and QM / MM dynamic simulations have been carried out in order to investigate the polymer chain propagation and termination processes in ethylene polymerization catalyzed by zirconocene with the counteranion [CH3B(C6F5)3]- included . A complete account is given not only of the potential energy profile ( PEP ) but also of the free energy profile ( FEP ) for the first and second steps of ethylene insertion , as well as of the chain termination . solvation effects were included on the basis of a continuum model . special attention was given to the counteranion mobility in the catalytic process and the possible differences between PEP and FEP . two different modes of attack by ethylene , cis and trans to the counteranion [CH3B(C6F5)3] - , were considered . In general , the FEPs differ from the PEPs in the barrier height and the shape . the FEP gives a higher barrier over PEP due to entropic contributions . the transition state of ethylene uptake by the metal center , the ethylene p-complex , and the ethylene insertion transition state are all clearly present on the FEPs . this is not always the case for the PEPs , especially for the trans pathway . the calculated FEPs for the chain propagation indicate that the cis pathway is preferred over the trans pathway for both the first and second insertions . for the energetically favorable cis pathway , the ethylene insertion into the Zr-Ca bond rather than the ethylene uptake by the metal center is the rate - determining step for both PEP and FEP ( with / without solvation effects included ) . free dynamic simulations without any constraint on the process after ethylene insertion show that the counteranion can recoordinate to the metal center again in a period of less than <nUm> ps . In comparison with the estimated time scale of the chain propagation , the counteranion which was displaced by ethylene in the ethylene uptake process has sufficient time to recombine with [Cp2ZrR]+ again before a new monomer approaches to the metal center . this is in good agreement with very recent experiments . the energetically most favorable pathway for the chain termination corresponds to the cis approach , with a free energy barrier of <nUm> kcal / mol . 
A series of carbosilane dendritic compounds gn - ONNMem , containing one ( n = <nUm> ) , four ( n = <nUm> ) , eight ( n = <nUm> ) , or <nUm> ( n = <nUm> ) terminal pyridylimine ligands , substituted with m methyl groups ( m = <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) , and nickel complexes gn - ONNMemNiBr2 , comprising monometallic to metallodendritic structures , have been synthesized . the nickel complexes , in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , are active catalysts for the concurrent transformation of ethylene into mixtures of toluene - insoluble polyethylene and oily oligomers . oligomers consist of mixtures of olefins that follow a schulz - flory distribution , and polymers are found to be highly branched low molecular weight polyethylene . the variation of the pyridylimine ligand framework by methyl substituents has a decisive influence on the activities of the nickel compounds . also , the size ( i.e. , generation n ) of the dendritic precursor acutely affects the catalyst performance and the microstructure of the insertion products . thus , higher generation catalysts show superior oligomerization activities and produce less branched polyethylene polymers with higher molecular weights . 
substituted 4- / 7-halo-1H / -indenes and 5-methyl-3-bromo-4- / 6H-cyclopenta[b] thiophenes were shown to be convenient starting materials for suzuki - miyaura , negishi , and murahashi protocols to give the corresponding aryl-subsituted indenes and cyclopenta[b]thiophenes of importance for further synthesis of ansa - metallocenes . alternatively , (2-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)boronic acid and (1-methoxy-2-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-4-yl)boronic acid as well as the respective organozinc and -magnesium reagents can be used for synthesizing aryl-subsituted indenes via the Pd - catalyzed reactions with aryl halides . these synthetic methods were shown to have a very broad scope to afford libraries of aryl-substituted indenes . finally , synthesis and structure characterization of several representative chiral ansa - zirconocenes , potentially useful as components of highly active and stereoselective olefin polymerization catalysts , have been performed . 
we present a DFT study of the monometallic group transfer polymerization ( GTP ) of methyl acrylate ( MA ) catalyzed by Sm - based and Zr - based metallocenes . the processes examined are the generation of the catalytically active species , the subsequent C-C coupling reaction , and the ring opening of a metallacyclic stable intermediate , resting state of the polymerization process , obtained from the C-C coupling . the mechanism for a neutral zirconocene , a cationic zirconocene , and a neutral samarocene are compared . the isoelectronic neutral samarocene and cationic zirconocene systems share many features , which explains their similar behavior in both the C-C coupling ( no energy barrier on the potential energy surface ) and the MA - assisted opening of the metallacycle . an analysis of the factors driving polymer stereoregularity in the processes catalyzed by the neutral samarocene and the cationic zirconocene has led to identifying a relationship between stereoregularity and the relative disposition of the acrylate and enolate ligands , as well as the direction of the incoming MA molecule in the opening of the metallacycle resting state . on the basis of these discoveries a kinetic model has been developed , which has proved successful in qualitatively predicting stereoregularity . 
dibenzyl complexes [ Ti(OC6H2-R1-6-R 2-4)2{S(CH2)2S}(CH 2Ph)2 ] ( 2a-c ; R1 = tBu , r <nUm> = me , a ; R1 , R2 = tBu , b ; r <nUm> = H , R2 = me , c ) with a tetradentate dianionic [OSSO] - type ligand were synthesized from the corresponding titanium dichloro complexes [ Ti(OC6H2-R1-6-R2-4) 2{S(CH2)2S}Cl2 ] and benzylmagnesium chloride in toluene . NMR spectroscopic monitoring of the reaction of the dibenzyl complex 2b with BC18F15 in bromobenzene indicates the formation of a thermally sensitive benzyl cation [ Ti(OC6H2-tBu2-4,6) 2{S(CH2)2S}(CH2Ph)]+ . 1H NMR spectra at <nUm> ° C show two C1 - symmetric diastereomers in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio , suggesting slow epimerization on the NMR time scale at this temperature . the benzyl complex 2c , which does not bear bulky ortho-substituents , was found to be fluxional and unstable in solution . related benzyl complexes of the 1,5-dithiapentanediyl-linked ligand [ Ti(OC 6H2-tBu-6-R-4)2{S(CH 2)3S}(CH2Ph)2](4a,b ; r = me , a ; r = tBu , b ) were synthesized in an analogous manner ' and were also shown to be highly fluxional and unstable in solution , decomposing immediately upon addition of BC18F15 . using the 1,4-dithiabutanediyl-linked dibenzyl complexes and the activators [ PhNMe 2H][B(C6F5)4] / AlnOct <nUm> , the living isospecific polymerization of styrene could be achieved for the first time . the resulting isotactic polystyrenes show narrow molecular weight distributions ( mw / Mn < ∼ <nUm> ) . A linear relation between the number - averaged molecular weights Mn and the monomer conversion was observed . 
series of neutral and cationic palladium carbosilane dendritic compounds of the general formula gn - ONNMem[Pd(X)Y] ( x , Y = Cl ; x = me , Y = Cl ; x = me , Y = MeCN ) , containing <nUm> ( n = <nUm> ) , <nUm> ( n = <nUm> ) or <nUm> ( n = <nUm> ) terminal pyridylimine complexes , substituted with m methyl groups ( m = <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) , along with the corresponding monometallic counterparts ( n = <nUm> ) , have been synthesized . monometallic or dendritic chloro methyl or cationic methyl palladium compounds consist of a cis / trans mixture of diastereoisomers , with compositions according to their electronic and steric features . the cationic compounds gn - ONNMe m[PdMe(MeCN)]+ are found to be active catalysts for the alternating copolymerization of CO and 4-tert-butylstyrene , producing mainly syndiotactic polyketones due to a chain - end stereocontrolled mechanism . modification of the pyridylimine ligand framework by methyl substituents has a decisive influence on the activities of the palladium compounds . some of them are found to retain some activity after several days of catalytic reaction . also , the size ( i.e. , generation n ) of the dendritic precursor affects the catalyst performance and the microstructure of the copolymerization products . thus , higher generation catalysts show superior activities and produce shorter and less stereoregular copolymer chains . 
the polymerization of norbornene in the presence of different bis(salicylaldiminate)copper(II) complexes and methylalumoxane has been investigated . In all cases a high molecular weight vinyl-type polymer was obtained . the presence of electron - withdrawing nitro groups on the chelate ligand markedly increased the activity of the catalyst . the influence on the catalytic performances and polymer characteristics as a function of reaction parameters , such as temperature , duration , and content of free trimethyl aluminum in the commercial MAO , was studied . 
this work reexamines the reaction of the tantalocene trialkyl complex cp 2TaMe <nUm> with the strong organo lewis acids ( LAs ) E(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ( e = B , Al ) under various reaction conditions , investigates the activation of schrock 's alkylidene complex cp 2Ta( = CH 2)Me with Al(C 6F 5)3 , and employs the alkylidene complex for the polymerization of functionalized alkenes such as methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) and N,N-dimethylacrylamide ( DMAA ) . three cationic and zwitterionic tantalocene complexes have been isolated and structurally characterized , the cation [ cp 2TaMe <nUm> ] +[MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - ( 1 ) , the zwitterion cp 2Ta +[CH 2Al(C 6-F <nUm> ) <nUm> -]Me ( 2 ) , and the cation [ cp 2Ta(CH 2)MeAl(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] +[Al(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - ( 3 ) . complex <nUm> , which is formed by the unusual nucleophilic attack of a C 6F <nUm> group within the aluminate moiety in <nUm> on Al(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> present in excess , consists of a cationic portion that can be viewed as a hybrid of two extreme structures : cp 2-Ta +[CH 2Al(C 6F <nUm> ) 2]Me and the cationic tantalocene alkylidene-LA adduct [ cp 2Ta( = CH 2)MeAl(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] + . the investigation into the scope of such a unique reaction type shows it to be specific to the aluminate / alane ( A1 - / A1 ) pair . all three isolated complexes are inactive for polymerization of MMA and DMAA ; however , the combination of cp 2Ta( = CH 2)Me with <nUm> equiv of Al(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> is highly active , producing high-molecular-weight polymers presumably via an A1 - / A1 bimolecular propagation process . 
tetrabenzo[a,c,g,z]fluorene ( Tbf-H , <nUm> ) was deprotonated with n-butyllithium , leading to ionic tbf - LiLn complexes <nUm> and <nUm> , consisting of well - separated cations ( Li(THF)4 ( 5 ) , Li(DME) <nUm> ( 6 ) ) and tbf anions . subsequent reactions with chlorotitanium alkoxides ClxTi(OiPr)4-x : ( x = <nUm> , <nUm> ) and chlorotitanium phenoxides {ClTi(OR)3(THF)}2 ( r = C 6H5 ( 12 ) , 4-MeC6H4 ( 13 ) , 4- tBuC6H4 ( 14 ) ) give a series of e5-tetrabenzo[a,c,g,i]fluorenyltitanium complexes ( TbfTiCl 2(OiPr) ( 11 ) and TbfTi(OR)3 [ r = iPr ( 10 ) , C6H5 ( 15 ) , 4-MeCe6H4 ( 16 ) , 4-'BuC6H4 ( 17 ) ] ) , which were characterized by NMR , MS , and IR measurements and x-ray crystallography . additionally , the compounds ' properties regarding the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene when activated with MAO were explored . the activities increase in the following order [ kg sPS / ( mol Ti × mol styrene × h ] : <nUm> ( 1420 ) < <nUm> ( 3400 ) < <nUm> ( 3740 ) < <nUm> ( 6040 ) < <nUm> ( 6720 ) . 
A comprehensive account of the synthesis , properties , and evaluation of a wide range of ethylene homopolymerization catalysts derived from imido titanium compounds supported by the triazacyclic ligands Me3[9]aneN <nUm> and R3[6]aneN3 is described ( me 3[9]aneN2 -1,4,7-trimethyltriazacyclononane ; r 3[6]aneN3 = 1,3,5-trimethyl- or 1,3,5-tris(n-dodecyl) triazacyclohexane ) . conventional preparative - scale reactions afforded the triazacycle - supported imido titanium compounds Ti(NR)(Me3[9]aneN 3)Cl2 ( r = tBu ( 1 ) , 2,6-C6H 3Me2 , 2,6-C6H3iPr <nUm> , ph , C6F5 , or CH2Ph ( 6 ) ) . solid phase - supported analogues of <nUm> and <nUm> ( linked by either the macrocycle or imido ligand to a <nUm> % cross-linked polystyrene support ) and representative me 3[6]aneN3 solution phase systems Ti(NR)(R 3[6]aneN3)Cl2 ( r = me or n-dodecyl ) were also synthesized . At ambient temperature , solution phase Me3[9]aneN <nUm> catalyst systems were more active for ethylene polymerization ( methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) cocatalyst ) than their solid phase - supported or Me3[6]aneN3 analogues . A library of <nUm> other triazacyclononane - supported catalysts was prepared by the semiautomated , sequential treatment of Ti(NMe2)2Cl2 with RNH2 and Me3[9]aneN3 . the ethylene polymerization capabilities of <nUm> compounds of the type Ti(NR)(Me 3[9]aneN3)Cl2 were evaluated at <nUm> ° C ( MAO cocatalyst ) and compared in representative cases to the corresponding productivities at ambient temperature . whereas either bulky n-alkyl or n-aryl imido substituents in the compounds Ti(NR)(Me3[9]aneN 3)Cl2 were sufficient to give highly active catalysts at ambient temperature , only those with bulky n-alkyl groups excelled at <nUm> ° C . polymer end group analysis indicated that polymeryl chain transfer to both AlMe3 and ethylene monomer is an active mechanism in these systems . the use of MAO pretreated with BHT-H ( BHT-H = 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol ) led to higher productivites , increased polymer molecular weights , and more polymer chain unsaturations , but productivity decreased when a large excess of BHT-H was used . the reactions of the well - defined alkyl species Ti(N tBu)(Me3[9]aneN3)Me2 , [ Ti(N tBu)(Me3[9]aneN3)-Cu-Me)2AlMe 2]+ , and [ Ti(NtBu)(Me3[9]aneN 3)Me]+ with BHT-H were examined , and the aryloxide compound [Ti(NtBu)(Me3[9]aneN3)(BHT)][BAr 4F ] was isolated ( ArF = C6F <nUm> ) . the x-ray structures of Ti(NR)(Me3[9]aneN 3)Cl2 ( r = tBu , 2,6-C6H 3Me2 , 2,6-C6H3Pr2 , ph , C6F5 ) and Ti(NR)(Me3[6]aneN3)Cl <nUm> ( r = 2,6-C6H3iPr2 , ph , C6F5 ) are reported . the perfluorophenyl imido titanium compounds both exhibit well - defined supramolecular structures based on C ⋯ F intermolecular interactions . 
ethylene polymerization using catalysts derived from activation of zirconocene aluminohydride complexes with either methyl aluminoxane or B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> is reported . variable - temperature NMR spectra of mixtures of cp* 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> or cp' 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> and excess B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> reveal the formation of di- or polynuclear metallocenium ion - pairs featuring terminal or both terminal and bridging borohydride counteranions HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> arising from hydride abstraction . At higher T , ion - pairs featuring the terminal HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> counterion decompose , and the AlH <nUm> that is liberated degrades B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> to furnish mixtures of ( C 6F <nUm> ) nAlH 3-n and , in the case of cp* 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> , a new ion - pair partnered with the diborohydride counteranion [ cp* 2ZrH][(m-H) 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] . the latter compound was independently prepared from cp* 2-ZrH <nUm> and HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> and is active in ethylene polymerization ; however it is <nUm> times less active than the catalyst formed from cp* 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> and B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> and so can not account for the multisite behavior of the latter combination . there is evidence of chemical exchange between " free " or terminal HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> and excess B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> in these mixtures , and on the basis of model studies with [ nBu 4N][HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] and B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> , this involves reversible formation of [ nBu 4N][(C 6F <nUm> ) 3B)(m-H)B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , which can be detected by 19F NMR spectroscopy in solution at low T . 
the reaction of the titanacycle CpTi(NPt - Bu3)(C 4H8 ) ( 1 ) with benzyl halides , 4-bromo-l-butene , and allyl chloride proceeds with loss of ethylene to give CpTiX(NPt-Bu3) ( CH2Ph ) ( x = Cl , <nUm> ; Br , <nUm> ) , CpTiBr-(NPt-Bu3)(CH 2CH2CHCH2 ) ( 5 ) , and CpTiCl(NPt-Bu 3)(CH2CHCH2) ( 6 ) , respectively . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were readily alkylated to CpTiMe(NPt-Bu3)(CH2Ph) ( 7 ) and CpTiMe(NPt-Bu3)(CH2CHCH2) ( 8 ) , respectively . loss of ethylene also occurs on reaction of <nUm> with bipyridine to give CpTi(NPt-Bu3)(bipy) ( 9 ) . In contrast , reaction of <nUm> with ClSiMePh2 in the presence of PMe3 gave CpTiCl(NPt-Bu 3)(CH2CH2-SiPh2Me) ( 10 ) . In a similar fashion , the two-carbon derivatives CpTiCl(NPt - Bu3)(CH 2CH2SiMe3 ) ( 11 ) , CpTiCl(NPt-Bu 3)(CH2CH2Si(SiMe3)3) ( 12 ) , CpTi(NPt-Bu3)(CH2CH2SiMe 3)(OSO2CF3) ( 13 ) , CpTiCl(NPt-Bu 3)(CH2CH2Snn-Bu3) ( 14 ) , CpTiCl(NPt-Bu3)(CH2CH2SiCl3) ( 15 ) , and [CpTiCl(NPt-Bu3)(CH2CH2)]2-SiCl2 ( 16 ) were produced . In the absence of PMe3 , reaction of <nUm> with Cl4Si and ClSnMe3 gave the four-carbon derivatives CpTiCl(NPt-Bu3)(CH2CH2CH2CH 2SiCl3 ) ( 17 ) and CpTiCl(NPt - Bu3)(CH 2CH2CH2CH2-SnMe3 ) ( 18 ) , while reaction of <nUm> with ClSnPh3 gave only the two-carbon chain derivative CpTiCl(NPt-Bu3)(CH2CH2SnPh <nUm> ) ( 19 ) . nonetheless , in the presence and absence of PMe3 reaction of <nUm> with ClBcat or ClPPh2 gave the analogous two- and four-carbon derivatives CpTiCl(NPt-Bu3)(CH2CH 2Bcat ) ( 20 ) , CpTiCl(NPt-Bu3)(CH2CH 2CH2CH2Bcat ) ( 21 ) , CpTiCl(NPt-Bu 3)(CH2CH2PPh2)(22) , and CpTiCl(NPt-Bu3)(CH2CH2CH2CH 2PPh2 ) ( 23 ) , respectively . the corresponding species CpTiCl(NPt-Bu3)(CH2CH-(CH3)CH(CH 3)CH2PPh2 ) ( 24 ) was prepared from CpTi(NPt-Bu3)(CH2CHMe)2 ( 2 ) , while complexation of <nUm> and <nUm> afforded CpTiCl(NPt-Bu3)(CH2CH 2CH2CH2PPh2)RhCl(cod) ( 25 ) and CpTiCl(NPt-Bu3)(CH2-CH(CH3)CH(CH 3)CH2PPh2)RhCl(cod) ( 26 ) . the mechanisms affording the functionalized two- and four-carbon derivatives above are discussed and the implications considered . 
A series of alkyl- and aryl-imido titanium dialkyl compounds Ti(N'Bu)(Me <nUm> [9]aneN <nUm> )R <nUm> ( r = me ( 1 ) , CH <nUm> SiMe <nUm> ( 3 ) , CH <nUm> t bu ( 4 ) , CH <nUm> ph ( 5 ) ) , Ti(NR)(Me <nUm> [9]aneN <nUm> )Me <nUm> ( r = i Pr ( 6 ) , ph . ( 7 ) , 3,5-C <nUm> H <nUm> ( CF <nUm> ) <nUm> ( 8 ) , 2,6-C <nUm> H <nUm> i Pr <nUm> ( 9 ) , 2-C <nUm> H <nUm> CF <nUm> ( 10 ) , 2-C <nUm> H <nUm> t bu ( 11 ) ) , and Ti(NR)(Me <nUm> [9] aneN <nUm> )(CH <nUm> SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> ( r = i Pr ( 12 ) , Ar F ( 13 ) ) were prepared and crystallographically characterized in the case of <nUm> , 6-9 , and <nUm> ( me <nUm> -[9]aneN <nUm> = 1,4,7-trimethyl triazacyclononane ; Ar F = C <nUm> F <nUm> ). these compounds , isolobal with the titanocenes cp <nUm> TiR <nUm> , were thermally stable at elevated temperatures except for <nUm> . reaction of <nUm> with [ ph <nUm> C][BAr F <nUm> ] ( TB ) and diisopropylcarbodiimide in CH <nUm> Cl <nUm> gave the Ti-Me insertion product [ Ti(NPh)(Me <nUm> [9] - aneN <nUm> ){MeC(N i Pr ) <nUm> }][BAr F <nUm> ] ( 15-BAr F <nUm> ). the corresponding reaction of <nUm> in the absence of organic substrate gave [ Ti <nUm> ( m-NPh ) <nUm> ( me <nUm> [9]aneN <nUm> ) <nUm> Cl <nUm> ][BAr F <nUm> ] <nUm> via a solvent activation reaction . the roomtemperature ethylene polymerization capabilities of the dialkyl compounds were evaluated using TB cocatalyst in the presence of Al i bu <nUm> ( TIBA ) . among the dimethyl precatalysts , only the systems <nUm> and <nUm> , with the bulkiest imido groups , showed high productivities ( <nUm> and <nUm> kg mol <nUm> h <nUm> bar <nUm> , respectively ) . the productivites of the other ferf - butyl imido precatalysts <nUm> and <nUm> ( <nUm> and <nUm> kg mol <nUm> h <nUm> bar <nUm> , respectively ) were substantially lower than that of <nUm> . the catalyst system <nUm> / TIBA ( <nUm> equiv , no added TB ) was also active for ethylene polymerization ( <nUm> kg mol <nUm> h <nUm> bar <nUm> ). the less productive imido dialkyl precatalysts all formed complex mixtures on exposure to TIBA . the polyethylenes produced with <nUm> , <nUm> , and 5-11 generally had m w / m n values in the range <nUm> - <nUm> . the PE formed with <nUm> / TB / TIBA was terminated only by methyl end groups , consistent with chain transfer to TIBA followed by subsequent b-H transfer by the resultant titanium isobutyl cation . the alkyl cations [ Ti(N t bu ) ( me <nUm> [9]aneN <nUm> )R ] + ( r = me or CH <nUm> SiMe <nUm> ) reacted rapidly with TIBA in C <nUm> d <nUm> Br at <nUm> ° C , forming isobutene . DFT calculations found that TIBA adducts of the model methyl cation [ Ti(NMe)(H <nUm> [9]aneN <nUm> )Me ] + were energetically favorable by ca. <nUm> to <nUm> kJ mol <nUm> . whereas <nUm> alone or with AlMe3 present has been shown to form only ph <nUm> CMe on reaction with [ ph <nUm> C ] + , <nUm> : <nUm> mixtures of <nUm> and TIBA gave ph <nUm> CH as the only tritylcontaining product , suggesting a key role for transient [ Al i bu <nUm> ] + in the activation process for these catalysts . overall , the imido group in the Ti(NR)(Me <nUm> [9]aneN <nUm> )Me <nUm> / TB / TIBA catalysts systems appears to have two roles : to stabilize the dialkyl precatalyst toward degradation by the TIBA itself prior to activation , and to inhibit the formation of catalytically inactive hetero- or homo-bimetallic complexes . 
using the Sm / I2Sm mixed system , organochlorosilanes ( r 3SiCl ) undergo reductive dimerization reactions to give the corresponding disilanes in moderate to good yields . the Sm / I2Sm mixed system also can be applied successfully to the polymerization of l,4-bis(dimethylchlorosilyl)benzene and dichloromethylphenylsilane , which affords the s-p conjugate poly(disilanylenephenylene) ( m w / Mn = <nUm> , Mn = <nUm> ) and poly(methylphenyl) silane ( mw / Mn = <nUm> , Mn = <nUm> ) with a sharp molecular distribution . 
cationic intermediates formed upon activation of an olefin polymerization catalyst based on bis[N-phenylpyrrolylaldiminato]titanium(IV) dichloride ( L 2TiCl2 , I ) and [ n-(3-tert-butylsalicylidene)-2,3,4,5,6- pentafluoroanilinato-N'-phenylpyrrolylaldiminato]titanium(IV) dichloride ( L'LTiCl2 , II ) with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) have been identified . outer - sphere ion pairs of the type [L2TiMe(S)]+[MeMAO] - and [L'LTiMe(S)]+[MeMAO]- capable of ethene polymerization have been characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy . unlike methyl metallocenium cations , the barrier of the first ethene insertion into the Ti-Me bonds of these species is not significantly higher than that of subsequent insertions . surprisingly , whereas homoligated catalyst precursors L2TiCl2 in the presence of MAO are prone to ligand transfer to aluminum , under the same conditions the heteroligated system L'LTiCl2 / MAO proved resistant to ligand scrambling . 
the mechanisms of the two most likely routes for the generation of stereodefects in the syndiospecific polymerization of propylene , mediated by the Cs - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes Me2CCpFluZrR +X- ( 1 ) , Me2CCp(3,6-di-Me-Flu)ZrR +X- ( 2a ) , Me2SiCp(3,6-di-Me-Flu)ZrR +X- ( 2b ) , and Me2CCp(3,6-di-tBu-Flu)ZrR +X- ( 3 ) ( X- = MeB(C6F 5)3- , FAl(Bipf)3 - , MAOMe- ) are explored using density functional theory . site epimerization events ( also known as back - skip or missed insertion ) generate defective single m dyads , while enantiomeric misinsertions are the main source of double mm triads . the most important factor affecting the frequency of enantiomeric misinsertion is the structure of the ligand , while the counterion and solvation have little effect . site epimerization is also influenced by the nature of the ligand system , but the bulk and the charge distribution of the anion are more prominent factors . the inclusion of solvent effects in the modeling of the site epimerization is critical for explaining reactivity and to achieving at least qualitatively correct results . application of the two - parameter probabilistic scheme developed by farina and co-workers allows for the prediction of pentad distributions from the computed selectivities . the good agreement found between experiment and computations for the basic unsubstituted system invented by ewen and razavi validates the proposed model . thus , the computed pentad distributions may be used for assessing the effectiveness of modifications to the ligands on syndioselectivity . increasing the bulk of 3,6-substituents on the fluorenyl ligand leads to increased syndiotacticity , without significantly affecting the reactivity . by introducing a stereogenic center on the alkyl chain , it is possible to assess the influence of chain end control on stereoselectivity . the main effect of chain end control is to increase the stereoselectivity after a stereoerror . 
the <nUm> : <nUm> combination of Ti{CGC}Me2 ( <nUm> ; CGC = me 2Si(Me4C5)(tBuN) ) with B(C6F 5)3 was found to feature a so far unrevealed thermal robustness in methacrylate polymerization that enables it to operate in a broad temperature range ( 0-100 ° C ) with a living behavior . highly effective ( <nUm> kg PMMA*mol ti-1*h-1 ) and productive ( monomer - to - Ti ratio up to <nUm> ) homopolymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) and effective diblock and triblock copolymerization of MMA with butyl methacrylate ( BMA ) were thus achieved at <nUm> ° C . the robust " constrained geometry " titanium system has been used to investigate thiols as possible chain transfer agents in MMA polymerization . neutral alkylthiolato and thiophenolato complexes [Ti{CGC}(X)(Y)] ( <nUm> , x = me , Y = tBuS ; <nUm> , x = me , Y = o-MeOC6H4S ; <nUm> , x = Y = iPrS ; <nUm> , x = Y = PhCH2S ) have been synthesized by protonolysis of <nUm> with thiols and shown to polymerize MMA once activated by a lewis acid such as BC6F5 <nUm> . combinations <nUm> / BC18F15 / tBuSH polymerized quantitatively MMA in toluene to yield PMMAs with narrow polydispersity ( mw / Mn [?]1 <nUm> ) , but no effective chain transfer was evidenced , whatever the conditions used . the stoichiometric reaction of tBuSH and o-MeOC6H4SH with the cationic enolate complex [ Ti{CGC}(O(OiPr)C = CMe2)-(THF)]+[MeB(C 6F5)3]- ( 8 ) revealed that thiols do cleave the Ti - o(enolate) bond of <nUm> to give the alkylthiolato and thiophenolato titanium cationic species ; however , this pathway proceeds remarkably slowly in comparison with that with a similar Zr - o(enolate) bond . 
the successful [Ph2PN(iPr)PPh2]Cr- catalyzed trimerization and tetramerization of ethylene to 1-hexene and <nUm> -octene requires the presence of a cocatalyst , of which methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) is particularly relevant . density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations are reported on the interaction of various MAO models with chromacycloheptane intermediates . chromacycloheptanes are well established to be important intermediates during the selective chromium - catalyzed trimerization and tetramerization of ethylene , effectively resembling appropriate models for a study of MAO interaction with chromium complexes during active catalysis . A systematic study is presented evaluating different (AlOMe)n cage structure models for MAO , as both " classic " MAO cages and cages activated by interaction with trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) , comparing methylation aptitudes of TMA versus MAO models and evaluating the interaction of MAO models with chromacycloheptane intermediates . from the results the importance of the use of realistic ligand and large MAO models is shown to be a prerequisite for obtaining accurate catalyst activation data . In particular , use of a " stripped - down " ligand [Me2PN(Me)PMe2] on chromacycloheptane in combination with a relatively small MAO cage [ ( AlOMe ) 6*(AlMe3) ] results in the optimization of formally coordinated chromacycloheptane-MAO complexes , even with increased steric congestion on chromium upon coordination of an additional ethylene moiety . In contrast , use of the " full " ligand [ Ph2PN( iPr)PPh2 ] and larger MAO cages [ ( AlOMe ) 9*(AlMe3) ] shows that while the formation of formally coordinated chromacycloheptane - MAO complexes are successfully optimized in the absence of additional ethylene , only dissociated ion - pair complexes are present when an additional ethylene molecule is introduced . from these results important insight is gained on the role of MAO during catalysis , as well as the model requirements for both MAO and chromium complexes to conduct fundamental theoretical studies in selective chromium - catalyzed ethylene oligomerization .

half - titanocenes containing aryloxide ligands immobilized on the chain end of ring - opened poly(norbornene)s , (C5Me5)TiMe 2[O-2,6-R2C6H2-4-CH{CH-(1,3-cyclo- C5H8)-CH}nCHCMe2Ph ] [ r = H ( 1 ) , me ( 2 ) , iPr ( 3 ) ] , prepared by living ring - opening metathesis polymerization ( ROMP ) by Mo(N-2,6-i-Pr2C6H 3)(CHCMe2Ph)(OtBu)2 , have been prepared and identified by 1H and 13C NMR spectra , elemental analysis , and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy . these complexes showed high catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) cocatalyst , and the effect of the substituent on the aryloxide on both the activity and molecular weight of the resultant polymer was the same as that using nonsupported (C5Me5)TiCl 2(O-2,6-R2C6H3) ( r = H , me , iPr ) . complex <nUm> showed both notable catalytic activities and efficient 1-hexene incorporation with the same monomer reactivity ratio as nonsupported (C5Me5)TiCl2(O-2,6- iPr2C6H3 ) ( 3' ) for ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization in the presence of MAO . 
gently warming the e6,e5-bis(indenyl) zirconium dimethoxyethane compound ( e6-C9H 5-1,3-(SiMe3)2)-(e5-C 9H5-1,3-(SiMe3)2)Zr(DME) ( 1-DME ) to <nUm> ° C resulted in C-O bond scission to yield an equimolar mixture of the zirconocene ethylene compound ( e5-C9H 5-1,3-(SiMe3)2)2Zr(e 2-CH2 = CH2 ) and the corresponding zirconium bis(methoxide) complex ( e5-C9H5-1,3- (SiMe3)2)2Zr(OMe)2 . monitoring the relative rates of 1-DME versus 1-DME-d10 cleavage by 1H NMR spectroscopy established no kinetic isotope effect ( kH / k d = <nUm> ) , eliminating the possibility of C-H activation in or prior to the rate - determining step . computational studies support a pathway involving rate - determining DME dissociation from the e6 , e5-bis(indenyl)zirconium complex followed by facile e6 to e5 indenyl haptotropic rearrangement and C-O bond scission . corresponding C-S bond cleavage chemistry has been investigated for three thioethers and the mechanism of bond activation compared to the oxygen congeners . 
the novel N-R-quinolinyl-8-amino ligands HL1-5 ( r = 2,6-Me 2C6H3 ( HL1 ) , 2,4,6-Me 3C6H2 ( HL2 ) , 2,6-Et 2C6H3 ( HL3 ) , 2,6-iPr 2C6H3 ( HL4 ) , C6H <nUm> ( HL5 ) ) reacted with Sc(CH2SiMe 3)3(THF)2 to afford the well - defined complexes (L1-5)Sc(CH2SiMe3)2(THF) ( 1-5 ) , which were fully characterized by NMR spectral and x-ray diffraction analyses . complexes 1-3 combined with organoborates to establish binary systems that exhibited high activity for the polymerization of styrene , while <nUm> was less active and <nUm> was almost inert . the cationic complex [ L1Sc(CH 2SiMe3)(DME)2][B(C6F 5)4 ] ( 6 ) was successfully isolated by treatment of <nUm> with [PhMe2NH][B(C6F5)4] , and represents probably the structural model of the initiation active species . remarkably , upon addition of aluminum trialkyls to the binary systems , distinguished improvement in catalytic performances was achieved , among which the ternary system <nUm> / 5AliBu3 / [Ph3C][B(C6F 5)4 ] displayed the highest activity ( <nUm> - <nUm> g mol-1 h-1 ) and syndioselectivity ( r = <nUm> ) via a chain - end control mechanism governed by the concerted steric effect of the ligand and the aluminum alkyls . this represents the first non-cyclopentadienyl stabilized rare - earth metal based catalyst showing both high activity and specific selectivity for the polymerization of styrene , which might shed new light on designing more efficient precursors and further investigation of the mechanism for this polymerization . 
A tantalum complex of a silicon - bridged tetramethylcyclopentadienyl-phenoxy ligand , Et2Si(e5-C5Me4)(3- tBu-5-Me-2-C6H2O)TaCl3 ( 2 ) , was prepared by treating Cl5Ta with the dilithium salt generated by reaction of the corresponding ligand <nUm> with nBuLi in the presence of Et3N in heptane . the molecular structure of <nUm> , as confirmed by x-ray analysis , showed a four - legged piano-stool geometry around the tantalum atom and slightly twisted ligand architecture with a bridging diethylsilylene unit . the tantalum complex <nUm> exhibited moderate catalytic activities for copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene in the presence of iBu3Al / ph 3C[B(C6F5)4] . the methylation reaction of the trichlorotantalum complex <nUm> afforded the corresponding trimethyltantalum complex <nUm> . cationic dimethyltantalum species were generated by treating <nUm> with an equimolar amount of Ph3C[B(C6F 5)4 ] or BC18F15 and found to be thermally stable in o-dichlorobenzene-d4 , even at elevated temperature . 
the dimer of lithium m2,e1-N-[(N,N- dimethylamino)dimethylsilyl]-2,6-diisopropylanilidate [ 1c , [ LiN(2,6- iPr2C6H3)Si(CH3) 2N(CH3)2]2 represented as ( LiL ) <nUm> ] reacted with group <nUm> chlorides to form corresponding compounds , which were crystallized and confirmed by x-ray diffraction analysis as compounds of pseudotetrahedral ZrL2Cl2 ( 2 ) and chloro-bridged dinuclear tetrahedral compounds ZrLCl2(m-Cl)2Li'2THF ( 3 ) , ZrLCl2(m-Cl)2Li'2Et2O ( 4 ) , HfLCl 2(m-Cl)2Li'2Et2O ( 5 ) , and [ ZrLCl 2(m-Cl)]2 ( 6 ) . the catalytic behaviors of group <nUm> compounds were investigated in the presence of MAO as a cocatalyst . compound <nUm> exhibited high activity for ethylene polymerization , while compounds <nUm> and <nUm> showed good activities for both ethylene polymerization and ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization . 
A series of amidate half - titanocene dichlorides , Cp'TiLCl2 [ cp' = cp ( as 5-C5H5 ) or cp* ( as 5-C5Me5 ) , L = N-(2-methylquinolin-8-yl)-p-R- benzamides ; C1 : cp' = cp , r = OMe ; C2 : cp' = cp , r = me ; C3 : cp' = cp , r = H ; C4 : cp' = cp , r = F ; C5 : cp' = cp , r = Cl ; C6 : cp' = cp* , r = OMe ; C7 : cp' = cp* , r = me ] , have been synthesized by the stoichiometric reaction of Cp'TiCl3 with the corresponding potassium amidates . all complexes are fully characterized by elemental and NMR analyses . the molecular structures of complexes C2 and C4 are confirmed by single - crystal x-ray diffraction , and the amidate moieties coordinate the titanium center by imino and alkoxide groups . the systems C1 - C7 / MAO show much higher activities toward ethylene polymerization than CpTiCl3 / MAO or Cp*TiCl3 / MAO systems . the procatalysts ( C6 and C7 ) bearing a cp* ligand exhibit higher activities than their analogues ( C1-C5 ) containing a cp ligand , while the amidate ligands containing electron - donating groups positively affect the catalytic behavior . both increasing the ratio of MAO to titanium and reducing reaction temperature enhance the productivities ; however , the molecular weights of the resultant polymers decrease with higher activities . moreover , the C6 / MAO system performs with high activity in the copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene or 1-octene . 
hetero - bimetallic Ti-Al complexes containing tris(aryloxo)amine ligands of type [ TiR'{(m2-O-2,4-R2C6H 2-6-CH2)(O-2,4-R2C6H 2-6-CH2)2N}][R'2Al(m 2-OiPr ) ] [ 3a,b and 4a ; r = me ( 3 ) , tBu ( 4 ) ; R' = me ( a ) , et ( b ) ] have been prepared by reacting Ti(O iPr)[(O-2,4-R2C6H2-6-CH 2)3N ] [ r = me ( 1 ) , tBu ( 2 ) ] with <nUm> equiv of AlR'3 in toluene . crystallographic analyses of 3a,b and 4a reveal that these complexes have a distorted octahedral geometry around Ti and a distorted tetrahedral geometry around al. complexes 3a,b and 4a exhibited moderate catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization in toluene in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) at 80-120 ° C , and 4a showed higher activity than 3a,b . the tert-butyl analogue ( 4a ) itself polymerizes ethylene without cocatalysts to afford high molecular weight polymer with a uniform distribution , clearly suggesting a hypothesis that cleavage of Ti-O bonds would generate the catalytically active cationic species in this catalysis . 
the synthesis of multisubstituted diphenylmethylene-bridged fluorenyl-cyclopentadienyl proligands Ph2C(3,6-tBu 2FluH)(3-R1-5-R2C5H3) ( flu = fluorenyl ; R1 = tert-butyl , R2 = H ( 2a ) ; r <nUm> = tert-butyl , R2 = me ( 2b ) ; R1 = cumyl , R2 = me ( 2c ) ) was developed using a nucleophilic addition protocol based on regular and activated fulvenes . two highly congested proligands ( 2b,c ) were prepared in a two - step procedure , starting first by addition of [3,6-tBu2Flu]+Li- onto 6,6'-bis(p- chlorophenyl)fulvenes , followed by a Pd - catalyzed reductive dechlorination . the x-ray crystal structures of 2a and 2b*CH2Cl2 were determined . these revealed a preorganized sandwichlike positioning of the fluorenyl and cyclopentadienyl plane fragments , similar to that observed in the metallocenes . the corresponding dichlorozirconium complexes { ph 2C(3,6-tBu2Flu)(3-R1-5-R2-C 5H2)}ZrCl2 ( R1 = tert-butyl , r <nUm> = H ( 3a ) ; R1 = tert-butyl , R2 = me ( 3b ) ; R1 = cumyl , R2 = me ( 3c ) ) were prepared by salt metathesis and characterized by elemental analysis , NMR spectroscopy , and x-ray crystallography ( for 3a,c ) . these C1 - symmetric zirconocenes exist as racemic mixtures of two enantiomers , arising from planar chirality at the cp ring . when activated with MAO , 3a,b showed high activity in the polymerization of propylene ( <nUm> and <nUm> kg of iPP mol-1 h-1 , respectively ; toluene solution , <nUm> ° C ) , affording highly isotactic ( [m] <nUm> <nUm> % ) polymers with molecular weights in the range mw = <nUm> 000-175 <nUm> , which are similar to those obtained with the corresponding CMe2 - bridged catalysts . No activity was observed with the 3c / MAO system , which was proposed to be due to a deactivation involving a cumyl phenyl ring . this was supported by DFT computations on the cationic species [ { ph 2C(3,6-tBu2Flu)(3-cumyl-5-Me-C5H 2)}ZrMe]+ , which revealed facile coordination of the phenyl ring to the metal center , followed by C-H(phenyl) activation at the ortho position with concomitant elimination of methane ; propylene insertion into the resulting ortho-metalated species was found to be thermodynamically unfavorable . 
the alkyl hydrido bis(pyrazolyl)borate reagent Tl(MeHB(3-mesitylpyrazolyl) <nUm> ) ( Tl(MeBpMs) , <nUm> ) has been prepared and used to generate group <nUm> metal MeBpMs complexes . the reaction of <nUm> with ClZr <nUm> affords (MeBpMs*)2ZrCl2 ( <nUm> , MeBpMs* = MeHB(3-mesitylpyrazolyl)(5-mesitylpyrazolyl) - ) . the reaction of <nUm> with M(CH2Ph)4 yields (MeBpMs)M(CH2Ph)3 ( m = Zr ( 3 ) , Hf ( 4 ) ) , bibenzyl , and tl0 , via initial MeBpMs / benzyl exchange to produce <nUm> or <nUm> and Tl(CH2Ph) , followed by thermal decomposition of Tl(CH2Ph) . the reaction of <nUm> with [Ph3C][B(C 6F5)4 ] proceeds by one - electron oxidation of a zirconium benzyl bond to yield [ (MeBpMs)Zr(CH2Ph) 2][B(C6F5)4] ( 5 ) and a series of organic products derived from coupling and H atom transfer reactions of trityl and benzyl radicals . the reaction of <nUm> with [Ph3C][B(C 6F5)4 ] yields [ (MeBpMs)Hf(CH 2Ph)2][B(C6F5)4] ( 6 ) along with Ph3CCH2Ph ( <nUm> % ) as the major organic product . the high yield of Ph3CCH2Ph in this reaction suggests that electrophilic benzyl abstraction competes with oxidative M-CH2Ph bond cleavage in this case . the reaction of <nUm> or <nUm> with <nUm> equiv of [ H(OEt 2)2][B(C6F5)4] affords [(MeBpMs)M(CH2Ph)2(OEt2)][B(C 6F5)4 ] ( m = Zr ( 7 ) , Hf ( 8 ) ) . zirconium complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> exhibit a stronger tendency for e2-benzyl bonding than hafnium analogues <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> . the cationic species <nUm> and <nUm> polymerize ethylene . 
organometallic chemistry has provided the foundation for the development of a wide range of new olefin polymerization catalysts over the last two to three decades . the unraveling of the mechanisms of activation and the mode of action of polymerization catalysts has transformed these former " black - box " systems into some of the best understood catalysts to date . In recent years insight into mechanistic steps such as ligand exchange with main - group - metal alkyls has had particular far - reaching consequences for materials design and new industrial products . this review attempts to summarize the advances made over the last 9-10 years in our understanding of the chemistry of catalyst activation and associated fundamental mechanistic aspects . 
the static DFT calculations and car - parrinello molecular dynamic simulations were performed for a series of half - metallocene ethylene- polymerization catalysts based on Ti(IV) complexes with aryloxy ligands , varied in cyclopentadienide cp / cp* and 2,6-di- / 2-monosubstituted phenoxy ligand combinations . the results confirm the more pronounced conformational flexibility of the monosubstituted systems , demonstrated by a relatively easy rotation of the aryloxy ligand . In the case of the complex with a 2-phenylphenoxy ligand , a substantial decrease in rotational barrier is observed due to the secondary interactions between the phenyl substituent and the methyl protons of cp* . In the catalytically active species derived from the corresponding precatalysts , the barrier for the ligand rotation is decreased compared to the precatalysts . for the monosubstituted aryloxy complexes such an easy rotation allows for the transition between the " nonreactive " and " reactive " propagation pathways ( anti and syn ) , which can lead to an increase in their catalytic activity . 
multinuclear NMR spectroscopic studies of polymerization - active species generated by activation of o-F - substituted and nonsubstituted bis(enolatoimine) titanium complexes with MAO evidence a noncovalent interaction of the o-F moieties with the metal center , which is likely to facilitate living ethylene polymerization via suppression of chain transfer and of b-hydrogen transfer processes . 
the effect of the metal on elementary chain propagation and termination reactions in hafnocene- and zirconocene - catalyzed olefin copolymerization processes has been systematically studied by quantum chemical methods . two consecutive monomer insertions , parallel with the competing chain termination reactions , were studied for copolymerization of ethene with propene , 1-butene , and 1-hexene . for the purpose of a comparative study , analogous species along the reaction pathway were studied for each metallocene / monomer combination . effects due to incorporation of a comonomer were analyzed as a function of both the central metal and the comonomer size . In accordance with the general experimental observations of zirconocenes producing lower molecular weight polymer than the hafnocenes , differences in activation energies for chain propagation and termination are smaller for the zirconocene . for the zirconocene , the activation energy is particularly low for b-hydrogen elimination after secondary comonomer insertion . 
bis(cyclopentadienyl)aluminum and -gallium species of the type (Pytsi)ECp2 [ e = Al ( 2a ) , Ga ( 2b ) ; pytsi = C(SiMe3) 2SiMe2(2-C5H4N) ] have been prepared from NaCp and respective dichlorides (Pytsi)ECl2 in isolated yields of <nUm> % ( 2a ) and <nUm> % ( 2b ) . In addition to applying standard methods of characterization ( NMR spectroscopy , CHN analysis , and MS ) , the molecular structures of both compounds were solved by single - crystal x-ray crystallography . reactions between 2a or 2b with Zr(NMe2)4 in benzene , followed by addition of an excess of ClSiMe3 , gave the first ansa - zirconocene dichlorides with aluminum ( 4a ) or gallium ( 4b ) in bridging position . the gallium compound 4b was isolated in a yield of <nUm> % and characterized by NMR spectroscopy , CHN analysis , and mass spectrometry . the aluminum species 4a could not be obtained in an analytically pure form ; it was characterized by NMR spectroscopy , and its molecular structure was determined by single - crystal x-ray analysis . the angle between the two planes of the cp ligands in 4a was found to be <nUm> ° , which is larger than in cp 2ZrCl2 ( α = <nUm> ° ) and smaller than in silicon - bridged ansa - zirconocene dichlorides ( e.g. , Me2Si(C 5H4)2ZrCl2 : α = <nUm> ° ) . crystallization attempts of 4a from DCCl3 solutions gave crystals of the new species (Pytsi)AlCl[(C5H4)ZrCp] ( 7 ) , which was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single - crystal x-ray analysis . In comparison to the pytsi - containing species 2a and 2b , the less sterically protected compound [ 2-(Me2NCH2)C6H 4]AlCp2 ( 6 ) , which was prepared from NaCp and [ 2-(Me 2NCH2)C6H4]AlCl2 in yields of <nUm> % and characterized by standard methods ( NMR , CHN , and MS ) , reacted with Zr(NMe2)4 to give the known Cp2Zr(NMe 2)2 . the targeted ansa - species was not formed , as judged by 1H NMR spectroscopy . the gallium - bridged compound 4b and cp 2ZrCl2 , respectively , had been tested for polymerizations of ethylene utilizing MAO as an activator ( <nUm> equiv of MAO ; <nUm> or <nUm> mmol of precatalyst ; <nUm> or <nUm> psi ) , resulting in activities of <nUm> to <nUm> for 4b and of <nUm> to <nUm> kg PE ( mol zr)-1h-1atm-1 for Cp2ZrCl2 . 
the NC - nacnacH ligand ( 2 ) was prepared by the deprotonation of the unsymmetrically n5-phenyl , n1-2,6-diisopropylphenyl substituted bis(imino) acetylacetonate nacnacH system ( 1 ) with n-butyllithium followed by cyanation with tosyl cyanide . subsequent deprotonation ( KH ) gave the [NC-nacnac]K salt ( 3 ) , which was transmetalated by reacting it with CpZrCl3(dme) , to yield the complex (NC-nacnac)CpZrCl2 ( 5 ) . addition of one molar equivalent of BC18F15 gave [ ( C 6F5)3B-NC-nacnac]CpZrCl2 ( 6 ) . the compounds <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were characterized by x-ray diffraction . activation of <nUm> with MAO gave an active homogeneous ziegler - natta catalyst for ethylene polymerization . the (NC-nacnac)CpZrCl2 / MAO system is ca. <nUm> times more active than the CN - free reference system (nacnac)CpZrCl2 ( 4 ) / MAO . the BC18F15 - containing system <nUm> / MAO has an activity similar to <nUm> / MAO but allows for much lower MAO concentration before the catalytic activity ceases . 
reaction of (silyl)(silylene)tungsten complex Cp*(OC) 2W(SiMe3)( = SiMes2 ) ( 1 ) with sulfur reagents , S8 and ethylene sulfide <nUm> , afforded cyclic carbene tungsten complex Cp*(S)W{ = C(SiMe3)C( = O)OSi(Mes)2S } ( 3 ) via C = O bond fission of a carbonyl ligand and 1,2-migration of the SiMe3 group from W to the resulting carbene carbon . In contrast to the tungsten complex , reaction of (silyl)(silylene)molybdenum complex Cp*(OC) 2Mo(SiMe3)( = SiMes2 ) ( 2 ) with <nUm> gave e2-thiocarbonyl complex Cp*(S)Mo[{e2-S = C(SiMe3)}C( = O)OSi(Mes)2S ] ( 5 ) , which would be formed by addition of a sulfur atom to the Mo = C bond of a molybdenum analogue of <nUm> . 
the chemistry of a series of ansa - bridged ethylene-bis(hexamethylindenyl) zirconium and hafnium complexes has been explored . treatment of EBI*Li2*THF0.38 with MCl4* THF2 ( m = Zr , Hf ) gives rac - EBI*MCl2 ( rac-2 , rac-3 ) and meso-EBI*MCl2 ( meso-2 , meso-3 ) ( m = Zr and Hf ) , respectively . the rac - and meso-isomers can be separated by fractional crystallization . meso-EBI*ZrMe2 ( meso-4 ) can be prepared by alkylation of meso-2 with MeLi*LiBr . the molecular structures of rac - and meso-2 and rac - and meso-3 have been determined by single - crystal x-ray crystallography . A comprehensive structural comparison between these compounds and related ansa metallocenes has been carried out . rac - and meso-2 and rac - and meso-3 in the presence of modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) are very active catalyst precursors for the polymerization of ethene to give high - density polyethene ( HDPE ) with molecular weights ( mw ) in the range <nUm> 000-220 <nUm> and polydispersities ( mw / Mn ) of ca. <nUm> . the activities of both catalyst precursors rac - and meso-2 are some of the highest reported in the literature , at <nUm> <nUm> and <nUm> <nUm> kgPE / mol met / h / bar , respectively . 
the copolymerization of styrene and ethylene by the cationic half - sandwich scandium alkyl species (e5-C5Me5)Sc(CH 2SiMe3 ) has been computationally investigated by using the quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics ( QM / MM ) method . it has been found that the initiation of styrene polymerization both kinetically and energetically prefers 2,1-insertion ( secondary insertion , free - energy barrier of <nUm> kcal / mol , and exergonic by <nUm> kcal / mol ) to 1,2- insertion ( primary insertion , free - energy barrier of <nUm> kcal / mol , and exergonic by <nUm> kcal / mol ) . this is in contrast to a titanocene - based catalyst system , in which the initiation of styrene polymerization was computationally found to prefer 1,2-insertion , while the subsequent styrene insertion ( polymerization ) proceeds in a 2,1-insertion pattern . In the current Sc - based catalyst system , although the insertion of styrene into the metal - alkyl bond of the active species is kinetically slower than that of ethylene , the formation of a styrene p - complex is more favorable than that of an ethylene complex . also , the insertion of styrene into an ethylene-preinserted species is more energetically favorable than continuous ethylene insertion into the ethylene-preinserted species . these thermodynamic factors could add to a better understanding of styrene-ethylene copolymerization . the thermodynamic preference for the insertion of styrene rather than that of ethylene into the active species with an ethylene end group was not reported for group <nUm> catalyst systems . it is also found that the syndiospecific selectivity is inherently determined by the substituent of the ancillary ligand e5-C5Me5 . 
amine elimination reactions of the scandium tris(amide) complexes Sc[N(SiRMe2)3](THF)n ( r = H , n = <nUm> ; r = me , n = <nUm> ) with <nUm> equiv of the substituted cyclopentadienes C5Me 4R'H ( R' = me , SiMe3 ) afforded the series of thermally stable half - sandwich scandium bis(amide) complexes ( C 5Me5)Sc[N(SiHMe2)2]2 ( 1 ) , (C5Me4SiMe3)Sc[N(SiHMe2) 2]2 ( 2 ) , and (C5Me5)Sc[N(SiMe 3)2]2 ( 3 ) . In the presence of Al iBu3 , activated by an equimolar amount of [ ph 3C][B(C6F5)4] , all these complexes showed high activity toward styrene polymerization to give high-molecular-weight polystyrene ( Mn > <nUm> ) with high syndiotacticity ( rrrr > <nUm> % ) . 
A series of half - sandwich zirconium complexes with imino-quinolinol ligands have been synthesized and characterized . the catalytic behaviors of these complexes toward ethylene polymerization were investigated in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as a cocatalyst . the catalytic behaviors were highly affected by the substituent in both cyclopentadienyl and imino-quinolinol ligands . the cp analogue complexes CpZr[ONNR]Cl2 ( 1a-e ) exhibited high activities up to <nUm> × <nUm> g of PE ( mol of zr)-1 h-1 , whereas the cp* analogue complexes Cp*Zr[ONNR]Cl2 ( 2a-e ) also showed moderate activities for ethylene polymerization . 
A series of chromium (III) complexes , LCrCl3 ( C1-C6 : L = 2-(1H-benzo- [d]imidazol-2-yl)-N-(2,6-R1-4-R2-phenyl) quinoline-8-carboxamide ; C1 : R1 = iPr , R2 = H ; C2 : R1 = et , R2 = H ; C3 : R1 = me , R2 = H ; C4 : R1 = me , R2 = me ; C5 : R1 = H , R2 = H ; C6 : r <nUm> = F , R2 = H ) , was synthesized and characterized by IR spectroscopy , elemental analysis , mass spectra , and magnetic moments . the x-ray crystallographic analysis of complexes C2 and C3 reveals distorted octahedral geometries around the chromium atoms . upon activation with MAO , these complexes exhibit high activities for ethylene oligomerization ( up to <nUm> × <nUm> g.mol - <nUm> ( Cr ). h-1 ) and ethylene polymerization ( up to <nUm> × <nUm> g.mol - <nUm> ( Cr ). h-1 ) . the oligomers were produced with high selectivity for r - olefins ( > <nUm> % ) , and the distribution closely resembled the schultz - flory rule . various reaction parameters were investigated in detail , and the results revealed that both the steric and electronic effects of the ligands effect the catalytic activities of these chromium complexes as well as the distribution of the products formed . 
A series of novel half - metallocene - type group IV metal complexes containing phosphine oxide-phenolate chelating ligands of type CpMCl2[O-2R 1-4R2-6(Ph2P = O)C6H2 ] ( cp = CH , m = Ti , 2a : R1 = R2 = H ; 2b : R1 = ph , R2 = H ; 2c : R1 = tBu , R2 = H ; 2d : R1 = R2 = tBu ; m = Zr , 3b : R1 = ph , R2 = H ; 3c : R1 = tBu , R2 = H ; 3d , R1 = R2 = tBu ) have been synthesized in high yields ( 60-76 % ) from CpMCl3 ( m = Ti , Zr ) with <nUm> equiv of 2R1-4R2-6(Ph2P = O)C 6H2OH in THF and in the presence of triethylamine , and the complexes were identified by NMR and mass spectra as well as elemental analysis . structures for 2a-d and 3d were further confirmed by x-ray crystallography . complexes 2a-d adopt a five - coordinate , distorted square - pyramidal geometry around the titanium center . complex 3d has a six - coordinate , distorted octahedral geometry around the zirconium center , in which the equatorial positions are occupied by oxygen atoms of the chelating phosphine oxide-phenolate ligand and two chlorine atoms . the cyclopentadienyl ring and the oxygen atom of the THF molecule are coordinated on the axial position . when activated by modified methylaluminoxane , all complexes exhibited moderate to high activities toward ethylene polymerization , giving high molecular weight polymer with a unimodal molecular weight distribution . the substituents on ligands and the metal center as well as the reaction conditions have a profound effect on the polymerization . it should be noted that zirconium complexes 3b-d displayed notable ethylene polymerization activity even at high temperature ( <nUm> C ) . moreover , using Ph3CB(C6F 5)4 / i-Bu3Al in place of MMAO as a cocatalyst , 3b-d also generate high molecular weight polymer with high efficiency under the same conditions . 
the potassium salt of <nUm> was transmetalated by reaction with (Cp-allyl)ZrCl3(dme) , yielding the complex (NC-nacnac)Cp- allylZrCl2 ( 2 ) . addition of <nUm> molar equiv of B(C6F 5)3 gave [ (C6F5)3B-NC- nacnac]Cp - allylZrCl2 ( 3 ) , and the subsequent addition of <nUm> molar equiv of BC12F10H to <nUm> gave the hydroborated species [ ((C6F5)3B-NC-nacnac)Cp-(CH 2)3-B(C6F5)2]ZrCl <nUm> ( 4 ) . the hydroboration of <nUm> with <nUm> molar equiv of HB(C 6F5)2 gave an insoluble product . this product was fully characterized by 11B and 13C solid - state NMR and IR , which showed that the hydroboration followed by intermolecular adduct formation ( R-B(C6F5)2- - -NC- - -R' ) occurs , resulting in an organometallic polymer ( 5 ) . In addition to the CN - free [nacnac]Cp - allylZrCl2 ( 6 ) , the hydroborated derivative [ (nacnac)Cp-(CH2)3-B(C6F5) <nUm> ] ( 7 ) was also prepared . complexes 2-7 were activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and gave active catalysts for ethylene polymerization . the polymers produced were linear and had high molecular weight , with polydispersities ( PDI ) of less than <nUm> , indicating that the catalysts are single site . the presence of the allyl group on the cp ring was found to increase the molecular weight of the materials produced . In addition to discrete complexes , an organometallic polymer ( 5 ) was formed . this compound is air stable and , while not very soluble , polymerizes ethylene with good activity . 
the N - heterocyclic carbene ligated scandiumtrialkyl complexes [ { 2,6-C 6H3R2NCH}2CSc(CH 2SiMe3)3 ] ( r = me ( 1 ) ; r = iPr ( 2 ) ) were synthesized by the reaction of <nUm> equiv of [ Sc(CH2SiMe 3)3(THF)2 ] with the corresponding ligand [{2,6-C6H3R2NCH}2C] . their molecular structures have been established by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . upon activation with <nUm> equiv of [Ph3C][B(C6F5) <nUm> ] , complexes <nUm> and <nUm> exhibited high activities up to <nUm> ( kg of polymer ) ( mol of sc)-1 h-1 for 1-hexene homopolymerization , affording polymers with moderate molecular weight ( 18-46 kg mol-1 ) at room temperature . the use of a low reaction temperature of-30 ° C resulted in high molecular weight ( up to <nUm> kg mol-1 ) . the catalyst systems based on complex <nUm> or <nUm> also showed excellent activities for 1-octene or 1-decene polymerization . moreover , in the presence of <nUm> equiv of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] , complex <nUm> proved to be an excellent catalyst for copolymerization of 1-hexene(h) with 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) to give random atactic H / HD copolymers with a wide range of HD contents ( <nUm> - <nUm> mol % ) , a previously unreported copolymer . 
A set of asymmetric bis-indenyl zirconium SiMe2 - bridged ansa - complexes , containing 2-isopropyl-4-arylindenyl and 2-methyl-4- aryltetrahydroindacenyl fragments , have been synthesized . these complexes demonstrate better catalytic activity , stereoselectivty , and polymer molecular weight capability in propylene homo-and copolymerization in comparison to analogues without a tetrahydroindacenyl fragment . 
we have applied 3D-QSAR chemometric tools to analyze the polymerization activity of a series of analogous zirconocene catalysts with different substitution patterns in the cyclopentadienyl rings . the selection of the most stable conformers was performed by means of a conformational analysis of the different catalysts in a step previous to the QSAR study . the calculated QSAR model has been assessed in robustness following a progressive scrambling protocol that helps to check redundancy in the descriptor space . this model presents a good predictive ability as tested with a set of four catalysts . the final model is controlled mostly by steric contributions , which can be related to the weakness of the catalyst - cocatalyst interaction . 
the stoichiometric reactions of n-(2-methylquinolin-8-yl) (R)amides ( L1 - L8 ; L1 , r = ph ; L2 , r = p-FPh ; L3 , r = p-ClPh ; L4 , r = p-(MeO)Ph ; L5 , r = o-MePh ; L6 , r = p-MePh ; L7 , r = me ; L8 , r = CF3 ) with Me3Al afforded the corresponding dimethylaluminum amidate complexes [ me 2AlL ] ( C1-C8 ) . the treatment of n-(2-methylquinolin-8-yl)picolinamide ( L9 ) with <nUm> or <nUm> equiv of Me3Al formed Me2AlL9 ( C9 ) or Me2AlL9*Me3Al ( C10 ) , respectively ; meanwhile , the stoichiometric reaction of L9 with iBu3Al gave iBu2AlL9 ( C11 ) . all organoaluminum amidate complexes were fully characterized by 1H / 13C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis , and the unambiguous structures of complexes C2 , C4 , C9 , and C11 were further determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . with the assistance of <nUm> equiv of BnOH , all dialkylaluminum amidate complexes showed appreciable activities toward the ring - opening polymerization of e-caprolactone and produced polycaprolactones with narrow polydispersity ; the nature of the active species was also investigated . 
trifluoromethyltrimethylsilane , ( CH <nUm> ) 3SiCF <nUm> , in the presence of CsF serves as an excellent CF <nUm> group - transfer reagent , and reaction with cp 2TiF <nUm> in THF gives the titanocene trifluoromethyl fluoride complex cp 2Ti(CF 3)(F) ( <nUm> ; cp = C 5H <nUm> ) in <nUm> % isolated yield . reaction of complex <nUm> with the trimethylsilyl reagents , ( CH <nUm> ) 3SiX ( x = OTf = OSO 2CF <nUm> , Cl , Br , I , N <nUm> , and OSO 2Ph ) , in a tetrahydrofuran or toluene solution affords the corresponding Ti-CF <nUm> derivatives cp 2Ti(CF 3)(X) ( x = OTf ( 2 ) , Cl ( 12 ) , Br ( 13 ) , I ( 14 ) , N <nUm> ( 15 ) , and OSO 2Ph ( 16 ) ) in good isolated yields of 67-84 % . these compounds have been characterized by a combination of reactivity studies , IR and 1H / 13C{ 1H } / 19F NMR spectroscopies , and single - crystal x-ray diffraction . the Ti-CF <nUm> linkage in these complexes is remarkably robust , and although the a-C-F bonds are elongated , there is no evidence of an a-fluoride ( Ti***F- CF <nUm> ) between the electrophilic Ti(IV) metal center and any of the C-F bonds in the trifluoromethyl group in the solid - state or in solution . In the solid - state , these complexes are shock - sensitive ; energetic decomposition of cp 2Ti(CF 3)(F) ( 1 ) produces uniform spherical nanoparticles ranging from ∼ <nUm> to <nUm> nm in size and porous fluorinated oligomers and polymers containing both -(CF 2-CF 2)- and -(CF 2-CFH)- units , as determined by a combination of SEM , XRD , XRF , XPS , and 19F MAS NMR . density functional theory results show good agreement with experimental structural data obtained for cp 2Ti(CF 3)(X) ( x = F ( 1 ) , OTf ( 2 ) , Cl ( 12 ) , N <nUm> ( 15 ) ) and accurately predicts longer Ti-CF <nUm> distances than for each specific CH <nUm> analogue , and the trend extends to structurally related Zr and Hf analogues . simpler model compounds from groups <nUm> and <nUm> ( M(CH <nUm> ) <nUm> , M(CH <nUm> ) <nUm> ( CF <nUm> ) , M(CH <nUm> ) <nUm> ( CCl <nUm> ) , and M(CH <nUm> ) <nUm> ( CF 2CF 2CF 2CF <nUm> ) ; m = Ti , Zr , Hf , Fe , Ru , Os ) ) were also examined and show that , for group <nUm> complexes , p-bonding is a significant factor in shortening the strongly ionic M-CH <nUm> relative to M-CF <nUm> , whereas for the predominantly covalent group <nUm> analogues , p-back - bonding helps to shorten the predominantly covalent M-CF <nUm> relative to M-CH <nUm> . the bonding analysis suggests that the significant elongation of C-F bonds α to metals is mainly a consequence of the electropositivity of the group <nUm> metal centers , with minor , if any , contributions from p-effects ; the bond - lengthening effect is most pronounced at the a-position and decays rapidly on moving away from the metal . 
kinetics associated with the [ (SBI)Zr(CH 2SiMe <nUm> ( C 6H 4)NMe 2)][MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] (1a)-catalyzed polymerization of 1-hexene in a mixed toluene-d <nUm> / chlorobenzene-d <nUm> solvent at <nUm> ° C were investigated via 1H NMR and compared to the kinetics associated with the (SBI)ZrMe(MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ) (1c)-catalyzed polymerization of 1-hexene under identical conditions . In the presence of 1-hexene , both catalysts form an identical propagating species , (SBI)Zr(poly-1-hexyl)(MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ) ( 1b ) , but the concentration of 1b during 1a - catalyzed polymerization is only ca. <nUm> % of the anticipated value . under reaction conditions , 1b reacts reversibly with the model complex p-TMS-C 6H 4-NMe <nUm> ( 2 ) to yield the outer - sphere ion pair tentatively identified as [(SBI)Zr(poly-1-hexyl)(2)] [ MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 1e ) , which acts as an essentially dormant site during 1-hexene polymerization . warming of 1b in the absence of additives generates the well - defined hydridoborate complex (SBI)ZrMe(HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ) ( 1d ) , which does not reinitiate in the presence of 1-hexene . b-Hydride elimination of 1b in the presence of additives such as 1,2-dichloroethane and <nUm> results in catalyst decomposition . 
A number of 2-methyl-4-aryl-5-methoxy-6-alkylindenes and C 2-symmetric me 2Si - bridged ansa - zirconocenes based on them were synthesized . zirconocenes were obtained by means of highly effective and scalable racemo - selective synthetic approach based on the use of a Zr tert-butyl amide complex . the structure of m-(bis-[e 5-6-tert-butyl-5- methoxy-2-methyl-4-tert-butylphenyl-1H-inden-1-yl]dimethylsilanediyl ) dichlorozirconium(IV) ( 14 ) has been established with x-ray analysis . the introduction of a methoxy group into the indenyl fragment of zirconocene significantly improved its catalytic performance ( i.e. , its activity , stereoselectivity , molecular mass potential , and thermal stability ) in the polymerization and copolymerization of propylene in comparison with the benchmark spaleck - zirconocene . the role of the methoxy group is proposed to stabilize the cationic catalytic intermediates , which was confirmed using DFT calculations . 
the observation of weak intramolecular C-H***F-C interactions in group <nUm> (s-aryl)-chelating complexes using NMR spectroscopic and neutron diffraction studies was recently reported . In this work , a new titanium(IV) catalyst precursor supported by a tridentate pyridine-2-phenolate-6-(s-aryl) ligand , featuring a metal center surrounded by multiple CF <nUm> substituents , has been synthesized . the nature of intramolecular interactions in the bis(benzyl) complex in solution was probed using multinuclear NMR spectroscopic experiments ( including [ 1H , 19F]-HMQC and -HMBC ) , which reveal scalar coupling across C-H***F-C interactions between methylene hydrogens and the proximal CF <nUm> group on the s-aryl ( but not the phenolate ) moiety . high activities are observed for ethylene polymerization at different temperatures , which exceed those for the tBu-phenolate congener . 
treatment of Ln(CH 2SiMe <nUm> ) 3(thf) <nUm> ( ln = Sc , Y , and Lu ) with <nUm> equiv of CpPN - type ligands C 5H <nUm> = PPh 2-NH-C 6H 3R <nUm> ( r = me , L 1(Me) ; r = iPr , L <nUm> ( iPr ) ) at room temperature readily generated the corresponding CpPN - type bis(alkyl) complexes <nUm> and 2a-2c . addition of <nUm> equiv of CHLi 2SiMe <nUm> to a mixture of L <nUm> ( iPr ) and LnCl 3(thf) <nUm> ( ln = Sm and Nd ) also afforded the CpPN - type bis(alkyl) complexes 2d and 2e . the cp moiety bonds to the central metal in a classical η <nUm> mode in all CpPN - type complexes <nUm> and <nUm> . In contrast , the cp MePN - type ligands C 5Me 4H- PPh <nUm> = N-C 6H 3R <nUm> ( r = me , L 2(Me) ; r = iPr , L <nUm> ( iPr ) ) behaved differently . L 2(Me) did not react with Sc(CH 2SiMe <nUm> ) 3(thf) <nUm> . similarly , L <nUm> ( iPr ) was also inert to Sc(CH 2SiMe <nUm> ) 3(thf) <nUm> even at <nUm> ° C . when the central metal was changed to yttrium , however , the equimolar reaction between Y(CH 2SiMe <nUm> ) 3(thf) <nUm> and L <nUm> ( iPr ) in the presence of ClLi afforded two bis(alkyl) complexes 3a and 3b . In the main product 3a , [ C 5HMe <nUm> ( η 3-CH <nUm> ) - PPh <nUm> = N-C 6H <nUm> iPr 2]Y(CH 2SiMe <nUm> ) 2(thf) , the ligand bonds to the Y 3+ ion in a rare η 3-allyl / k-N mode , whereas in 3b , ( C 5Me 4-PPh <nUm> = N-C 6H <nUm> iPr 2)Y(CH 2SiMe <nUm> ) 2(LiCl) ( thf ) , the cp ring coordinates to the Y 3+ ion in an η <nUm> mode , and a ClLi unit is located between the Y 3+ ion and the nitrogen atom . when the central metal was changed to lutetium , a bis(alkyl) complex 4a , [ C 5HMe <nUm> ( η 3-CH <nUm> ) - PPh <nUm> = N-C 6H <nUm> iPr 2]Lu(CH 2SiMe <nUm> ) 2(thf) , and a bis(alkyl) complex 4b , ( C 5Me 4-PPh <nUm> = N-C 6H <nUm> iPr 2)Lu(CH 2SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> , were isolated . the protonolysis reaction of the IndPN - type ligands C 9H 7-PPh <nUm> = N-C 6H 3R <nUm> ( r = me , L 3(Me) ; r = et , L 3(Et) ; r = iPr , L <nUm> ( iPr ) ) with Ln(CH 2SiMe <nUm> ) 3(thf) <nUm> ( ln = Sc , Y , and Lu ) generated the IndPN - type bis(alkyl) complexes 5a-5c , <nUm> , and 7a-7c , selectively , where the ind moiety tends to adopt an η 3-bonding fashion . the more bulky FluPN - type ligands C 13H 9-PPh <nUm> = N-C 6H 4R ( r = H , L 4(H) ; r = me , L 4(Me) ) were treated with Ln(CH 2SiMe <nUm> ) 3(thf) <nUm> ( ln = Sc and Lu ) to afford the FluPN - type bis(alkyl) complexes <nUm> and 9a and 9b , where the flu moiety has a rare η 1-bonding mode . complexes 1-9 were fully characterized by 1H , 13C , and 31P NMR ; x-ray ; and elemental analyses . upon activation with AlR <nUm> and [ ph 3C][B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , the scandium complexes showed good to high catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization . the effects of the sterics and electronics of the ligand , the loading and the type of AlR <nUm> , the polymerization temperature , and the polymerization time on the catalytic activity were also discussed . 
A general and effective method for the racemoselective synthesis of bis-indenyl-type ansa - zirconocenes was proposed and successfully applied for the synthesis of several C 2-symmetric ansa - zirconocenes based on 2-methyl-4-aryltetrahydro-s-indacene . this new racemoselective method relies on ClZr 3NH-tert-Bu as a key reagent . the formation of racemic products was confirmed by NMR studies and single - crystal x-ray diffraction . the novel complexes are potent catalysts for isotactic propylene polymerization and ethylene-propylene copolymerization . 
to explore the possibility of producing a narrow distribution of mid- to long - chain hydrocarbons from ethylene as a chemical feedstock , co-oligomerization of ethylene and linear a-olefins ( LAOs ) was investigated , using a previously reported chromium complex , [ ClCr <nUm> ( PNP OMe ) ] ( <nUm> , where PNP OMe = N,N-bis(bis(o-methoxyphenyl)phosphino)methylamine ) . activation of <nUm> by treatment with modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) in the presence of ethylene and 1-hexene afforded mostly C <nUm> and C <nUm> alkene products . the identities of the C <nUm> isomers , assigned by detailed gas chromatographic and mass spectrometric analyses , strongly support a mechanism that involves five- and seven - membered metallacyclic intermediates comprised of ethylene and LAO units . using 1-heptene as a mechanistic probe , it was established that 1-hexene formation from ethylene is competitive with formation of ethylene / LAO cotrimers and that cotrimers derived from one ethylene and two LAO molecules are also generated . complex <nUm> / MMAO is also capable of converting 1-hexene to C <nUm> dimers and C <nUm> trimers , albeit with poor efficiency . the mechanistic implications of these studies are discussed and compared to previous reports of olefin cotrimerization . 
the C1 - symmetric metallocenes rac-[1-(9-e5- fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl)ethane ] zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) and rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6- cyclopenta-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl)ethane]hafnium dichloride ( 2 ) are known to produce elastic polypropylene . they were investigated concerning their temperature stability during the polymerization of propene . after activation of these complexes with triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) / [ CPh 3][B(C6F5)4] , first polymerization experiments ( 80-100 C ) afforded moderate to high activities . however , at these polymerization temperatures , the molecular weights of the produced polymers are significantly decreased , resulting in a waxy appearance and , therefore , a loss of the elastic behavior . the main reason for this behavior , especially for the more significant decrease of the molecular weight in the case of hafnocene <nUm> compared with zirconocene <nUm> , was revealed to occur due to a fast b-methyl transfer reaction . hence , hafnocene <nUm> can form polymer chains with a high selectivity toward allylic chain ends . these macromonomers can be used in the catalytic insertion polymerization for the formation of new grafted copolymers . initial copolymerization experiments with ethene were conducted . 
A series of Ti(IV) post-metallocene bis(benzyl) precatalysts supported by tridentate pyridine-2-phenolate-6-(s-aryl) [O,N,C] ligands , featuring various substituents on the s-aryl ( directly adjacent to the pyridine ring : fluoro , trifluoromethyl , benzo [C4H4] ) and phenolate groups ( tert-butyl , trifluoromethyl , cumyl , 1,1-diphenylethyl ) , have been prepared . multinuclear ( including 1H , 13C , and 19F ) NMR characterizations of the complexes have been performed . the principal purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of these substituents upon ethylene polymerization reactivity and polymer properties . the cumyl-phenolate s-naphthyl Ti precatalyst , in conjunction with [ ph 3C][B(C6F5)4] , displays good activity and produces polyethylene with exceptionally high MW ( Mn = <nUm> × <nUm> ) and an mw / Mn value ( 2.5 ) approaching single - site character at <nUm> C , but multisite behavior is apparent for other catalysts . DFT calculations have been performed to probe the polymerization behavior and the role of the py - adjacent substituent . these studies revealed the possibility of two distinct polymerization reactions , namely conventional and ethylene-assimilated ( comprising initial ethylene insertion into the Ti-C(s-aryl) bond ) chain propagation , and found that the latter is kinetically preferred . furthermore , the viability of another kinetically competitive pathway , namely the isomerization of the ethylene-assimilated [Ti-CH2CH2-aryl] species via b-H elimination and 2,1-reinsertion , was also indicated . 
effects of aryloxo terminal ligands and AlMe3 in ethylene polymerization using a series of Ti(OAr)[{(O-2,4-R2C 6H2)-6-CH2}3N ] [ r = me ( 1 ) , tBu ( 2 ) ; Ar = 2,6-Me2C6H3 ( a ) , 2,6-iPr2C6H3 ( b ) , 2,6-Ph 2C6H3 ( c ) , 2,6-F2C6H <nUm> ( d ) , C6F5 ( e ) ] ( 1a-1e , 2d,2e ) in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) have been explored . reactions of 1b,1d,1e , which showed an increase in the activity upon addition of a small amount of AlMe <nUm> , with <nUm> equiv of AlMe3 afforded heterobimetallic Ti-Al complexes , TiMe(O-2,6-iPr2C6H 3)[(O-2,4-Me2C6H2-6-CH 2)(m2-O-2,4-Me2C6H 2-6-CH2)(Me2Al-m2-O-2,4-Me 2C6H2-6-CH2)N ] ( 3b ) and [ TiMe{(O-2,4-Me2C6H2-6-CH2) <nUm> ( m2-O-2,4-Me2C6H 2-6-CH2)N}][Me2Al(m2-OAr)] [ Ar = 2,6-F2C6H3 ( 3d ) , C6F5 ( 3e ) ] , in moderate yields , and their structures were determined by x-ray crystallography . In contrast , the similar reaction of 1a ( which showed a decrease in the activity upon addition of AlMe3 ) yielded [Al(m2-O-2,6-C6H3)Me2] <nUm> and TiMe[{(O-2,4-Me2C6H2)-6- CH2}3N ] as isolated forms : [ Al(m2-OC 6F5)Me2]2 was isolated from the mixture in the reactions of 1c,2d,2e . the isolated heterobimetallic complexes ( 3b,3d,3e ) exhibited high catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization in the presence of MAO , suggesting that these bimetallic species play a role in this catalysis . 
A series of half - sandwich fluorenyl ( flu' ) scandium dialkyl complexes Flu'Sc(CH2SiMe3)2(THF)n ( <nUm> , flu' = C13H9 , n = <nUm> ; <nUm> , flu' = 2,7- tBu2C13H7 , n = <nUm> ; <nUm> , flu' = 9-SiMe3C13H8 , n = <nUm> ; <nUm> , flu' = 2,7- tBu2-9-SiMe3C13H6 , n = <nUm> ; <nUm> , flu' = 9-CH2CH2NMe2C 13H8 , n = <nUm> ; <nUm> , flu' = 2,7-tBu 2-9-CH2CH2NMe2C13H <nUm> , n = <nUm> ) have been synthesized and structurally characterized . In comparison with the well - known cyclopentadienyl-ligated scandium catalyst system [ (C5Me4SiMe3)Sc(CH2SiMe 3)2(THF) ] / [Ph3C][B(C6F 5)4 ] , the analogous combinations of the fluorenyl-ligated , THF - containing complexes 1-4 with [Ph3C][B(C6F 5)4 ] show relatively low activities , albeit with similar syndioselectivities for styrene polymerization and styrene-ethylene copolymerization . however , on treatment with <nUm> equiv of AliBu <nUm> , the 1-4 / [Ph3C][B(C6F5) <nUm> ] combinations show a dramatic increase in catalytic activity without changes in the stereoselectivity . In contrast , the combinations of complexes <nUm> and <nUm> , which have an amino group attached to the fluorenyl ring and intramolecularly bonded to the metal center , exhibit very low activity , no matter whether or not AliBu3 is present , affording syndiotactic polystyrenes with broad molecular weight distributions . the DFT calculations of the activation mechanism by using the representative catalysts suggest that AliBu3 can capture the THF molecule from the catalyst precursors 1-4 at first,and then the new , THF - free cationic half - sandwich scandium active species [ Flu'Sc(CH2SiMe 3)][B(C6F5)4] with less steric hindrance around the metal center is generated in the presence of an activator such as [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] . the DFT calculations on the syndioselectivity of styrene (co)polymerization catalyzed by [Flu'Sc(CH2SiMe3)][B(C6F 5)4 ] have also been carried out , thus shedding new light on the mechanistic aspects of the (co)polymerization processes . 
the bisDFTO alkylidene complexes of molybdenum Mo(NR)(CHCMe 2Ph)(DFTO)2 ( r = 2,6-i-Pr2C6H <nUm> , 2,6-Me2C6H3 , C6F <nUm> , 1-adamantyl ; DFTO = 2,6-(C6F5) 2C6H3O ) and monoaryloxide monopyrrolide ( MAP ) complexes Mo(NR)(CHCMe2Ph)(Me2Pyr)(OAr) ( Me2Pyr = 2,5-dimethylpyrrolide ; r = C6F5 , ArO = DFTO , 2,6-dimesitylphenoxide ( HMTO ) ; r = 2,6-Me2C6H3 , ArO = DFTO ) have been prepared in good yields . addition of dicarbomethoxynorbornadiene ( DCMNBD ) to bisDFTO complexes yielded polymers that have a cis,isotactic structure . polymerization of DCMNBD by Mo(NC 6F5)(CHCMe2Ph)(Me2Pyr)(HMTO) gives a polymer that contains the expected cis,syndiotactic structure , but polymerization of DCMNBD by Mo(NR)(CHCMe2Ph)(Me2Pyr)(DFTO) ( r = C6F5 , 2,6-Me2C6H3 ) generates a polymer that has a cis,isotactic structure , the first observation of a cis,isotactic polymer prepared employing a MAP initiator . norbornene is polymerized to give what is proposed to be highly tactic cis-polyNBE . addition of ethylene to Mo(NC6F5)(CHCMe2Ph)(DFTO) <nUm> leads to formation of Mo(NC6F5)(CH 2CH2)(DFTO)2 , which also behaves as an initiator for polymerization of DCMNBD to cis,isotactic - polyDCMNBD and norbornene to cis highly tactic polyNBE . Mo(NC6F5)(CH 2CH2)(DFTO)2 reacts with 3-methyl-3- phenylcyclopropene ( MPCP ) to give Mo(NC6F5)(CHCHCMePh) (DFTO)2 in ∼ <nUm> % yield . 
the composition of methylalumoxane ( MAO ) and its interaction with trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) have been investigated by a combination of chemical , spectroscopic , neutron scattering , and computational methods . the interactions of MAO with donor molecules such as THF , pyridine , and PPh3 as a means of quantifying the content of " free " and " bound " TMA have been evaluated , as well as the ability of MAO to produce [ me 2AlL2]+ cations , a measure of the electrophilic component likely to be involved in the activation of single - site catalysts . THF , pyridine , and diphenylphosphinopropane ( dppp ) give the corresponding TMA - donor ligand complexes accompanied by the formation of [ me 2AlL2]+ cations . the results suggest that MAO contains not only lewis acid sites but also structures capable of acting as sources of [AlMe2]+ cations . another unique , but still unresolved , structural aspect of MAO is the nature of " bound " and " free " TMA . the addition of the donors OPPh3 , PMe <nUm> , and PCy3 leads to the precipitation of polymeric MAO and shows that about one - fourth of the total TMA content is bound to the MAO polymers . this conclusion was independently confirmed by pulsed field gradient spin echo ( PFG-SE ) NMR measurements , which show fast and slow diffusion processes resulting from free and MAO - bound TMA , respectively . the hydrodynamic radius Rh of polymeric MAO in toluene solutions was found to be <nUm> ± <nUm> Å , leading to an estimate for the average size of MAO polymers of about 50-60 Al atoms . small - angle neutron scattering ( SANS ) resulted in the radius RS = <nUm> ± <nUm> Å for the MAO polymer , in excellent agreement with PFG-SE NMR experiments , a molecular weight of <nUm> ± <nUm> , and about <nUm> Al atoms per MAO polymer . the MAO structures capable of releasing [AlMe2]+ on reaction with a base were studied by quantum chemical calculations on the MAO models (OAlMe)n(TMA) m for up to n = <nUm> and m = <nUm> . both -O-AlMe2-O- and -O-AlMe2-m-Me- four - membered rings are about equally likely to lead to dissociation of [AlMe2]+ cations . the resulting MAO anions rearrange , with structures containing separated Al2O <nUm> 4-rings being particularly favorable . the results support the notion that catalyst activation by MAO can occur by both lewis acidic cluster sites and [AlMe2]+ cation formation . 
A series of novel half - sandwich - type chromium complexes bearing phenoxy-phosphine [O,P] ligands ( 3a-3f ) or phenoxy-phosphine oxide [ O,Pi = O ] ligands ( 4b-4e ) were synthesized in high yields from CpCrCl2(thf) with corresponding ligands in THF . x-ray structure analyses for 3b , 3c , 3e , and 4c revealed that these complexes adopt a three - legged piano stool geometry . when activated by modified methylaluminoxane , complexes 3a-3f exhibited moderate to high activities toward ethylene polymerization , giving high molecular weight polymers with unimodal molecular weight distributions . excitingly , complex 3c could efficiently promote ethylene / NBE copolymerization , therefore , high molecular weight copolymers with high NBE content could easily be obtained under optimized conditions . the [ O,Pi = O ] complexes showed higher catalytic activities than [O,P] analogues but produced much lower molecular weight polymers . the difference in polymerization behavior might be caused by the change of both the steric bulk and the electronic effect around the metal center . 
A series of new half - sandwich titanocene [ ( e5-C 5H5)TiLCl2 ] ( 1 ) and nonorganometallic titanium complexes [TiLCl3(THF)] ( 2 ) and [TiL2Cl2] ( 3 ) containing 5-(2-hydroxyphenyl)tetrazole ( LH ) were synthesized in high yield and fully characterized by various spectroscopic methods and x-ray crystallography . In all complexes , the ligand L acted as a monoanionic bidentate ligand and hydrogen bonding between the oxygen of the tetrahydrofuran and hydrogen of the tetrazolyl unit was observed . In the cycloaddition of CO2 to propylene oxide , complex <nUm> showed the highest activity among the reported Ti complexes . 
the novel neutral k2-N,O-salicylaldiminato Ni (II) complex , [ k2-N,O-{2,6-(3',5'-R2C 6H3)2C6H3-N = C(H)-(3,5- I2-2-O-C6H2)}NiCH3(pyridine) ] ( 1a-pyr , r = NO2 ) , with four nitro substituents on the n-terphenyl motif is a catalyst precursor for ethylene polymerization to yield linear higher molecular weight polyethylene ( e.g. , Mn <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 and only <nUm> methyl branches per <nUm> carbon atoms ) . A comparison with other known catalyst precursors at various polymerization conditions shows that the catalytic properties in terms of linearity and molecular weight are similar to the fluorinated catalyst precursor with r = CF3 , showing that the latter is not singular , but rather suppression of chain transfer and branch formation by b-hydride elimination can also be brought about by nonfluorinated electron - withdrawing remote substituents . 
the reaction of [Cp2ZrMe][MeB(C6F5) <nUm> ] ( 1 ) with 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene and 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene , respectively , in C6D5Cl at <nUm> ° C results in irreversible formation of the cationic Cp2Zr+-allyl complexes [ Cp2Zr(e3-CH2C(CH 2R)CH2)]+ ( 2a , 3a ) and [ Cp2Zr(e 3-CH2C(Me)CHR)]+ ( 2b , 3b ) ( 2a,b , r = CH(CH 3)2 ; 3a,b , r = C4H7 2CH3 ) and release of methane . the Cp2Zr +-allyl complexes were characterized with regard to their structures and rearrangement dynamics of their allyl ligands by NMR spectroscopy . variable - temperature 1H NMR experiments show that the allyl ligands of complexes 2a,b and 3a,b are fluxional . the fluxional behavior in these complexes is mainly due to a mechanism that involves e3 to e1 isomerization , rotation of the allyl carbon-carbon π unit about the carbon-carbon σ bond , and reversion to the e3- allyl coordination mode , when both the allyl syn / anti hydrogen exchange and apparent cp ligand exchange occur . the rotation of the C-C unit about the allyl carbon-carbon σ bond also results in a reversal of the e3-allyl coordination face relative to the Cp2Zr + moiety . A second mechanism which may account for the apparent cp ligand exchange in the Cp2Zr+-allyl complexes under investigation consists of rotation of the e3-coordinated allyl ligand about the metal - allyl bond . the free energy of activation for the exchange processes , as estimated from the coalescence temperature of the two cp ligands , is between <nUm> and <nUm> kJ / mol . aside from the intramolecular allyl exchange processes described above , this study also shows that the e1- and e3-coordinated allyl forms of a particular Zr - allyl complex coexist in solution and that the equilibrium composition of these species is temperature dependent . the Cp2Zr+-allyl complexes described in this paper serve as models for similar cationic cp 2Zr+-allyl intermediates implicated in zirconocene - catalyzed alkene polymerization reactions . 
the reaction mechanisms of the (silyl)(silylene)tungsten and -molybdenum complexes Cp(OC)2M(SiMe3)( = SiMes2 ) ( m = W ( 1 ) , Mo ( 2 ) ; cp* = e5-C5Me5 ; mes = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2 ) with the sulfur donor reagent ethylene sulfide <nUm> have been explored by ab initio molecular orbital and DFT ( B3LYP ) methods . As a result , the metal - ligand interactions were found to be stronger in the tungsten complexes than in the molybdenum complexes . therefore , in the early stages which are common for both tungsten and molybdenum complexes , the energy barriers of the reactions of the tungsten tend to be higher than those of the molybdenum . the insertion of a sulfur atom into the metal - ligand bond takes place more easily in the molybdenum complex in comparison to that in the tungsten complex . this is the plausible reason parts of the reaction mechanisms and the final products are different between the W and Mo complexes . 
the alkyne complexes [ (PNP)Ti(e2-HC ≡ CH)(CH 2tBu ) ] ( 2 ) and [ (PNP)Ti(e2-HC ≡ CMe ) ( CH2tBu ) ] ( 3 ) have been prepared by treatment of [ NP2Ti = CHtBu(OTf) ] ( 1 ) with the grignard reagents H 2C = CClHMg and MeHC = BrCHMg , respectively . complex <nUm> can be also prepared using the grignard CH2 = C(Me)MgBr and <nUm> . the 2-butyne complex [ (PNP)Ti(e2-MeC ≡ CMe)(CH2tBu) ] ( 4 ) can be similarly prepared from <nUm> and MeHC = C(Me)MgBr . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> have been characterized with a battery of multidimensional and multinuclear ( 1H , 13C , and 31P ) NMR spectroscopic experiments , including selectively 31P decoupled 1H{ 31P } , 1H-31P HMBC , 1H-31P HOESY , and 31P EXSY . variable - temperature 1H and 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy reveals that the acetylene ligand in <nUm> exhibits a rotational barrier of <nUm> kcal mol-1 , and such a process has been corroborated by theoretical studies . formation of the titanium alkyne ligand in complexes <nUm> and <nUm> proceeds via the vinyl intermediate [ NP2Ti = CHtBu(CH = CHR ) ] followed by a concerted , metal - mediated b-hydrogen abstraction step that has been computed to have a barrier of 20-22 kcal mol-1 . the geometry and rotational mechanism of the alkyne ligand in <nUm> are presented and compared with those of the ethylene derivative [ (PNP)Ti(e2-H2C = CH2)(CH2 tBu ) ] ( 5 ) , which does not display rotation of the bound ethylene under the same conditions . 
the catalyst systems Cl3FITi / MAO ( FI = phenoxyimine ligand with an additional aryl-O-CH3 donor ) display exceptionally high activity in selective ethylene trimerization . by means of NMR and EPR spectroscopy , the nature of the Ti species formed in the catalyst systems Cl3FITi / MAO , Cl3FITi / MMAO , and ClFITi <nUm> / AlR3 / [Ph3C]+[B(C6F 5)4]- ( r = me , et , iBu ) has been studied . it was shown that outer - sphere ion pairs of the type [ FITi IVMe2]+[A]- ( [A]- = [MeMAO]- , [MeMMAO]- , [ BC6F5 4]- ) are formed at the initial stage of the reaction of Cl3FITi with MAO , MMAO , and AlMe3 / [Ph3C] +[B(C6F5)4]- . these ion pairs further partially convert into TiIII and TiII species . In the systems Cl3FITi / MAO and ClFITi <nUm> / AlMe3 / [Ph3C]+[B(C 6F5)4]- , complexes with the proposed structures (FI)TiIIIMe2 , (FI)TiIICl , and [(FI)TiII(S)]+[A]- ( [A]- = [MeMAO]- , [B(C6F5)4)]- , S = solvent , vacancy ) were observed ( concentrations of TiIII species was lower than those of the TiII congeners ) . In contrast , in the system Cl3FITi / MMAO , the concentrations of TiIII species ( ion pairs of the type [ (FI)TiIII(m-H)(m-Cl)Al iBu2]+[MeMMAO]- ) were higher than those of the TiII counterparts ( ion pairs [(FI)TiII(S)] +[MeMMAO]- ) . the system Cl3FITi / MMAO displays lower activity and selectivity in 1-hexene formation , in comparison to Cl3FITi / MAO , due to undesirable PE generation . probably , Ti II and ITiV ion pairs are those participating in ethylene trimerization . 
A multinuclear NMR spectroscopic study was performed to assess the nature of species responsible for living ethylene (E)-norbornene ( N ) copolymerization reaction using the fluorinated enolatoimine titanium complex [ Ti(k2-N,O-{2,6-F2C6H3N-C(Me) C(H)C(CF3)O})2Cl2 ] ( 1 ) activated with dry methylaluminoxane ( d-MAO ) . the analysis involved ( i ) the catalytic system ( <nUm> with MAO ) ; ( ii ) the species formed after simultaneous addition of 13C - enriched ethylene and norbornene and after further addition of 13C - enriched ethylene ; and ( iii ) species formed during norbornene homopolymerization . the results supported the existence of noncovalent interactions of ortho-fluoroaryl substituents with the titanium center , which contribute to the living character of the copolymerization reaction . 
A series of asymmetric formamidine ligands bearing different substituents with various steric and electronic properties on the nitrogen of the N-C-N motif were synthesized . group <nUm> bis(formamidinate) dimethylamido , chloride , and benzyl complexes were studied using these asymmetric ligands and their solid - state structures and their behavior in solution were determined . these complexes were activated with MAO ( methylalumoxane ) or a combination of cocatalysts and tested in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene . A noticeable influence of the formamidine nitrogen substituents on the activity of the catalyst and properties of the obtained polymers was observed . further , a plausible mechanism for the polymerization of propylene is presented derived from a combination of ESR - C60 and MALDI - TOF trapping experiments which shed light on the nature of the active catalytic species . 
from the reaction of [PtCl2(N-CMe)2] with FcC-N ( 1 ) ( fc = Fe(e5-C5H4)(e5-C 5H5 ) ) complex [PtCl2(FcC-N)(N-CMe)] ( 2 ) was obtained , which on subsequent treatment with <nUm> gave trans-[PtCl 2(N-CFc)2 ] ( trans-3 ) . the latter complex and the appropriate cis isomer ( cis-3 ) were also accessible when [PtCl2] or [PtCl2(N-CMe)2] is reacted with a 2.6-fold excess of <nUm> . appropriate treatment of [PtCl2(N-CMe)2] with two equivalents of 1-acetyl-1'-cyanoferrocene ( 4 ) produced trans-[PtCl 2(Fe(e5-C5H4CN)( e5-C5H4C(O)Me))2 ] ( trans-5 ) . coordination polymer [ PtCl2(Fe(e5-C5H 4CN)2)]n ( 7 ) was obtained by combining [PtCl2(N-CPh)2] with [ Fe(e5-C 5H4CN)2 ] ( 6 ) . however , when <nUm> was reacted with PPh3 for deaggregation , [ PtCl2(PPh3) <nUm> ] was formed . addition of FcC - CLi ( 8-Li ) to trans-3 gave pentametallic trans-[Pt(C-CFc)2(NH-CnBuFc)2] ( 10 ) via trans-[Pt(C-CFc)2(N-CFc)2] ( 9 ) . when trans-3 is reacted with two equivalents of nBuLi in the absence of FcC-CH ( 8 ) , trans-[PtCl2(NH-CnBuFc)2] ( 11 ) was obtained , which decomposed to FcC(-NH)nBu ( 12 ) , giving FcC(O)nBu ( 13 ) . electrochemical measurements of the nitrile platinum complexes show no redox separation for the oxidation of the fc and Fe(e5-C 5H4)2 moieties . compared with the noncoordinated ferrocenecarbonitriles , a shift to higher potentials is observed . In contrast , for <nUm> four well - separated redox events ( <nUm> , <nUm> , + <nUm> , + <nUm> mV ) were found , which could be assigned to the oxidation of the fc units . UV - vis / NIR spectroscopy allowed to determine an IVCT absorption ( nmax = <nUm> cm-1 , emax = <nUm> l*mol-1*cm-1 , dn1 / <nUm> = <nUm> cm-1 ) for 10+ , classifying this mixed - valent species as a weakly coupled class II system according to robin and day , while no IVCT transitions were observed for 10n+ ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) . the structures of trans-3 , cis-3 , <nUm> , and FcC(O)tBu ( 15 ) in the solid state were determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . although the bond distances and angles of trans-3 and cis-3 are similar , the cis isomer crystallizes as a dimer possessing Pt-Pt distances within the sum of the van der waals radii . 
binucleating multidentate amine bis(phenolate) ligands with rigid terphenyl backbones were designed to support two zirconium centers locked in close proximity . polymerizations of propylene or 1-hexene with the synthesized bimetallic precatalysts resulted in polymers with significantly higher isotacticity ( up to <nUm> % mmmm ) in comparison to the stereoirregular polymers produced with previously reported Cs - symmetric monometallic analogues . the bimetallic precatalysts also display higher activity ( up to <nUm> kg of poly(1-hexene) ( mmol of zr)-1 h-1 ) , in comparison to the monometallic analogues , and among the highest activities reported for nonmetallocene catalysts . the stereocontrol is consistent with a bimetallic mechanism involving remote steric interactions with the ligand sphere of the second metal center . 
A family of group <nUm> alkoxide and aryloxide complexes of a chiral cyclopentadienyl-derived (hydro)permethylpentalenyl ligand ( C8Me 6H ; Pn*(H) ) have been prepared and fully characterized . both racemic and enantiopure complexes of all group <nUm> congeners were prepared with a wide variety of alkoxide and aryloxide ligands . the complexes Pn*(H)Ti(OtBu)3 ( 1 ) , Pn*(H)Ti(O-2,6-Me-C 6H3)3 ( 2 ) , Pn*(H)Zr(OtBu) <nUm> ( 3 ) , Pn*(H)Zr(OCH2Ph)3 ( 4 ) , Pn*(H)Zr(S-OCH{CH3}C6H5)3 ( 5 ) , Pn*(H)Zr(rac-OCH{CH3}C6H5)3 ( 6 ) , Pn*(H)Zr(O-2,6-Me-C6H3)3 ( 7 ) , Pn*(H)Zr(O-2,6-iPr-C6H3)3 ( 8 ) , Pn*(H)ZrCl2(O-2,6-tBu-C6H3) ( 9 ) , Pn*(H)Hf(O-2,6-Me-C6H3)3 ( 10 ) , Pn*(H)HfCl(O-2,6-iPr-C6H3)2 , ( 11 ) , and Pn*(H)HfCl2(O-2,6-tBu-C6H <nUm> ) ( 12 ) were prepared by the reaction of Pn*(H)MCl3 complexes with the corresponding potassium alkoxides and aryloxides . single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies implied that , despite multiple diastereomers being possible for each complex , the diastereomers isolated are limited to configurations in which the methyl group at the chiral center is always oriented anti to the metal center in order to minimize steric hindrance ( R,RP and S,SP ) . the complexes were investigated as initiators for the ring - opening polymerization of l- and rac - lactide in order to ascertain if these mixtures of diastereomers could exert any stereocontrol on the resulting polymerization . kinetic studies were completed to explore the effects of the metal cation , chiral (hydro)permethylpentalenyl ligand , ancillary ligands , initiator concentration and temperature . both Pn*(H)Zr(S- OCH{CH3}C6H5)3 and Pn*(H)Zr(rac-OCH{CH3}C6H5)3 demonstrated very high rates of propagation for l- and rac - lactide ( <nUm> < kobs < <nUm> h-1 ) at <nUm> ° C . the observed propagation rates using Pn*(H)Zr(rac - OCH{CH3}C 6H5)3 are around <nUm> % faster for l-lactide and rac - lactide in comparison to those using Pn*(H)Zr(S - OCH{CH 3}C6H5)3 . the polymers were characterized by NMR spectroscopy , GPC , and MALDI - ToF mass spectrometry in order to investigate the tacticities and polydispersities of the polymerizations . 
A series of chiral palladium (II) and nickel (II) complexes bearing a C2 - symmetric monoanionic tridentate bis(oxazoline) ligand , (R2-(S,S)-BOZ)M(X) ( 1-6 : r = C3H7 , m = Pd , x = AcO ( 1 ) ; r = C3H7 , m = Pd , x = Cl ( 2 ) ; r = ph , m = Pd , x = Cl ( 3 ) ; r = ph , m = Ni , x = Cl ( 4 ) ; r = C3H7 , m = Ni , x = Cl ( 5 ) ; r = C3H7 , m = Pd , x = OTf ( 6 ) ) , have been synthesized and structurally characterized . the experimental results demonstrate that such chiral palladium (II) and nickel (II) complexes bearing C2 - symmetric tridentate ligands in which the monoanionic group is located inside are effective for norbornene polymerization . In the presence of various cocatalysts such as MAO , MMAO , and activator / AlR3 , these chiral palladium (II) complexes exhibit much higher activities of up to <nUm> × <nUm> g of PNB ( mol of pd)-1 h-1 for the vinylic polymerization of norbornene , affording insoluble polynorbornenes with high packing density . In contrast , the chiral nickel (II) complexes show relatively low activities of ca. <nUm> × <nUm> g of PNB ( mol of ni)-1 h-1 and produce both insoluble polynorbornenes and soluble high-molecular-weight polynorbornenes with moderate molecular weight distributions . 
A series of (imido)vanadium(V) alkylidene complexes containing an imidazolidin-2-iminato ligand of the type V(CHSiMe3)(NR)(X)(PMe3) ( r = 2,6-Me2C6H3 ( Ar , 3a ) , 1-adamantyl ( ad , 3b ) , C6H5 ( 3c ) ; x = 1,3-Ar'2(CH2N)2C = N ; ar' = 2,6-iPr2C6H3 ) have been prepared in n-hexane in the presence of PMe3 from the corresponding dialkyl complexes V(NR)(CH2SiMe3)2(X) ( 2a-c ) . these alkylidene complexes ( 3a-c ) exhibit catalytic activities for ring - opening metathesis polymerization ( ROMP ) of norbornene : the phenylimido analogue ( 3c ) exhibits remarkable activity at <nUm> ° C ( e.g. a TOF value of <nUm> h-1 ( <nUm> turnovers after <nUm> min ) ) , affording high-molecular-weight polymers with uniform molecular weight distributions . the reaction of the (arylimido)vanadium(V) dialkyl complex 2a with CH afforded the phenyl complex V(NAr)(CH2SiMe3)(C6H5)(X) ( 4a ) by 1,2-C-H activation via an alkylidene intermediate and the diphenyl complex V(NAr)(C6H5)2(X) as the final product . the activity by 3a-c for ROMP , the reactivity of 2a-c for formation of these alkylidenes by a-hydrogen elimination , and the reactivity of 2a-c toward benzene were highly affected by the nature of the imido ligand . 
heterocyclic - fused cyclopentadienyl scandium bis(alkyl) complexes L1-4Sc(CH2SiMe3)2THF ( (5-Me-1-Ph-cyclopenta[b]pyrrol-4-yl)Sc(CH2SiMe3)2THF ( 1 ) , (2,5-Me2-3-Ph-6H-cyclopenta[b]thiophenyl)Sc(CH2SiMe3)2THF ( 2 ) , (2,4,5,6-Me4-4H-cyclopenta[b]thiophenyl)Sc(CH2SiMe3)2THF ( 3 ) , (2,3,4,5,6-Me5-4H-cyclopenta[b]thiophenyl)Sc(CH2SiMe3)2THF ) ( 4 ) ) were facilely synthesized by alkane elimination reaction of Sc(CH2SiMe3)3(THF)2 with the heterocyclic - fused cyclopentadienyl ligands HL1-4 in high yields . complexes 1-4 were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies and x-ray diffraction analyses as THF - solvated monomers , adopting a half - sandwich geometry . upon activation of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] / AliBu3 , these half - sandwich scandium complexes displayed various activities toward the copolymerization of ethylene ( e ) and dicyclopentadiene ( DCPD ) . complex <nUm> , supported by the phenyl-substituted pyrrole - fused cyclopentadienyl ligand , showed a slightly higher activity than the phenyl-substituted thiophene - fused cyclopentadienyl complex <nUm> . among the thiophene - fused cyclopentadienyl complexes 2-4 , <nUm> , bearing pentamethyl substituents , showed the highest activity of <nUm> × <nUm> g / molSc*h*bar . the resultant copolymers had adjustable DCPD incorporation varying from <nUm> up to <nUm> mol % , of which the alternating poly(E-alt-DCPD) had a high tg of <nUm> ° C . In addition , no cross-linking was observed in the copolymers , suggesting that these catalytic systems were highly regioselective for the two active double bonds within DCPD . 
the synthesis of the ether - substituted group <nUm> metallocene complexes [Ti(e5-C5H5)(e5-C5H4{CMeRCH(OMe)2})Cl2] ( r = me ( 4 ) , ph ( 5 ) ) and [M(e5-C5H4{CMeRCH(OMe)2})2Cl2] ( m = Ti , r = me ( 6 ) , ph ( 7 ) ; m = Zr , r = me ( 8 ) , ph ( 9 ) ) is reported . In addition , the titanocene derivatives 4-7 have been supported on the mesoporous silica - based material KIT-6 , giving the functionalized materials K4-K7 , respectively . all compounds and materials have been characterized by different analytical techniques such as solution NMR spectroscopy , mass spectrometry , elemental analysis , solid - state multinuclear NMR spectroscopy , IR spectroscopy , N adsorption - desorption isotherms , x-ray fluorescence and diffraction , SEM , and TEM . additionally , the molecular structures of the zirconocene derivative <nUm> and the hydrolysis product [Ti(e5-C5H5)(e5-C5H4{CMe2COO})Cl] ( 4a ) of titanocene complex <nUm> have been determined by x-ray diffraction studies . the structure of 4a reveals a five - membered metallacyclic arrangement . the ether - substituted titanocene compounds 4-6 and the functionalized material K5 have been tested for their antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects in vitro in three human cancer cell lines ( A549 lung adenocarcinoma , MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma , and HCT - <nUm> colorectal adenocarcinoma ) , as well as in normal human fibroblasts . compounds 4-6 and K5 showed moderate but specific cytostatic effects . moreover , additional studies related to the hydrolytic stability ( for 4-7 ) and DNA interaction ( for <nUm> ) have been carried out . finally , taking into account the feasible applicability of metallocene complexes , a preliminary ethylene polymerization study has been performed using the two synthesized zirconocene compounds ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) . ( figure presented ) . 
treatment of trichloride complexes [ (PNP)MCl <nUm> ] ( m = Ti or Zr ) with <nUm> equiv of ethyl-Grignard reagent cleanly results in transmetalation followed by b-hydrogen abstraction to form the ethylene-ethyl species [ (PNP)M(e <nUm> -H <nUm> C = CH <nUm> )(CH <nUm> CH <nUm> ) ] . In the case of zirconium , we can replace the ethylene ligand with an imido or 2,2'-bipyridine ( bpy ) to form [ NP2Zr = N[1 - adamantyl](CH <nUm> CH <nUm> ) ] or [ (PNP)Zr(bpy)(CH <nUm> CH <nUm> ) ] , respectively . the ethylene-methyl derivative [ (PNP)Zr(e <nUm> -H <nUm> ci = CH <nUm> )(CH <nUm> ) ] can also be prepared cleanly from the precursor [ (PNP)Zr(CH <nUm> ) <nUm> ( OTf ) ] and ethyl-Grignard reagent . using the isotopologue [ (PNP)Zr(CD <nUm> ) <nUm> ( OTf ) ] we found that a-abstraction is not a pathway to ethylene formation . ( chemical presented ) .

In a subsequent reaction of [ { CORu < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ( e-C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > r ) } < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ( μ < inf > <nUm> < / inf > -C ≡ C ) ] and AgBF < inf > <nUm> < / inf > use of a strict Ag < sup > + < / sup > / ethyne-1,2-diyl ratio gave [ Ag({Ru(CO) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ( e-C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) } < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ( η < sup > <nUm> < / sup > -C ≡ C ) ) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ](BF < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) . the analogous Cu < sup > + < / sup > adduct [ Cu({Ru(CO) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ( e-C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) } < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ( η < sup > <nUm> < / sup > -C ≡ C ) ) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ](PF < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) is observed , along with the tricopper(I) adduct from the reaction of [ { CORu < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ( e-C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > r ) } < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ( μ < inf > <nUm> < / inf > -C ≡ C ) ] and [ Cu(NCMe) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ](PF < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) . A combination of factors appears to control the solid - state structures of these coinage metal adducts , with the anion found to be that which influences the packing to the greatest extent . 
the intermediates of olefin polymerization over homogeneous catalysts based on bis[N-(3-tert-butylsalicylidene)anilinato]zirconium(IV) dichloride { ( L tBu)2ZrCl2 } ( 1-tBu ) , bis[N-(3-methylsalicylidene)-anilinato]zirconium(IV) dichloride { ( L Me)2ZrCl2 } ( 1-Me ) , and bis[N-(salicylidene) anilinato]zirconium(IV) dichloride {(LH)2ZrCl2} ( 1-H ) with different activators { methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and AlMe <nUm> / [CPh3]+-[B(C6F5) 4]- ) have been studied by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy . heterobinuclear ion pairs [ ( LtBu ) 2Zr-(m-Me)2AlMe2]+[Me-MAO] - ( 2-tBu ) and [ (LtBu)2Zr(m-Me) 2AlMe2]+[B(C6F5) 4]- ( 2'-tBu ) are formed upon activation of l-tBu with MAO and AlMe3 / [CPh3] +[B(C6F5)4]- , respectively . these species are the precursors of the highly active intermediates of polymerization . In contrast , the activation of 1-Me with MAO results mainly in the formation of the tight ion pair [ ( LMe ) 2ZrMe+ ⋯ -Me-MAO- ] . this ion pair is the precursor to a poorly active intermediate of polymerization . In the catalytic systems 1-HZMAO and 1-H / AlMe3 / [CPh3]+[B(C 6F5)4]- , the aluminum ion pairs [LHAl(m-Me)(m-Cl)AlMe2]+[Me-MAO] - and [LHAl(m-Me)(m-Cl)AlMe2] +[B(C6F5)4]- , which were inactive in ethylene polymerization , are predominantly formed . the isomeric composition of 2'-tBu is close to that of the initial complex 1-tBu . the main route of the 1-tBu / MAO catalyst deactivation is the ligand transfer to aluminum with the formation of the complex LtBuAlMe2 . 
the synthesis and structure of novel 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl substituted cyclopentadienes ( <nUm> / <nUm> ) and of their zirconocene dichloride derivatives [ Zr(e5-C5H4C2H 4CF3)2Cl2 ] ( 6 ) and [ Zr(e-C 5H3-1,2-(C2H4CF3) 2}2Cl2 ] ( 7 ) is reported . these precatalysts have been investigated toward their properties in the methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) assisted polymerization of ethylene . the results can be compared to the polymerization properties of the non-fluorinated analogue [ Zr(Eta ; -C 5H4C2H4CH3 ) 2Cl2 ] ( 11 ) . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> produce high - density polyethylene ( HDPE ) and are among the most active precatalysts for donor functionalized nonbridged metallocenes . an unprecedented temperature independence of the molar mass distribution is observed for the polymerization with <nUm> . 
the synthesis , characterization , and reactivity of the new water - soluble ansa - molybdocene catalyst [ { C 2Me <nUm> ( C 5H <nUm> ) 2}Mo(OH)(OH 2)][OTs] ( 3 ) and the related hydroxo-bridged dimer [ ( C 2Me <nUm> ( C 5H <nUm> ) 2)Mo(M - OH ) ] 2[OTs] <nUm> ( 5 ) are described . the effect of the ethylene bridge on the metallocene structure was evaluated by comparing the crystal structures of ( C 2Me <nUm> ( C 5H <nUm> ) 2)MoH <nUm> ( 2 ) and <nUm> to those of the nonansa analogues . the ethylene bridge changed the bite angles of the metallocene fragment by only a few degrees in both ansa structures . to probe the electronic consequences of the tetramethylethylene bridge , the ( C 2Me <nUm> ( C 5H <nUm> ) 2)Mo(CO)H ( 4 ) complex was prepared . on the basis of the V(C ≡ O ) stretching frequencies , the ansa ligand C 2Me <nUm> ( C 5H <nUm> ) <nUm> was found to be electron - withdrawing relative to two η 5C 5H <nUm> ligands . the reactivity of <nUm> in nitrile hydration , phosphate ester hydrolysis , and carboxylic acid ester hydrolysis was explored , and the rate constants for these transformations were compared to rate constants obtained using the cp 2Mo(OH)(OH <nUm> ) + and cp' 2Mo(OH)(OH <nUm> ) + catalysts . In all cases , the cp 2Mo(OH)(OH <nUm> ) + catalyst , having intermediate electron density , had the largest rate constants . the reactivity trends for the three catalysts are explained by the relative electrophilicities of the Mo centers . if electrondonating cyclopentadienyl ligands are employed , the reactivity of the bound substrate is decreased relative to cp and the rate is decreased . conversely , if electron - withdrawing cp cyclopentadienyl ligands are employed , the reactivity of the bound hydroxo nucleophile is decreased and the rate is decreased . In the case of the cp 2Mo(OH)(OH <nUm> ) + complex , these two opposing trends converge , and optimal activity is observed . 
treatment of the phosphonium salt [ Me(t-Bu)P(C5Me 4H)2]I with <nUm> equiv of KH produces the coordination polymer {K[Me(t-Bu)P(C5Me4)2](thf)} ∞ . if the phosphonium salt reacts with a single equivalent of KH followed by Ca[N(SiMe3)2]2 , the calcium complex [Me(t-Bu)P(C5Me4)2]CaN(SiMe 3)2 is produced , which is structurally related to Cp'2LnX organolanthanides . density functional theory studies of the H3E ( e = C , Si , P ) - substituted cyclopentadienyl ring indicate that the energy required for out - of - plane bending of the substituent decreases in the order CH3 > H3Si > H3P . 
the mechanism of formation of branched polyethylene in the polymerization promoted by mesometallocene / MAO systems has been investigated by combining DFT calculations and experimental results on differently featured meso-zirconocenes . A possible explanation for the required meso structure in the formation of branches considers a competition of ethene insertion and b-hydrogen transfer to the monomer . general mechanistic considerations in order to design catalytic systems able to synthesize LLDPE by ethene homopolymerization have been outlined . 
condensation of (R)-2,2'-diamino-1,1'-binaphthyl with <nUm> equiv of pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde in toluene in the presence of molecular sieves at <nUm> ° C gives (R)-bis(pyrrol-2-ylmethyleneamino)-1,1'-binaphthyl ( 1H <nUm> ) in <nUm> % yield . deprotonation of 1H2 with HNa in DME , followed by reaction with Cl3Y in DME gives the complex 1-YCl(dme) ( 2 ) in <nUm> % yield . A salt metathesis reaction between <nUm> and ( me 3Si)2NNa in a mixed solvent of THF and toluene ( <nUm> : <nUm> ) gives the organoyttrium amide 1-Y[N(SiMe3)2](thf)*C 7H8 ( 4 ) in <nUm> % - yield . alternatively , the organolanthanide amides may also be prepared by silylamine elimination . for example , treatment of 1H2 with <nUm> equiv of Ln[N(SiMe3)2]3 in toluene at reflux gives , after recrystallization from a mixed toluene and THF solution , organolanthanide amides 1-Ln[N(SiMe3)2]-(thf) *(C7H8)n ( n = <nUm> , ln = Sm ( 3 ) ; n = <nUm> , ln = Y ( 4 ) ; n = <nUm> , ln = Yb ( 5 ) ) in good yields . reaction of <nUm> with one equiv of Me3N*HCl or excess of Me3Al leads to formation of 1-YCl(dme) ( 2 ) and 1-Y(m-Me)2AlMe2 ( 6 ) , respectively . treatment of <nUm> with excess of 1H2 in toluene at reflux gives , after recrystallization from a benzene solution , the dinuclear complex { ( 1 ) 3Yb2}3*2C7H 8*2C6H6 ( 7 ) in <nUm> % yield . all compounds have been characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and elemental analyses . the solid - state structures of compounds 2-4 and <nUm> have been further established by single x-ray diffraction analyses . organolanthanide amides 3-5 are active catalysts for asymmetric hydroamination / cyclization of aminoalkenes and polymerization of MMA , affording cyclic amines in good yields with moderate ee values and syn-rich poly(MMA)s , respectively . 
reaction of the titanium dichloro complex containing a [OSSO] - type bis(phenolate) ligand (edtbp)TiCl2 ( 1 ) ( edtbpH2 = ( HOC6H2-tBu2-4,6 ) 2(SCH2CH2S) ) with <nUm> equiv of AlMe3 produces the methylchloro complex (edtbp)TiMeCl ( 2 ) in <nUm> % yield , alternatively prepared from comproportionation of <nUm> and the dimethyl complex (edtbp)TiMe <nUm> ( 3 ) . the titanium ester enolate complex (edtbp)TiMe{O( 1PrO)C = CMe2 ] ( 4 ) was synthesized by reaction of <nUm> with lithium isopropylisobutyrate , LiO(1PrO)C = CMe2 , in a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio . this complex reacted with alcohols ROH ( r = iPr , ph , Ph3C ) to give alkoxy complexes (edtbp)TiMe(OR) ( 6-8 ) and with acetone under C-C coupling to afford an aldolate complex (edtbp)TiMe(OCMe 2CMe2CO2iPr ) ( 9 ) . methyl abstraction from the neutral complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> using with B(C6Fs) <nUm> gave the corresponding cationic species [ (edtbp)Ti(OR)(THF ). , ] [MeB(C6F58)3] . all complexes have been characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis . single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies were performed for complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> . cationic titanium enolate species initiate the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) at room temperature , producing syndiotactic - enriched poly(methyl methacrylates ) ( PMMAs ) . In the presence of the neutral enolate complex , MMA polymerization proceeds in a living fashion . the neutral titanium enolate complex <nUm> was found to be moderately active in n-butyl acrylate ( n-BA ) polymerization . 
transition metal precatalyst - organoaluminum cocatalyst interactions are of fundamental importance in ziegler - natta polymerization catalysis . rare - earth metal tetramethylaluminate complexes (BDPPpyr)Ln(AlMe4) bearing a [NNN]2- post-metallocene - type ligand ( H2BDPPpyr = 2,6-bis-(((2,6-diisopropylphenyl)amino)methyl)pyridine ) were obtained by two different synthesis routes . reaction of (BDPPpyr)Ln(NEt2)(THF) with trimethylaluminum afforded complexes (BDPPpyr)Ln(AlMe4) of the small rareearth metals scandium and lutetium . corresponding compounds of the larger metals yttrium and lanthanum were synthesized according to the tetramethylaluminate route , i.e. , the reaction of Ln(AlMe4) <nUm> with H2BDPPpyr produced (BDPPpyr)Ln(AlMe4) , along with the byproduct (BDPPpyr)(AlMe2)2 . dynamic NMR spectroscopy of (BDPPpyr)Ln(AlMe4) revealed distinct fluxional behavior of the AlMe4- ligand depending on the metal size ( Lu : associative via Lu(m-Me)3AlMe ; Sc : dissociative via Sc(w-Me)AlMe3 ) . In the presence of trimethylaluminum , the yttrium derivative undergoes a ligand backbone metalation at the isopropyl methyl group yielding (BDPPpyr-H)Y[(m-Me)AlMe2]2 featuring a [NNNC]3 -- type ligand . for the lutetium derivative , addition of THF caused cyclometallation products (BDPPpyr-H)Lu[(m-Me)AlMe2](THF) and [Lu(BDPPpyr-H)]2 involving the isopropyl methine proton . present studies not only clearly show the enhanced reactivity of rare - earth metal methyl moieties [Ln-Me] but also that excessive use of organoaluminum cocatalysts can result in gradual ligand degradation and concomitant catalyst deactivation . the findings might contribute to a better understanding of activation / deactiviation sequences in post-metallocene - promoted olefin polymerization . 
reacting tetrabenzo[a,c,g,i]fluorenyllithium { TbfLi(THF)4 ( 1 ) } with TiCl3(THF)3 ( 2 ) leads to the formation of the e5-tetrabenzo[a,c,g,i]fluorenyltitanium(III) derivative TbITiCl2(THF) ( 3 ) , which can be conveyed to the titanium(IV)complex TbfTiCl3 ( 4 ) by oxidative chlorination with CCl4- subsequent reaction with various lithium phenoxides gives a series of titanium complexes of the type ArCl2IOTbTi ( Ar = 4-tBuC 6H4 ( 5 ) , 2,6-Me2C6H3 ( 6 ) , 2,4,6-Me3C6H2 ( 7 ) , 2,6-iPrC 6H3 ( 8 ) , 2,6-Ph2C6H3 ( 9 ) ) . furthermore , <nUm> was reacted with radicals or radical - generating peroxides to form the complexes TbfTiCl2TEMPO ( 10 ) and TblTiCl2CBu ( 11 ) . all compounds were characterized by IR , MS , and NMR measurements and x-ray crystallography . finally , compounds <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were subjected to ethylene polymerization experiments using d-MAO . the activities increase in the following order [ kG(PE)mol(Ti)-1 h-1 bar-1 ] : <nUm> ( 320 ) < <nUm> ( 320 ) < <nUm> ( 760 ) < <nUm> ( 1000 ) . 
the mono(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(II) complex CpTiCl(dmpe)2 has been prepared by treating (CpTiCl2)x with n-butyllithium in the presence of 1,2-bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane ( dmpe ) . subsequent treatment of this titanium (II) species with methyllithium or n-butyllithium affords the alkyl and hydride analogues CpTiMe(dmpe)2 and CpTiH(dmpe) <nUm> , respectively . the x-ray crystal structures of CpTiX(dmpe) <nUm> ( x = Cl , me , H ) have been determined , and all possess unusually long metal - ligand distances owing to steric crowding in the first coordination sphere of these formally eight - coordinate complexes . analogous treatment of [Cp*Ti(BH4)Cl]2 with n-butyllithium in the presence of a chelating phosphine affords the mono(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) titanium (II) complexes Cp*Ti(BH4)(e2-PP) , where PP is dmpe or (tert-butyl)tris(dimethylphosphinomethyl)silane ( trimpsi ) . all of these titanium (II) complexes are catalysts for the oligomerization of alkenes . for example , ethylene is dimerized to 1-butene ; subsequent coupling reactions of 1-butene with ethylene gives the ethylene trimers 2-ethyl-1-butene and 3-methyl-1-pentene . the product distribution most strongly supports a coupling mechanism that proceeds via metallacyclopentane intermediates . As judged from the similarity of the product distributions , we propose that the catalytically active species in the alphabutol process for the dimerization of ethylene to 1-butene are titanium (II) centers . 
the reaction of LTiCl3 ( 1 ) ( L = HC(CMeN(2,6-iPr 2C6H3))2 , nacnac ) with MeLi - ( et 2O)0.14 in toluene afforded the stable Ti(IV) alkyl complex LTiMe3 ( 1 ) . reaction of <nUm> with <nUm> equiv of AlMe3 in toluene resulted in the formation of LTi(Me) = CH(Al2Me5) ( 2 ) in high yield . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by x-ray structural analysis , NMR , IR , mass spectrometry , and elemental analysis . the Ti-CH bond length ( <nUm> Å ) of <nUm> is in the range of a short Ti-C bond . this was additionally supported by NMR and DFT calculations . compound <nUm> polymerized ethylene without adding any cocatalyst , although activity is low ; the best TOF value was <nUm> × <nUm> g(polymer) / mol catalyst · h · bar . 
the new inorganic / organic hybrid π ligand [ Me2C(CStL)(C 2BgHiO)]3 was prepared via a selective deboration of me 2C(C5H5)(C2B10H <nUm> ) with piperidine in ethanol . treatment of its sodium salt with MCl4(THF)2 gave the mixed - sandwich complexes [ { e5:e5-Me2C(C5H 4)(C2B9H10)}MCl2][Na(DME) <nUm> ] ( m = Zr ( 4 ) , Hf ( 5 ) ) . complex <nUm> reacted with C5H 5Na , KCH2Ph , or NaNH(C6H3-2,6- pr2i ) to afford { [ e5 : e2- Me2C(C5H4)(C2B9H 10)]Zr(e5-C5H5)(m-Cl) } ( Na(DME)2 ) ( 7 ) , [ ( e5:e5-Me 2C(C5H4)(C2B9H 10))ZrCl-(CH2C6H5)][Na(DME) <nUm> ] ( 8 ) , or [e5:e5]-Me 2C(C5H4)(C2B9H 10)]Zr(NHC6H3Pr2i)(THF) ( 9 ) , respectively . both <nUm> and <nUm> were stable , and no ClNa elimination was observed upon heating the toluene solution . In the presence of excess MAO ( methylalumoxane ) , complexes <nUm> , and <nUm> were very active catalysts for ethylene polymerization . all complexes were fully characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and elemental analyses . some were further confirmed by single - crystal x-ray analyses . 
the new inorganic / organic hybrid ligand [NMe3H][Me 2C(C9H7)(C2B9H <nUm> ) ] was prepared via a selective deboration of me 2C(C9H7)(C2B10H <nUm> ) with piperidine in ethanol . reaction of the ligand with Zr(NMe2)4 provided the neutral group <nUm> metal amide complex trans-[e5:e5-Me2C(C9H 6)(C2B9H10)]Zr(NMe 2)(NHMe2) ( 3 ) through an amine elimination reaction . treatment of the trianionic salt of the ligand with MCl4(THF) <nUm> gave the mixed sandwich complexes trans[{e5 : e5-Me2C(C9H6)(C 2B9H10)}MCl2][Na(DME)3] ( m = Zr ( 4 ) , Hf ( 5 ) ) . complex <nUm> reacted with KCH2Ph , C 5H5Na , or NaNH(C6H3-2,6-Me <nUm> ) to afford trans-[{e5 : e5-Me 2C(C9H6)(C2B9H 10)}ZrCl(CH2C6H5)][Na(DME) <nUm> ] ( 6 ) , trans-{[e1:e5-Me 2C(C9H6)(C2B9H 10)]ZrCl(e5-C5H5)}{Na(DME) <nUm> } ( 7 ) , or [ e5:e5-Me 2C(C9H6)(C2B9H 10)]Zr(NHC6H3Me2)(THF) ( 8 ) , respectively . both <nUm> and <nUm> were thermally stable , and no ClNa elimination was observed upon heating their DME solutions . complex <nUm> also reacted with excess HNa in THF to generate the ring - opening product trans-[e5 : e5-Me2C(C9H6)(C 2B9H10)]Zr(OCH2CH2CH 2CH3)(THF) ( 9 ) . In the presence of excess MAO ( methylalumoxane ) , complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were active catalysts for ethylene polymerization . all complexes were fully characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and elemental analyses . some were further confirmed by single - crystal x-ray analyses . 
four neutral zirconocene bis(ester enolate ) and non-zirconocene bis(alkoxy) complexes have been employed for ring - opening polymerizations and chain transfer polymerizations of l-lactide ( L-LA ) and e-caprolactone ( e-CL ) . all c2v- , C2- , and Cs - ligated neutral zirconocene bis(ester enolate ) complexes effectively polymerize e-CL at <nUm> ° C with high ( > <nUm> % ) initiator efficiencies . the Cs - ligated complex ph 2C(Cp)(Flu)Zr[OC(OiPr) = CMe2]2 ( 1 ) also promotes highly efficient polymerization of L-LA and is at least <nUm> times more reactive than the c2v.,- and C2 - ligated analogues . the L-LA polymerization by <nUm> exhibits living characteristics , producing PLA with quantitative isotacticity ( no sign of monomer epimerization ) and controlled molecular weight . this polymerization follows firstorder kinetics with respect to both [L-LA] and [1] , consistent with a monometallic , coordinationanionic propagation mechanism . the structurally characterized non-zirconocene bis(alkoxy) complex [ ( 2,6-iPr2C6H 4)N(CH2)3N(2,6-iPr2C 6H4)]Zr(OiPr)2[O = C(NMe 2)CHMe2 ] ( 2 ) has been synthesized in quantitative yield from the reaction of the zirconium bis(amido) precursor with isopropyl isobutyrate . complex <nUm> behaves as a single - site catalyst for polymerizations of both e-CL and L-LA , unlike the comparative homoleptic zirconium tetraisopropoxy complex , which shows multisite behavior for the same processes . both the zirconocene <nUm> and the non-zirconocene <nUm> catalyze efficient chain transfer polymerization in the presence of iPrOH as a chain transfer reagent ( CTR ) for the catalytic production of PLA and PCL , respectively ; however , the metallocene system is more robust ( in terms of ligand stability and maintaining the polymerization rate ) toward an excess of a protic CTR than the present non-metallocene system . 
the formation of cationic species relevant to olefin polymerization based on BCl2HfIS , Me2C(C5H4)(Hu) Cl2Hf , Ph2C(C5H4)(Flu)HfCl <nUm> , and L'HfCl2 activated by MAO , AlMe <nUm> / CPh3[B(C6F5)4] , and AlBu3i[B(C6F5)4] ( SBI = rac-Me2Si(Ind)2 ; L' = C2H 4(Flu)(5,6-C3H6-2-MeIHd) ) was studied by 1H , 13C , and 19F NMR spectroscopy . thermally stable heterobinuclear intermediates of the type [ LHf(m-Me) 2AlMe2I+[MeMAO]- and [LHf(m-Me)2AlMe2]+[B(C6F 5)4]- were identified when using MAO and AlMe3 / CPh3[B(C6F5)4] as activators , respectively . the stability of these species explains the low productivity of hafnocene catalysts in the presence of AlMe3- containing activators , compared to zirconocenes . by contrast , in the ternary systems LHfCl2 / AlBu3i / CPh3[B(C 6F5)4 ] hydride species were detected that must be responsible for the formation of the highly active sites in olefin polymerization . the ionic hydrido species differ significantly in stability . the formation of the mixed - alkyl complex L'Hf(Me)CH2SiMe <nUm> proceeds with surprisingly high diastereoselectivity ; the sterically more hindered isomer is produced preferentially . it reacts with CPh3[B(C6F5)4] to afford the ion pair [L'Hf-CH2SiMe3]+[B(C 6F5)4]- as two diastereomers that exist in dynamic equilibrium . the rates of site epimerization of this ion pair indicate only small energy differences between the two isomers . 
reaction of titanium complex [(L)TiX2(THF)] ( L = { N,N-[(5-R-3-tert-Bu-2-0-C6a2)CH2]2 ( C3H2N2 ) } , r = tert-Bu , La , r = me , lb ; x = C1 , la , lb ; x = Br , La , <nUm> ) with <nUm> equiv of PhCH2MgC1 or MeLi in diethyl ether gave dimethyl complexes [(L)Ti(CH2Ph)2] ( 3a , 3b ) and [ (L)Ti(CH3) 2](4a , 4b ) by salt metathesis . dibenzyl titanium complex [ ( L a)Ti(CH2Ph)2 ] ( 3a ) absorbs dioxygen gas to afford the oxygen-insertion product [ (La)Ti(OCH2Ph) <nUm> ] ( 5 ) in <nUm> % yield . the reduction of [ (La)MBr 2(THF) ] ( 2 ) with <nUm> equiv of LiBEt3H in toluene gave the titanium(IP) species [(La)TiBr(THF)2] ( 6 ) . the molecular structures of 3b , 4b , <nUm> , and <nUm> have been confirmed by x-ray single - crystal analysis . the solid state structures of these compounds reveal that these hybrid carbene ligands adopt a transoid conformation to form a pseudotrigonal - bipyramidal ( for 3b , 4a , 4b , and <nUm> ) or octahedral ( for <nUm> ) coordination geometry around metal centers . these titanium complexes ( <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> ) showed high activities up to ca. <nUm> kg PE / ( mol Ti · h · atm ) for ethylene polymerization in the presence of MAO as coactalyst . the 13C NMR analysis revealed that linear polyethylene with low molecular weight was formed by these NHC titanium complexes . No methyl or other long - chain branch could be observed . 
indenyl-based C2 - symmetric metallocenes have been used extensively as catalysts for the synthesis of high molecular weight polymers from ethylene or propylene homopolymerization . however , the same catalysts afford only low molecular weight polymers in ethylene / propylene copolymerization . we have in a recent study shown [ wang et al. organometallics <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ] that the poor performance of fluorenyl-based C 1-symmetric zirconocenes in ethylene / propylene polymerization is a result of electronic effects . In the present computational study , we demonstrate how it is possible by substitutions in the 2- and 4-positions of the indenyl ligands to design catalysts that afford high molecular weight polymers from ethylene / propylene copolymerization . 
the use of the chelating diboranes o-C 6F 4[B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] <nUm> ( 1 ) and o-C 6F <nUm> ( 9-BC 12F <nUm> ) <nUm> ( <nUm> : 9-BC 12F <nUm> = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octafluoro-9-borafluorene ) for the polymerization of isobutene ( IB ) in aqueous suspension or in hydrocarbon solution was studied . polymerizations in aqueous suspension provided polymer of moderate MW and at variable conversion and were dependent on temperature , mode of diborane addition , the presence of surfactant , and the acidity of and nature of the anion present in the aqueous phase . the T dependence of MW over the T range <nUm> to <nUm> ° C was studied in aqueous suspension , and higher MW polymer was formed at lower T . the hydrolysis and methanolysis of diboranes <nUm> and <nUm> was studied by NMR spectroscopy . reactions of diborane <nUm> with excess MeOH or water afford solutions containing oxonium acids [ o-C 6F 4{B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> } 2(m-OR)][(ROH) nH ] ( <nUm> : r = H , n > <nUm> ; <nUm> : r = me , n = <nUm> ) . when diborane <nUm> is present in excess over water or MeOH , degradation of the diborane is observed . In this case the products are o-C 6F 4{B(C 6F <nUm> ) 2}H ( 5 ) and ( C 6F <nUm> ) 2BOH <nUm> or ( C 6F <nUm> ) 2BOMe <nUm> , respectively . In the case of diborole <nUm> , o-C 6F <nUm> ( 9-BC 12F 8)B(2-C 12F 8-2 " -H)(m-OH) · 7H 2O ( 17 ) and o-C 6F <nUm> ( 9-BC 12F 8)B(2-C 12F 8-2 " -H)(m-OMe) ( 11 ) were isolated from reactions of <nUm> with water and MeOH , respectively , and were characterized by x-ray crystallography . none of these degradation products effect IB polymerization in aqueous suspension . As a model for initiation of polymerization , the reaction of diborole <nUm> with 1,1-diphenylethylene ( DPE ) was studied . addition of MeOH at low T results in efficient formation of the ion - pair [ ph 2CMe][o-C 6F <nUm> ( 9-BC 12F <nUm> ) 2(m-OMe) ] via protonation of DPE . polymerizations in hydrocarbon media were exothermic and rapid and gave quantitative yields of polymer even at very low concentrations of diborane <nUm> . the T dependence of MW was studied in hydrocarbon solution and showed non-Arrhenius behavior . this was explained by competitive chain transfer to monomer at elevated T and chain transfer to molecular water at lower T . 
summary : the reaction dynamics of b-hydrogen transfer in the zirconocene olefin polymerization catalyst was modeled using DFT path sampling . trajectories were found to cross the reaction barrier at a broad range and showed that Zr-H bonding increases during the reaction due to dynamic effects and a Zr-(e2-C2H4) fluctuation is critical to inducing the transfer . 
reaction of the menthyl-substituted metallocene dichlorides (e5-menthyl-C5H4)2MCl <nUm> ( m = Ti ( 1-Ti ) , Zr ( 1-Zr ) ) with magnesium in the presence of Me3SiC2SiMe3 in THF gives the chiral group <nUm> metallocene alkyne complexes of titanium and zirconium ( e5- menthyl-C5H4)2M(Me3SiC 2SiMe3 ) ( m = Ti ( 2-Ti ) , Zr ( 2-Zr ) ) . both complexes show a similar complexation behavior and reactivity to their achiral metallocene congeners . for example , the reaction with ethylene was studied ; whereas the zirconium complex 2-Zr yields the zirconacyclopentane <nUm> in a well - defined reaction , the titanium analogue 2-Ti produces only an as yet unseparable mixture of different compounds . 2-Ti , 2-Zr , and <nUm> were characterized by x-ray crystal structure analysis . 
C1- and CS - symmetric fluorenyl-based metallocenes have been used extensively as catalysts for the synthesis of high-molecular-weight polymers from ethylene and propylene homopolymerization . however , these same catalysts produce only low-molecular-weight polymers in ethylene / propylene copolymerization . we have shown in a recent study that the poor performance of fluorenyl-based C1 - symmetric zirconocenes in ethylene / propylene polymerization is a result of electronic effects . furthermore , we have also shown in another investigation that incorporating sterically demanding substituents in the 2- and 4- positions of C 2-symmetric zirconocenes can significantly increase molecular weight in copolymerization . In the present study we shall use the same approach ( modifying substituents on the cyclopentadienyl and fluorenyl ligands ) to design C1- and CS - symmetric fluorenyl-based metallocenes that afford high-molecular-weight polymers from ethylene / propylene copolymerization . 
the Pd - catalyzed cross-coupling reactions of readily available 2-bromo-lH-indene with lH - pyrrole , l / / -indole , 9H-carbazole , and their derivatives were shown to be convenient methods to obtain novel ligands containing azole fragments bonded with cyclopentadienyl via nitrogen . an alternative protocol using enol triflates of 1-indanone or 2-indanone is also useful , particularly for synthesizing indenes bearing the n-azolyl fragment in position <nUm> . on the other hand , the synthesis of 2-(lH-benzimidazol-l-yl)-lH- indene can be achieved via the Cu - catalyzed reactions only . the substituted indenes with the n-azolyl fragment in position <nUm> were further used for obtaining several semisandwich complexes of zirconium , [ η 52-(N-azolyl) indenyl]zirconium tribromides , as well as symmetrical and unsyrrrmetrical waymouth - type zirconium and hafnium complexes containing indenyl ligands bearing planar n-azolyl or aryl fragments in position <nUm> . these metallocenes were unambiguously characterized , including by x-ray crystal structure analysis , and a study of the fluxional behavior of several waymouth - type complexes in solution was carried out by NMR spectroscopy . finally , novel waymouth - type complexes , after being activated by MAO , were found to form active catalysts of ethylene homopolymerization and ethylene / l-octene copolymerization . 
new salan ligand precursors that include differently substituted phenol arms were prepared by a two step synthetic pathway . the ligand precursors included activity - enhancing electron - withdrawing groups on one phenol ring , stereodirecting bulky groups on the other phenol ring , and either diaminoethane or trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane as the diamine skeleton . reacting the ligand precursors with either tetra- (O-tert-Bu)zirconium or tetrabenzylzirconium led to [(Salan)ZrX2] - type complexes ( x ) O-tert-Bu , bn ) of octahedral geometry and C1 - symmetry as single stereoisomers in all cases . crystal structure studies indicated that the fac - fac isomers had formed . the chiral salan ligands were found to wrap in a fully diastereoselective manner . all the dibenzylzirconium complexes polymerized 1-hexene upon activation with tris(pentafluorophenl)borane . the electron - withdrawing ability of the substituents was the dominant factor in enhancing the catalysts ' activity ; thus Lig2ZrBn2 , featuring a dichlorophenolate arm and a ditert- bu-phenolate arm , led to an activity of <nUm> g mmol-1 h-1 , whereas lig 4ZrBn2 , featuring a diiodophenolate arm and a di-tert-Bu-phenolate arm , led to an activity of <nUm> g mmol-1 h-1 . pentad analysis showed that despite the catalysts C1 - symmetry , hemiisotactic polymers had not formed . instead , isotactic polymers were produced , the extent of isotacticity depending on the bulk of substituents on both rings , and independent of the rigidity of the diamine skeleton ; thus Lig2ZrBn2 led to poly(1-hexene) of [mmmm] ) <nUm> % , and Lig4ZrBn2 led to poly(1-hexene) of [mmmm] ) <nUm> % . the salan complexes of the more rigid diaminocyclohexane skeleton were less active , their typical activities being ca. <nUm> g mmol-1 h-1 , and led to polymers of higher molecular weights . unraveling these trends enabled the development of a catalystsLig10ZrBn2shaving a high activity of <nUm> g mmol-1 h-1 and leading to high a molecular weight polymer of almost perfect isotacticity of [mmmm] ) <nUm> % . 
A series of ansa-cyclopentadienyl-phenoxy titanium complexes ( PHENICS : phenoxy-induced complex of sumitomo ) ( la-e ) , [ { Me2CCp(OC 6H2-3-R-5-R')}TiCl2 ] ( 1a , r = R' = H ; 1b , r = tBu , R' = me ) and [ { Me2Si(C 5Me4)(OC6H2-3-R " -5-Me ) } Cl2Ti ] ( 1c , r " = tPr ; 1d , r " = tBu ; 1e , r " = adm ) , have been synthesized and characterized . it is noteworthy that the dihedral angles of the cyclopentadienyl and phenoxy moieties of the complexes 1b and id , revealed by x-ray crystal structure analysis , are <nUm> ° ( 1b ) and <nUm> ° ( 1d ) , indicating a distortion from a mutual perpendicular arrangement , whereas the symmetrical patterns of the 1H NMR spectra indicate a dynamic behavior in solution . the PHENICS - type complexes exhibit good to excellent catalytic activities for copolymerization of ethylene and <nUm> -hexene upon activation with A1 tBu3 / [ ph 3C][B(C6F5)4] cocatalyst . particularly , the complexes with a bulky substituent at the ortho position of the phenoxy moiety showed excellent catalytic features ( id , <nUm> kg mol-1h-1 at <nUm> ° C , <nUm> kg mol " ' h-1 at <nUm> ° C ) . these data show that the catalytic activity of the PHENICS - type catalysts is higher than that reported for the so - called constrained geometry catalyst ( CGC ) precursors . this becomes even more evident in light of the results for polymerization at <nUm> ° C . whereas the PHENICS catalyst system acts as a single - site catalyst at <nUm> ° C , the CGC - type catalysts proved to be inactive under analogous conditions . moreover , the copolymers obtained with PHENICS incorporate much higher content of 1-hexene than those obtained with CGC . 
s-Symmetric propylene polymerization catalysts <nUm> with a bridged cyclopentadienyl and fluorenyl architecture are known to produce syndiotactic polymers . on the other hand , related C1 - symmetric catalysts , such as <nUm> , that are obtained from <nUm> by the introduction of a bulky substituent ( tert-butyl ) on the cyclopentadienyl ring afford isotactic polymers . In this study we employ DFT calculations in order to analyze several aspects of olefin polymerizations catalyzed by the fluorenyl-based C1 - symmetric zirconocene <nUm> . modeling of the propagation in naked cationic systems , disregarding the noncoordinating counterion , yields information on the factors that affect streoselectivity ( and ultimately stereoregularity ) , regioselectivity , and reactivity of the " crowded " site of the zirconocene relative to the " open " one . several hypotheses are investigated , with the aim to rationalize the experimental observation that <nUm> affords isotactic polymers whereas <nUm> gives rise to syndiotactic polymers . we provide in addition an analysis of the stability of dormant species <nUm> produced from <nUm> propylene mis - insertions . for this task , the need to include explicitly the counterion in the modeling seems to be inevitable . comparative studies of the energetics of b-H elimination to the metal or b-H transfer to the monomer , relative to insertion into a Zr - secondary C bond , indicate that dormant species <nUm> are prone to b-H elimination . 
In this work , the reversible chain transfer to Al in ethene polymerization catalyzed by Cp*2ZrCl2 / MAO was studied via comparison of the polymerization in the presence and absence of trimethyl-aluminum ( TMA ) contained in commercial MAO . it was found that the weight distributions of the products were narrower , in the presence of TMA , at low Al / Zr ratios taken in these experiments . PDIs of about <nUm> or lower were attainable at temperatures up to <nUm> ° C . we propose that a fast to moderate reversible chain transfer between Cp*2ZrR+ and TMA ( similar to a catalyzed chain growth mechanism ) is the origin of the low polydispersity . simulation of the polymerization with the proposed mechanism confirmed this hypothesis ; the qualitative results are consistent with the experimental trends . 
the addition of free alkyl radicals to olefins is known to encounter a small activation energy and to be highly regioselective , typically favoring the less substituted carbon of the double bond . the ability to modify the reactivity and regioselectivity of the given reaction can be of interest from both fundamental and practical perspectives . olefins are known to bind to the [ d ° -Cp2Zr(OtBu)]+ fragment ( Zr ) relatively weakly , affording adducts having a nonclassical asymmetrical bond between Zr and the double bond of the olefins . In the present study electronic structure methods based on density functional theory ( B3LYP ) have been used to investigate how the kinetics and thermodynamics of methyl radical addition to a systematically varied series of mono- and 1,1-disubstituted ethylene may change when they are coordinated to Zr . In general , methyl addition to the unsubstituted carbon of the coordinated olefins is found to encounter an increased activation energy compared to the noncoordinated reactions . In contrast , the barriers of addition to the substituted carbon of the coordinated olefins are slightly smaller than the barriers in the noncoordinated reactions . these effects lead to opposite regioselectivities in the free and the coordinated reactions of several olefins . however , even when the kinetic regioselectivity reverses upon coordination , the thermodynamic preference for addition to the terminal carbon in the noncoordinated reactions remains unchanged . these results are discussed qualitatively on the basis of unconventional geometries calculated in the coordinated reactants , transition states , and products 
A comparative quantum chemical study has been performed to shed light on the fundamental differences between hafnocenes and zirconocenes concerning reactions between the metals and a-olefin monomers , namely , ethene , propene , 1-butene , and 1-hexene . analogous species along the a-olefin polymerization pathways were studied for bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconocene and hafnocene , taking into account the structural variations of the first two monomer insertion steps and of the competitive chain - termination reactions . the results were analyzed as a function of both the metal and the monomer , the metal showing more distinct differences . the most notable difference in the reactions of the zirconocene and hafnocene can be seen in b-hydrogen transfer to metal , activation energies for which are significantly higher for the hafnocene . 
A series of benzyl-substituted , dual - site ansa - metallocenes were synthesized and characterized . their isolated rac- and meso-diastereomers were studied in propene polymerization after methylaluminoxane or borate activation . catalysts polymerization behavior were investigated in various polymerization conditions , and produced polypropenes ( PPs ) were characterized with NMR , GPC , and DSC . the rac- and meso-diastereomers of these unsymmetric catalysts bearing a SiMe2 bridge produced PP with similar activity , tacticity , and molar mass . according to quantum chemical calculations , the benzyl group in the catalysts can rotate , having significant energy minima . the reason that the diastereomers produce PP with similar molar mass is linked to these local energy minima and is further discussed . 
Bis(vinyl-Cp)zirconium dichloride ( 6 ) undergoes a clean intramolecular photochemically induced [2+2] cycloaddition reaction to yield the cyclobutylene-bridged ansa - zirconocene isomer ( 7 ) when irradiated with UV light ( HPK <nUm> , pyrex filter ) at ambient conditions . both the open and the ansabridged isomers ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) were characterized by x-ray diffraction . the corresponding bis(2-vinylindenyl)ZrCl2 complex ( 12 ) also closes rapidly and completely to the ansa - metallocene ( 13 ) upon photolysis . the bis(2-butadienylindenyl)ZrCl2 complex ( 20 ) undergoes a formal [4+4] cycloaddition reaction upon photolysis to yield its ansa - metallocene isomer <nUm> , exhibiting an eight - membered carbocyclic bridging unit . the metallocene complexes prepared and characterized in this study give very active ethene polymerization catalysts upon activation with excess methylalumoxane . 
A series of 2-benzimidazolyl- / v-phenylquinoline-8-carboxamide half - titanocene chlorides , CpTiLCl ( C1-C6 : cp = e5-C 5H5 ; L = 2-(l / / -benzo[ # midazol-2-yl)-N-(2,6-R 1-4-R2-phenyl)quinoline-8-carboxamide derivatives ; Cl : R1 = i-Pr , R2 = H ; C2 : R1 = et , R2 = H ; C3 : R1 = me , R2 = H ; C4 : R1 = me , r <nUm> = me ; C5 : R1 = H , R2 = H ; C6 : R1 = F , R2 = H ) , have been synthesized by the stoichiometric reaction of half - titanocene trichlorides with the corresponding potassium 2-benzimidazolyl-N-phenylquinoline-8-carboxamide . all complexes are fully characterized by elemental and NMR analyses , as well as single - crystal x-ray diffraction for complexes Cl , C2 , and C6 . In addition , the oxo-bridged dinuclear complex C7 was separated from the solution of C6 in air . these complexes , C1-C6 , activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , exhibit high catalytic activities toward both ethylene polymerization and copolymerization of ethylene with a-olefins . according to the catalytic system of Cl / MAO , both elevating the reaction temperature and increasing the ratio of MAO to titanium precursor enhance the productivities ; however , the molecular weights of the resultant polymers obtained decrease against their higher activities . moreover , copolymerizations of ethylene with either 1-hexene or 1-octene effectively produce copolymers with incorporated comonomers of <nUm> - <nUm> % mol . 
mixtures of Cp*TiR3 ( with cp* = C2H3 and r = CH3 , 13CH3 ) and equimolar amounts of BC18F15 or BC25F5H15 <nUm> , active in the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene , have been investigated by means of ESR spectroscopy . At room temperature the formation of Cp*TiR+ complexes has been observed . rapid insertion of styrene occurs in Ti-R bonds of these cationic Ti (III) complexes , strongly suggesting their role in the stereospecific polyinsertion . 
Titanium(IV) and zirconium(IV) bent - sandwich complexes containing the new donor substituted [2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl]cyclopentadienyl ( CpN ) ligand are described . CpNH ( <nUm> ; C7H9NiPr <nUm> ) is prepared from sodium cyclopentadienide and 2-chloro-1-(diisopropylamino)ethane . the highly moisture - sensitive metallocene dichlorides Cp2NTiCl2 ( 2 ) and Cp2NZrCl2 ( 3 ) are synthesized by reaction of CpNLi with Cl4Ti and Cl4Zr , respectively . In combination with the cocatalyst methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) they are precursors for ethylene polymerization catalysts . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> react with <nUm> equiv of ClH with protonation of the amino groups to give the air- and moisture - stable metallocene dichloride dihydrochlorides Cp2NTiCl2*2HCl ( 4 ) and Cp2NZrCl2*2HCl ( 5 ) , which also are found to be precatalysts for the polymerization of ethylene . the dimethyl compounds Cp2NTiMe2 ( 6 ) and Cp2NZrMe2 ( 7 ) can be obtained by reaction of <nUm> and <nUm> with <nUm> equiv of methyllithium . the dibenzyl complexes Cp2NTiBz2 ( 8 ) and Cp2NZrBz2 ( 9 ) are formed analogously with a stoichiometric amount of benzylmagnesium bromide . the diphenoxy complex Cp2NTi( OPh)2 ( 10 ) is synthesized by reaction of <nUm> with <nUm> equiv of lithium phenoxide . the dialkyl compounds 6-8 and the diphenoxy compound <nUm> show a remarkable activity in the catalytic dehydrocoupling of phenylsilane . Zr(NMe2)4 reacts with <nUm> equiv of CpNH ( 1 ) to give the zirconocene derivative Cp2NZr(NMe2)2 ( 11 ) in quantitative yield . the structure of <nUm> has been determined by a single - crystal x-ray diffraction study . the effects of the (dialkylamino)- and (dialkylammonio)-ethyl substituents in metallocene - type compounds of titanium and zirconium are described . 
the synthesis and properties of two soluble , weakly coordinating derivatives of the tetrakis-(perfluoroaryl)borate anion B(4-C6F4TBS)4- and B(4-C6F4TIPS)4- ( TBS = tert-butyldimethylsilyl and TIPS = triisopropylsilyl ) are reported . reaction of the trityl salts of the above anions with a variety of zirconium and thorium L2MMe2 complexes in benzene or toluene affords the cationic ion - paired methyl complexes L2MMe+X- or the corresponding hydrido complexes L2MH+X- ( L2 = bis(cyclopentadienyl)- or cyclopentadienylamido-type ligand ) when the reaction is carried out under dihydrogen . the solid state structure of the complex (Me5Cp)2ThMe+B(C6F5) 4- has been characterized by x-ray diffraction . the BC24F20 -- based zirconocenium methyl complexes L2MMe+ are unstable at room temperature with respect to , among other factors , intramolecular C-H activation of the ligand framework . In general , the thermal stabilities of the B(C6F4TBS)4 -- and B(C6F4TIPS)4 -- derived complexes are greater than those of the corresponding BC24F20 -- and MeB(C6F5)3 -- derived analogues . the relative coordinative tendencies of MeB(C6F5)3- , B(C6F5)4- , B(C6F4TBS)4- , and B(C6F4TIPS)4- are estimated from the solution spectroscopic information and the structural dynamics of the ion - pairs and follow the order MeB(C6F5)3- > B(C6F4TBS)4- ≈ B(C6F4TIPS)4- > B(C6F5)4- . the coordination of the neutral metallocene precursors to the cationic metallocenes is found to compete with counteranion coordination . arene solvent coordination to the zirconium constrained geometry cation [(Me4Cp)SiMe2(NtBu)]ZrMe+ is also observed when B(C6F5)4- is the counteranion . (1,2-Me2Cp)2ZrMe+B(C6F 4TBS)4- undergoes slow decomposition under an inert atmosphere to afford [(1,2-Me2Cp)2ZrF]2(m-F)+B(C 6F4TBS)4- , which has been characterized by x-ray diffraction . the olefin polymerization activity and thermal stability of the zirconocene catalysts reaches a maximum when B(C6F4TBS)4- and B(C6F4TIPS)4- are used as counteranions . the polymerization activity of the zirconium constrained geometry complex also reaches a maximum in aromatic solvents when B(C6F5)4- is used as the counteranion , apparently due to solvent coordination . 
As modifications of the effective catalyst precursor [dimethylsilanediylbis(benz[e]indenyl)]-zirconium dichloride , the ansa - zirconocene complexes Me2Si(cyclopenta[c]phenanthryl)2ZrCl2 , Me2Si(cyclopenta[l]phenanthryl)2ZrCl2 , Me2Si(2-methylcyclopenta[l]phenanthryl)2ZrCl2 , and Me2Si(2-methyltetrahydrobenz[e]indenyl)2ZrCl2 have been synthesized . when activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , these complexes give highly active catalysts for the polymerization of propene to polymers with high isotacticities and molecular weights .

this paper reports the convenient " one - pot " synthesis of a bifunctional - me <nUm> cp ̂ phenolate - ligand and the efficient " one - step " synthesis of the corresponding Ti IV and Zr IV complexes . the reaction of 2-bromo-4-methylphenol with <nUm> equiv of n BuLi followed by addition of 2,3,4,5-tetramethyl-2-cyclopentenone produces the bifunctional mono-Cp phenol ligand precursor 2-(tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)-4-methylphenol ( (TCP)H <nUm> , <nUm> ) . reaction of <nUm> with Ti(CH <nUm> -Ph ) <nUm> at <nUm> ° C in toluene cleanly generates (TCP)Ti(CH <nUm> ph ) <nUm> ( 2 ) , while the corresponding reaction with Zr(CH <nUm> ph ) <nUm> at higher temperatures affords the chelated C <nUm> -symmetric zirconocene ( TCP ) <nUm> Zr ( 3 ) . In solution at room temperature , the two benzyl groups of <nUm> are magnetically equivalent , however , in the solid state , x-ray diffraction reveals that one benzyl group is coordinated in a normal η <nUm> -fashion and the other in an η <nUm> - mode . the small Cp-(centroid)-Ti-O angle of <nUm> ° in <nUm> indicates sterically open features in common with amido-based " constrained geometry " polymerization catalysts . low - temperature NMR - scale reactions of <nUm> with B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> and ph <nUm> C + B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> - indicate the formation of the corresponding cationic complexes (TCP)TiCH <nUm> ph + PhCH <nUm> B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> - ( 4 ) and (TCP)TiCH <nUm> ph + B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> - ( 5 ) . upon activation with ph <nUm> C + B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> - , complex <nUm> is highly active for ethylene , propylene , and styrene polymerization . 
tris(b-perfluoronaphthyl)borane ( BC30F21 , PNB ) is synthesized from b-perfluoronaphthyllithium and BCl3 to serve as a new strong organo-Lewis acid cocatalyst . PNB efficiently activates a variety of group <nUm> dimethyl complexes to form highly active homogeneous ziegler - natta olefin polymerization catalysts . reaction of PNB with rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrMe2 and CGCMMe2 ( m = Zr , Ti ; CGC = Me2Si(e5-Me4C5)( tBuN ) ) ( <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio ) rapidly produces the base - free cationic complexes rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrMe+MePNB- ( 1 ) and CGCMMe+MePNB- ( m = Zr , <nUm> ; Ti , <nUm> ) , respectively . the m-methyl dinuclear cationic complex [(CGCTiMe)2(m-Me)]+MePNB- ( 4 ) is formed when a <nUm> : <nUm> CGCTiMe2 : PNB stoichiometry is employed : In the case of group <nUm> dimethyl zirconocenes , L2ZrMe2 ( L = e5-C5H5 , cp ; e5-1,2-Me2C5H3 , cp'' ) , reaction in a <nUm> : <nUm> metallocene : PNB ratio affords cationic complexes L2ZrMe+MePNB- ( L = cp , <nUm> ; cp'' , <nUm> ) , while the reaction with a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio affords dinuclear m-methyl cationic complexes [(L2ZrMe)2(m-Me)]+MePNB- ( L = cp , <nUm> ; cp'' , <nUm> ) . In both reactions , m-F dinuclear cationic complexes [(L2ZrMe)2(M-F)]+MePNB- ( L = cp , <nUm> ; cp'' , <nUm> ) are formed as byproducts . BC20F15H3N and BC2H3N2P were synthesized and characterized . analysis of the BC2H3N2P + BC18F15 ⇄ BC20F15H3N + PNB equilibrium yields DH ° = <nUm> kcal / mol and DS ° = <nUm> eu , suggesting PNB has somewhat higher lewis acidity and is sterically more encumbered than BC18F15 . solution n(CN) values for BC2H3N2P and (C6F5)3-BNCCH3 are <nUm> and <nUm> cm-1 , respectively , which indicate strong lewis acidity . B2C2H3NP can not be detected in the reaction of BC20F15H3N with PBB [ PBB = tris-(2,2',2''-perfluorobipheny)lborane ] over prolonged periods at <nUm> ° C . In ethylene polymerization , PNB - derived cationic complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> have catalytic activities similar to the BC18F15 - derived analogues , while <nUm> and <nUm> have substantially higher activities . In propylene polymerization , catalyst <nUm> has higher activity than the BC18F15 analogue . In the case of ethylene and 1-hexene copolymerization , PNB - derived cationic complex <nUm> exhibits higher polymerization activity with similar 1-hexene incorporation versus the BC18F15 - derived cationic complex . In large - scale batch copolymerizations of ethylene and 1-octene mediated by CGCTiMe2 , the PNB - based catalytic systems exhibit approximately twice the activity of the BC18F15 - based systems . 
A new synthesis of unbridged mixed ring zirconocenes was developed and a series of mixed ligand zirconocenes with substituted 2-arylindenyl and 1-methyl-2-arylindenyl ligands have been prepared . when activated with methylaluminoxane , the mixed ligand complexes catalyze the polymerization of propylene to give elastomeric polypropylene . the propylene polymerization behavior of the mixed ligand catalysts was compared to that of their bis-(indenyl) analogues to determine the relative contribution of each ligand to the activity and stereospecificity of the catalyst . the effects of 2-arylindenyl and 1-methyl-2-arylindenyl ligands on the stereospecificity of the catalysts are essentially additive ; the stereospecificity of the mixed ring complex is intermediate to that of the bis(2-arylindene) analogues . however , the effect of 1-methyl substitution on catalyst productivity is not additive ; the productivities exhibited by bis(2-arylindenyl)ZrCl2 / MAO and (1-methyl-2-arylindenyl)(2-arylindenyl)ZrCl2 / MAO derived catalysts are similar and substantially higher than those of the bis(1-methyl-2-phenylindenyl)ZrCl2 / MAO catalysts . 
the ( e2-diaryl ketone)zirconocene dimers 17a and 17b ( aryl = phenyl or p-tolyl ) react with the group <nUm> metallocene dihydride complexes [RCp2MH2] ( RCp2M = Cp2Zr , (MeCp)2Zr , or Cp2Hf ) to yield the dimetallic compounds [ (m-e1-O:e2-C,O-Ar2CO)ZrCp <nUm> / H2MRCp2 ] 18a-f . these systems contain a dimetallabicyclic framework in which the two metal centers are bridged by the e2-diaryl ketone ligand oxygen atom and a m-hydride ligand . the remaining hydride ligand is trans-oriented to the m-H moiety at the MRCp2 unit . the complexes 18a-c were characterized by x-ray diffraction . treatment of the complexes <nUm> with BC18F15 results in the selective abstraction of the terminal hydride ligand to form the dimetallic cation complexes [ (m-e1-O:e2-C,O-Ar2CO)ZrCp 2(m-H)MRCp2]+ 19a-f ( with BC18F15H - anion ) . the complexes <nUm> contain the intact ( e2-diaryl ketone)ZrCp2 unit to which a (H-MRCp2)+ cation is formally attached . they exhibit a planar dimetallabicyclic framework , in which the two group <nUm> metal centers are connected by means of the e2-ketone oxygen atom and the m-hydride ligand . the complexes 19a,b and e were characterized by x-ray crystal structure analyses . the complexes <nUm> behave chemically as adducts of the highly reactive (RCp2M-H)+ cations with a metallaoxirane matrix . ethene is polymerized by the systems <nUm> with high catalyst activities . 
five new indenyl zirconium metallocenes with 2-alkyl and 2-aryl substituents were synthesized and characterized . for the synthesis of the ligand the di-Grignard reagent 1,2-bis(magnesiomethyl)benzene dichloride was explored as a synthon to 2-substituted indenes . this procedure provides access to a variety of functionalized 2-indenylmetallocenes such as bis(2-ferrocenylindene)zirconium dichloride and bis(2-adamantylindenyl)zirconium dichloride . crystallographic characterization of bis[2-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)indenyl] zirconium dichloride revealed an anti conformation with a coplanar orientation of the dimethylamino substituent to the aryl ring in the solid state . the polymerization behavior of all five zirconocene dichlorides in liquid propylene was studied in the presence of MAO at various temperatures , and the results were compared to those for the known catalyst system bis-(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride / MAO ( M1 / MAO ) . the productivity of the 2-arylindene metallocenes in propylene polymerization was on the order of 100-7000 kg of PP / ( ( mol of Zr ) h ) . In contrast , the (2-adamantylindenyl)metallocenes exhibited very low productivities of <nUm> kg PP / ( ( mol of Zr ) h ) in propylene polymerization . 
novel aminoboranediyl-bridged zirconocenes [ i-Pr2NB(e5-C5H4) 2]ZrCl2 ( 8b ) and [i-Pr2NB(e5-1-C9H8)2] Cl2Zr ( 4b ) have been prepared and structurally characterized . when activated by excess methylaluminoxane , 4b and 8b form highly active catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene . the catalyst derived from 4b converts propylene to isotactic polypropylene . 
the reaction of [CPh3][B(C6F4R)4] with [Cp'2-ZrH2]2 ( cp' = C5H4SiMe3 ) gives the new binuclear hydrido complexes [Cp'4Zr2H3][B(C6F 4R)4J ( r = F , SiPr3i ) , which are highly active initiators for the polymerization of isobutene and isobutene - isoprene copolymerizations at near - zero concentrations of ionizing solvents . the structure of the trinuclear hydride [ Cp'5(e1:e5-C5H 3-SiMe3)Zr3H4J+[B(C 6F4SiPri3)4]- is reported . 
effective cocatalysts need not contain metalloid / metal-carbon bonds and the properties of the resulting metallocenium cation - anion pairs are sensitive to both the counteranion core structure and the metallocene ancillary litigation . the perfluoroaryloxide salts of the formula Ph3C+Al(OC6F5)4- and Ph3C+M(OC6F5)6- ( m = Nb , Ta ) were synthesized and characterized . In combination with sterically encumbered zirconocene dimethyl complexes , they yield active ethylene polymerization catalysts . 
mixed - ring metallocenes Cp'Cp''MCl2 ( cp' and cp'' = cyclopentadienyl and its substituted derivatives ; m = Ti and Zr ) have been prepared by reacting Cp'MCl3 with the cp'' anion salt , in which the Cp'-M bond is stronger than the Cp''-M bond . ethene has been polymerized with these complexes in the presence of methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) as co-catalyst . the catalytic properties of titanocenes were influenced mainly by the steric effects of cyclopentadienyl ring substituents . both steric and electronic effects of substituents influenced the catalytic properties of zirconocenes . 
polymerization of propylene with the three - component catalytic system bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride-alkyl magnesium chloride-triisobutylaluminum is studied . the annelated zirconocene is alkylated by the grignard reagent . the three - component system is as good in activity as two - component systems with polymethylalumoxane as a cocatalyst . stereoblock elastomeric polypropylene with a high molecular weight is formed . 
the investigation of the intermolecular composition distribution of an ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers using DSC method has been carried out . the known methods : step crystallization ( SC ) and successive self - nucleation / annealing ( SSA ) have been adapted for this purpose , and particularly , the optimal condition of the process have been chosen to enable the best fractional crystallization of the copolymer . the method has been applied for fractionation of two ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers synthesized with supported vanadium and zirconocene catalysts and having similar concentrations of 1-hexene . although metallocene catalysts are known from their more homogeneous structure of active sites in comparison to multi-site ziegler - natta catalysts , the copolymers obtained over both catalytic systems gave DSC curves resolved into several peaks but with different melting points . using the thomson - gibbs equation , comparable average lamellar thickness of the separated peaks has been calculated . the amounts of copolymer fraction with defined lamellar thickness have been determined . it was obtained that the copolymer produced from the metallocene system contains a thinner and more homogeneous lamella thickness than that obtained with ziegler - natta vanadium catalyst supported on the same carrier . 
the use of two different types of metallocene catalysts in the dehydrogenative coupling of phenylsilane to produce poly(phenylsilane) was investigated . the metallocene catalysts were first synthesized ( i ) through the reaction of zirconcene dichloride with n-butyllithium in toluene and ( ii ) through the reaction of zirconocene dichloride with sec-butyllithium in toluene . after the catalyst synthesis , phenylsilane was added in situ commencing polymerization of the phenylsilane to poly ( phenylsilane ) through dehydrogenative coupling in each case . the resulting poly(phenylsilanes) were characterized by 1H NMR , GPC , FTIR , and UV / vis , and were shown to be successful photoinitiators for a variety of acrylate and methacrylate type monomers . 
organometallic compounds Cp2TiCl2 , ( EtC 5H4)2NbCl2 , and ( Pr iC5H4)2WCl2 were assessed as additives that control polymer chain growth in the polymerization of methyl methacrylate . In the presence of compounds mentioned in amounts comparable with that of the initiator , a uniform process with no gel - effect occured and respective linear increase in the molecular weight of the polymer up to high degrees of the monomer conversion was observed . 
ethylene polymerizations were performed with a catalytic system composed of titanocene(III)-b-diketonate complex such as [Cp2Ti(III)(1-benzoylacetonato)] or [Cp2Ti(III)(dibenzoylmethanato)] and MMAO . these catalysts are active for the polymerization of ethylene to give high - density polyethylene with high molecular weight . 
activities of ethylene / a-olefin copolymerization were found to increase with silane - modified silica - supported MAO using ansazirconocene catalyst . the increase in activities was less pronounced when higher a-olefins were used . however , silane modification resulted in the narrower molecular weight distribution of polymers . 13C NMR revealed that ethylene incorporation in all systems gave polymers with the similar triad distribution . 
density functional theory with hybrid exchange - correlation functional B3P86 is used to calculate the molecular structures of neutral Fe (II) complexes formed in the LFeCl <nUm> / AlMe <nUm> system ( L = tridentate bis(imine)pyridyl ligand ) . A simplified model of the LFeCl <nUm> complex is used in calculations , where L is replaced by three NH <nUm> ligands . parameters of geometric and electronic structures of the complexes ( NH <nUm> ) 3FeMe(m-Me)AlMe <nUm> ( I ) and ( NH <nUm> ) 3FeMe(m-Me) 2AlMe <nUm> ( IIA and IIB ) , which are the structures where the Fe-Me and Fe-m-Me groups are in one or two perpendicular planes , respectively , were determined . complexes II , which were earlier identified using 1H NMR spectroscopy , are more stable than complex I . complex IIB is strongly polarized ( the distances r(Fe-m-Me) and r(Al-m-Me) are <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ) and coordinatively unsaturated due to the transfer of the methyl group from ( NH <nUm> ) 3FeMe <nUm> onto AlMe <nUm> . it has significant electron density deficit in the coordination sphere of the transition metal [ ( NH <nUm> ) 3FeMe ] q ( q = +0.80e ) . the energetic profile of the reaction of ethylene addition to the Fe-Me bond for the complexes ( NH <nUm> ) 3FeMe <nUm> , IIA and IIB , was calculated . it was shown that , compared to ( NH <nUm> ) 3FeMe <nUm> , a drastic decrease in the activation energy of ethylene addition is observed in the case of IIB ( from <nUm> to <nUm> kJ / mol ) . the reason for the more efficient activation of the complexes LFeMe <nUm> by a weak lewis acid ( AlMe <nUm> ) and for the increased reactivity of the metal - alkyl bond in complex IIB compared to the zirconocene complex cp 2ZrMe <nUm> is discussed . 
the surface compounds of zirconium in OSi <nUm> / MAO / cp 2ZrMe <nUm> ( I ) and OSi <nUm> / cp 2ZrMe <nUm> ( II ) catalysts were studied by the IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO at 93-293 K . it was found that the bridging and terminal complexes of CO were formed on the surface of the catalysts at <nUm> K ; the adsorption of CO was reversible . At <nUm> K , CO was irreversibly inserted into the Zr-Me bond with the formation of various acyl compounds of zirconium ; these compounds were characterized by absorption bands in the region 1495-1750 cm <nUm> in the IR spectrum . these data suggested the heterogeneity of the surface composition of zirconocene catalysts I and II . catalyst I , which was active in ethylene polymerization , contained surface zirconium complexes that can be considered as the precursors of active centers for ethylene polymerization . 
macrocyclic compounds are central to the development of new drugs , but preparing them can be challenging because of the energy barrier that must be surmounted in order to bring together and fuse the two ends of an acyclic precursor such as an alkene ( also known as an olefin ) . to this end , the catalytic process known as ring - closing metathesis ( RCM ) has allowed access to countless biologically active macrocyclic organic molecules , even for large - scale production . stereoselectivity is often critical in such cases : the potency of a macrocyclic compound can depend on the stereochemistry of its alkene ; alternatively , one isomer of the compound can be subjected to stereoselective modification ( such as dihydroxylation ) . kinetically controlled z - selective RCM reactions have been reported , but the only available metathesis approach for accessing macrocyclic e-olefins entails selective removal of the z-component of a stereoisomeric mixture by ethenolysis , sacrificing substantial quantities of material if e / z ratios are near unity . use of ethylene can also cause adventitious olefin isomerization- A particularly serious problem when the e-alkene is energetically less favoured . here , we show that dienes containing an E-alkenyl-B(pinacolato) group , widely used in catalytic cross-coupling , possess the requisite electronic and steric attributes to allow them to be converted stereoselectively to e-macrocyclic alkenes . the reaction is promoted by a molybdenum monoaryloxide pyrrolide complex and affords products at a yield of up to <nUm> per cent and an e / z ratio greater than <nUm> / <nUm> . we highlight the utility of the approach by preparing recifeiolide ( a 12-membered - ring antibiotic ) and pacritinib ( an 18-membered - ring enzyme inhibitor ) , the z - isomer of which is less potent than the e-isomer . notably , the 18-membered - ring moiety of pacritinib- A potent anti-cancer agent that is in advanced clinical trials for treating lymphoma and myelofibrosis - was prepared by RCM carried out at a substrate concentration <nUm> times greater than when a ruthenium carbene was used . 
catalytic reactions that enable the formation of new bonds to carbon centres play a pervasive role in the state - of - the - art synthesis of organic molecules and macromolecules . In contrast , the development of analogous processes as routes to main group compounds and materials has been much slower . nevertheless , recent advances have led to a broad expansion of this field and now allow access to a wide range of catenated structures based on elements across the p block . these breakthroughs have already impacted areas such as hydrogen storage and transfer , functional inorganic polymers and ceramic thin films . dehydrogenation and dehydrocoupling processes are particularly well developed and may be mediated by either transition metal or main group catalysts . such pathways represent an increasingly attractive and convenient alternative to traditional routes , such as salt metathesis and reductive coupling reactions . an overview of this emerging area is presented in this review with a focus on recent developments and future challenges . 
A living polymerization that involved photoexcited metal - containing ferrocenophane monomers was studied . the monomers used in the study are silicon - bridged ferrocenophanes , which are ferrocene derivatives where a single silicon atom bridges the two cyclopentadienyl ligands . under photo - irradiation polymerization was found to be proceeding to a near - quantitative conversion , and the resulting polymer has a molecular weight determined by the polydispersity index . the polymerization is highly reproducible provided that the reaction temperature is controlled . the experiments conducted using optical filters verified that photo - irradiation of the reaction mixture at wavelengths corresponding to the lowest energy absorption is necessary for polymerization in the presence of C2H5Na initiator . 
we describe the synthesis of a styrene-ethylene copolymer using a trivalent titanium - based polymerization catalyst system , tris(acetylacetonate)titanium ( ti(acac) <nUm> ) , combined with triisobutylaluminum - modified methylaluminoxane . gel - permeation chromatography measurement revealed that copolymerization using the above-mentioned catalyst system yielded a mixture of two different polymers . 13C nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) analysis of the soxhlet - extracted fractions indicated that the insoluble part contained a long ethylene-ethylene sequence and an isolated styrene unit , whereas the soluble part contained a syndiotactic styrene - styrene sequence with ethylene units adjacent to continuous styrene units . the ratio of the styrene - styrene sequence to the styrene-ethylene joint part of the soxhlet - soluble fraction , estimated from the NMR resonances , increased with the styrene content . the melting temperature of the soxhlet - soluble fraction also increased with the ( styrene - styrene ) / ( styrene-ethylene ) ratio of the polymers . these two results together indicate that a block - like copolymer was produced that contained long syndiotactic polystyrene portions separated by ethylene units . 
this study aims to explore an effective route for the graft copolymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) monomer onto syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) using free - radical polymerization , and the effects of an organophilic montmorillonite on the final properties of graft copolymer samples . for this purpose , the chlorine groups of a-phenyl-chloro-acetylated sPS were converted to 9-decen-1-oxy groups by a substitution nucleophilic reaction in the presence of a solvent composed of 9-decen-1-ol moiety , sodium hydride ( HNa ) and dry N,N-dimethylformamide . the vinyl-terminated sPS multicenter macromonomer ( VsPSM ) obtained was used in free - radical copolymerization with MMA monomer in a heterogeneous process to yield a graft copolymer ( sPS-graft-poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( sPS-g-PMMA ) ) . the structure of VsPSM and sPS-g-PMMA were determined by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy . thereafter , organophilic MMT was obtained after being treated with hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride salt by an ion - exchange process . finally , the sPS-g-PMMA / MMT nanocomposite was prepared by a solution intercalation method . x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were used to confirm nanocomposite formation . it was found that the addition of only a small amount of organoclay ( <nUm> wt % ) was enough to improve the thermal stabilities and properties of the nanocomposite . 
Pd complexes with diimine ligands promoted the controlled cyclopolymerization of 1,6-dienes and 1,6,11-trienes to afford polymers containing 1,2-trans-cyclopentane groups with well - regulated stereochemistry . the polymerization proceeded with quantitative cyclization of the monomer , even under bulk conditions or in copolymerization reactions with ethylene and a-olefins . the polymerization of monomers with oligomethylene spacers yielded polymers with five - membered rings that are accurately distributed along the polymer chain . 4-Alkylcyclopentenes and alkenylcyclohexanes were also polymerized by Pd - diimine complexes to afford polymers with 1,3-trans- cyclopentane groups and 1,4-trans-cyclohexane groups , respectively . Pd complexes with a C <nUm> symmetrical structure promoted the isospecific polymerization of 4-alkylcyclopentenes , and the resultant isotactic polymers showed liquid crystalline properties . the mechanism of the polymerization reaction has been revealed . 
polymeric material development has made great progress owing to the innovations in catalyst technology for polymerization . In recent years , the use of polyolefins has been expected to expand to various applications as substitutions for materials such as metal , paper and wood . therefore , metallocene catalysts are a key technology for producing high - performance polyolefins specifically designed for a given application . In this report , we present a novel polypropylene ( low modulus polypropylene : LMPP ) with low isotacticity and high molecular weight , and which is synthesized using specific C2 - symmetric doubly bridged metallocene complexes . LMPP possesses some isotactic sequences in stereorandom order , and its tacticity can be precisely controlled through the design of the metallocene catalysts . LMPP can be provided as pellets and be applicable to hot melt adhesives , elastic fibers , nonwoven fabrics and so on , because of its unique elastomeric properties and excellent compatibility with isotactic polypropylene . 
tremendous effort has been directed toward the design of an organic ligand framework around the catalytically active metal center of homogeneous catalyst precursors . this work is aimed at controlling not only the reactivity of the metal catalysts for a-olefin polymerization but also the molecular weight , molecular weight distribution , polymer microstructure and monomer content of the copolymers . among the catalyst precursor categories , non-bridged half - metallocene complexes supported by a variety of chelating ligands are attractive catalyst motifs for ethylene homopolymerization , ethylene / a-olefin copolymerization and stereoselective polymerization of a-olefins . these motifs are attractive in terms of their rather simple synthetic protocols and the wide range of potential architectural designs of the attached ligands . this review article summarizes recent developments regarding non-bridged half - metallocene complexes of group 4-6 metals with anionic chelating ligands . In contrast to the conventional metallocene initiators cp <nUm> MX <nUm> ( cp = η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ) , half - metallocene complexes of the type CpM(L^L)X <nUm> ( L^L = chelating ligands ) offer the advantage of catalyst modification . steric and / or electronic modification of the coordination environment can be achieved by changing one cyclopentadienyl ligand of a metallocene complex to another ligand , such as three- , four- , five- , six- or seven - membered chelates having bidentate or tridentate coordinations and being monoanionic , dianionic or trianionic . half - metallocene complexes with a four - membered chelating ring are focused on due to their unique dynamic behaviors of metal - centered racemization and chain transfer . the structural uniqueness of the metal complexes , the effects of the chelate ring sizes on their productivity and the activation processes of the metal complexes with cocatalysts are highlighted . 
A new type of asymmetric chirogenic polymerization by asymmetric allylic substitution catalyzed by planar – chiral ruthenium complexes was designed . the polymerization systems function in a highly stereoselective manner to afford optically active polymers with high selectivity . the asymmetric carbon in the main chain is precisely controlled . each monomer unit of the polymer has a potentially reactive terminal olefin , which can be used for further transformations . optically active polymers bearing chiral cyclic architecture were prepared by a combination of asymmetric allylic substitution and ring - closing metathesis reaction employing the terminal olefin of the side chains . additionally , the efficient introduction of a wide range of substituents into the side chain of the optically active polymer without any racemization has been made possible by using the thiol – ene reaction . Poly-N-alkoxyamides obtained by our asymmetric polymerization can be transformed into nonnatural polypeptides containing an aromatic ring on the peptide backbone , called a poly “ arylopeptide ” , through reductive cleavage of the N – O bond in n-alkoxyamide . the resulting polymer adopts a one - handed stable helical conformation in solution . 
, part of springer Nature.More than <nUm> years have passed since ziegler and natta shared the nobel prize in chemistry for their discovery of olefin polymerization catalysts . the field of metal - catalysed polymerization has since matured , in no small part owing to the development of several high - performance catalysts . although polymerization research has in many ways been driven by catalyst development , this has often occurred as a result of trial and error discovery of a promising motif , followed by extensive tuning of the steric and electronic properties of the ligand ( s ) present in the lead complex . recently , some alternative design strategies have emerged that afforded new classes of olefin polymerization catalysts . this perspective highlights recently designed catalyst motifs and the novel reactivity patterns they enable . special attention is given to methods specifically designed for the copolymerization of ethylene with polar - functionalized co-monomers — challenging reactions that showcase these creatively designed catalyst motifs . 
this chapter reports the application of different organic compounds as photosensitizers for selected types of co-initiators . these chromophores possess strong absorption bands at wavelengths ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> nm and are shown to facilitate photoinitiated radical polymerization of acrylates , for example 2-ethyl-(2-hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol triacrylate ( TMPTA ) and 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate ( HDDA ) , and sometimes also the cationic polymerization of epoxides . the polymerizations are initiated at room temperature by using long - wavelength visible light in the presence of borate salts , aliphatic and aromatic amines , iodonium salts , n-alkoxypyridinium salts , 1,3,5-triazine derivatives and silane compounds acting as co-initiators . 
during the past decade , photopolymerization has been the focus of intense research efforts owing to the constant growth of industrial applications and the development of new photoinitiators and monomers . the applicability of photopolymerization extends from conventional areas , such as coatings , inks , and adhesives , to high - tech domains , such as optoelectronics , laser imaging , stereolithography , 3D-printing and nanotechnology . from a mechanistic point of view , a photopolymerization reaction is initiated by a photoinitiator or a photoinitiating system , which , under exposure to a light source , generates active species , inducing the polymerization process . over the years , various photoinitiating systems have been developed , expanding the scope of applicability . recently , the field of photopolymerization has undergone a renaissance with the development of photocatalytic systems enabling the content of photoinitiators in the photocurable resins to be drastically reduced , allowing the polymerization speed to increase and higher conversion yields . In this chapter , we propose an overview of the principal visible light photoredox catalysts used in photopolymerization reactions . especially , a special emphasis will be devoted to photocatalysts operating under low light intensity exposure . 
A series of group IV metal catalysts was designed by using the " sidearm strategy " . the sidearm group is envisioned to act as a controller of the shape and / or electronic properties of the catalytic site and so to tune the behaviours of olefin (co)polymerization . As expected , the coordination pattern of the newly - designed ligands with titanium tetrachloride leads to complexes of monoligand trichloro titanium , and this result makes the steric space of the active site for polymerization readily tunable via variation of the sidearm . In the presence of MMAO , these complexes show excellent activity to copolymerize ethylene and comonomer . 1-Alkenes , cycloolefins , o-alkenol , o-alkenoic acid , and o-alkenoic ester could be incorporated into the PE backbone efficiently . In addition , both SHOP type nickel complexes and bisoxazolines were modified by the sidearm strategy . based on this simple strategy , the activity of the resulting nickel complexes increased obviously and the newly - designed SaBOX played the key role in a highly syndiospecific ( > <nUm> % rr ) and controlled ATRP of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) , allyl methacrylate ( AMA ) and vinyl methacrylate ( VMA ) under mild polymerization conditions . 
two case histories are reported where noncovalent interactions play an important role in olefin polymerization catalyzed by transition metals . In the first example , by using DFT calculations , the influence of a-agostic interactions on the stereoselectivity of propene insertion reactions and their contribution to developing new models for the isotactic stereocontrol achieved with nonmetallocene catalysts are considered . In the second example , experimental and theoretical results aimed at explaining the role of noncovalent interactions ( such as FH or FM , where m = metal center ) in living olefin polymerization promoted by group <nUm> nonmetallocene systems and also the chain - branching formation of polyethylene obtained with late transition metals are summarized .

In the presence of cocatalysts , these dinuclear organo-rare-earth - metal alkyl complexes could initiate isoprene polymerization with high activity ( <nUm> % conversion of <nUm> equiv. of isoprene in <nUm> h ) , yielding polymers with high regioselectivity ( <nUm> polymers up to <nUm> % ) . 
the phosphine stabilized ethylene complex of zirconocene , Cp2Zr , reacts with <nUm> equiv. of BC18F15 to form the girdle - type zwitterion Cp2Zr+(PPh3Me)CH2CH 2B-(C6F5)3 <nUm> , which serves as an ethene polymerization catalyst either with or without added BC18F15 . 
the fascinating story of the discovery of the metallocene-methylaluminoxane catalysts for olefin polymerization is reviewed from its conception up until the first commercial production of polymers . A great number of different titanocenes and zirconocenes have been synthesized that give tailored polymers of totally different structures , and allows control of polymer tacticity , molecular weight and molecular weight distribution to be more efficient . new kinds of copolymers and elastomers can be synthesized .

the dimerization and ion - pair formation enthalpies of advanced silicon bridged bisindenyl zirconocenes have been estimated at the density functional ( DFT ) level of theory . according to our calculations ( based on molecular mechanics geometry optimization with subsequent DFT geometry relaxation ) , a properly designed bisindenyl ligand sphere helps to avoid catalyst dimerization and reduces coordination of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) anions to cationic sites . interestingly , we also found a correlation between the dipole moment of the active species considered here and their catalytic performance . these results suggest that an appropriate substituent pattern favours complexation of propylene monomers as the dominant mechanism to stabilize electron deficient active sites due to a diminution of particular intermolecular forces which yield catalytically inactive resting states . 
chiral boron - bridged ansa - type zirconocenes can be prepared in a few simple steps ; various donor molecules such as Et2O , THF or PMe3 undergo complexation at boron leading to catalysts having vastly different catalytic properties in ziegler - natta polymerization of propene ; the PMe3 - containing catalyst is the most active and stereoselective ( <nUm> % isotacticity ) . 
the ligand to metal charge transfer ( LMCT ) transitions of racemic siloxy substituted ethylene bridged bis(indenyl) - type zirconocenes were studied using UV / VIS spectroscopy in combination with ab initio hartree - fock and hybrid density functional B3LYP methods . clear correlations between the experimental LMCT absorption energies and theoretical HOMO-LUMO energy gaps were observed . the LMCT absorption energies were analysed as a function of the ligand structure . hydrogenation of the indenyl ring and position of the siloxy substituent have strong influences on HOMO-LUMO energy gaps , and consequently on the observed absorption energies .

the compound [HNMe2Ph][NpB(C6F5) 3](Np = C5H11 ) reacts with dimethylzirconocenes to give active propylene polymerization catalysts which are significantly more active and give higher molecular weight polypropylene than do the catalysts obtained using BC18F15 ; the [ BC18F15Np ) anion is for steric reasons more weakly coordinating than is [MeB(C6F5)3] . 
metathesis is one of the most spectacular recent improvements in synthetic strategies for organic synthesis and polymer science . the historical aspects and modern developments of the metathesis reactions are summarized here . In particular , emphasis is placed on the leading role played by the mechanistic work and proposals of yves chauvin and on the history of the efficient catalysts discovered by the groups of r . R. schrock and r . H. grubbs . it is pointed out how the chauvin metathesis mechanism , with formation of a metallacyclobutane , has been generalized to many organometallic reactions that also involve square intermediates comprising a metal atom . subsequently , the progressive development of ideas by schrock and grubbs during the last three decades has brought the field to the forefront of synthetic chemistry . the quest for efficient metathesis catalysts is a success story , starting from organometallic mechanisms , that has now invaded the worlds of organic synthesis and polymer science . indeed , the schrock ' and grubbs ' catalysts and their derivatives are now the most efficient catalysts compatible with functional groups for the metathesis reactions . they considerably shorten synthetic schemes by affording new routes and therefore have changed the way chemists think about synthesis . 
homogeneous catalysts for olefin polymerization such as metallocene or half - sandwich complexes containing the metals titanium , zirconium and hafnium , or other transition - metal coordination complexes can be functionalized with alkenyl groups and have then the potential to copolymerize with olefins to give heterogeneous catalysts . In a similar manner metallacyclic metallocene complexes with a metal-carbon σ bond allow the catalytic insertion of olefins into this bond and produce heterogeneous catalysts . it is also possible to functionalize the active species of the cocatalyst methylalumoxane ( MAO ) and use it for self - immobilization processes . the high excess of MAO that is necessary in homogeneous solution can be reduced by more than <nUm> % with this method .

bimetallic dichlorotitanium complexes , { 2,6-[e5-2,5-Me 2C5H2]2-4-R-C6H 2N-N}{Ti(iv)Cl2}2 ( <nUm> , r = me ; <nUm> , r = F ) and 4,4'-A[{2-(e5-2,3,5-Me3C5H)C 6H3NC6H11-kN}Ti(iv)Cl 2]2 ( <nUm> , A = CH2 ; <nUm> , A = O ; <nUm> , A = ortho-C6H4 ) are prepared via a key step of the suzuki - coupling reaction of 2-dihydroxyboryl-3-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one ( 1 ) with dibromo-compounds . the solid state structure of <nUm> was determined by x-ray crystallography . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> are not active for ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization . meanwhile , the complexes 18-20 are highly active and their activities are higher than that of the mononuclear analogue , { 2-(e5-2,3,5-Me3C5H)C6H 3NC6H11-kN}Ti(iv)Cl2 ( 21 ) . the molecular weights of the polymers obtained with the bimetallic complexes 18-20 are higher than that of the polymer obtained using <nUm> . slightly higher contents of long-chain-branching are observed for the copolymers obtained using the bimetallic system . 
the caesium triphosphenide Cs[tBu3SiPPPSitBu3] was accessible from the reaction of CsF with the sodium triphosphenide Na[tBu3SiPPPSitBu3] in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature . In contrast to the preparation of tetrahydrofuran-solvated silanides M[SitBu3] ( m = Li , Na , K ) , our efforts to synthesize the caesium silanide Cs[SitBu3] as a tetrahydrofuran complex failed . when tBu3SiBr was treated with an excess of caesium metal in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature , the caesium enolate Cs[OCHCH2] and the supersilane tBu3SiH formed rather than the silanide Cs[SitBu3] . X-Ray quality crystals of the enolate Cs[OCHCH2] ( orthorhombic , pnma ) were obtained from tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature . In contrast to the structures of its homologues M[tBu3SiPPPSitBu3] ( m = Na , K ) , the caesium triphosphenide Cs[tBu3SiPPPSitBu3] features a polymer in the solid state ( orthorhombic , cmcm ) .

though still somewhat neglected in most textbooks of organic chemistry , the importance of reactions involving radicals and radical ions as intermediates is widely recognized . these reactions are of interest to synthetic chemists because they can be used to introduce structural features that often can not be achieved readily with conventional two electron ( polar ) processes . In addition to their utility in organic and polymer synthesis , these reactions are also important in a number of other areas including biochemistry , medicine , food science , atmospheric chemistry - just to name a few . through the popular press , even the general public is aware of radicals , mainly in the context of health and nutrition , as evidenced by the increased interest in antioxidants . this chapter reviews some of the more significant and interesting developments in <nUm> dealing with the mechanism of radical and radical ion reactions in solution , several developments for which are especially worth noting . for example , " simple " hydrogen atom transfer reactions have been thoroughly studied since the 1940s , because among other reasons , they are fundamentally important to understanding the oxidation of virtually all organic - based materials . yet , recent work has shown that there are at least four different mechanisms via which a hydrogen atom can be transferred . it is also noteworthy that modern , high - level molecular orbital calculations are now commonly used to probe the mechanisms of radical reactions - often dealing with issues that are impossible to address experimentally . finally , the number of publications describing radical - type reactions in biology and medicine continued to grow in <nUm> , with the increasing recognition of these intermediates as critical in numerous biological processes . 
conducting polymers are unique reactive materials whose composition ( polymer - counterion - solvent ) shifts ( non-stoichiometry ) under electrochemical control in liquid electrolytes . the involved events ( electric pulses , conformational movements , ions and solvent composition change , or shift of the intra- and intermolecular forces ) mimic similar events occurring during living functions in cells . A new unexplored world for basic academic research and for the development of new biomimicking devices is emerging . combination of chemical reactions and conformational energy of the chains open a new paradigm : there are great expectations for the development of electrochemical actuators ( artificial muscles , smart windows , smart membranes , smart drug delivery ) intelligent devices able to sense their surroundings during work . scientists and engineers able to develop new theoretical models to quantify conformational movements stimulated by the chemical reactions in dense and wet polymeric materials ( artificial or biological ) are required . 
the tripodal phosphines MeC(CH 2NMe ) 3P and N(CH 2CH 2NMe ) 3P were converted to the corresponding phosphinimines and the corresponding Ti - complexes MeC(CH 2NMe ) 3PNTiCpCl <nUm> ( 2 ) and N(CH 2CH 2NMe ) 3PNTiCpCl <nUm> ( 5 ) were prepared . these species were also alkylated to give the corresponding dimethyl derivatives . preliminary attempts to utilize these species in the polymerization of ethylene with MAO as the activator resulted in all but negligible activity . an alternative synthetic approach utilizing the bis-phosphinimine ( CH 2(Me)NPtBu <nUm> ) <nUm> was developed to prepare ( CH 2(Me) NP(tBu 2)NSiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> ( 8 ) , ( CH 2(Me) NP(tBu 2)NH ) <nUm> ( 9 ) and subsequently [ ( CH 2(Me) NP(tBu <nUm> N ) 2]Ti(NMe <nUm> ) <nUm> ( 10 ) , [ ( CH 2(Me)NP(tBu <nUm> N ) 2]TiCl <nUm> ( 11 ) and [ ( CH 2(Me)NP(tBu <nUm> N ) 2]TiMe <nUm> ( 12 ) . for comparison purposes the related species [ tBu <nUm> ( me 2N)PN ] 2TiCl <nUm> ( 14 ) and [ tBu <nUm> ( me 2N)PN ] 2TiMe <nUm> ( 15 ) were also prepared . compounds ( 12 ) and ( 15 ) , using <nUm> equiv. of [ ph 3C][B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] as the activator , resulted in moderate to good polymerization activities . 
A series of framework coordination polymers reveals the use of 1,2,4,5-tetrazines as efficient bridging ligands towards silver (i) and copper (i) ions . all four nitrogen atoms were functional as lone pair donors leading to an unprecedented m4-coordination of the ligands ( 1,2,4,5-tetrazine , ttz ; 3,6-dimethyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine , me2ttz ) in [Ag(ttz)(X)] ( x = NO3 , <nUm> ; ClO4 , <nUm> ) , [Ag2(Me2ttz)(NO3)2] ( 3 ) , [Ag2(Me2ttz)(H2O)2(ClO4)2] ( 4 ) , [Ag3(Me2ttz)(H2O)2(CF3SO3)3] ( 5 ) and [Cu4Cl4(Me2ttz)] ( 6 ) . In <nUm> and <nUm> , m4-tetrazines and silver ions ( AgN4 , Ag – N <nUm> – <nUm> Å ) compose a 3D framework of ( <nUm> ; <nUm> ) topology . structures <nUm> and <nUm> were based on disilver – tetrazine ribbons , while in 5m4-tetrazines interconnect silver – triflate chains . In <nUm> , m4-ligands connect inorganic layers sustained by copper – chloride squares , hexa- and octagons ( <nUm> and <nUm> Å ) . multiple n-coordination to metal ions enhances the ability of the electron deficient tetrazine system for anion ⋯ π binding . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> exhibit very short interactions of this type with corresponding O ⋯ C(N) separations down to a record value of <nUm> Å and O ⋯ π <nUm> Å . for <nUm> , p-acidity of tetrazine was reflected by contacts Cl ⋯ π of <nUm> Å . results of high level ab initio calculations ( RI - MP2 / aug-cc-pVTZ ) were in good agreement with experimental results , and were suggestive of the progressive enhancement of the p-acidity by increasing the number of Ag (i) ions N - coordinated to tetrazine . 
the use of solvents produces the largest amount of auxiliary waste in polymer science . due to the fact that sustainable chemistry is becoming more and more important in polymer research , alternative reaction media have been investigated in order to reduce or replace the use of organic solvents . the most commonly used green solvents in polymer chemistry are water , supercritical carbon dioxide and ionic liquids . the progress of utilizing these green solvents in polymerization processes is reviewed and discussed in this critical review on the basis of results mainly published during the last five years ( <nUm> references ) .

In addition to 1a(NCMe) <nUm> , 1b(NCMe) <nUm> ( OH <nUm> ) and 2(NCMe) <nUm> , a single crystal x-ray determination has been performed on the structurally related salt [ ( L tripp )Ni <nUm> Br <nUm> ( OH <nUm> ) <nUm> ][Br] ( 4 ) . 
tris(pyrazolyl)borate titanium(IV) complexes containing aryloxo ligand of type , TpTiCl2(OAr) [ tp = HB(pyrazolyl)3 ; Ar = 2- iPrC6H4 , C6F5 , 2,6-Ph2C6H3 ] , have been prepared , identified , and the structures of TpTiCl2(OC6F5) , TpTiCl2(O-2,6-Ph2C6H3) have been determined by x-ray crystallography . the 2-iPrC6H <nUm> analogue exhibits especially high catalytic activities for ethylene polymerisation in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , and the activity by TpTiCl2(OAr) increased in the order : Ar = 2-iPrC 6H4 > ph > C6F5 > > 2,6-Ph2C6H3 > 2,6-Me2C 6H3 , 2,6-iPr2C6H <nUm> . 
recent efforts concerning nonbridged half - titanocenes containing anionic donor ligand of the type , Cp'TiX2(Y) [ cp' = cyclopentadienyl group ; x = halogen , alkyl ; Y = anionic ancillary donor ligands such as aryloxo , ketimide etc. ] , as new types of olefin polymerisation catalysts have been reviewed . it has been demonstrated that these complexes displayed unique characteristics especially for ethylene copolymerisation affording new polymers by efficient incorporation of bulky olefins ( so called " traditionally unreactive " monomers in transition metal catalysed coordination polymerisation ) , that have not been attained by the ordinary catalysts . 
condensation of allylcyclopentadiene <nUm> with acetone in the presence of pyrrolidine gave 2-allyl-6,6-dimethylfulvene ( 2 ) . methyllithium addition gave lithium 1-allyl-3-tert-butylcyclopentadienide ( 3 ) . transmetallation with <nUm> equiv. of Cl4Zr yielded the respective functionalized zirconocene dichloride complexes meso-4 and rac-4 , which were both isolated isomerically pure . with <nUm> mol % of [Cl2(PCy3)2RuCHPh] the rac-4 diastereoisomer underwent a clean intramolecular ring - closing olefin metathesis reaction to yield the ansa - zirconocene complex rac-6 . the complexes meso-4 , rac-4 and rac-6 were characterized by x-ray diffraction . treatment of the open metallocenes meso-4 and rac-4 , respectively , with excess methylalumoxane gave rather active ethene polymerization catalysts . the corresponding catalyst derived from the conformationally restricted bulky ansa - metallocene rac-6 is markedly less active . 
A number of transition metal catalysts including early and late transition metals have been investigated for olefin polymerization and copolymerization . progress of the field in this decade is reviewed , and important topics among them such as binary catalysts and polymerization of new monomers are described in detail . our recent results on the polymerization of olefins having cycloalkenes and non-conjugated dienes using late transition metal complexes are also mentioned . 
chiral metallocene cations , discrete main group anions , dually active ion pairs and nucleophile / electrophile pairs have been utilized to transform the polymerization of polar vinyl monomers from one type to another . these discrete or hybrid catalysts have enabled the development of five types of such polymerizations , including stereospecific and living coordination polymerization , asymmetric coordination polymerization , single - site anionic polymerization , bimolecular polymer - transfer polymerization , and diastereospecific ion - pairing polymerization . 
reaction of the amido-bridged zirconium complex ( CpSiMe 2NSiMe2Cp)ZrCH3 ( 1 ) ( cp = C5H <nUm> ) with half an equivalent of BC6F5 <nUm> or Ph3CB(C6F5)4 afforded the binuclear zirconium complexes [ ( CpSiMe2NSiMe 2Cp)Zr)2(m-CH3)][RB(C6F 5)3 ] ( 2a , r = CH3 , 2b , r = C6F <nUm> ) with a methyl group as the bridge between the two zirconium atoms . In the presence of one equivalent of BC18F15 or Ph3C(C6F5)4 , <nUm> was transformed to the zwitterionic complexes [(CpSiMe2NSiMe2Cp)Zr] [RB(C6F5)3] ( 3a , r = CH3 , 3b , r = C6F5 ) which are free of a metal - bound s-alkyl ligand . 2b is stable with Me3Al while 3b combined with me 3Al to form a hetero - binuclear complex [ ( CpSiMe2NSiMe 2Cp)Zr(m-CH3)]Al(CH3)2][B(C 6F5)4 ] ( 4 ) as shown by NMR spectroscopy at room temperature . treatment of 2a or 3a with an excess of Me3Al led to (CpSiMe2NSiMe2Cp)Zr(C6F5) ( 5 ) through a group exchange process . 2b , 3a and <nUm> have been characterized by x-ray diffraction studies . 2a , 2b , 3a and 3b were highly active catalysts for ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with 1-octene in the presence of trialkylaluminium , but the binuclear zirconium complexes ( 2a and 2b ) showed higher activities than their mononuclear counterparts 3a and 3b . polymerization activities varied with the trialkylaluminiums and increased with the trialkylaluminium concentration applied in the system . the product existed mainly in the form of Al(PE)3 with polymeric chains , and its molecular weight and distribution were greatly influenced by the type and amount of trialkylaluminium applied in the catalytic system . 
oxidation of [ CpFe(e5-C5H4PtBu <nUm> ) ] with Me3SiN3 gave the phosphinimine [ CpFe(e5-C5H4PtBu2NSiMe <nUm> ) ] ( 1 ) which was used to prepare [ Cp'TiCl 2(NPtBu2C5H4)FeCp ] ( cp' = cp <nUm> , cp* <nUm> ) and subsequently [ Cp'TiMe2(NPtBu 2C5H4)FeCp ] ( cp' = cp <nUm> , cp* <nUm> ) . similarly , [ (e5-C5Ph5)Fe(e5- C5H4PtBu2NSiMe3 ) ] <nUm> was converted to [ CpTiX2(NPtBu2C5H4) Fe(e5-C5Ph5) ] ( x = Cl <nUm> , me <nUm> ) . the bis-phosphinimine [ Fe{e5-C5H4PtBu 2(NSiMe3)}2 ] ( 9 ) was prepared and used to obtain [ { Fe(e5-C5H4PtBu2N) 2}TiCl2 ] ( 10 ) and [ { Fe(e5-C 5H4PtBu2N)2}TiMe2 ] ( 11 ) . these species exhibited a temperature dependent conformational change in the chelate geometry on the NMR time scale . cyclic voltammetry studies showed pseudo reversible redox waves assigned to the fe2+ / fe3+ couple for <nUm> and <nUm> , while <nUm> exhibited only irreversible oxidations . compound <nUm> was also used to prepare [ Fe(e5-C5H4PtBu 2NTiXCl2)2 ] ( x = Cl <nUm> , cp <nUm> , cp* <nUm> ) . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> react with BC18F15 or [CPh3][B(C6F5)3] to generate salts of the formula [ Cp'TiMe{(NPtBu2C5H 4)FeCp}]X ( cp' = cp , x = [ MeB(C6F5) <nUm> ] 17a , [B(C6F5)4] 17b ; cp' = cp* , x = [MeB(C6F5)3] 18a , [ B(C 6F5)4 ] 18b ) . compounds <nUm> further generated [ Cp*TiMe{HNPtBu2(C5H4) Fe(e5,e1-C5H4)}]X ( x = [MeB(C6F5)3] 19a , [ B(C6F 5)4 ] 19b ) , respectively . the cationic species 17a and 18a are very active polymerization catalysts , giving polyethylene with activities of <nUm> and <nUm> g mmol-1 h-1 atm-1 , respectively at <nUm> ° C . 
economic pressure , environmental issues and ever increasing demand are driving the shift from oil - based polymers to those available from renewable resources . ring opening polymerisation of cyclic esters is currently a topical field with metal complex - induced coordination / insertion type polymerisation leading the way . such a polymerisation method offers a wide range of advantages from control over the polymer structure to kinetic enhancement ; however industrially available catalysts based on tin suffer from inherent toxicity and as a result a policy change from the food and drug administration ( FDA ) is not unrealistic . this review underlines the efforts made in the past five years or so , and shows how low toxicity metals are attracting increasing attention in the field of e-caprolactone polymerisation .

several titanium isopropoxide complexes [ N,N'-bis(2-oxo-3-R 1-5-R2-phenylmethyl)-N,N'-bis(methylene-p-R 3-C6H4)-ethylenediamine]Ti(O iPr)2 [ R1 = t-Bu , R2 = me , r <nUm> = H ( 1b ) ; R1 = R2 = t-Bu , R3 = H , ( 2b ) ; R1 = R2 = Cl , R3 = H , ( 3b ) , R1 = t-Bu , R2 = me , R3 = Cl ( 4b ) ; R1 = r <nUm> = t-Bu , R3 = Cl , ( 5b ) ; R1 = R2 = R3 = Cl , ( 6b ) ] supported over sterically demanding aryloxy based [N2O2]H2 ligands have been designed as precatalysts for the ethylene polymerization . specifically , the 1b-6b complexes , when treated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) under <nUm> ± <nUm> psi of ethylene at <nUm> ° C for <nUm> h , produced polyethylene polymers of high molecular weight ( mw = ca. <nUm> - <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 ) having broad molecular weight distribution ( PDI = ca. <nUm> - <nUm> ) . the 1b-6b complexes were conveniently synthesized from the direct reaction of the [ N 2O2]H2 ligands , 1a-6a , with Ti(O iPr)4 in 69-86 % yield . 
A series of heteroligated (salicylaldiminato)(b-enaminoketonato) titanium complexes of the general formula [ 3-But-2-OC 6H3CHN(C6F5)][PhNC(CF 3)CHC(R)O]TiCl2 ( 3a : RPh , 3b : RC6H 4Ph(p) , 3c : RC6H4Ph(o) , 3d : r = 1-naphthyl , 3e : r = C6H4F2(2,6) , 3f : r = C6H 4Cl2(2,5) , <nUm> g : RC6F4(2,3,5,6)OMe(4) ) were synthesized . the structure of complexes 3d , 3f-g were determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . the x-ray crystallographic analysis indicated these complexes adopted a distorted octahedral geometry around the titanium center . upon activation with modified methylaluminoxane , complexes 3a-g exhibited moderate to good catalytic activity for norbornene ( NB ) vinyl addition polymerization , producing moderate molecular weight polynorbornenes under mild conditions . the introduction of electron - withdrawing groups can greatly enhance the catalytic activity . significantly , the heteroligated titanium complexes displayed greatly improved activity for vinyl addition polymerization of NB compared to homoligated counterparts , which may stem from the suitable combinations of electronic and steric effects . 
starting from 1,1'-diacetylferrocene the ortho-amino,a- dimethylamino[3]ferrocenophane system <nUm> was prepared . this was converted to the o-imino,a-Cp - derivative <nUm> . subsequent treatment with e.g. an excess of methyllithium followed by ClZr <nUm> ( NMe <nUm> ) <nUm> ( thf ) <nUm> and me <nUm> ClSi <nUm> eventually gave the [3]ferrocenophane based cp - amido zirconium complex 11b . In a similar way the [3]ferrocenophane derived fluorenyl-Cp ansa - zirconocene dichloride complex <nUm> was obtained . the 20-methylalumoxane ( MAO ) system is an active homogeneous ziegler - natta catalyst for ethylene polymerization . the 11b-MAO system reacts efficiently with an ethene-1-octene mixture to yield a mixture of linear polyethylene plus the ethene-1-octene copolymer . the compounds <nUm> , <nUm> , 10b , 11b , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were characterized by x-ray diffraction . 
A number of half - zirconocene anilide complexes of the type Cp*ZrCl <nUm> [ N(2,6-R <nUm> <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> )R <nUm> ] [ r <nUm> = i Pr ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) , me ( 2 ) ; r <nUm> = me ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) , bn ( 3 ) ] and Cp*ZrCl[N(2,6-Me <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> )Me ] <nUm> ( 4 ) ( cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ) were synthesized from the reactions of Cp*ZrCl <nUm> with the lithium salts of the corresponding anilide in diethyl ether at room temperature . all new zirconium complexes were characterized by <nUm> H and <nUm> C NMR and elemental analysis . molecular structures of complexes <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> were determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . upon activation with Al i bu <nUm> and ph <nUm> CB(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> , complexes 1-4 exhibit good catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization , and produce polyethylene with a moderate molecular weight . among these zirconium complexes , complex <nUm> shows the highest catalytic activity while complex <nUm> shows the lowest catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization . complexes 1-3 also exhibit moderate catalytic activity for copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene , and produce copolymers with relatively high molecular weight and reasonable 1-hexene incorporation . In addition , the activation procedure of these catalyst systems were studied by <nUm> H NMR spectroscopy . 
this perspective surveys the history of - and recent advances in - metallacycle - mediated coupling chemistry of substituted alkenes . while the reaction of preformed metal-p complexes with ethylene was reported nearly <nUm> years ago , the generalization of this mode of bimolecular C-C bond formation to the regio- and stereoselective union of complex substrates has only recently begun to emerge . this perspective discusses early observations in this area , the challenges associated with controlling such processes , the evolution of a general strategy to overcome these challenges , and a summary of highly regio- and stereoselective convergent coupling reactions that are currently available via metallacyclemediated cross-coupling of substituted alkenes . 
the chemistry of the anions dicyanamide and tricyanomethanide ( dca and tcm , respectively ) has produced a plethora of discoveries over the past few decades , particularly in relation to transition - metal coordination polymers with magnetic coupling . over recent years there have been an increasing number of reports of heterofunctionalised cyano-containing anions , typically derivatives of dicyanomethanide . our own group has been particularly concerned with the amide- and nitroso-functionalised anions carbamoyldicyanomethanide ( cdm ) and dicyanonitrosomethanide ( dcnm ) , respectively . this feature article examines the fascinating diversity of materials and complexes that can be obtained using small cyano anions , ranging from coordination polymers to heterometallic clusters and hydrogen bonding networks . In particular , we focus on results from our own laboratories in the past few years . the magnetic properties of these materials are briefly discussed . 
the coordination polymer [Zn2(1,2-bda)2(bpe)] *MeOH , which exhibits solvochromic effects upon reversible linear alcohol removal and adsorption , can be turned into [ zn2(1,2-bda) 2(tpcb)0.5 ] in two - step SCSC transformations . 
the new polymer presents a p - doping process with anion exchange and its electrochemical reduction with cation exchange during potential cycling . stored specific charges of <nUm> mAh g <nUm> for the polymer reduction and <nUm> mAh g <nUm> for its oxidation make the material very promising for fast charge / discharge batteries or specialised supercapacitors in which the material is also required as the anode . 
the series of half - titanocene 2-(1-(arylimino)ethyl)quinolin-8-olate dichlorides , Cp'TiCl2L ( cp' = e5-C 5H5 or e5-C5Me5 , L = 2-(1-(2,6-R1-4-R2-phenylimino)ethyl)quinolin-8-olate ) , was synthesized via the stoichiometric reaction of Cp'TiCl3 with the corresponding potassium salt , viz. 2-(1-(2,6-R1-4-R 2-phenylimino)ethyl)quinolin-8-olate . all compounds were characterized by elemental analysis , 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy . the molecular structures of complexes C2 and C4 were determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . when activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , all half - titanocene pre-catalysts exhibited high activities for ethylene polymerization and co-polymerization with a-olefins or norbornene . 
A series of 2-(1-(arylimino)propyl)quinolin-8-olate half - titanocene dichlorides , Cp'TiCl2L ( cp' = e5-C 5H5 or e5-C5Me5 , L = 2-(1-(2,6-R1-4-R2-phenylimino)propyl)quinolin-8-olate ) , was synthesized via the stoichiometric reaction of Cp'TiCl3 with the corresponding potassium 2-(1-(2,6-R1-4-R2- phenylimino)propyl)quinolin-8-olate salt . all titanium compounds were characterized by elemental analysis , 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy ; the molecular structures of two representative compounds were determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction . on activation with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , all half - titanocene compounds showed high activity in ethylene polymerization , and furthermore , performed with good to high activities in the co-polymerization of ethylene with either 1-hexene or 1-octene affording polyethylenes with high co-monomer incorporation . less bulky ortho-substituents ( R1 ) on the phenylimino groups were found to enhance the catalytic activities of their titanium compounds . In general , the titanium pro-catalysts containing e5-C5Me5 ( C7 - C12 ) exhibited higher activities than did their analogues bearing e5-C 5H5 ( C1-C6 ) . some of the resultant polyolefins were ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene . 
selected examples concerning effects of both cyclopentadienyl fragment ( cp' ) and anionic donor ligand ( Y ) in nonbridged modified half - titanocenes of the type , Cp'TiX <nUm> ( Y ) ( x = halogen , alkyl ) , as new type of olefin polymerisation catalysts have been reviewed . these complexes displayed unique characteristics not only for ethylene (co)polymerisation but also for syndiospecific styrene polymerisation , ethylene / styrene copolymerisation ; precise fine tuning of the ligand substituents plays an important role for the successful (co)polymerisation ; a different mechanistic consideration for the syndiospecific styrene polymerisation , which can explain the copolymerisation behaviour in this catalysis , has also been introduced . 
metallation of a variety of a,o-dienes has been explored with an η 9,e 5-bis(indenyl)zirconium sandwich compound and an ansa - titanocene dinitrogen complex . the η <nUm> , η 5-bis(indenyl)zirconium sandwich compound , ( η 9- C 9H 5-1,3-Pr 2)(e 5-C 9H 5-1,3- iPr 2)Zr , served as an isolable source of negishi 's reagent and readily formed a kinetic mixture of cis and trans diastereomers of the corresponding zirconacyclopentanes upon diene metallation . for pure hydrocarbon substrates such as 1,6-heptadiene and 1,7-octadiene , an equimolar amount of cis and trans diastereomers were the kinetic products ; isomerization to the thermodynamically favoured trans isomers was observed over time at ambient temperature or upon heating to <nUm> ° C , respectively . by contrast , substitution of the methylene or ethylene spacer in the α , o-diene with a fluorenyl group ( e.g. 9,9-diallylfluorene ) resulted in exclusive kinetic formation of the trans diastereomer . amino-substituted dienes were also readily cyclised and one example was characterised by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . similar studies were also conducted with the ansa - titanocene dinitrogen complex , [ me 2Si(e 5-C 5Me 4)(e 5-C 5H 3-3- tBu)Ti ] <nUm> ( μ <nUm> , η 1,e 1-N <nUm> ) , and both kinetic and thermodynamic selectivities evaluated . the use of a C <nUm> symmetric ansa - metallocene increases the number of isomeric possibilities . for diallyl tert-butyl amine , diene metallation was more selective than for the bis(indenyl)zirconium sandwich compound and isomerization was also more rapid . preliminary functionalisation reactivity for both the zircona- and titanocycles was also explored . 
the mononuclear silyl-linked bis(amidinate) titanium compound <nUm> was prepared by salt metathesis of <nUm> and TiCl4(thf)2 . alkylation of <nUm> with methyllithium gave analogue <nUm> . both <nUm> and <nUm> exhibited a configuration similar to ansa - metallocene and showed good activity towards ethylene polymerization after activation with MAO . 
A series of half - sandwich pentamethylcyclopentadienyl chromium (iii) complexes bearing a salicylaldiminato ligand , Cp*[2-R1-4-R 2-6-(CHNR3)C6H2O]CrCl [ R1 = iPr ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) , tBu ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) , ad ( 6 ) ; R2 = H ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) , tBu ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ; R3 = iPr ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) , tBu ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) ] , were synthesized . all complexes were characterized by elemental analyses and the structures of complexes 1-4 and <nUm> were determined by x-ray diffraction analysis . these complexes adopt a pseudo-octahedral coordination environment with a three - legged piano stool geometry . upon activation with a small amount of AlR3 , complexes 1-6 all catalyze the polymerization of ethylene in a quasi living fashion with good to high catalytic activity under mild conditions and produce ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene as spherical particles with a diameter of 1-6 mm . the catalytic activity of these complexes and the molecular weight of the produced polyethylene can be tuned in a broad range by changing the R1 , r <nUm> , and R3 groups as well as the AlR3 cocatalyst . it was found that complex <nUm> with R1 = ad , R2 = tBu , and R3 = iPr shows the highest catalytic activity and produces polyethylene with the highest molecular weight . 
binuclear half - metallocene chromium complexes { Cp*[3-(CHNR)-2-O- C10H5]CrCl}2 [ cp* = C5Me <nUm> ; r = iPr ( 1 ) , ph ( 2 ) , 2,6-iPr 2C6H3 ( 3 ) ] based on 1,1'-binaphthyl ligands , as well as their mononuclear analogues Cp*[3-(CHNR)-2'- R'-2-O-C20H11]CrCl [ r = iPr , R' = nBuO ( 4 ) , r = ph , R' = nBuO ( 5 ) , r = 2,6- iPr2C6H3 , R' = nBuO ( 6 ) , r = iPr , R' = H ( 7 ) ] , were synthesized and characterized by mass spectrometry , elemental analysis , magnetic measurement , and UV - vis spectroscopy . the molecular structures of complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> were further confirmed by single - crystal x-ray crystallographic analysis . when activated with a small amount of AlMe3 , these binuclear complexes exhibited higher activities in catalyzing ethylene polymerization in comparison with their mononuclear analogues , affording high molecular weight polymers with unimodal molecular weight distributions . the highest activity up to <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> g PE ( mol cr)-1 h-1 was achieved in the catalyst system of complex <nUm> bearing a bulky 2,6-iPr 2C6H3 group on the imine nitrogen atom in the presence of <nUm> equiv. AlMe3 as activator at <nUm> ° C . 13C NMR analysis indicates the resultant polymers are linear and no evidence on branch was found . 
half - sandwich titanium salicylbenzoxazole complexes CpTiLCl < inf > <nUm> < / inf > 2a-2c [ L = r-2-(benzo[d]xazol-2-yl)phenol ( r = H ( 2a ) , r = 6-CH < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ( 2b ) , r = 4-CH < inf > <nUm> < / inf > -6- < sup > t < / sup > bu ( 2c ) ] and salicylbenzothiazole complexes CpTiLCl < inf > <nUm> < / inf > 2d-2g [ L = r-2-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)phenol ( r = H ( 2d ) , r = 6-CH < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ( 2e ) , r = 6- < sup > t < / sup > bu ( 2f ) , r = 4-Cl ( <nUm> g ) ] were synthesized by the reaction of CpTiCl < inf > <nUm> < / inf > with the sodium salts of their corresponding precursors . complexes 2a-2g were fully characterized by < sup > <nUm> < / sup > H and < sup > <nUm> < / sup > C NMR spectra and elemental analyses . the molecular structures of 2a and 2b were determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction methods . when activated by excess methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) these half - sandwich titanium complexes showed moderate to high activities for ethylene polymerization and produced high molecular weight polyethylenes . the half - sandwich titanium salicylbenzoxazole complexes ( 2a-2c ) exhibited higher activities , of up to <nUm> × <nUm> < sup > <nUm> < / sup > g PE mol Ti < sup > <nUm> < / sup > h < sup > <nUm> < / sup > for the 2b / MAO system , than those of their analogues , half - sandwich titanium salicylbenzothiazole complexes ( 2d-2g ) . 
A method for the preparation of bifunctional carbosilane dendrons has been developed and used to synthesize first- and second - generation dendrons containing [ cp <nUm> MCl <nUm> ] end - groups ( m = Ti , Zr ; cp = cyclopentadienyl ) and Si-Cl focal - point bonds . these dendrons have been fully characterized in solution and , in the case of the zirconium derivatives , immobilized on an amorphous silica surface and tested as ethylene polymerization catalysts . the immobilization was quantitative and quite stable under the conditions of the catalysis . 
In the present paper , the recent development of new silyl chemistry based photoinitiating systems for sunlight induced polymerization is presented . the inherent issues of the effects of a low light intensity and oxygen inhibition are discussed . some selected examples leading to tack free coatings in free radical photopolymerization ( FRP ) and cationic photopolymerization ( CP ) are provided . the use of the silyl radical chemistry to overcome the O inhibition is presented . the sunlight induced polymerization might be a promising way for practical low cost and environmentally friendly curing processes . the use of renewable epoxy monomers ( such as epoxidized soybean oil ( ESO ) , epoxidized linseed oil ( ELO ) or limonene dioxide ( LDO ) ) in combination with a sunlight induced process also appears particularly worthwhile for green chemistry applications . 
A new concept based on the photoredox catalysis is proposed for the design of a photoinitiating system able to efficiently generate , in a single catalytic cycle , both a radical and a cation as initiating species . this is exemplified here by the tris(1,10-phenanthroline)ruthenium(ii) ( ru(phen)3 2+ ) complex in combination with a diphenyl iodonium salt and a silane . interesting and promising photopolymerization profiles in free radical photopolymerization ( FRP ) and free radical promoted cationic photopolymerization ( FRPCP ) are obtained under air and upon xenon lamp exposure and even soft irradiation conditions ( fluorescence bulb , sunlight ) . an acrylate / epoxide blend is also easily polymerized under air using a fluorescent bulb . the mechanisms are investigated by ESR and laser flash photolysis experiments . 
progress in the synthesis of highly stereoregular polymers with syndiotacticity ≥ <nUm> % from an array of monomer substrates is surveyed , with a focus being placed on the use of syndiospecific discrete catalyst or initiator systems also exhibiting high activity and efficiency in the polymerization reactions . the monomer scope encompasses nonpolar a-olefins ( propylene , styrene , and higher a-olefins ) , conjugated diolefins , bicyclic olefins , polar conjugated olefins ( acrylic monomers such as methacrylates and (meth)acrylamides ) , and cyclic esters ( lactides and b-lactones ) , while the polymerization catalysts or initiators enabling such syndiospecific polymerizations cover those discrete molecular complexes of main - group , early transition , and lanthanide metals . several free - radical polymerization systems capable of producing highly syndiotactic polymers are also highlighted . 
1-Pentene and 4-methyl-1-pentene ( 4M1P ) have been polymerised using several C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocene catalysts rac-X(2-R 1,4-R2-Ind)2ZrCl2 [ x = C 2H4 , R1 = R2 = H ( 1 ) ; x = SiMe <nUm> , R1 = R2 = H ( 2 ) ; x = SiMe2 , R1 = me , R2 = H ( 3 ) ; x = SiMe2 , R1 = H , R2 = ph ( 4 ) ; x = SiMe2 , R1 = me , r <nUm> = ph ( 5 ) ] with MAO as cocatalyst . the effects of polymerisation conditions as well as substituents on the indenyl ligand were studied . except for the poly-1-pentenes synthesized with <nUm> and <nUm> at low temperatures , low molecular weight isotactic polymers were generally obtained . compared to their behaviour in propylene polymerisation , the relative activity and selectivity of catalysts 1-5 are considerably different for 1-pentene and 4M1P polymerisation . of the five catalysts , <nUm> and <nUm> showed the highest activities for both 1-pentene and 4M1P polymerisation , while <nUm> resulted in the lowest activities , especially for 4M1P polymerisation . subsequently , a cs- and several C 1-symmetric zirconocenes , (R1)2C(3-R 2-Cp)(2,7,-R3-Flu)ZrCl2 ( R1 = me , R2 = R3 = H ( 6 ) ; R1 = R2 = me , R3 = H ( 7 ) ; R1 = me , R2 = t-Bu , R3 = H ( 8 ) ; R1 = me , R2 = R3 = t-Bu ( 9 ) ; r <nUm> = ph , R2 = t-Bu , R3 = H ( 10 ) ; R1 = ph , R2 = R3 = t-Bu ( 11 ) , were tested in 1-pentene and 4M1P polymerisation with MAO as cocatalyst . the effect of substituents on the bridge , the cyclopentadienyl ( cp ) and fluorenyl ( flu ) ligand , was studied relative to the polymerisation temperature and type of monomer . the molecular weights of the polymers were considerably higher than those of the poly-1-pentenes and P4M1Ps obtained with C2 - symmetric zirconocenes ( 1-5 ) . the catalytic activities and polymer molecular weights strongly depend on the fluorenyl substituent and the bridge , while the type of substituent on the cp ligand has a strong influence on the tacticity of the polymers . 
new photoinitiating systems allowing an efficient cationic photopolymerization of epoxides under air using different diode lasers are presented . these new photoinitiating systems are based on various three - component photoinitiating systems i.e. violanthrone-78 ( or violanthrone-79 , tris(2,2'-bipyridine)ruthenium(ii) dichloride , methylene blue , and iridium (iii) complexes ) / diphenyl iodonium salt / tris(trimethylsilyl) silane . excellent polymerization profiles with high monomer conversions were obtained . these results allow the design of less shrinkable high speed photopolymers usable in the visible wavelength range for a variety of applications in e.g. the manufacture of optical elements . A reaction mechanism is also proposed . 
In order to gain insight into the mechanism for the thermal ring - opening polymerization of strained dicarba[2]ferrocenophanes , the thermal reactivity of selected examples of these species with different substitution patterns has been explored . when heated at <nUm> ° C dicarba[2]ferrocenophanes meso / rac-[Fe(e 5-C 5H <nUm> ) 2(CHPh) <nUm> ] ( meso / rac-7 ) and meso-[Fe(e 5-C 5H <nUm> ) 2(CHCy) <nUm> ] ( meso-13 ) were found to isomerize or to undergo disproportionation , respectively . these processes are apparently general for dicarba[2]ferrocenophanes with one or more non-hydrogen substituents at each carbon atom in the dicarba bridge and both appear to involve homolytic cleavage of the C-C bond in the bridge as a key step . In striking contrast , derivatives containing either one or no non-hydrogen substituents on the bridge such as { fe[e 5-C 5H <nUm> ] 2[CH(Ph) CH <nUm> ] } ( 15 ) and [ fe(e 5-C 5H <nUm> ) <nUm> ( CH <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 17 ) undergo thermal ring - opening polymerization ( ROP ) under similar conditions ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> h ) . thus , thermolysis of <nUm> yielded polyferrocenylethylene { fe[e 5-C 5H <nUm> ] 2[CH(Ph)CH <nUm> ] } n ( 16a ) with a broad molecular weight distribution ( m w = <nUm> , PDI = <nUm> ) . analysis of 16a by MALDI - TOF mass spectrometry suggested that the material was macrocyclic . thermal treatment of linear polyferrocenylethylenes { fe[e 5-C 5H <nUm> ] 2[CH(Ph)CH <nUm> ] } n with narrow molecular weight distributions ( prepared by photocontrolled ROP ) at <nUm> ° C confirmed that the macrocycles detected form directly , and not as a result of depolymerization . copolymerizations of <nUm> with <nUm> and of <nUm> with the deuterated species [ fe(e 5-C 5H <nUm> ) <nUm> ( CD <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( d 4-17 ) were conducted in order to probe the bond cleavage mechanism . comparative NMR spectroscopic analysis of the resulting copolymers <nUm> and d 4-18 , respectively , and of homopolymer 16a , indicated that thermal ROP does not occur via a homolytic C-C bridge cleavage mechanism . A series of thermolysis experiments were conducted with MgCp <nUm> ( cp = η 5-C 5H <nUm> ) at <nUm> ° C , which resulted in the isolation of ring - opened species formed from <nUm> and <nUm> , and indicated that the Fe-Cp bonds can be cleaved under the thermal ROP conditions employed . the studies indicated that a chain growth process that involves heterolytic Fe-Cp bond cleavage in the monomers is the most probable mechanism for the thermal ROP of dicarba[2]ferrocenophanes . 
the opening up of new markets , particularly in the far east , is expected to increase the industrial demand for more ( and new ) plastic materials . In turn , this will drive the need for further catalyst development , with increased efficiency and with the capacity to easily control the resulting polymer properties being high on the agenda . with this in mind , tailoring the pre-catalyst structure has proved to be a very successful strategy , and has allowed for the elucidation of a number of structure - activity trends . A particularly fruitful synthetic avenue has been the deployment of multi-dentate ancillary ligands bearing one or more substituents containing additional functionality , capable of weakly binding to the metal . such a method is versatile and allows for the incorporation of a wide range of functionality . furthermore , benefits of such an approach include the ability to control the % incorporation of co-monomers , in situ screening , low co-catalyst loadings ( versus activity enhancement ) as well as control over the resultant polymer structure . this review underlines the efforts made in the last few years with regard to the use of tridentate ligands and beyond in the field of a-olefin polymerization using catalytic systems based on group IV metals . 
A series of half - titanocene dichloride 2-aryliminoquinolin-8-olates , CpTi LCl2 ( C1-C6 : cp as CH , L as 2-(1-(o-benzhydrylarylimino)methyl)quinolin-8-olates or 2-(1-(o- benzhydrylarylimino)ethyl)quinolin-8-olates ) , was synthesized and fully characterized ; the molecular structures of representative complexes C2 and C4 are reported . upon activation with modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) , the title complexes exhibited good activities for ethylene polymerization ( up to <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 ( Ti ) h-1 ) . the C4 / MMAO system was further investigated for the co-polymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene , 1-octene , or isoprene . 
A range of aryloxy and alkoxy ligands , both monodenate and chelating , have been coordinated to ti(iv) to yield complexes of the form [ ArOTi 2Cl <nUm> ] , [ Ti(ROO)Cl <nUm> ] and [ Ti(ROO) 2Cl <nUm> ] ( r = aryl , alkyl ) . the complexes vary in their lewis base solvation and / or aggregation state , as revealed by x-ray crystallography of selected examples . the complexes have been evaluated as catalysts for ethylene oligomerisation and polymerisation following activation with alkylaluminium reagents ( AlEt <nUm> , methylaluminoxane ) . while polyethylene is the major product , ethylene oligomers also result , ranging from dimers to higher oligomers . the results indicate a number of different active species are formed upon activation , with oligomers likely arising through a metallacyclic mechanism . the findings are discussed in the context of the commercial alphabutol dimerisation system [ Ti(OR) <nUm> ] , and the development of group <nUm> based ethylene trimerisation catalysts . 
bis(imino)aryl NCN pincer Ni (ii) complexes 2,6-(ArNCH) 2C 6H 3NiBr ( <nUm> : Ar = 2,6-Me 2C 6H <nUm> ; <nUm> : Ar = 2,6-Et 2C 6H <nUm> ; <nUm> : Ar = 2,6- iPr 2C 6H <nUm> ) were prepared via the oxidative - addition of Ni(0)(Ph 3P ) <nUm> with bis(N-aryl)-2-bromoisophthalaldimine . these nickel complexes were characterized by NMR and elemental analyses . their solid molecular structures were established by x-ray diffraction analyses . the nickel metal centers adopt distorted square planar geometries with the bromine atoms acting as one coordinate ligands . the NCN pincer Fe (ii) complexes 2,6-(ArNCH) 2C 6H 3Fe(m-Cl) 2Li(THF) <nUm> ( <nUm> : Ar = 2,6-Me 2C 6H <nUm> ; <nUm> : Ar = 2,6-Et 2C 6H <nUm> ; <nUm> : Ar = 2,6- iPr 2C 6H <nUm> ) were synthesized by lithium salt metathesis reactions of the ligand lithium salts with ClFe <nUm> . x-ray structure analyses of <nUm> and <nUm> revealed that the Fe (ii) complexes are hetero - dinuclear with the iron atoms in trigonal bipyramidal environments . when activated with MAO , the nickel complexes are active for norbornene vinyl polymerization but are inert for butadiene polymerization . the Fe (ii) complexes show moderate activities in butadiene polymerization when activated with alkylaluminium , affording the cis-1,4 enriched polymer . 
alkali metal reduction of tungsten tetrachloride in the presence of excess trimethylphosphite and ethylene affords moderate yields of trans- tetrakis(trimethylphosphite)tungsten bis(ethylene) . this easily prepared species bearing inexpensive ancillary ligands promotes the oxidative coupling of carbon dioxide and ethylene at ambient temperature to produce two isomeric tetrakis(trimethylphosphite)tungsten acrylate hydride complexes . these isomers vary by the κ 2-O,O and κ 3-C,C,O coordination mode of the acrylate ligand , and swiftly interconvert in solution as detected by 2D NMR spectroscopy . the CO 2-derived acrylate fragment may be released from the tungsten coordination sphere by treatment with methyl iodide to afford modest quantities of free methyl acrylate . 
A series of novel monochloro half - zirconocene complexes containing phosphine oxide-(thio)phenolate chelating ligands of the type , ClCp'Zr[X-2-R1-4-R2-6-(Ph2PO)C 6H2]2 ( cp' = CH , 2a : x = O , R1 = ph , R2 = H ; 2b : x = O , R1 = F , R2 = H ; 2c : x = O , R1 = tBu , R2 = H ; 2d : x = O , R1 = R2 = tBu ; 2e : x = O , r <nUm> = SiMe3 , R2 = H ; 2f : x = S , R1 = SiMe3 , R2 = H ; cp' = C5Me5 , <nUm> g : x = O , R1 = SiMe3 , R2 = H ) , have been synthesized in high yields . these complexes were identified by 1H {13C} NMR and elemental analyses . structures for 2b , 2c and 2f were further confirmed by x-ray crystallography . structural characterization of these complexes reveals crowded environments around the zirconium . complexes 2b and 2c adopt six - coordinate , distorted octahedral geometry around the zirconium center , in which the equatorial positions are occupied by three oxygen atoms of two chelating phosphine oxide - bridged phenolate ligands and a chlorine atom . the cyclopentadienyl ring and one oxygen atom of the ligand are coordinated on the axial position . complex 2f also folds a six - coordinate , distorted octahedral geometry around the Zr center , consisting of a Cp-Zr-O ( in PO ) axis [ <nUm> ° ] and a distorted plane of two sulfur atoms and one oxygen atom of two chelating phosphine oxide - bridged thiophenolate ligands as well as a chlorine atom . when activated by modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) , all the complexes exhibited high activities towards ethylene polymerization at high temperature ( <nUm> ° C ) , giving high molecular weight polymers with unimodal molecular weight distribution . the formation of 14-electron , cationic metal alkyl species might come from the Zr-O ( in phenol ring ) bond cleavage based on the DFT calculations study . 
A general and efficient approach toward new zirconium and hafnium complexes based on 2-aryl-8-arylaminoquinoline ligands was developed . these precursors , when activated with MAO / borate cocatalyst and supported on silica , result in active olefin polymerization catalysts . the ethylene copolymers produced under industrially relevant conditions show very high molecular weights and unique microstructures defined by the multisite nature of the catalyst . A site - diversification mechanism is proposed to explain the presence of at least five individual sites , as deduced from 3D-TREF analysis of ethylene-butene copolymers . 
bis(imino)diphenylamido rare - earth metal dialkyl complexes [ o-(2,6- iPr2-C6H3-NC-C6H 4)2-N]Ln(CH2SiMe3)2 ( <nUm> : ln = Sc ; <nUm> : ln = Lu ; <nUm> : ln = Y ) have been synthesized in good yields and structurally characterized by elemental analysis , NMR spectroscopy , and single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies . they serve as highly efficient single - component catalysts both for the living ring - opening e-caprolactone polymerization and random copolymerization with g-butyrolactone , with the activity being dependent on the steric hindrance around the metal center , yielding high molecular weight PCLs or P(CL-co-BL)s with narrow molecular weight distributions . 
non-bridged half - metallocene dimethyl complexes of group <nUm> metals 2a-4a with an n-4-methoxyphenyl(iminomethyl)pyrrolyl ligand 1a were synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray analysis . upon activation with [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] , these complexes became active catalysts for the polymerization of 1-hexene . A series of hafnium complexes with various n-substituents on the imine group of ligands 1b-1g were also prepared and applied as catalysts for 1-hexene polymerization . the activation parameters for the exchange process between the two methyl groups bound to the metal for Cp*MMe2(R-pyr) complexes were estimated by NMR shape analysis at various temperatures . the findings indicated that the transition state of the ligand flipping process might be associated with the isoselectivity of the polymerization reaction . 
the synthesis of a novel electropolymerizable monomer , 2,2',3 , 3'-tetrahydro-2,2'-bithieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxine ( THBTD ) , based on two 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene ( EDOT ) moieties connected through the ethylenedioxy bridge is reported . the new monomer paves the way for the development of cross-linked networks based on the EDOT moiety . polymer films were electrogenerated from monomeric solutions by consecutive potential sweeps or by flow of constant anodic currents and the polymer structure was studied using FTIR . the relationship between the mass of the electrogenerated polymer ( after reduction ) and the polymerization charge gives the productivity of the consumed charge ( mg C <nUm> ) while the charge stored and delivered by the films was determined by cyclic voltammetry getting the specific charge ( C g <nUm> ) . simultaneously with the electroinitiated polymerization a chemical polymerization occurs around the electrode by monomer protonation giving protonated and no electroactive polymer chains . this chemical polymerization was followed in solution by UV - vis spectroscopy using different conditions . productivities and specific charges change with the conditions of synthesis in opposite directions . the voltammetric control presents a main redox couple ( <nUm> / <nUm> V ) and a strong reduction process at <nUm> V that only can be reoxidized at more anodic potentials than <nUm> V as usual for charge trapping effects . EQCM studies indicate a remarkable difference between PEDOT and poly(THBTD) . while poly(THBTD) shows a predominantly reversible anionic exchange during oxidation from the neutral state , the parent pristine PEDOT presents a mixed anionic and cationic exchange . electrochromic color changes from an intense blue color of the oxidized film to a clear orange color in the reduced films as observed by in situ UV - vis spectroscopy . interestingly , the electrochromic changes in poly(THBTD) are opposed to those of PEDOT . both thiophene derivative polymers present a similar thermal degradation at <nUm> and <nUm> ° C , respectively . 
A series of trimetallic yttrium complexes , L < inf > <nUm> < / inf > Y < inf > <nUm> < / inf > Cl < inf > <nUm> < / inf > [ L = N-(2-methylquinolin-8-yl)-p-R-benzamides , <nUm> : r = H ; <nUm> : r = OMe ; <nUm> : r = me ; <nUm> : r = Cl ] , has been synthesized by the stoichiometric reaction of ClY < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ( THF ) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > with the corresponding potassium amidates . all complexes have been characterized by elemental analysis and NMR spectroscopy . the molecular structure of complex <nUm> bearing seven amidate ligands was confirmed by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . screening of these complexes , in the presence of BnOH , for ring - opening polymerization of caprolactone ( e-CL ) revealed effective activities . 
new aromatic derivatives PyD based on a pyrene moiety are proposed here as new photoinitiators ( PIs ) in multi-component systems ( with an iodonium salt , a sulfonium salt and optionally a silane ) for the radical polymerization of acrylates and the cationic polymerization of epoxy , epoxy-silicone and vinyl ethers . these new photoinitiators allow the use of a long wavelength excitation ( using visible light delivered by a halogen lamp , a laser diode at <nUm> nm or a Xe-Hg lamp ) . excellent polymerization profiles are obtained . for polymerization processes using pyrene , very low conversions are reached in agreement with the lack of absorption of this compound for λ > <nUm> nm i.e.PyDs are attractive compounds for visible light . acrylate - epoxide , acrylate - vinyl ether and vinyl ether - epoxide blends are also easily polymerized i.e. for the synthesis of interpenetrating or crosslinked polymer networks . the initiation step mechanisms analyzed by ESR , fluorescence , steady state photolysis and laser flash photolysis experiments are discussed .

In this article , three new zinc (ii) coordination polymers have been synthesized using 4,4'-azobipyridine ( azbpy ) and three different aliphatic dicarboxylates . the reaction was carried out through the slow diffusion technique at room temperature giving rise to { [ zn2(m3- OH)(azbpy) (suc)1.5]*(H2O)2}n ( 1 ) , { [Zn(azbpy)0.5(glut)(H2O)]*(H 2O)}n ( 2 ) , and { [ zn2(azbpy)2(fum) 2]*(H2O)}n ( 3 ) ( suc = succinate dianion , glut = glutarate dianion and fum = fumarate dianion ) . the structures of these complexes were determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction analysis and also by other physicochemical methods . compound <nUm> is a three - dimensional ( 3D ) framework , whereas compound <nUm> shows a one - dimensional ladder - like structure which is further extended in two dimensions through supramolecular interactions ( H - bonding ) . compound <nUm> displays a three - dimensional ( 3D ) 5-fold interpenetrated diamondoid network structure . In the case of <nUm> and <nUm> , the structures contain void spaces which are occupied by guest water molecules , whereas in <nUm> , the pores are totally blocked through interpenetration . TGA and PXRD analysis showed that all three compounds were thermally stable up to a high temperature . the desolvated framework of compounds <nUm> and <nUm> show adsorption of different gas molecules and exhibit a higher adsorption preference for CO2 over N . the photoluminescence study in the solid state of compounds 1-3 indicates ligand based florescence emissions at room temperature . 
functional polyolefins ( i.e. , polyethene or polypropene bearing functional groups ) are highly desired materials , due to their beneficial surface properties . many different pathways exist for the synthesis of these materials , each with its own advantages and drawbacks . this review focuses on those synthetic pathways that build up a polymer chain from ethene / propene and functionalised polar vinyl monomers . despite many recent advances in the various fields of olefin polymerisation , it still remains a challenge to synthesise high molecular - weight copolymers with tuneable amounts of functional groups , preferably with consecutive insertions of polar monomers occurring in a stereoselective way . to overcome some of these challenges , polymerisation of alternative functionalised monomers is explored as well . 
the deployment of fluorinated moieties to engender electronic effects through non-covalent attractive interactions is a new concept for olefin polymerization catalysts , and was proposed to account for the unprecedented living polymerization mediated by certain catalysts bearing fluorine - containing ancillary ligands . this strategy is distinct from conventional approaches based on steric influences to control olefin polymerization processes . In this perspective , the concept , generality and beneficial effects of applying non-covalent interactions to control polymerization reactions are discussed , with particular emphasis given to intramolecular C-H ⋯ F-C interactions between a fluorinated ligand and growing polymer chain . 
the influence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) catalyst activators of different concentrations and preparative histories on the performance of 1-hexene polymerisations was investigated by kinetic methods , using rac-Me 2Si(2-Me-Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2 as the standard catalyst precursor . fast sampling and analysis allow the time dependence of monomer conversion and the growth of the number - average polymer molecular weight to be determined at a sufficiently short timescale to make this a feasible method for routine catalyst evaluation . differences in productivity , polymer molecular weight and active species count are shown to be primarily a linear function of the trimethylaluminium concentration . the results in toluene and heptane as solvents are compared ; the data show that the inferior performance in heptane is due to a substantially lower active species concentration . 
A range of unsubstituted ( 1,2 ) and 6-substituted ( 3-5 ) ortho-phenoxy-imine ligands have been prepared and converted to their silyl ether derivatives ( 6-10 ) . reaction of silyl ethers with ClTi < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ( thf ) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > in the case of the unsubstituted species yields bis-ligated complexes while the substituted species react cleanly to yield complexes of the form [ Ti(O^NR)Cl < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ( thf ) ] . In most cases the complexes have been characterised by x-ray crystallography . testing of the complexes for ethylene oligomerisation and polymerisation has been undertaken employing alkylaluminium co-catalysts ( AlEt < inf > <nUm> < / inf > , MAO ) . In all cases the predominant product formed is polyethylene however careful analysis of the liquid phase reveals a complex process by which 1-butene is most likely formed via cossee mechanism while 1-hexene results from a metallacyclic process . 
A series of NNO ketoimines bearing trifluoromethyl substituents were synthesized from the schiff base condensation of 1,3-diketones ( 1,1,1-trifluoro-5,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexanedione , 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-phenyl-1,3- butanedione , and 1,1,1-trifluoro-2,4-pentanedione , 1,1,1,5,5,5- hexafluoroacetylacetone ) and 8-aminoquinoline or 8-amino-2-methylquinoline and isolated in 40-70 % yield . the ketoimines were combined with zinc bis-(trimethylsilyl)amide to prepare a zinc amide complex in <nUm> % yield or were combined with zinc bis-(trimethylsilyl)amide and 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol to prepare zinc phenoxide complexes in 81-94 % yield . the ketoimines and zinc complexes were characterized with 1H , 13C , and 19F NMR , absorbance spectroscopy , mass spectrometry , elemental analysis and x-ray crystallography . the mononuclear solid state structures of the zinc amide and phenoxide complexes showed tridentate coordination of the zinc center by the ketoiminate and monodentate coordination by the amide or phenoxide . the zinc complexes were assessed for their ability to catalyze the ring opening polymerization ( ROP ) of l-lactide into poly-lactic acid ( PLA ) with some complexes reaching <nUm> % conversion in <nUm> h . As the monomer to catalyst ratio increased , the molecular weight of the isolated polymeric material increased in a nearly linear fashion while retaining a narrow molecular weight distribution . homonuclear decoupled 1H NMR spectra of the isolated polymeric material showed the retention of stereochemistry in the isotactic poly-l-lactic acid . kinetic studies , where the substituents on the ketoiminate and quinolyl moiety were varied , showed that lower electron density on the Zn metal center yielded lower ROP catalytic activity than their electron rich counterparts . the complexes are proposed to use the coordination - insertion mechanism for living polymerization of l-lactide . 
the dehydrogenation of primary and secondary amine - boranes ( RNH 2*BH3 and R2NH*BH3 ; r = alkyl groups ) was studied using the bulky N - heterocyclic carbene IPr ( IPr = [ (HCNDipp)C : ] ; dipp = 2,6-iPr2C6H3 ) as a stoichiometric dehydrogenation agent . In the case of primary amine - boranes , carbene - bound adducts IPr*BH2-NH(R)-BH3 were obtained in place of the desired polymers [RNH-BH2]n . the secondary amine - borane iPr2NH*BH3 participated in dehydrogenation chemistry with IPr to afford the aminoborane [iPr2NBH2] and the dihydroaminal HIPr <nUm> as products . attempts to induce H elimination from the arylamine - borane DippNH2*BH3 yielded a reaction mixture containing the known species IPr*BH2NHDipp , IPr*BH2NH(Dipp)-BH3 , free DippNH2 and H2IPr . the new hindered aryl-amine borane adduct Ar*NH 2*BH3 [ ar* = 2,6-(Ph2CH) 2-4-MeC6H2 ] underwent a reaction with IPr to give IPr*BH3 and free Ar*NH2 , consistent with the presence of a weaker N-B dative bond in Ar*NH2* BH3 relative to its less hindered amine - borane analogues . 
In order to prepare a new unsymmetrical chiral ligand , C <nUm> H <nUm> CH(CH <nUm> )CH <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> , with an indenyl moiety connected to a cyclopentadienyl unit by a chiral ethylene bridge , we reacted the optically active tosylate <nUm> , derived from ethyl (S)-(-) lactate , with LiCp . the only product resulting from this reaction was an optically active spirocyclopropane <nUm> obtained with a high diastereoselectivity ( <nUm> % de ) . we also observed that , when the reduction of the ethyl indene lactate <nUm> was realized with an excess of AlHLi <nUm> in et <nUm> O under reflux , spirocyclopropane <nUm> was obtained in high yield with the same diastereoselectivity . when tosylate <nUm> was reacted with MgCp <nUm> , in place of LiCp , ligand <nUm> was obtained in good yield as a mixture of two double - bond isomers of the cp unit . ligand <nUm> was fully structurally characterized after conversion into transition monometallic complexes such as C <nUm> H <nUm> CH(CH <nUm> )CH <nUm> η <nUm> - C <nUm> H <nUm> CMoO <nUm> me <nUm> and C <nUm> H <nUm> CH(CH <nUm> )CH <nUm> η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> Rh(COD) <nUm> , in which the indene moiety was kept intact due to the difference in reactivity of the indenyl moiety with respect to the cyclopentadienyl unit . an attempt to prepare a heterobimetallic complex from the sodium indenide salt of <nUm> and [RhCl(COD)] <nUm> , afforded a rhodium cyclopentadienyl complex <nUm> , resulting from a metal exchange reaction with loss of the molybdenum part initially coordinated to the cp unit , and conservation of the optical purity . an homobimetallic rhodium complex <nUm> could be prepared by deprotonation of ligand <nUm> with TlOEt , followed by quenching with [RhCl(COD)] <nUm> . the bis-rhodium complex <nUm> is obtained as a mixture of two diastereoisomers <nUm> a and <nUm> b with respect to the planar chirality of the indenyl ring system , with a good diastereoisomeric excess de = <nUm> % . the structures of both complexes <nUm> and major (pS)-diastereoisomer <nUm> a were determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction . 
the activity and stability of homogeneous olefin polymerisation catalysts , when immobilised on a support , are dependent on both chemical and physical effects . chemical factors affecting catalyst activity include the ease of formation of the active species , which is strongly dependent on the transition metal . catalyst productivity is dependent on the balance between activity and stability . immobilisation can lead to a lower proportion of active species and therefore lower initial polymerisation activity , but nevertheless give higher polymer yields in cases where increased catalyst stability is obtained . important physical factors are support porosity and the ability of a support to undergo progressive fragmentation during polymerisation , facilitating monomer diffusion through the growing catalyst / polymer particle . this article illustrates the importance of these factors in olefin polymerisation with both early- and late - transition metal catalysts , with particular reference to the use of silica and magnesium chloride supports as well as to effects of immobilisation on polymer structure and properties . 
electronic properties of the aminophenolate groups have obvious effect on the synthesis of aminophenolate lanthanide - lithium complexes . amine elimination reactions of Ln[N(SiMe3)2]3(m-Cl)Li(THF) <nUm> with lithium aminophenolates [ ArNHCH2(3,5- tBu2C6H2-2-O)Li(THF)]2 ( Ar = p-ClC6H4 , [ONH]Cl-p ; p-BrC 6H4 , [ONH]Br-p ) in tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) in a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio gave the bimetallic lanthanide - lithium amido complexes [NO] cl-p 2Ln[N(SiMe3)2][Li(THF)] <nUm> ( ln = Y ( 1 ) , Yb ( 2 ) ) , and [NO]Br-p 2Ln[N(SiMe3)2][Li(THF)]2 ( ln = Y ( 3 ) , Yb ( 4 ) ) . when the Ar groups are p-MeOC6H4 , ( [ONH]MeO-p ) and o-MeOC6H4 ( [ONH] MeO-o ) , similar reactions generated the homoleptic lanthanide - lithium complexes [NO]MeO-p 3Ln[Li(THF)]3 ( ln = Y ( 5 ) , Yb ( 6 ) ) and [NO]MeO-o 2Ln[Li(THF)] ( ln = Y ( 7 ) , Yb ( 8 ) ) in high isolated yields , respectively . whereas the bimetallic lanthanide - lithium amido complexes [NO]Cl-o 2Ln[N(SiMe3) 2][Li(THF)]2 ( ln = Y ( 9 ) , Yb ( 10 ) ) can be obtained in good yields , when the Ar group is o-ClC6H4 ( [ONH] cl-o ) . all of these complexes were well characterized . x-ray structure determination revealed that these complexes have solvated monomeric structures . In complexes 1-4 , <nUm> , and <nUm> , the lanthanide atom is five - coordinated by two oxygen atoms and two nitrogen atoms from two aminophenoxy ligands and one nitrogen atom from N(SiMe3)2 group to form a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry , whereas in complexes 5-8 , the central lanthanide atom is six - coordinated by oxygen atoms , and nitrogen atoms from the aminophenoxy ligands to form a distorted octahedron . it was found that complexes 1-10 are highly efficient initiators for the ring - opening polymerization of 2,2-dimethyltrimethylene carbonate ( DTC ) , affording the polymers with high molecular weights , and the homoleptic heterobimetallic lanthanide complexes showed apparently high activity .

Zn (ii) complexes <nUm> and <nUm> exhibited higher rate constants of <nUm> h < sup > <nUm> < / sup > and <nUm> h < sup > <nUm> < / sup > respectively compared to rate constants of <nUm> h < sup > <nUm> < / sup > and <nUm> h < sup > <nUm> < / sup > observed for the corresponding Cu (ii) complexes <nUm> and <nUm> respectively at <nUm> ° C . all the polymerization reactions follow pseudo first - order kinetic with respect to e-CL monomer . initiator <nUm> showed first - order dependency on the polymerization reactions and utilizes only one active site as the initiating group . the molecular weights of the polymers produced range from <nUm> g mol < sup > <nUm> < / sup > to <nUm> g mol < sup > <nUm> < / sup > and exhibited relatively broad molecular weight distributions associated with transesterification reactions . 
A series of novel half - zirconocenes containing phosphine-(thio)phenolate chelating ligands of the type Cp'Zr(thf)Cl2[X-2-R 1-4-R2-6-(PPh2)C6H2 ] ( cp' = C5Me5 , 2a : x = O , R1 = ph , r <nUm> = H ; 2b : x = O , R1 = tBu , R2 = H ; 2c : x = O , R1 = R2 = tBu ; 2d : x = O , r <nUm> = SiMe3 , R2 = H ; 2e : x = S , R1 = SiMe3 , R2 = H ; cp' = CH , 3b : x = O , R1 = tBu , R2 = H ; 3c : x = O , r <nUm> = R2 = tBu ; 3d : x = O , R1 = SiMe3 , R2 = H ; 3e : x = S , R1 = SiMe <nUm> , R2 = H ) have been synthesized in high yields ( 74-85 % ) . these complexes were identified by 1H , 13C and 31P NMR as well as elemental analyses . structural analysis for 2a-b and 2d revealed that these complexes adopt six - coordinate , distorted octahedral geometry around the zirconium center . these novel half - zirconocenes possessed high catalytic performance for ethylene polymerization at high temperature in the presence of MMAO . the phosphine-phenolate - based cp* complexes produced high molecular weight polymers ( MW > <nUm> <nUm> ) , while the cp analogues displayed much higher activities at high temperature . complex 3c with MMAO showed a maximum ethylene polymerization activity of <nUm> <nUm> kg mol zr-1 h-1 at <nUm> ° C . In addition , the cp based complexes 3b-e could promote ethylene and 1-hexene copolymerization with high activities .

A series of new dyes based on (thio)barbituric acid derivatives were synthesized and used as photoinitiators of polymerization upon very soft irradiation ( laser diodes at <nUm> nm and <nUm> nm ; blue LED bulbs or even a halogen lamp ) . these dyes can work according to an oxidative cycle ( dye / diphenyl iodonium salt / n-vinylcarbazole system ) or a reductive cycle ( dye / amine / alkyl halide system ) and partly behave as organic photocatalysts . ring - opening polymerization ( ROP ) of epoxides and radical polymerization ( RP ) of acrylates are easily promoted . excellent RP and / or ROP polymerization profiles are obtained . the contrasting behavior of the thiobarbituric vs. barbituric acid derivative is discussed . the initiation mechanisms , analyzed by electron spin resonance ( ESR ) and steady state photolysis experiments , are detailed . 
a-Silicon polyoxomolybdates in combination with an iodonium salt and / or a silane are used to generate phenyl and / or silyl radicals as well as silylium cations upon UV light irradiation . these species can initiate the radical photopolymerization of acrylates , the cationic photopolymerization of epoxides and the photopolymerization of epoxy / acrylate blends ( i.e. for the synthesis of interpenetrated polymer networks ) thereby leading to the formation of polyoxometalate / polymer hybrid materials . the mechanical properties of e.g. the polyether films are affected by the presence of polyoxometalate in the matrix as shown by their dynamic mechanical analysis ( DMA ) . the photochemical mechanisms are studied by steady state photolysis , cyclic voltammetry , and electron spin resonance techniques . 
it is an unquestionable fact that syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) has stimulated great interest on the basis of its importance in basic scientific research and potential industrial applications . it is regarded as a new low - cost engineering polymer with various desirable properties , such as a high melting temperature ( <nUm> ° C ) , fast crystallization rate , low dielectric constant , excellent mechanical properties , low permeability to gases , outstanding dimensional stability , excellent processing characteristics at a very low melt viscosity , and good chemical resistance . however , some drawbacks of sPS restrict its practical use : its brittleness , a disadvantage in applications where mechanical properties are important ; the absence of polar groups for adhesion to substrates and compatibility with polar polymers ; and the need to process sPS at high temperatures due to its high melting points . thus , modification of sPS is necessary to expand its applications , and has been the subject of much investigation . this review provides a snapshot of recent progress in the chemical modification of syndiotactic polystyrene , including in situ functionalization of sPS ( syndiospecific copolymerization of styrene with a second monomer and catalytic chain transfer to a chain transfer agent ) , post-functionalization of sPS ( introduction of polar groups into sPS , graft or block copolymerization onto sPS , and hydrogenation of sPS or its copolymers ) and monomer modification . 
the monomeric ( DPPDT ) and polymeric ( PDQT ) diketopyrrolopyrrole-thiophene derivatives combined with an iodonium salt or an amine ( and optionally an additive ) are used as photoinitiating systems to initiate the cationic polymerization of epoxides or divinyl ethers , radical polymerization of acrylates and thiol - ene polymerization under different irradiation sources ( i.e. very soft halogen lamp , laser diodes at <nUm> nm , <nUm> nm and <nUm> nm ) . the DPPDT based systems are very efficient upon the green light exposure . remarkably , these systems are characterized by a higher efficiency than references based on camphorquinone , a well known photosensitizer for visible light . the photochemical mechanisms are studied by steady state photolysis , fluorescence , cyclic voltammetry , laser flash photolysis and electron spin resonance spin trapping techniques . 
A judicious choice of a polyinsertion catalyst and monomer feed composition allows the one - pot synthesis of ethylene-styrene copolymers with an unprecedented structure , containing an isotactic polystyrene ( iPS ) block joined to an isotactic ethylene-alt-styrene sequence ( iP(E-alt-S) ) . both segments in the native polymer give rise to crystallinity . the characterization of the materials has been performed through different techniques . In particular AFM analysis of samples obtained by spin coating shows the presence of either circular nano-domains with about a <nUm> nm diameter due to self - assembling of the copolymer chains or bicontinuous nanostructured phases depending on the block lengths . 
organic electrochromic materials have gained constantly increasing interest over the years with respect to their inorganic counterpart due to essentially two distinctive characteristics : their processability through solution based low cost processes and their wide colour palette . such characteristic features enabled their application in displays , smart windows , electronic paper and ophthalmic lenses . alongside the established concept of donor - acceptor polymers , side chain functionalized multichromophoric polymers are gaining attention as a highly performing and synthetically feasible alternative , particularly relevant to applications requiring a complete colourlessness in one of the accessible redox states of the material . the primary aim of the present article is to review all the results involving the tuning of the native electrochromic properties of simple conjugated polymers through the introduction of a discrete electrochromic molecule as a side chain substituent . this journal is 
A new type of mesoporous-C4N4 - based catalyst ( n-butBr / mp-C3N4 ) was prepared by simple grafting of n-bromobutane . the N adsorption - desorption and x-ray diffraction characterizations indicate that , in comparison with the parent mp-C3N4 , the textual and structural properties have been well retained by n-butBr / mp-C3N4 . In the cycloaddition of CO2 with propylene epoxide , the n-butBr / mp-C3N4 exhibits high catalytic conversion as well as a high selectivity to propylene carbonate . the maximum TOF value obtained over n-butBr / mp-C3N4 is <nUm> h-1 at <nUm> h under <nUm> ° C , which compares favorably to other reported C3N4 - based catalysts . In addition to n-bromobutane , mp-C3N4 materials grafted with other alkyl halides also provide high catalytic activities . according to the fourier transform infrared and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements , it is speculated that the catalytic active sites of n-butBr / mp-C3N4 are uncondensed amines and Br anions which originate from the reaction between n-bromobutane and the N - containing heterocycles of mp-C3N4 . 
A series of titanium trichloride complexes 1a-4a , 7a-10a ligated with claw - type tetradentate aminophenolate ligands were synthesized from the direct reaction of TiCl4(THF)2 with <nUm> equiv. of the corresponding aminophenol in the presence of triethylamine . for comparison purposes , titanium isopropoxide complexes 5e-8e were also synthesized via the reaction of Ti(OiPr)4 and <nUm> equiv. of the proligand . similar reactions of ZrCl4(THF)2 with the corresponding aminophenol ligands in the presence of triethylamine only allowed the isolation of zirconium complex 8b . the x-ray diffraction studies reveal that titanium trichloride complexes 2a , 9a and titanium triisopropoxide complex 5e all possess a distorted octahedral geometry with the tetradentate aminophenolate ligand in cis-O , N , N chelating mode , where the methoxy group of the aryl unit does not coordinate with the metal center in the solid state . upon activation with MMAO , these titanium and zirconium(iv) complexes exhibited moderate to high catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization at 30-120 ° C , producing high-molecular-weight polyethylenes with broad distributions ( m w / Mn = <nUm> - <nUm> ) . the activities of titanium trichloride complexes are significantly higher than those of titanium isopropoxide and zirconium trichloride complexes at high temperatures . the highest activity of <nUm> <nUm> kg ( mol-Ti h)-1 could be achieved by titanium trichloride complex 8a with bromo groups on both ortho- and para-positions of the phenolate ring of the ligand at <nUm> ° C . this journal is

this study describes the first convenient preparation of 3- , 4- , 5- , 6- , 7- , 8- , 9- , 10- , 11- , and 12-armed star - shaped poly(styrene oxide ) ( PSO ) Ru (ii) complexes using a click - to - chelate approach . this approach involves the combination of the click reaction and stepwise chelating reactions of Ru(ii)(DMSO)4Cl2 with macroligands , 2-(1-PSO n-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)pyridine ( PSOn - tapy ) or 2-(1-PSO m-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-6-(1-PSOn-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl) pyridine ( PSOm-bitapy-PSOn ) ( m , n = <nUm> , <nUm> , or <nUm> ) . click chemistry was used to prepare the PSOn - tapy and PSO m-bitapy-PSOn macroligands . more specifically , PSO n-tapy was prepared by reacting the azido-functionalized PSO n ( PSOn-N3 ) with excess 2-ethynylpridine . on the other hand , PSOm-bitapy-PSOn was obtained by the click reaction of excess PSOn-N3 with 2,6-diethynylpridine to afford (PSOn)2 - bitapy when m equals n , and by the stepwise click reactions of PSOm-N3 and PSOn-N <nUm> with 2,6-diethynylpridine to produce PSOm-bitapy- PSOn when m is not equal to n . In order to obtain these polymer - substituted macroligands , PSOn-N3 was initially synthesized by the living ring - opening polymerization ( ROP ) of styrene oxide ( SO ) using t-Bu-P4 as a catalyst and the azido-functionalized mono- or multi-hydroxyl compounds , e.g. , 6-azido-1-hexanol , 2-((6-azidohexyloxy) methyl)-2-methylpropane-1,3-diol ( 1 ) and 2-((6-azidohexyloxy)methyl)-2- (hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol ( 2 ) as initiators . this journal is

the copolymerization of 2-methyl-1,5-hexadiene ( MHD ) with propylene has been studied with different single - site group <nUm> metal catalysts . systems based on ansa - zirconocene precursors such as rac-{Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind} Cl2Zr ( 1 ) and C1- or CS - symmetric ansa-{CpCR2Flu}ZrCl2 ( <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ) , once activated by MAO , are highly active ( 20-600 kgpol g cat-1 h-1 at 60-70 ° C ) and yield copolymers in which MHD is cyclopolymerized as methylene-(1-methyl)-1,3-cyclopentane ( MMCP ) units . 13C NMR studies revealed , depending on the symmetry of the precatalyst used , either highly isotactic ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) or syndiotactic ( 3 ) polypropylene ( PP ) backbones , with isolated MMCP units . fully trans-diastereoselective cyclopolymerization of MHD was observed with <nUm> / MAO , while a mixture of trans and cis MMCP rings was observed with <nUm> and <nUm> / MAO . the amount of MMCP units in PP ( <nUm> - <nUm> mol % ) can be controlled by the amount of MHD in the feed . In contrast , the constrained geometry catalyst system based on {C5Me4SiMe2NtBu}TiCl2 ( 4 ) and MAO showed a much lower productivity ( ca. <nUm> kgpol gcat <nUm> h-1 at <nUm> ° C ) and yielded a regioirregular , atactic copolymer in which MHD is simply vinyl-inserted in quite moderate amounts ( <nUm> mol % ) . 
we report here the use of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) modified aqueous miscible organic solvent treated ( AMOST ) layered double hydroxide , Mg6Al2(OH)16CO3*4H2O ( AMO-Mg3Al-CO3 ) as a catalyst support system for the slurry phase polymerisation of ethylene using immobilised metallocene and non-metallocene metal complexes . the polymerisation data demonstrates that the catalyst productivity is dependent on the thermal treatment of the LDH and the temperature , pressure and time of the polymerisation . the solid catalyst system , AMO-Mg3Al-CO3 / MAO / (MesPDI)FeCl2 has been shown to have the highest overall activity for a non-metallocene system ( <nUm> kgPE mol-1complex h-1 bar-1 ) , and AMO-Mg3Al-CO3 / MAO / (2-Me,4-PhSBI)ZrCl2 was the most productive for a metallocene - based system ( ∼ <nUm> kgPE mol-1complex h-1 bar-1 ) . the molecular weights and polydispersities vary with the complex on the AMO - LDH surface . scanning electron microscopy images show that the morphology of the as produced polyethylene mimics that of the LDH support . this journal is 
hexagonal H2MgO2 nanoflakes were synthesized via a hydrothermal method in the presence of polyethylene glycol <nUm> ( PEG - <nUm> ) . x-ray diffraction ( XRD ) and field - emission scanning electron microscopy ( FE - SEM ) were applied to characterize the composition , morphologies and structure of the H2MgO2 nanoflakes . Brunauer-Emmett-Teller ( BET ) analysis was performed to investigate the porous structure and surface area of the as-obtained nanoflakes . the transesterification of dimethyl carbonate ( DMC ) with phenol to produce diphenyl carbonate ( DPC ) was carried out over the hexagonal H2MgO2 nanoflakes . the evaluation results showed that the hexagonal H2MgO2 nanoflakes had better activity and excellent selectivity to target products compared with many conventional ester exchange catalysts . compared with other catalysts , such as AlCl3 , Cl2Zn , and irregular H2MgO2 synthesized via a hydrothermal method without PEG - <nUm> , which all have been widely used as catalysts for this transesterification reaction , H2MgO2 nanoflakes were more stable and showed a relatively high activity with a low catalyst amount . the transesterification reaction process was also analyzed with the classic thermodynamic theory , and when the reaction was carried out at <nUm> K , with a molar ratio of phenol to DMC of <nUm> : <nUm> , a reaction time of <nUm> h , and a catalyst amount of <nUm> % ( molar ratio to phenol ) , the selectivity of the transesterification reaction reached <nUm> % . moreover , the deactivated hexagonal H2MgO2 nanoflakes could be easily reactivated by calcination under vacuum , and the regenerated H2MgO2 nanoflakes showed the catalytic activity almost as high as that of the fresh sample . 
A new imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine - containing pyrrolyl ligand HL ( HL = 3-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine ) was synthesized and employed in the organometallic chemistry of titanium . the syntheses , structures , catalytic properties and antitumor activity of three titanium complexes supported by HL are reported . reactions of Ti(NMe2)4 and Ti(NEt2)4 with <nUm> equivalents of HL , led to the production of titanium bisamido complexes TiL2(NMe2)2 ( 1 ) and TiL2(NEt2)2 ( 2 ) , respectively . treatment of Ti(OiPr)4 with <nUm> equivalents of HL resulted in the formation of TiL2(OiPr)2 ( 3 ) . all complexes were characterized by elemental analyses and NMR studies . the solid - state structures of <nUm> and <nUm> were further established by single x-ray crystallography . the titanium bisamido complexes <nUm> and <nUm> are shown to be good pre-catalysts for the hydroamination of alkynes . complex <nUm> was found to be an active catalyst for the ring - opening polymerization of e-caprolactone . the cytotoxicity activities of <nUm> towards the tumor cells HCT - <nUm> , C3P and MCF-7 were measured . complex <nUm> exhibited good antitumor properties . 
the interactions of diaryliodonium and ferrocenium ( FC ) salts during photopolymerization under visible light were systematically studied . spectroscopic , electrochemical , and calculation results indicate that electron transfer occurs between diaryliodonium and FC salts and that FC can be used as a photosensitizer for diaryliodonium salt photoinitiation systems under visible light . thus , the activity of a two - component photoinitiator system composed of different proportions of diaryliodonium and FC salts was investigated for induction of cationic polymerization of bisphenol-A epoxy resin A ( DGEBA ) and cationic / free radical hybrid polymerization of a DGEBA / tripropylene glycol diacrylate ( TPGDA ) mixture under visible light . cationic polymerization of DGEBA achieved high epoxy conversion , while hybrid polymerization of DGEBA and TPGDA achieved synchronous curing . the proposed two - component photoinitiator system may meet the special needs of applications such as 3D printing . hybrid polymerization may improve the performance of light - cured polymers . 
we present a novel soft templating approach ( STA ) for the elaboration of porous silicon carbide ( CSi ) in oxygen- and moisture - free atmospheres . In this method , the molecular precursor , 1,3,5-trisilacyclohexane ( TSCH ) which is in a liquid state at room temperature , is templated by a solid network of semi-fluorinated alkanes ( SFA ) that self - assemble directly in the former liquid . the obtained gel phase is then converted into a polysilane by the polymerization of TSCH molecules around the solid network of SFA . In a next step , the SFA are washed out from the polysilane , and the latter material is converted into CSi by calcination under argon atmosphere at <nUm> ° C . the resulting material possesses a granular structure with a macroporosity . this study validates STA as a sustainable and promising method to obtain porous and mesoporous CSi . 
A new linker , [1,1':2',1''-terphenyl]-4',5'-dimethoxy-4,4''-dicarboxylic acid ( H2L ) has been used along with 4,4'-azobispyridine ( azpy ) as the co-linker to solvothermally synthesize six coordination polymers ( CPs ) . these compounds are formulated as {[Zn(L)(azpy)0.5]*(0.5H2O)}n ( 1 ) , {[Zn2(L)2(azpy)]*(DMF)*(1.5H2O)}n ( 2 ) , {[Zn(L)(bphy)]*(DMF)}n ( 3 ) , [Cd(L)(azpy)0.5(DMF)(H2O)]n ( 4 ) , {[Co(L)(azpy)](2H2O)}n ( 5 ) and {[Co3(L)2(bphy)2(HCOO)2(H2O)2](6DMF)(6H2O)}n ( 6 ) ( bphy = 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)hydrazine ) . interestingly , <nUm> and <nUm> which are synthesized at <nUm> and <nUm> ° C , respectively , are found to be orientation isomers . when the solvothermal reactions are carried out at <nUm> ° C , the azo-bond in the co-linker azpy is reduced to bphy as found in <nUm> and <nUm> . all the complexes exhibit an sql topology . they are characterized by x-ray crystallography , elemental analysis , thermogravimetry , powder x-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy . solid state photoluminescence studies show an intra-ligand p-p* transition in each case . 
by means of the spin - polarized conceptual density functional theory ( SP - CDFT ) , three 2,6-bis(imino)pyridine catalysts based on iron (ii) , used for polymerization of ethylene , were studied . the catalysts differed by the substituent group , bearing either -H , -NO <nUm> or -OCH <nUm> . to date , catalytic activity , a purely experimental parameter measuring the mass of polyethylene produced per millimole of iron per time and pressure unit at a fixed temperature , has not been explained in terms of local hyper - softness . the latter is a purely theoretical parameter designed for quantifying electronic effects ; it is measured using the metal atom responsible for the coordination process with the monomer ( ethylene ) . because steric effects are not relevant in these kinds of catalysts and only electronic effects drive the catalytic process , an interesting link is found between catalytic activity and the local hyper - softness condensed on the iron atom by means of four functionals ( B3LYP , BP86 , B97D , and VSXC ) . this work demonstrates that the use of local hyper - softness , predicted by the SP - CDFT , is a suitable parameter for explaining order relationships among catalytic activity values , thus quantifying the electronic influence of the substituent group inducing this difference ; the use of only net electric charges does not lead to clear conclusions . this finding can aid in estimating catalytic activities leading to a more rational design of new catalysts via computational chemistry . 
bifunctional Ag (i) , Pd (ii) , Rh (i) , Ru (ii) and Au (i) complexes containing a NHC ligand and a pendant trivalent boron moiety have been synthesized in high yields . fine - tuned reaction conditions were used to prevent potential ligand self - quenching or polymerization due to the eventual co-existence in situ of free NHC ( lewis base ) and boronic ester ( lewis acid ) in the same molecule . 
new titanium(iv) complexes having two bidentate b-iminoethyl-spiro[4,5]decan-6-onato ligands with various n-aryl substituents have been synthesized . x-ray crystal structure analysis reveals that these titanium complexes all exhibit a C2 - symmetric conformation with a distorted octahedral geometry , although the specific orientation of the ligands around the titanium center varies with the identity of the n-aryl moiety . upon activation with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , these complexes catalyze the polymerization of ethylene and propylene . In the case of ethylene , most complexes exhibit the characteristics of a living polymerization between <nUm> ° C and <nUm> ° C , producing polyethylenes with narrow molecular weight distributions and number average molecular weights up to <nUm> g / mol . depending on the n-aryl substituents , polymerizations of propylene result in products with tacticity ranging from slightly syndiotactic to slightly isotactic .

quenched - flow data for propene polymerization with rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-1-indenyl)2ZrCl2 / MAO support a picture where removal of MAO qualitatively changes the kinetic profile from a mainly enthalpic to a mainly entropic barrier . DFT studies suggest that a not previously recognized singly - bridged end-on coordination mode of Me6Al2 to catalytically active centers may be kinetically relevant as a resting state . In contrast , the more traditional doubly - bridged complex of Me3Al is proposed to be more relevant to chain transfer to cocatalyst . 
A new anilido-imine tetra-azane ligand 1,2-[2'-(2'',6''-iPr2C6H3NCH)C6H4NH]2C6H4 ( LH2 ) was synthesized and characterized . one - pot direct ClH - elimination reactions of LH2 with MCl4 ( m = Ti , Zr , Hf ) in toluene at room temperature at first and then at <nUm> ° C under vacuum afforded LMCl2 [ m = Ti ( 1a ) , Zr ( 1b ) , Hf ( 1c ) ] in high yields ( <nUm> ∼ <nUm> % ) . it is for the first time the Zr and Hf complexes are being synthesized by the one - pot direct ClH - elimination reactions of MCl4 with a weak acidic amine - containing free ligand . all new complexes were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and the molecular structures of 1a , 1b and 1c were determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . the metal centers in all complexes are six - coordinated with a distorted octahedral geometry . upon activation with MAO or AliBu3 / Ph3C+B(C6F5)4- , these complexes exhibit moderate catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization . the AliBu3 / Ph3C+B(C6F5)4- activated catalyst systems produce polyethylene with ultra-high molecular weight ( viscosity - averaged molecular weight me up to <nUm> × <nUm> dalton ) while the MAO activated catalyst systems show relatively good thermostability . 
A series of naphthalimide derivatives containing tertiary amine groups ( DNNDs ) have been prepared . some of these derivatives ( e.g. DNND3 , DNND4 and DNND5 ) exhibit interesting shifted absorption so that they can be utilized as versatile photoinitiators upon exposure to various violet and blue LEDs ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> nm ) . they are particularly efficient for the cationic photopolymerization of an epoxide and the free radical photopolymerization of an acrylate . the thiol - ene photopolymerization , as well as the synthesis of interpenetrating polymer networks ( of epoxide / acrylate blend ) IPNs , is feasible . remarkably , the production of hydrogels can also be easily achieved using a DNND derivative after inclusion in a cyclodextrin cavity . the photochemical mechanisms have been comprehensively investigated by steady state photolysis , electron spin resonance ( ESR ) , fluorescence , electrochemistry and laser flash photolysis and discussed in detail . 
well defined 9-substituted fluorene C-C bridged constrained geometry configuration ( CGC ) Ni (ii) complexes bearing b-ketoiminato-fluorene ligands , { CH < inf > <nUm> < / inf > C(O)CHC[N(fluorenyl)]-CH < inf > <nUm> < / inf > } < inf > <nUm> < / inf > Ni ( ni1 ) and { CF < inf > <nUm> < / inf > C(O)CHC[N(fluorenyl)]-CH < inf > <nUm> < / inf > } < inf > <nUm> < / inf > Ni ( ni2 ) were synthesized by coordination reaction and in situ coupling reaction in the presence of (DME)NiBr < inf > <nUm> < / inf > . the complexes were characterized by NMR and elemental analyses . and the quality ni1 and ni2 crystals structure was confirmed from x-ray with C-C bridged constrained geometry configuration . on activation with B(C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > F < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > , the Ni - based complexes showed high catalytic activities for norbornene homo-polymerization , activities up to <nUm> < sup > <nUm> < / sup > g PNB mol per Ni per h . the copolymerization of 2-heptoxymethylene norbornene ( HN ) with norbornene by the pre-catalysts ni1 and ni2 was also explored in the presence of B(C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > F < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > . high molecular weight polymers with unimodal molecular weight distributions were obtained , indicating that the nature of the polymerization was single site . the catalytic activity , co-monomer incorporation and the properties of the resultant polymers can be controlled over a wide range by tuning the catalyst structures and reaction parameters . 
crystalline nanofibers of linear polyethylene were formed through ethylene confined polymerization with porous polymer microsphere - supported titanocene . polyethylene nanofibers ( < <nUm> nm ) aggregated to form intertwined thicker fibers ( <nUm> nm to <nUm> mm ) . the obtained PE has high mw and Tm . interestingly , the high Tm ( <nUm> ° C ) was maintained in the second stage of heating . 
meso- and micro-porous silicon carbide ( CSi ) ceramics have been successfully synthesized via a nanocasting process . these materials exhibit very high specific surface areas ( from <nUm> to <nUm> m2 g-1 ) and present morphologies of highly ordered CSi nanorods . liquid allylhydropolycarbosilane or poly-1,3,5-trisilacyclohexane ( pTSCH ) were used as starting pre-ceramic polymers and were casted in a meso-porous silica template ( SBA-15 ) which has undergone densification treatment . after thermal conversion , silica hard templates were subsequently removed by an aqueous hydrofluoric acid treatment leading to CSi inverse replicas of the template . the prepared meso-porous CSi products were thoroughly analyzed using small and wide angle x-ray scattering , electronic microscopies and nitrogen physisorption experiments . from our observations , the preparation procedure preserves the nanoscale structure of the silica templates and leads to highly porous CSi materials with tunable morphologies and specific surface areas . 
we report the synthesis of two zirconocenes , dimethylsilylbis(hexamethylindenyl) zirconium dichloride , rac - (SBI*)ZrCl2 , and nbutyldimethylsilyl(hexamethylindenyl) zirconium trichloride , [(Ind*SiMe2nBu)Zr(m-Cl)Cl2]2 . the complexes were characterised by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography , and the bonding was evaluated using density functional theory . rac - (SBI*)ZrCl2 demonstrated a very high activity for solution phase polymerisation of ethylene ( ca. <nUm> <nUm> kgPE-1 molZr-1 h-1 bar-1 ) . both rac - (SBI*)ZrCl2 and rac - (EBI*)ZrCl2 ( EBI* = ethylenebis(hexamethylindenyl) ) have been supported on MAO modified silica and AMOST layered double hydroxides ( AMO - LDHs ) , and evaluated as catalysts in the slurry - phase polymerisation of ethylene . the highest catalytic polymerisation activities for rac - (SBI*)ZrCl2 and rac - (EBI*)ZrCl2 on the layered double hydroxides were <nUm> and <nUm> kgPE-1 molZr-1 h-1 bar-1 respectively , for MAO modified Mg2Al-SO4 LDH . however , rac - (EBI*)ZrCl2 was a three times more active catalyst than rac - (SBI*)ZrCl2 when supported on silica . 
the reaction of PhN(Li)SiMe3 with <nUm> equiv. of dimethylcyanamide with further addition of <nUm> equiv. of CpTiCl3 led via Me3SiCl elimination to dinuclear titanium(iv) compound <nUm> . the reaction of DippN(Li)SiMe3 with <nUm> equiv. of dimethylcyanamide with further addition of <nUm> equiv. of CpTiCl3 afforded centrosymmetric dimeric titanium(iv) compound <nUm> and mononuclear <nUm> with the elimination of Me3SiCl . the zirconium(iv) compound <nUm> was obtained by the addition reaction of PhN(Li)SiMe3 with <nUm> equiv. of dimethylcyanamide and metathesis reaction with Cl4Zr . x-ray diffraction studies of 1-4 establish the dinuclear titanium(iv) structure in <nUm> , half - titanocene of <nUm> and <nUm> , and a propeller - like complex fragment of <nUm> . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> show moderate or high activities in the polymerization of ethylene upon activation with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . 
A novel highly transparent alternate copolymer of norbornene with isoprene was prepared using a coordination catalytic system composed of bis(phenoxy-imine) titanium complexes and triisobutylaluminum . distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer 13C NMR microstructure analysis of the copolymer reveals the vinyl-type addition nature of norbornene in the copolymer . the content of norbornene in the copolymer stayed constant at approximately <nUm> % , varying the monomer feed ratio and conversion , which implied an alternating nature in the copolymer backbone . the copolymer obtained with a relatively high molecular weight ( Mn = <nUm> to <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 ) shows good thermal stability and a moderate glass transition temperature ( tg = 75-79.5 ° C ) . the copolymer also exhibits admirable transparency in the visible wavelengths ( maximal transmittance ≈ <nUm> % ) . 
polymerisation of 1-decene , 1-dodecene , 1-hexadecene , and 1-octadecene by Cp*TiCl2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) ( 1 ) - MAO catalysts yielded high molecular weight polymers with unimodal molecular weight distributions , and the Mn values in the resultant polymers were higher than those prepared by linked half - titanocene , [ Me2Si(C5Me4) (NtBu)]TiCl2 and ordinary zirconocenes ( Cp2ZrCl2etc . ) ; Cp*TiMe2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) - [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] catalyst showed higher catalytic activities , affording ultrahigh molecular weight polymers ( Mn = > <nUm> × <nUm> ) . 
competition between two different polymerization pathways to polymethylsilanes ( PMS ) and polycarbosilanes ( PCS ) was studied . this occurs in a wurtz reduction - coupling reaction system during dechlorination of several dichloromethylsilanes via sodium in toluene . these two reactions do not carry on pari - passu , i.e. , PMS is exclusively formed . however , PCS can be formed dominantly when some zirconocenes are introduced . this competition was introduced as a result of a tautomeric transformation from methylsilylene ( MeRSi : ) into 1-silene ( CH2 = SiRH ) . these are formed simultaneously as two intermediates but are influenced by the substitution of methyl , ethyl , phenyl or vinyl groups on silicon in the dichloromethylsilanes . polymerization of methylsilylenes into PMS can be inhibited by deactivation of the sodium surface via chemical adsorption of zirconocene dichloride . hence , the catalytic insertion polymerization of 1-silene intermediates into PCS occurs at the active sites of zirconocenes - this leads to the formation of PCS conversion ratios of <nUm> % to <nUm> % from dichloromethylsilanes with methyl , ethyl and phenyl as substituents . however , catalytic polymerization does not happen from dichloromethylvinylsilane . the mechanisms of insertion polymerization as well as the thermal dynamic barrier from polymethylvinylsilane ( PMVS ) to polyvinylcarbosilane ( PVCS ) are discussed in detail . 
we investigate the ring rotation dynamics in poly(vinylferrocene) ( PVFc ) using incoherent neutron spectroscopy . PVFc contains ferrocene units laterally attached to a polymer backbone , allowing for one cyclopentadienyl ring of the organometallic sandwich structure of ferrocene to undergo rotational jump diffusion . the barrier of rotation is found to be broadly distributed , but the dynamics can be well described using a rotation rate distribution model which is well known from the description of methyl group rotation in glassy polymers . As necessary information for the analysis of quasielastic scattering data , we measure the static structure factor of the polymer using polarized neutron diffraction . neutron time - of - flight and backscattering data are then combined and consistently modeled over the large temperature range from <nUm> K to <nUm> K yielding an arrhenius behavior of the jump rate distribution . the mean value of potential barrier distribution is found to be <EA>  = <nUm> kJ mol-1 with a root mean square width of sE = <nUm> kJ mol-1 , being the result of superposition of constant intramolecular and heterogeneous intermolecular rotational barriers . 
metallacyclopentadienes , which possess two M-C(sp2) bonds and feature the structure of M(CR1CR2-CR3CR4) , are an important class of five - membered metallacycles . they are considered as both reactive intermediates in the stoichiometric and catalytic transformations of organic molecules and useful precursors to main group element compounds , and have received considerable attention in organometallic chemistry , coordination chemistry and synthetic organic chemistry over the past six decades because of their unique metallacyclic structure . this review comprehensively presents the synthesis , structure and reactivity of the s- , p- , d- and f-block metallacyclopentadienes distributed in the whole periodic table . In addition , their application in synthetic organic chemistry and polymer chemistry is summarized . this review aims to be beneficial for the design and synthesis of novel metallacyclopentadienes , and for promoting the rapid development of metallacyclic chemistry . 
novel zr(iv) and hf(iv) complexes bearing two constrained bulky b-enaminoketonato ligands { [ArNCH-C8H3(CH2)n(R)O]2MBn2 , m = Zr or Hf ; n = <nUm> , <nUm> or <nUm> ; r = H or C6H5 ; Ar = C6H5 or C6F5 } were synthesized and clearly characterized . x-ray crystal structure analysis reveals that these complexes adopt a distorted octahedral geometry . compared with non-constrained analogues , the zr(iv) complexes with a cyclic skeleton exhibited high catalytic activities ( up to <nUm> kgPE mmolZr-1 h-1 ) toward ethylene polymerization at ambient pressure and elevated temperatures . moreover , the catalytic properties of these complexes could be governed exquisitely by appropriate variation of the n-aryl substituents and the size of the benzocyclane . the zr(iv) complexes bearing a non-fluorinated n-aryl group yielded oligomers , while the fluorinated analogues bearing a five - membered or six - membered cyclane group produced high molecular weight polyethylenes ( <nUm> - <nUm> kg mol-1 ) under similar conditions on account of the suppression effects on b-H elimination . the zr(iv) complexes are more active toward ethylene polymerization than the hf(iv) analogues , and the resulting polymers exhibited higher molecular weight and narrower molecular weight distribution . 
Hydrosilane-B(C6F5)3 adducts were found to activate zirconocene dihalides and generate ternary catalytic systems possessing moderate to high activity in ethylene polymerization to high density polyethylene ( HDPE ) . the activation efficacy of the adducts increased with increasing hydride donor ability and decreased with steric crowding of the particular hydrosilane used . NMR investigation of the HSiEt3 / BC18F15 / Cp*2ZrF2 system ( cp* = e5-C5Me5 ) revealed the formation of a stable intermediate [Cp*2ZrF(FSiEt3-kF)]+[HB(C6F5)3]- , whereas a crucial role of the [HB(C6F5)3]- anion as a hydride donor for generation of an active cationic zirconium hydride center was elucidated . 
different di and trinuclear rare - earth metal complexes supported by 3-amido appended indolyl ligands were synthesized and their catalytic activities towards isoprene polymerization were investigated . treatment of [RE(CH2SiMe3)3(thf)2] with <nUm> equiv. of 3-(CyNCH)C8H5NH in toluene or in THF afforded dinuclear rare - earth metal alkyl complexes having indolyl ligands in different hapticities with central metals {[e2:e1-m-e1-3-(CyNCH(CH2SiMe3))Ind]RE-(thf)(CH2SiMe3)}2 ( cy = cyclohexyl , ind = indolyl , RE = Yb ( 1 ) , Er ( 2 ) , Y ( 3 ) ) or {[e1-m-e1-3-(CyNCH(CH2SiMe3))Ind]RE-(thf)2(CH2SiMe3)}2 ( RE = Yb ( 4 ) , Er ( 5 ) , Y ( 6 ) , Gd ( 7 ) ) , respectively . these two series of dinuclear complexes could be transferred to each other easily by only changing the solvents in the process . reaction of [Er(CH2SiMe3)3(thf)2] with <nUm> equiv. of 3-t-butylaminomethylindole 3-(tBuNHCH2)C8H5NH in THF afforded the unexpected trinuclear erbium alkyl complex [e2:e1-m-e1-3-(tBuNCH2)Ind]4Er3(thf)5(CH2SiMe3) ( 8 ) , which can also be prepared by reaction of <nUm> equiv. of [Er(CH2SiMe3)3(thf)2] with <nUm> equiv. of 3-(tBuNHCH2)C8H5NH in THF . accordingly , complexes [e2:e1-m-e1-3-(tBuNCH2)Ind]4RE3(thf)5(CH2SiMe3) ( RE = Y ( 9 ) , Dy ( 10 ) ) were prepared by reactions of <nUm> equiv. of [RE(CH2SiMe3)3(thf)2] with <nUm> equiv. of 3-(tBuNHCH2)C8H5NH in THF . reactions of [RE(CH2SiMe3)3(thf)2] with <nUm> equiv. of 3-t-butylaminomethylindole 3-(tBuNHCH2)C8H5NH in THF , followed by treatment with <nUm> equiv. of [(2,6-iPr2C6H3)NCHNH(C6H3iPr2-2,6)] afforded , after workup , the dinuclear rare - earth metal complexes [e1-m-e1:e1-3-(tBuNCH2)Ind][e1-m-e1:e3-3-(tBuNCH2)Ind]RE2(thf)[(e3-2,6-iPr2C6H3)NCHN(C6H3iPr2-2,6)]2(RE = Er ( 11 ) , Y ( 12 ) ) having the indolyl ligands bonded with the rare - earth metal in different ligations . all new complexes 1-12 were fully characterized by spectroscopic methods and elemental analyses , and their structures were determined by x-ray crystallographic analyses . it was found that , except for complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> , all complexes were highly efficient catalysts for selective isoprene polymerization ( up to <nUm> % 1,4-cis selectivity ) with the cooperation of co-catalysts , and the trinuclear complexes displayed advantages over dinuclear complexes in terms of molecular weight of polymers . 
N,N'-Bis(2,6-R-phenyl)-2,6-pyridinedicarboxamides ( L : r = Cl , L1 ; r = F , L2 ; r = H , L3 ; r = me , L4 ; r = et , L5 ; r = iPr , L6 ) were designed as neutral ligands , and the corresponding nickel complexes LNiBr2 ( ni1 - ni6 ) were synthesized as precatalysts for ethylene oligomerization . all new ligands were fully characterized by NMR , and FT-IR spectroscopy , and elemental analysis , while the nickel complexes were examined using FT-IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis . the coordination mode of the ligand with nickel in complexes ni5 and ni6 was tridentate ( O^N^O ) , as established by single crystal x-ray diffractions . all the nickel complexes ni1 - ni6 were tested for ethylene oligomerization with different alkylaluminum compounds as cocatalysts , and diethylaluminum chloride ( Et2AlCl ) was proved to be the most effective . upon activation with Et2AlCl , all nickel complexes showed high catalytic activity ( up to <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 ( Ni ) h-1 atm-1 ) with good selectivity for a-C4 . 
the dimer lithium complex <nUm> and zirconium complexes 4-6 were synthesized and characterized . monomer / dimer zirconium complexes 4-6 were synthesized by changing the molar ratio of Cl4Zr : ligand . their structures were confirmed by x-ray diffraction analysis , which showed a distorted octahedral geometry . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were zirconium trichloride compounds , while complex <nUm> was not a zirconium chloride species . the catalytic behaviors of complexes 4-6 were investigated in the presence of MAO as a cocatalyst . it was found that the catalytic activities of these zirconium complexes toward ethylene polymerization were closely related to the bonding patterns ( e3:e1 , e3 or e1 ) , the number of chlorine atoms in the procatalysts and the availability of the coordination site in the molecule . zirconium trichloride complex <nUm> showed the highest catalytic activity mainly because of its e1 bonding pattern . 
tridentate chelating ligands , which possess three coordination sites and six bonding electrons to coordinate a metal center , are considered as an alternative to the cyclopentadienyl ligand . such tridentate ligands can stabilize a variety of metal oxidation states of a complex and form two four- , five- , six- or seven - membered chelate rings . In addition , fine tuning of its electronic and steric properties by the modification of coordination atoms , ligand skeleton , and substituents on the skeleton of the tridentate ligand will enable control of the catalytic activity and stereochemistry of its complexes in olefin polymerization . this review introduces the recent progress on transition metal catalysts bearing tridentate chelating ligands for olefin polymerization . special emphasis is placed on the effects of ligand modifications on the polymerization activity , the stereochemistry , comonomer incorporation , and molecular weight of the resulting polymers . 
the novel dialkylzirconium complexes L'ZrR2 , ( r = CH3 , bn = benzyl , CH2SiMe3 , L' = Me2Si{e5-tetramethylcyclopentadienyl}{6-[2-(dimesitylboryl)phenyl]pyrid-2-ylamido} ) were synthesized . upon activation with <nUm> equiv. of [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]- , both L'Zr(CH3)2 and L'Zr(Bn)2 are quantitatively converted in situ into [L'Zr(CH3)]+[B(C6F5)4]- and [L'Zr(Bn)]+[B(C6F5)4]- while only <nUm> mol % conversion is observed with L'Zr(CH2SiMe3)2 . the aluminum - free cationic catalysts [L'Zr(CH3)]+[B(C6F5)4]- , [L'Zr(Bn)]+[B(C6F5)4]- and [L'Zr(CH2SiMe3)]+[B(C6F5)4]- initiate ring - opening metathesis polymerization ( ROMP ) of NBE to form predominantly cis-poly(NBE)ROMP . upon activation with [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]- and AliBu3 , L'Zr(CH3)2 , L'Zr(Bn)2 and L'Zr(CH2SiMe3)2 also exhibit moderate catalytic activity in the copolymerization of ethylene ( e ) with NBE . the resulting copolymers do not contain any ROMP - derived poly(NBE) , which is in stark contrast to the complexes ' homopolymerization propensity for NBE . upon activation with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , L'Zr(CH3)2 and L'Zr(Bn)2 produce pure vinyl-insertion polymerization - derived poly(NBE)-co-poly(E) while L'Zr(CH2SiMe3)2 allows for the synthesis of predominantly trans-poly(NBE)ROMP-co-poly(NBE)VIP-co-poly(E) - based copolymers via an a-H+ elimination / addition process . our findings are discussed on the basis of the instability of the alkylidenes in the presence of e and the blocking effect of aluminum alkyls on ROMP via coordination to the pyridyl-moiety in the cationic complexes . 
A series of a-diimine ligands and their corresponding palladium complexes were synthesized and characterized . these a-diimine ligands possess unique properties , which could lead to metal complexes with very similar electronic and steric environments around a palladium center . for example , the CO stretching frequencies of the palladium carbonyl complexes are very similar . At a remote position on the second coordination sphere of the ligand structure , substituents ( ph , CF3 , NO2 and OMe ) are installed to probe their potential influences on olefin polymerization and copolymerization processes . the properties of these palladium complexes in ethylene polymerization , ethylene / methyl acrylate copolymerization , ethylene / norbornene copolymerization and ethylene / 5-norbornene-2-yl acetate copolymerization are investigated in detail . interestingly , most of the metal complexes behaved very similarly to each other except for the complex bearing a ph substituent , which showed much better activity and generated polymers with much higher molecular weight . 
the homopolymerization of propylene and its copolymerization with styrene and ethylene catalyzed by half - sandwich scandium complexes bearing different ligands were carried out . A significant influence of alkyl and THF ligands on the propylene polymerization activity has been observed . the THF - containing trimethylsilylmethyl complex (C5Me4SiMe3)Sc(CH2SiMe3)2(THF) ( 4 ) in combination with one equivalent of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] , can serve as a high activity catalyst for the atactic polymerization of propylene . by using this high activity catalyst , the copolymerization of propylene with styrene has been achieved to afford multi-block propylene-styrene copolymers with syndiotactic styrene - styrene blocks . moreover , a novel family of random propylene-ethylene-styrene terpolymers with a broad composition range , relatively high molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions was effectively obtained by the terpolymerization of propylene with ethylene and styrene in the presence of <nUm> / [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] . the incorporation of styrene units into atactic polypropylene or ethylene-propylene copolymers can be controlled in a wide range simply by changing the monomer feed ratios . 
A series of sodium 2-arylimino-8-quinolates , C1-C8 , differing in both the nature of the aryl and quinolate substituents , was prepared and characterized by <nUm> H / <nUm> C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis . their x-ray structures reveal multimetallic assemblies adopting a variety of structural cores all based on Na-O repeat units : cubic and tetrametallic for C1 , C2 and C4 , hexagonal prismatic and hexametallic for C3 and C5 , and for tetrametallic C7' a core resembling a cyclooctatetraene - type tub - shape . In the presence of BnOH , C1-C8 exhibit good activities towards the ring - opening polymerization ( ROP ) of rac - lactide , affording amorphous polylactides with broad molecular weight distributions . furthermore , the substituent variation within the ligand frame of C1-C8 affects the catalytic activities of the ROP with the least sterically hindered system , C1 , yielding the highest conversion . introduction to the international collaboration the international collaboration between professor wen - hua sun at the institute of chemistry , chinese academy of sciences ( CAS ) and dr gregory A. solan at the university of leicester , UK started in <nUm> through a combination of shared scientific interests and common research goals . to strengthen this collaboration dr solan was awarded a CAS president 's international fellowship for visiting scientists in <nUm> . this scheme supports highly - qualified international scientists to carry out cooperative projects at CAS - affiliated institutions for 1-12 months and covers daily living expenses and international travel costs . the fellowship also aims to strengthen partnerships between CAS host institutions and the recipients ' home institution . dr solan , having first visited the institute of chemistry , CAS in beijing in <nUm> , has been able to make a more extended <nUm> month stay during his sabbatical leave in <nUm> working in professor sun 's laboratory for synthesizing a range of important polymeric materials including polyethylenes and polyesters .

A series of half - metallocene zirconium complexes CpZr(thf)Cl2[O-2,4-tBu-6-(P-PhR)C6H2] ( cp = CH , 2a : r = me , 2b : r = tBu , 2c : r = ph , 2d : r = 4-F-Ph ) have been synthesized by reacting CpZrCl3 with the corresponding ligands in THF . all the complexes were characterized by ( 1H , 13C and 31P ) NMR spectroscopy as well as elemental analysis . x-ray structural analysis for 2a and 2d revealed a six - coordinate distorted octahedral geometry around the zirconium center in the solid state . with the activation of a suitable cocatalyst , half - metallocene zirconium complexes 2a-d were employed to catalyze ethylene polymerization and ethylene copolymerization with cycloolefins including norbornene ( NBE ) , 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene ( ENB ) and 5-vinyl-2-norbornene ( VNB ) . all the complexes exhibited high efficiency toward the copolymerizations . high comonomer incorporations up to <nUm> % ( NBE ) , <nUm> % ( ENB ) and <nUm> % ( VNB ) , respectively , with high catalytic activities above <nUm> kgpolymer per molZr per h were achieved using catalyst 2c . steric hindrance and electronic effects of the complexes or the comonomers greatly influence copolymerization behavior . thus , catalytic activity and copolymer chain structure , including comonomer incorporation and the molecular weight , can be easily tuned over a wide range by changing catalyst and reaction conditions . 
an aqueous solution of a tri-block copolymer PPG-PEG-PPG has been used with two organic salts , sodium acetate and sodium citrate , to create new aqueous biphasic systems ( ABS ) . well defined phase diagrams with suitable tie - lineswere obtained by a turbidometric titration method at <nUm> K . the tie - line lengths and slopes of the tie lines were calculated and the results were validated using othmer - tobias and bancroft equations . the binodals indicate that sodiumcitrate offers a larger biphasic region with the polymer than the acetate salt . the aggregation number of the pure polymer solution and that separated from ABS , determined by a fluorescence quenchingmethod , clearly indicate a hike due to reorganization of the polymer chains upon phase separation . the newly designed systems have been used to extract three different vitamins , thiamine ( B1 ) , riboflavin ( B2 ) and cholecalciferol ( D3 ) , togetherwith the biomolecule caffeine . these studies indicate that caffeine interferes with the extraction of cholecalciferol . possible interactions between the two biomolecules , caffeine and cholecalciferol , thus identified , were further verified by gathering different spectral evidence like absorption , emission , 1H NMR , and mass spectra and from confocal microscopic studies . therefore results of binary extractions of two components in an ABS can act as an indicator of molecular interactions much a priori to confirmation by sophisticated analytical techniques .

2-Methoxyethylaminobis(phenolate)yttrium complexes Y(ONOOtBu)(Nu)(THF) have unique catalytic activity and selectivity toward the ring - opening polymerization ( ROP ) of b-butyrolactone ( BBL ) . some of them also showed activity toward the group - transfer polymerization ( GTP ) of michael - type monomers . these complexes with various nucleophilic ligands ( nu = CH2SiMe3 , 1a ; N(SiHMe2)2 , 1b ; OiPr , 1c ) showed discrepant activity for ROP and GTP . the chain initiation of the ROP of BBL and the GTP of 2-vinylpyridine ( 2VP ) catalyzed by these complexes is investigated by DFT calculations . the results indicate that , in the case of the ROP of BBL , less steric hindrance of the nucleophilic anionic ligand OiPr makes complex 1c have a higher chain initiation efficiency and thus a higher polymerization activity than 1a and 1b . In the case of the GTP of 2VP , the activity of 1a benefits from a good orbital match between the moieties of Y-CH2SiMe3 and vinyl of 2VP . the origin of the experimentally observed inertness of 1b has also been elucidated . these results could add to the better understanding of the experimentally observed activity discrepancy and shed light on the development of such a catalysis system .

this journal is the organo-soluble and extremely stable polynorbornene PHNB - HPB with a hexaphenylbenzene ( HPB ) moiety was prepared by ring - opening metathesis polymerization ( ROMP ) followed by hydrogenation . the hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC)-containing PHNB - HBC , which is insoluble in commercial organic solvents , was prepared by the cyclodehydrogenation of PHNB - HPB . the glass transition temperature of PHNB - HPB was <nUm> ° C . the temperatures required for a <nUm> % weight loss ( td10 ) for PHNB - HPB and PHNB - HBC were <nUm> ° C and <nUm> ° C under a nitrogen flow , respectively . the PHNB - HBC exhibited an ordered self - assembly in the solid state . the exfoliation of PHNB - HBC aggregates was tested by ultrasonication in various solvents . the PHNB - HBC dispersion solutions showed an intensive emission of the 0-0 transition ( <nUm> nm ) due to the lower d6h symmetrical structure and alkoxy substituents . between different solvents , the dispersion in n-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone ( CHP ) showed the highest individual metric and the strongest 0-0 transition ( <nUm> nm ) , indicating higher dispersibility . 
stereospecific polymers were constructed by the successive formation of a trans-CC bond using bis(benzylic gem - dibromide)s as monomers treated with Cu / polyamine under mild conditions . the structure of the polymer was characterized by GPC , NMR , UV - vis and MALDI-TOF-MS . the formation of a trans-CC bond was established by a series of control reactions . evidence demonstrates that the CC bond is generated by two domino reactions , one is the intermolecular reductive coupling reaction from gem - dibromide to vicinal dibromide and the other is the intramolecular debromination of vicinal dibromide , and therefore , the formation of a trans-CC bond . the successive formation of the trans-CC bond leads to the growth of a polymer chain following a step - growth polymerization mechanism . 
In this contribution , the effect of substitution on biaryl-based phosphine - sulfonate nickel catalysts is investigated . A series of [k2-(P,O)-2-(P-PhAr)-1-benzenesulfonato]NiPh(PPh3) nickel complexes ( Ni - OMe , Ar = 2-[2',6'-(OMe)2-C6H3]-C6H4 ; Ni-H , Ar = 2-(C6H5)-C6H4 ; Ni - OiPr , Ar = 2-[2',6'-(OiPr)2-C6H3]-C6H4 ; Ni-F , Ar = 2-[2',6'-F2-C6H3]-C6H4 ) are prepared and applied to the polymerization of ethylene as well as its copolymerizations with polar functionalized norbornene comonomers . these nickel complexes are highly active toward ethylene polymerization without the requirement of any cocatalyst . specifically , the Ni-F complex exhibits high stability and high activity ( up to <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 h-1 ) , and catalyzes the formation of polyethylene of high molecular weight ( Mn up to <nUm> <nUm> ) and high melting point ( Tm up to <nUm> ° C ) . the polyethylene molecular - weight distribution from this system is very sensitive to the steric demand of the ligand , as well as the nature of the coordinating base , polymerization temperature , and ethylene pressure . this , in turn , provides a simple and efficient strategy for the control of the polyethylene molecular - weight distribution , which is an important parameter that determines multiple material properties such as viscosity , stiffness , and crystallinity . Ni-F also exhibits good ethylene-copolymerization behavior toward polar - functionalized norbornene comonomers , leading to moderate comonomer incorporation in copolymers of moderate molecular weight and high melting point . 
various half - titanocenes containing monodentate anionic nitrogen ligands , CpTiCl <nUm> [ 3-C <nUm> H <nUm> ( CH <nUm> N)(CH <nUm> O)CN ] ( T1 ) , CpTiCl <nUm> [ ( C <nUm> H <nUm> O)(N i Pr <nUm> )CN ] ( T2 ) , CpTiCl <nUm> [ 1,3-(4-MeC <nUm> H <nUm> )(CH <nUm> N ) <nUm> CN ] ( T3 ) , CpTiCl <nUm> [ 1,3-(2,4,6-Me <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> )(CH <nUm> N ) <nUm> CN ] ( T4 ) , CpTiCl <nUm> [ 1,3-(2,6- i Pr <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> )(CH <nUm> N ) <nUm> CN ] ( T5 ) and CpTiCl[1,3-(2,6- i Pr <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> )(CH <nUm> N ) <nUm> CN][CH <nUm> ( CH <nUm> ) <nUm> CH(C <nUm> H <nUm> )COO ] ( T6 ) , were synthesized and characterized . the molecular structures of T1 , T2 and T5 were determined by x-ray crystallography . all the above half - titanocenes were employed as precatalysts for ethylene / propylene copolymerization after activation by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or modified MAO ( MMAO ) . the catalytic activity and propylene incorporation into copolymers increased in the order of T1 < T2 < T3 < T4 < T5 , which is attributed to the electron donating nature of the ligands . the half - titanocene containing the 2-ethylhexanoate ligand ( T6 ) has good solubility in hexanes . an ethylene-propylene copolymer with high molecular weight ( m w = <nUm> kg mol <nUm> ) could be obtained by the T6 / MMAO catalytic system . the ethylene / propylene copolymerization catalyzed by the T6 / TIBA / MMAO catalytic system was more controllable than that by the T5 / MAO catalytic system . importantly , both the T5 / MAO and T6 / TIBA / MMAO catalytic systems displayed a high catalytic activity of <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> and <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> g polymer per mol of Ti per h , respectively , even at a low Al / Ti molar ratio ( Al / Ti = <nUm> ) . all the values of r e × r P ( r e : reactivity ratio for ethylene ; r P : reactivity ratio for propylene ) were around <nUm> in the copolymerization catalyzed by T2 , T4 , T5 and T6 , indicating that nearly random ethylene-propylene copolymers could be prepared . compared to the T5 / MAO catalytic system , ethylene-propylene copolymers with higher molecular weight ( m w = <nUm> kg mol <nUm> ) and higher propylene incorporation ( <nUm> mol % ) could be produced by using the T6 / TIBA / MMAO ( TIBA / Ti = <nUm> ) system with a similar catalytic activity .

[ Cp*TiMe <nUm> { ( O-2,4-Me <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> )-6-CH <nUm> } ] <nUm> N ( 8 ) showed the higher catalytic activities than the related mononuclear analogue , Cp*TiCl <nUm> ( O-2-R-4,6-Me <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> ) ( r = me , t bu ) ; the activity by <nUm> in the presence of Al i bu <nUm> -[Ph <nUm> C][B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] cocatalysts was higher than that in the presence of MAO . 
A novel type of porous coordination polymer with titanium alkoxide linkages ( Ti - PCP ) was successfully constructed through reaction of a 1,3-diol - substituted shape - persistent arylene-ethynylene macrocycle with Ti(O i Pr ) <nUm> . the polymer exhibits a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller ( BET ) surface area ( <nUm> m <nUm> g <nUm> ) and good adsorption selectivity for CO <nUm> over N <nUm> . with n-Bu <nUm> BrN as a co-catalyst , Ti - PCP can serve as a highly efficient catalyst to convert CO <nUm> into cyclocarbonates through the cycloaddition reaction with epoxides under mild conditions . this framework - based heterogeneous catalyst not only has excellent catalytic activity , but also can be recycled and reused many times with easy product separation , thus showing its great potential for industrial applications as a green catalyst . with high uptake of CO <nUm> and catalytic ability to convert CO <nUm> to useful chemical compounds , this type of porous polymer with embedded catalytic centers could have important applications to solve environmental problems regarding post-combustion CO <nUm> capture and conversion .

the energy transfer from upconversion nanoparticles ( UCNPs ) to photosensitizers has been widely used for generating reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) by near infrared ( NIR ) excitation . however , the poor spectral overlap of lanthanide ions and conventional photosensitizers leads to low PDT efficiency . In this study , we construct a multilayered upconversion nanoplatform with dual photosensitizers to efficiently use the UV and visible upconversion emissions in NIR - responsive PDT . the nanoplatform consists of three functional layers , which are the upconversion nanoparticle as a core , and light - sensitive conjugated polymer and apo-transferrin-titanocene ( tf @ Tc ) as shells . under NIR irradiation , apparent energy transfer occurs from the core to the polymer and Tc components in the shell , producing reactive oxygen species and free radicals for cancer cell killing . In vitro cellular assays show the synergistic therapeutic effect of the conjugated polymer and Tc as photosensitizers . In vivo animal studies show that tumor growth is significantly inhibited in the mice receiving the theranostic platform and NIR irradiation . based on these observations , the multilayered upconversion nanocomposites can find potential applications in NIR - mediated anti-tumor therapy . 
an aluminabenzene-alkylzirconium complex having a half - zirconocene structure was synthesized . x-ray crystallographic analysis of this complex revealed a zwitterionic structure consisting of cationic alkylzirconium chloride and four - coordinated aluminate . In the presence of a catalytic amount of this complex , ethylene polymerization could proceed without any additives to form ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene . 
the synthesis of alkylphosphine - substituted a-diimine ( DI ) ligands and their subsequent addition to Ni(COD)2 allowed for the preparation of (iPr2PPrDI)Ni and (tBu2PPrDI)Ni . the solid state structures of both compounds were found to feature a distorted tetrahedral geometry that is largely consistent with the reported structure of the diphenylphosphine - substituted variant , ( Ph2PPr DI)Ni . to explore and optimize the synthetic utility of this catalyst class , all three compounds were screened for benzaldehyde hydrosilylation activity at <nUm> mol % loading over <nUm> h at <nUm> ° C . notably , ( Ph2PPr DI)Ni was found to be the most efficient catalyst while phenyl silane was the most effective reductant . A broad scope of aldehydes and ketones were then hydrosilylated , and the silyl ether products were hydrolyzed to afford alcohols in good yield . when attempts were made to explore ester reduction , inefficient dihydrosilylation was noted for ethyl acetate and no reaction was observed for several additional substrates . however , when an equimolar solution of allyl acetate and phenyl silane was added to <nUm> mol % ( Ph2PPr DI)Ni , complete ester C-O bond hydrosilylation was observed within <nUm> min at <nUm> ° C to generate propylene and PhSi(OAc)3 . the scope of this reaction was expanded to include six additional allyl esters , and under neat conditions , turnover frequencies of up to <nUm> h-1 were achieved . this activity is believed to be the highest reported for transition metal - catalyzed ester C-O bond hydrosilylation . proposed mechanisms for ( Ph2PPr DI)Ni - mediated carbonyl and allyl ester C-O bond hydrosilylation are also discussed . 
bis(oxazoline) - derived N - heterocyclic carbene ( IBiox ) supported rare - earth ( Sc , Y , Lu ) trialkyl complexes have been synthesized and structurally characterized , and their catalytic activity in the (co)polymerization of a-olefins has been studied . the treatment of Ln(CH2SiMe3)3(THF)2 with one equivalent of freshly prepared IBiox afforded the rare - earth metal complexes (IBiox)Ln(CH2SiMe3)3THFn ( ln = Sc ( 1 ) , n = <nUm> ; Y ( 2 ) , n = <nUm> ; and Lu ( 3 ) , n = <nUm> ) in good yields . single crystal x-ray diffraction study showed that <nUm> is pseudo tetrahedral , while <nUm> and <nUm> are distorted trigonal bipyramidal with coordinated THF . the Ln-C(carbene) bond distances in <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> are <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> Å , respectively . DFT calculations were performed to study the bonding scheme and the structural stability . complex <nUm> showed a high activity for 1-hexene polymerization by activation with <nUm> equivalents of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] , and the resultant polymers are predominantly vinylene end groups ( ca. <nUm> % ) . moreover , the catalyst system based on <nUm> proved to be effective for the copolymerization of 1-hexene with 1,7-octadiene , affording the copolymers with about <nUm> % pendant vinyl groups . the hydrophilicity of the copolymers was improved by modifying the vinyl groups with carboxyls via a thiol - ene reaction . 
catalytic hydroboration of ketones with pinacolborane was achieved with a 2D iron (ii) coordination polymer ( CP ) of a divergent 4,2';6',4''-terpyridine ( tpy ) derivative under mild conditions with high efficiency . this solid iron catalyst system is more active towards the hydroboration of ketones than that of aldehydes , displaying a different trend of reactivity from known homogeneous iron hydroboration catalysts . 
In this study , density functional theory calculations have been used to investigate the decisive role that the carborane ( cab ) ligand plays in ethylene polymerization catalyzed by cab - containing metal complexes . In the catalytic process , a large amount of charge transfer ( CT ) from cab to the metal centre was found to facilitate ethylene insertion . besides this , the (Cab)B-H ⋯ H-C(alkyl) dihydrogen bond interaction was demonstrated to be the main factor in stabilizing the intermediates . 
the photocatalytic degradation of different emergent contaminants in aqueous solutions has been studied by using oligomer - coated O2Ti nanoparticles under solar light irradiation . the oligomer was synthesized using methacrylic acid , ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether and imidazole . the material was characterized by SEM , DLS , FT-IR and FT - raman and UV - vis spectroscopy . the photocatalytic behavior with the model azo-dye methyl orange was analyzed in different conditions ( initial concentration and pH ) and the kinetic parameters were described by using the langmuir - hinshelwood model . the reuse and photocorrosion of the nanoparticles was studied up to seven operative cycles . the oligomer - coated nanoparticles showed better performance than the uncoated ones due to an increment in absorption in the visible light region . the charge transfer process would form electron / hole pairs ( e- / h+ ) with the holes localized on the organic ligands ( most probably on imidazole residues from oligomers ) and the electrons in the conduction band of O2Ti . supernatant safety after the photocatalytic treatment was examined by the lettuce seeds assay and no toxicity was found . the versatility of the material was studied by exposing it to different emergent contaminants ( ciprofloxacin , trimethoprim and chloramphenicol ) . 
the copolymerization of myrcene with ethylene and propylene using half - sandwich scandium complexes bearing various auxiliary ligands has been examined . In the copolymerization of myrcene with ethylene , the THF - free aminobenzyl scandium complex bearing a relatively small cyclopentadienyl ligand (C5H5)Sc(CH2C6H4NMe2-o)2 ( 1 ) afforded diblock myrcene-ethylene copolymers with a high myrcene content and predominant cis-1,4-structure , whereas the analogous scandium complex with a larger cyclopentadienyl ligand (C5Me4SiMe3)Sc(CH2C6H4NMe2-o)2 ( 2 ) afforded multiblock myrcene-ethylene copolymers with different myrcene contents and a predominant 3,4-structure . In contrast , the THF - containing trimethylsilylmethyl scandium complex (C5Me4SiMe3)Sc(CH2SiMe3)2(THF) ( 3 ) afforded alternating myrcene-ethylene copolymers on using a sufficient amount of myrcene . more remarkably , the terpolymerization of myrcene with ethylene and propylene has also been realized using a scandium complex <nUm> , yielding a new family of myrcene - based ethylene-propylene-diene rubbers ( EPDM ) with versatile CC double bonds in the main and side chains . by efficiently transforming the CC double bonds of the resulting myrcene - based EPDM into other polar groups , versatile functionalized polyolefins such as thioacetic acid , sulfoacid , and epoxidized , hydroxylated-chlorinated and furan functionalized polyolefins were obtained . 
copolymerization of ethylene ( e ) and styrene ( st ) was successfully achieved by using a scandium catalyst to produce a series of pseudo-random copolymers . the incorporation content of the st monomer could be tuned from <nUm> mol % to <nUm> mol % swiftly through varying the st to e feeding mole ratio and polymerization time . the highest st content in the copolymer is lower than <nUm> mol % even at a feeding mole ratio as high as st : e = <nUm> : <nUm> due to the steric hindrance around the active metal center . this is consistent with the monomer reactivity ratios of rE = <nUm> and rst = <nUm> calculated according to the fineman - ross equation . this catalytic performance was extended to other styrene derivatives , such as 4-methylstyrene , 4-tert-butylstyrene , 4-isopropenestyrene , 4-vinylphenyl dimethylsilane and 4-phenylethynylstyrene . the resulting E-St copolymers have no consecutive st sequences and show only one glass transition temperature varying from <nUm> ° C to <nUm> ° C with the st content . DFT simulation reveals the copolymerization mechanism . 
copolymerization behavior is the most critical factor in the properties of polymeric materials . highly active copolymerization of ethylene and norbornene was explored using (fluorenyl)(amido)titanium complexes bearing substituted amido ligands . the norbornene content and norbornene sequence distribution of the copolymers were controllable by changing the comonomer feed ratio and the polymerization temperature , respectively . the evaluation of the monomer reactivity ratios indicated that the copolymerization behavior of the (fluorenyl)(amido)titanium complex was tunable from alternating to random nature . the thermal and mechanical properties of the resulting copolymers depended on the sequence distribution of norbornene . 
rare earth metal - based complexes can catalyze ethylene / styrene copolymerization to give copolymers with long syndiotactic polystyrene sequences . here , sequence - controlled ethylene / styrene copolymerization was achieved by regulating the electronic and steric properties of scandium precursors . when a thiophene - fused cyclopentadienyl scandium complex <nUm> , ( 2,4,5,6-Me <nUm> -4H-cyclopenta[b]thiophenyl)Sc(CH <nUm> SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> , was used , a copolymer with long syndiotactic polystyrene sequences was obtained . the tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) adduct of complex <nUm> ( 1*THF ) showed lower activity to give a copolymer with short polystyrene sequences owing to an increase in the steric effects around the metal center . the pyridine adducts 1*Py and 1*Py F5 were totally inert . under the same conditions , complex <nUm> ( (2,5-dimethyl-3-phenyl-4-H-cyclopenta[b]thiophenyl)Sc(CH <nUm> SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> ) , an analog of <nUm> , incorporated styrene discretely into the copolymer to form a “ pseudo random ” microstructure . complex <nUm> bearing a bulky and less electron - donating constrained - geometry configuration ligand ( ( Flu-CH <nUm> -Py)Sc(CH <nUm> SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> ) could catalyze copolymerization in a livingness manner to afford copolymers containing mainly the alternating ethylene / styrene sequence , where a fast and reversible chain - transfer reaction to aluminum alkyl was observed . the influences of structural and electronic factors of the scandium precursors , such as the steric bulkiness of a ligand and incorporation of a lewis base to the active metal center , on the catalytic activity and sequence distribution of the resulting copolymers were elucidated . 
the charge density of the central metal atoms and band gap of the compounds were investigated by the dmol3 software package in density functional theory ( DFT ) . the band gap of the (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 compound was the smallest among the listed metallocene compounds , however , its reactivity reached <nUm> kg ( mol h)-1 × <nUm> at the time of slurry polymerization , which was the most active among the catalysts enumerated by the compounds and also verified the frontier orbital theory . the polymerization of the (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 compound with olefins proceeded according to the a-agostic mechanism of the ground state and the transition state . hydrogen molecules were released during the transition state and led to (nBuCp)2Zr(Cyclopropyl)+ as the final product . the authenticity of the presence of hydrogen in the olefin polymerization gas was confirmed . the aggregation of hydrogen led to a decrease in the activity of the metallocene catalyst , and that was why the energy barrier caused by the first polymerization was much lower than the second polymerization . the present work would provide valuable insight into the characteristics of metallocene catalysts with high activity and low hydrogen evolution . 
three cationic scandium aryloxide complexes , i.e. , [LScOAr]+[B(C6F5)4]- ( Ar = 2,6-tBu2C6H3 ; L = CH3C(2,6-iPr2C6H3N)C(R)C(CH3)(N(CH2)nCH2PPh2) ; 6a : n = <nUm> , r = H ; 6b : n = <nUm> , r = CH3 ; 6c : n = <nUm> , r = CH ) , were prepared by a three - step synthetic route . the reactivities of tridentate NNP ligand supported scandium complexes <nUm> toward various unsaturated substrates were investigated . treatment of 6a with non-conjugated small molecules such as phenyl isocyanates , phenyl isothiocyanate , and benzaldehyde resulted in formation of Sc / g-C [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition products 7-9 because of nucleophilic reactivity at the b-diketiminato g-carbon , with retention of Sc ⋯ P interactions . analogous Sc / g-C [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition reactions occurred for complex 6b with phenyl isocyanate and phenyl isothiocyanate , affording complexes <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . complex 6c , with a bulky benzyl substituent at the γ position of the b-diketiminato ligand , showed typical Sc / P frustrated lewis pair ( FLP ) reactivity toward phenyl isocyanate to give the 1,2-addition product <nUm> . complex 6c was efficient in the polymerization of g-methyl-a-methylene-g-butyrolactone ( MMBL ) . the corresponding initiating species <nUm> , which was formed by Sc / P FLP - type 1,4-addition , was isolated . 
the in air catalytic hydroboration of ketones and aldehydes with pinacolborane by an iron (ii) coordination polymer ( CP ) is carried out under mild and solvent - free conditions . the precatalyst is highly active towards a wide range of substrates including functionalized ketones and aldehydes in the presence of KO t bu as an activator , achieving a high turnover number ( TON ) of up to <nUm> . excellent chemoselectivity to aldehydes over ketones was also revealed , which is in sharp contrast with the results obtained under inert atmosphere using the same catalyst system . this catalyst observed here is not only highly efficient but also recyclable for reuse for at least <nUm> times without losing its effectiveness . 
lewis acid in situ modulation plays an important role in olefin polymerisation . In this work , pyridazine-imine Ni complexes ni1 and ni2 have been synthesised , characterised and investigated in ethylene (co)polymerisation . In the homo-polymerisation of ethylene , the B (iii) lewis acidic additives result in increased catalytic activities ( up to <nUm> × <nUm> g mol ni-1 h-1 ) . moreover , the B (iii) lewis acidic additives can modulate microstructures of the polyethylene products , resulting in increased branching densities and long chain branches . In the copolymerisation of ethylene with methyl 10-undecenoate , both catalytic activity and the polar monomer incorporation ratio ( up to <nUm> % ) increased upon using B (iii) lewis acidic additives . it was indicated that the lewis acid - base interaction between B (iii) lewis acids and the pyridazine moiety reduced the electron density from the Ni center and in situ modulated the pyridazine-imine Ni catalyzed ethylene (co)polymerisation . 
complex nanostructures with high compositional and structural tailorability are highly desired in order to meet the material needs in the rapid development of nanoscience and nanotechnology . therefore , the synthetic technique is of essential importance but currently still suffers from many challenges . herein , we elaborately explore and demonstrate the flexibility of the anisotropic metallo - organic compound ( dihafnium dichloride , cp <nUm> ClHf <nUm> ) for the fabrication of inorganic architectures by mimicking the assembly behaviors in biomolecules . the open and discrete architectures of mesoporous HfO <nUm> nanoframes were constructed via the self - assembly of precursor with acetone as solvent and ammonia as the basic source , but without any addition of auxiliary organic molecules , like surfactants , DAN or peptides . In addition , the nanostructures ( hollow spheres , solid spheres , yolk - shells , aggregations and defect - rich nanoparticles ) of HfO <nUm> assemblies can be well manipulated by simply modulating the synthesis parameters . the marked difference in the chemical bonds by the different ligands resulted in discrepant hydrolysis and then specific directional bonds for the diversity of the resultant HfO <nUm> assemblies . interestingly , the HfO <nUm> nanoframe exhibits enhanced piezoelectricity , and can be used as a microelectrode reactor to trigger the pseudo-electrochemical aniline polymerization reaction by introducing ultrasonic excitation to renew the surface charges . moreover , as compared with nanoparticle catalysts , the palladium ( Pd ) loaded nanoframe reactor exhibits obvious enhanced catalytic performance for classical suzuki coupling , benefiting from the structural advantages of the HfO <nUm> frame . our findings here can be expected to offer new perspectives to find suitable materials by understanding the analogy between materials chemistry and biomolecule chemistry . 
A novel near - infrared ( NIR ) photoinitiating system for cationic polymerization using upconversion nanoparticles ( UCNPs ) and ferrocenium salts is reported . the UV-A and visible light emitted by the UCNPs upon NIR irradiation , absorbed by the ferrocenium salts , results in the liberation of aromatic ligand and thus the formed active lewis acid can efficiently induce the cationic polymerization of oxirane and vinyl monomers . notably , high " post polymerization " efficiency in dark ( > <nUm> % ) was observed which can compensate the limited upconversion fluorescence efficiency and lead to an improved and uniform conversion of the monomers . 
ring - opening polymerisation ( ROP ) of strained [1] - and [2]metallocenophanes and related species is well - established , and the monomer ring - strain is manifest in a substantial tilting of the cyclopentadienyl ligands , giving α angles of ∼ 14-32 ° . surprisingly , tetracarba[4]nickelocenophane [Ni(e5-C5H4)2(CH2)4] ( 2 ) undergoes ROP ( pyridine , <nUm> ° C , <nUm> days ) to give primarily insoluble poly(nickelocenylbutylene) [Ni(e5-C5H4)2(CH2)4]n ( 12 ) , despite the lack of significant ring - tilt . the exoenthalpic nature of the ROP was confirmed by DFT calculations involving the cyclic precursor and model oligomers ( DH0ROP = <nUm> ± <nUm> kJ mol-1 ) , and is proposed to be a consequence of torsional strain present in the ansa bridge of <nUm> . the similarly untilted disila-2-oxa[3]nickelocenophanes [Ni(e5-C5H4)2(SiMe2)2O] ( 13 ) and [Ni(e5-C5H4)2(SiMePh)2O] ( 14 ) were found to lack similar torsional strain and to be resistant to ROP under the same conditions . In contrast , 1-methyltricarba[3]nickelocenophane {Ni(e5-C5H4)2(CH2)2[CH(CH3)]} ( 15 ) with a significant tilt angle ( α ∼ <nUm> ° ) was found to undergo ROP to give soluble polymer {Ni(e5-C5H4)2(CH2)2[CH(CH3)]}n ( 18 ) . the reversibility of the process in this case allowed for the effects of temperature and reaction concentration on the monomer - polymer equilibrium to be explored and thereby thermodynamic data to be elucidated ( DH0ROP = <nUm> kJ mol-1 , DG0ROP = <nUm> kJ mol-1 ) . compared to the previously described ROP of the unsubstituted analogue [Ni(e5-C5H4)2(CH2)3] ( 1 ) ( DH0ROP = <nUm> kJ mol-1 , DG0ROP = <nUm> kJ mol-1 ) , the presence of the additional methyl substituent in the ansa bridge appears to marginally disfavour ROP and leads to a corresponding decrease in the equilibrium polymer yield . 
poly(hexene) with very high molecular weight is produced at <nUm> MPa ( <nUm> atm ) with (C5HMe4)2HfCl2-methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) as catalyst ; the dependence of the polymerization on the reaction pressure ( <nUm> MPa - <nUm> GPa ) and the substituent pattern of a zirconocene catalyst is described . 
isoprene was hydrosilylated in the absence of transition metals by using specific organic solvents as both reaction media and organocatalysts . A highly selective reaction with successful catalyst recycling could be performed by using propylene carbonate as the reaction medium . 
therapeutic application of pharmacologically active proteins requires advanced drug delivery systems for stabilizing their activity and preventing denaturation during storage and patient treatment . depending on their clinical target , controlled drug release is often required to achieve the intended therapeutic effect . In this context , electrospun nanofibers gained considerable attention . however , even though immediate drug release from such fibers can easily be realized , fiber mat fabrication providing long - term controlled protein release still bares challenges . In this study , lysozyme was encapsulated in poly(vinyl alcohol ) fibers followed by post-modification with MeOH , glutaraldehyde vapor , or UV light . subsequently , a systematic investigation of the effect of these post-modification treatments on the physicochemical properties of the fibers and the stability and release kinetics of lysozyme was performed . MeOH treatment did not affect lysozyme release kinetics compared to untreated fibers , whereas glutaraldehyde vapor and UV light treatment prolonged the drug release . infrared spectroscopy revealed cross-linking of the polymer by glutaraldehyde vapor , which reduced the lysozyme release from the fibers . further , protein activity was significantly reduced for fibers treated with glutaraldehyde vapor and UV light . In addition , reduced viability was identified for cells in contact with glutaraldehyde vapor - treated fibers and , to a lesser extent , for UV light - treated fibers , whereas MeOH - treated fibers did not affect cell viability . these results elucidated the effects of fiber post-modification on the release kinetics , activity , and biocompatibility of protein drugs and can serve as guidance for rational development of nanomedicines for safe and effective therapeutic delivery of natural proteins .

A conjugated copolymer of 9,9-didodecylfluorene and 4-triphenylamino-2,6- bis(phenyl)pyridine ( F12TPN ) , containing both electron donor and acceptor moieties , was synthesized via suzuki coupling polymerization . polymer memory devices , based on thin films of F12TPN and its carbon nanotube composites , were fabricated . the current density - voltage characteristics of the indium tin oxide ( ITO ) / F12TPN / Al sandwich structure could be switched from a low conductivity ( off ) state to a high conductivity ( on ) state , when operated under negative bias with ITO as the anode . the switch-on voltage of the as-fabricated device was around <nUm> V . the on / off state current ratio was about <nUm> . the on / off state current ratio could be enhanced to <nUm> and the switch-on voltage reduced to about <nUm> V by doping the F12TPN layer with about <nUm> wt % of carbon nanotubes . once the memory devices had been switched on , they could not be erased ( switched off ) with a reverse bias ( positive bias ) . thus the memory effect was characteristics of that of a write - once read-many-times memory . the memory mechanism was deduced from molecular simulation and modeling of the nature of currents in both states . 
A deeper understanding of the processes , which occur during free radical photopolymerization , is necessary in order to develop a fully comprehensive model , which represents their behavior during exposure . one of these processes is photoinitiation , whereby a photon is absorbed by a photosensitizer producing free radicals , which can initiate polymerization . these free radicals can also participate in polymer chain termination ( primary termination ) , and it is therefore necessary to understand their generation in order to predict the temporally varying kinetic effects present during holographic grating formation . In this paper , a study of the photoinitiation mechanisms of irgacure <nUm> photosensitizer , in an epoxy resin matrix , is presented . we report our experimental results and present a theoretical model to predict the physically observed behavior . 
A study by molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulation of the acetonitrile diffusion into a polypyrrole film was carried out with atomic detail in a <nUm> N lithium perchlorate solution . from the simulated trajectories , the acetonitrile behavior was estimated from bulk solution to the interior of the polypyrrole film , across the polypyrrole / solution interface , for a neutral ( reduced ) and charged ( oxidized ) state of the polymer . among other properties , the translational diffusion coefficient and rotational relaxation time of the acetonitrile were calculated , where a diminution in the translational diffusion coefficient was measured in the interior of the polypyrrole matrix compared to bulk , independently of the oxidation state of the polymer , in contrast with the behavior of the rotational relaxation time that increases from bulk to the interior of the polymer for both oxidation states . In addition , the difference of free energy DG associated to the acetonitrile penetration into the polymer was calculated . from the results , it was evidenced that the scarce affinity of acetonitrile to diffuse into the polymer in its reduced state is related with the positive uniform difference of free energy DG ≈ <nUm> kJ / mol , while in the oxidized state , an important free energy barrier of DG ≈ <nUm> kJ / mol has to pass trough for reaching stable sites inside the polymer with values of DG up to <nUm> kJ / mol . 
this paper focused on the dechlorination of polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) , a plastic which is widely used in the human life and thereby is leading to serious " white pollution " , via vapor treatment process to recycle PVC wastes . In the process , ClH emitted was captured into water solution to avoid hazardous gas pollution and corruption , and remaining polymers free of chlorine could be thermally degraded for further energy recovery . optimal conditions for the dechlorination of PVC using vapor treatment was investigated , and economic feasibility of this method was also analyzed based on the experimental data . the results showed that the efficiency of dechlorination increased as the temperature increased from <nUm> ° C to <nUm> ° C , and the rate of dechlorination up to <nUm> % was obtained at the temperature near <nUm> ° C . meanwhile , about <nUm> % of total organic carbon was detected in water solution , which indicated that PVC was slightly degraded in this process . the main products in solution were identified to be acetone , benzene and toluene . In addition , the effects of alkali catalysis on dechlorination were also studied in this paper , and it showed that alkali could not improve the efficiency of the dechlorination of PVC .

bis(1-methylethenyl-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride ( 7a ) was prepared by a fulvene route . photolysis at <nUm> ° C with pyrex - filtered UV light resulted in a rapid and complete intramolecular [2+2]cycloaddition reaction to yield the corresponding cyclobutylene-bridged ansa - zirconocene dichloride isomer ( 8a ) . this is one of the rare examples of an organic functional group chemistry that leads to carbon-carbon coupling at the framework of an intact sensitive group <nUm> bent metallocene complex . more sterically hindered open metallocenes that bear bulky isopropyl or tert-butyl substituents at their cp rings in addition to the active 1-methylethenyl functional group undergo the photochemical ansa - metallocene ring closure reaction equally facile . the metallocene systems used and obtained in this study have served as transition metal components for the generation of active metallocene propene polymerization catalysts . 
single - site polymerization catalysts enable exquisite control over alkene polymerization reactions to produce new materials with unique properties . knowledge of catalyst speciation and fundamental kinetics are essential for full mechanistic understanding of zirconocene - catalyzed alkene polymerization . currently the effect of activators on fundamental polymerization steps is not understood . progress in understanding activator effects requires determination of fundamental kinetics for zirconocene catalysts with noncoordinating anions such as [B(C6F5)4]- . kinetic NMR studies at low temperature demonstrate a very fast propagation rate for 1-hexene polymerization catalyzed by [(SBI)Zr(CH2SiMe3)][B(C 6F5)4 ] [ where SBI is rac-Me 2Si(indenyl)2 ] with complete consumption of 1-hexene before the first NMR spectrum . surprisingly , the first NMR spectrum reveals , aside from uninitiated catalyst , Zr - allyls as the sole catalyst - containing species . these Zr - allyls , which exist in two diastereomeric forms , have been characterized by physical and chemical methods . the mechanism of Zr - allyl formation was probed with a trapping experiment , leading us to favor a mechanism in which Zr - polymeryl undergoes b-H transfer to metal without dissociation of coordinated alkene followed by s-bond metathesis to form H and Zr - allyl . Zr - allyl species undergo slow reactions with alkene but react rapidly with H to form hydrogenation products . 
copolymerization of racemic a-olefins with ethylene and propylene was carried out in the presence of enantiopure C1 - symmetric ansa metallocene , { 1,2-(SiMe2)2(e5-C 5H-3,5-(CHMe2)2)(e5-C 5H3)}-ZrCl2 to probe the effect of the polymer chain end on enantioselection for the R- or s-a - olefin during the kinetic resolution by polymerization catalysis . copolymerizations with ethylene revealed that the polymer chain end is an important factor in the enantioselection of the reaction and that for homopolymerization , chain end control generally works cooperatively with enantiomorphic site control . resulcts from propyclcene copolymerizations suggested that chain end control arising from a methyl group at the β carbon along the main chain can drastically affect selectivity , but its importance as a stereo - directing element depends on the identity of the olefin . 
A series of bimetallic organo-group <nUm> " constrained geometry " catalysts and binuclear bisborane and bisborate cocatalysts have been synthesized to probe catalyst center - catalyst center cooperativity effects on olefin enchainment in homogenous olefin polymerization and copolymerization processes . significant nuclearity effects are found versus mononuclear controls , and the effect can be correlated with metal - metal approach distances and ion pairing effects . novel polymer structures can be obtained by using such binuclear catalyst / cocatalyst systems . 
all rights reserved.d0 metal - alkyl complexes ( m = Ti , Zr , and Hf ) show specific activity and selectivity in olefin polymerization and oligomerization depending on their ligand set and charge . here , we show by a combined experimental and computational study that the13C NMR chemical shift tensors of the a-carbon of metal alkyls that undergo olefin insertion signal the presence of partial alkylidene character in the metal – carbon bond , which facilitates this reaction . the alkylidene character is traced back to the p-donating interaction of a filled orbital on the alkyl group with an empty low - lying metal d-orbital of appropriate symmetry . this molecular orbital picture establishes a connection between olefin insertion into a metal - alkyl bond and olefin metathesis and a close link between the cossee – arlmann and green – rooney polymerization mechanisms . The13C NMR chemical shifts , the a-H agostic interaction , and the low activation barrier of ethylene insertion are , therefore , the results of the same orbital interactions , thus establishing chemical shift tensors as a descriptor for olefin insertion . 
polyesters were formed from the reaction of the salt of camphoric acid and group IVB metallocene dichlorides using the interfacial polycondenzation process . the polyesters were formed in good yields with moderate chain lengths . fourier transform infrared spectroscopy shows bands characteristic of the presence of both reactants with new bands characteristic of the formation of the M-O and m – O(CO) linkage present . the polymers largely exist in a bridging geometry of the carbonyl groups about the metal atom . nuclear magnetic resonance shows the presence of bands derived from both reactants . matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization mass spectroscopy shows ion fragments to three units for the polymers with isotopic abundance characteristic of the presence of metal atoms in the ion fragment clusters . all the polymers exhibit good ability to inhibit all the tested cancer cell lines but the zironocene and hafnocene polymers exhibit especially good inhibition of the tested cancer cell lines that included two pancreatic cancer cell lines . they represent a potential new group of anticancer drugs . 
four b-ketoimine ligands ( two series ) were prepared through traditional condensation reactions of b-diketones with 2,6-substituted anilines . reaction took place only at the cyclohexanone carbonyl rather than at the acetyl or benzoyl carbonyl , even if more than two equivalents of the amines were added . consequently , four new moisture- and air - stable bis(b- ketoamino)nickel(II) complexes , Ni[2-CH3C(O)C6H <nUm> ( = NAr)]2 ( Ar = <nUm> , 6-iPr2C6H <nUm> , ( 1 ) ; Ar = <nUm> , 6-Me2C6H3 , ( 2 ) and Ni[2-PhC(O)C6H8( = NAr)]2 ( Ar = <nUm> , 6-iPr 2C6H3 , ( 3 ) ; Ar = <nUm> , 6-Me2C 6H3 , ( 4 ) were obtained and characterized . the solid - state structures of complex <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . additionally , these complexes can be applied as highly active catalyst precursors for vinyl polymerization of norbornene ( NBE ) after activation with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . 
A copper complex with b-ketoamine ligand based on a pyrazolone derivative was synthesized by condensing pyrazolone with 3-methylaniline and then reacting the produced b-ketoamine with copper halide . the solid - state structure of the complex was determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . the bis(b-ketoamine) copper complex shows moderate activity to catalyze the vinyl polymerization of norbornene with activation of methylaluminoxane under mild reaction conditions . the activity of the catalyst for norbornene polymerization is as high as <nUm> × <nUm> g polymer / mol Cu h . the polymer yield and catalytic activity can be controlled over a wide range by the variation of reaction parameters . 
based on the reaction of bis(e5-methylcyclopentadienyl) dichlorotitanium(Cp'2TiCl2 , cp' = e5-C5H4Me ) with 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid ( HNA-1 ) and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid ( HNA-2 ) , in the presence of b-cyclodextrin polymer ( b-CDP ) as a catalyst , two titanocene complexes : bis(e5-methylcyclopentadienyl) 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoatotitanium ( 1 ) and bis(e5-methylcyclopentadienyl) 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoatotitanium ( 2 ) , were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis , IR and 1H NMR spectra . x-ray diffraction analysis of <nUm> and <nUm> show mononuclear ITiV and indicate that the geometries at titanium are distorted tetrahedra with coordination number four . both complexes exhibit 3-D frameworks constructed through H - bonding and C-H ... π interactions . there are no p-p stacking interactions between the naphthyl rings and cyclopentadienyl rings of <nUm> , while there are three types of p-p interactions in the structure of <nUm> , owing to their different hydroxyl position in naphthalene rings . 
two binuclear oxo-bridged half - titanocene complexes , -oxo-bis[(1-aryl-2,3 , 4,5-tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)dichlorotitanium ] [ ( ArMe4CpTiCl 2)2O , Ar = 4-iPrC6H4 ( 3 ) , 4-tBuC6H4 ( 4 ) ] , have been prepared by the treatment of 1-aryl-2,3,4,5-tetramethylcyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride [ ArMe4CpTiCl3 , Ar = 4-iPrC6H <nUm> ( 1 ) , 4-tBuC6H4 ( 2 ) ] with <nUm> equiv of H 2O . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> have been characterized by elemental analysis and 1H- and 13C - NMR ( nuclear magnetic resonance ; NMR ) spectroscopies , and their molecular structures have been determined by x-ray crystallography . when activated with iBu3Al and ph 3CB(C6F5)4 , complexes <nUm> and <nUm> both exhibit reasonable catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization ( <nUm> × <nUm> to <nUm> × <nUm> kg PE ( mol ti)-1 bar-1 h-1 ) , producing polyethylenes with moderate molecular weight .

the selective transport of various metal ions through a novel polymer inclusion membrane ( PIM ) doped with b-diketone derivatives ( acetylacetone ( 1 ) , 3-propyl-acetylacetone ( 2 ) , and 3-benzyl-acetylacetone ( 3 ) ) was investigated . initial fluxes of metal ions transport across PIMs decrease in the following sequence : Zn (II) > Cu (II) > Co (II) > Ni (II) . results show that zinc (II) can be effectively separated by studied PIMs from equimolar aqueous solutions of copper , zinc , cobalt , and nickel nitrates . At pH <nUm> and after <nUm> hours <nUm> – <nUm> % of Zn (II) was recovered . it was found that membranes containing <nUm> and <nUm> separate zinc better than PIM with <nUm> . prepared PIMs were characterized using AFM and thermal analysis techniques . 
the results of an experimental program conducted on latex - modified mortars are presented in this article . these mortars have become of growing interest in the field of construction . they were used as superplasticizers , or water reducers , for finishing work applications and for repairs , coatings , and waterproofing . this study is about using two polymers ( latex ) , i.e. styrene – butadiene rubber and styrene – acrylic , in order to assess their performance in replacing cement in mortars . A series of mortar mixtures , containing <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> % of solid polymer latex ( by weight ) , were prepared and tested in the fresh and hardened states . the test parameters include the fluidity , compressive and flexural strengths , porosity accessible to water , adhesion to clay bricks , and cementitious substrates . the experimental results showed that substituting cement into modified mortars improves their fluidity and adhesion . In the case of clay substrates , a cohesive failure occurs within the substrate layer beyond <nUm> % of substitution , while the rupture takes place at the interface for all formulations tested on cementitious substrates . it was also noted that the flexural tensile strength improved beyond <nUm> days . however , the compressive strength of polymer mortars decreased with the substitution rate of cement , for all maturities considered . however , for porosity accessible to water , the results follow a linear function , with an inflection at <nUm> % of latex substitution . 
this account describes the development of a new type of polymerization catalysis termed ion - pairing polymerization ( IPP ) . IPP utilizes compatible and dually active transition - metal cation - main - group anion ion pairs in which both the cation and the anion can independently catalyze the polymer chain growth in a single polymerization reaction . furthermore , cations and anions of ion pairs can exhibit different stereoselectivity and growing chains at the cationic and anionic sites can undergo infrequent exchange between the two sites , thereby covalently linking the polymer chains produced at both sites to afford functionalized vinyl polymers with unique stereomultiblock microstructures .

the immobilization of the dinuclear platinum (II) sulfido complex [ Pt 2(m-S)2 (PPh3)4 ] on solid supports has been investigated . reaction with haloalkyl functionalized polymers [ merrifield 's resin ( chloromethylated polystyrene ) , chloropropyl silica , chloropropyl controlled pore glass , and bromopropyl polysiloxane ] gives complexes immobilized through alkylation of one of the sulfide ligands , forming a m-thiolate ligand acting as an anchor to the polymer support , akin to well - established reactions of [ Pt2(m-S)2(PPh 3)4 ] with molecular alkylating agents . the model complex [ Pt2(m-S)(m-SCH2SiMe3)(PPh 3)4]PF6 was prepared as the first molecular silicon - containing derivative of [ Pt2(m-S)2(PPh 3)4 ] and was fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy , electrospray ionization - mass spectrometry , and single - crystal x-ray diffraction . immobilization of [ Pt2(m-S)2(PPh3) <nUm> ] by phosphine exchange reactions was also achieved using commercial polystyrene - grafted triphenylphosphine or a new immobilized phosphine [ derived by sequential functionalization of merrifield 's resin with a polyether amine and then Ph2PCH2OH ] . 
the solution polymerization of ethylene using a binary metallocene system ( BMS ) , [C5Me4(SiMe2NtBu)]TiMe2 ( CGC-Ti ) / zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) / tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron ( TPFPB ) / modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) , has been carried out in a high - temperature , high - pressure continuous stirred - tank reactor ( CSTR ) at <nUm> ° C , <nUm> psig and with a mean residence time of <nUm> minutes . A series of BMS with different catalyst and cocatalyst incorporation were used . the utilization of Cp2ZrCl2 and MMAO in the BMS reduced the activity greatly , and the effect of MMAO was more severe . formation of long chain branches decreased even though more macromonomer was produced . polyethylenes with higher molecular weight and broader molecular weight distribution were synthesized using the binary systems than those produced using the CGC-Ti catalyst alone . the overall rate constants of ethylene propagation , long chain branching , ethylene macromonomer formation via chain transfer to monomer and b-hydride elimination , and chain transfer to hydrogen were estimated . 
this work concentrates on using the gas - phase polymerization technique for the production of highly loaded nanocomposites . filler loading levels near the vicinity of <nUm> wt % have been obtained using different nanofillers . three different in situ polypropylene ( PP ) nanocomposites , i.e. , Cloisite-20A filled polypropylene ( CFPP ) , kaolin filled polypropylene ( KFPP ) and nanosilica filled polypropylene ( SFPP ) have been prepared by gas - phase polymerization . the catalyst used is Nanosilica-Supported-Zirconocene . the fillers used are Closite-20A , kaolin and nanosilica , respectively . these were pre-treated with MAO ( methylaluminoxane ) to inhibit their deactivating action on the catalyst because of the presence of either acidic or basic groups on their surfaces ; in this way MAO acts as a co-catalyst for the three polymerization reactions being discussed . significantly higher molecular weight polypropylene was formed with nanosilica as the filler . the melting temperature and enthalpy is also observed to be comparatively higher in this case . however , in the case of other fillers , the molecular weights , as well as melting points , are comparatively lower . with the catalyst used , a mixture of crystalline and amorphous polypropylene was observed to form . comparatively lesser amounts of crystalline polypropylene are also observed . 
herein is described the development of a three - component photoinitiator system that employs the free radical promoted decomposition of diaryliodonium salts for the visible light induced cationic polymerization of epoxides . A long wavelength , titanium - complex free radical photoinitiator is used to generate radicals that abstract hydrogen atoms from benzyl alcohol synergists . the resulting benzyl radical species efficiently reduce diaryliodonium salts thereby generating oxycarbenium ions that spontaneously fragment to form the corresponding aldehyde and a brnsted superacid . the superacid subsequently initiates the cationic ring - opening polymerization of a wide variety of epoxide monomers . 
the reactivity ratios were estimated using the finemann - ross and the kelen - tudos graphical methods . structural parameters of the copolymers were obtained by calculating the dyad sequence fractions , which were derived using the monomer reactivity ratios . the kinetics of the thermal decomposition of the copolymers was studied by thermogravimetric analysis , TGA , in the frame of the Ozawa-Flynn-Wall and kissinger methods . the self - assembly behavior was also studied in aqueous solutions by dynamic light scattering measurements . 
the cationic polymerization of ethyl , n-butyl and iso-butyl vinyl ether , EVE , BVE and iBVE , respectively , was efficiently conducted using bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)dimethyl hafnium , Cp2HfMe2 , or bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)dimethyl zirconium , Cp2ZrMe2 in combination with either tris(pentafluorophenyl)borate , BC18F15 , or tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate dimethylanilinum salt , [B(C6F5)4]-[Me2NHPh]+ , as initiation systems . the evolution of polymer yield , molecular weight and molecular weight distribution with time was examined . In addition , the influence of the initiating system , the monomer and the reaction conditions on the control of the polymerization was studied . furthermore , statistical copolymers of EVE with BVE were prepared employing Cp2HfMe2 and [B(C6F5)4]-[Me2NHPh]+ as the initiation system . the reactivity ratios were estimated using both linear graphical and non-linear methods . structural parameters of the copolymers were obtained by calculating the dyad sequence fractions and the mean sequence length , which were derived using the monomer reactivity ratios . the glass transition temperatures , tg , of the copolymers were measured by differential scanning calorimetry , DSC , and the results were compared with predictions based on several theoretical models . the kinetics of thermal decomposition of the copolymers along with the respective homopolymers was studied by thermogravimetric analysis within the framework of the Ozawa-Flynn-Wall and kissinger methodologies . 
polymers derived from reacting group IVB metallocene dihalides and the matrix alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid act as their own matrix agent when performing MALDI MS. ion fragments containing two repeat units and greater are formed . the results are similar to those obtained employing graphite as the matrix material . the advantage of employing graphite as a comparative standard is that non-interfering ion fragment clusters are not produced by graphite . this is the second report of the inclusion of alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid into a condensation polymer and the use of the polymer itself as a matrix material indicating that this approach can be successfully applied to other systems . the addition of graphite as a matrix material allows the mass range to increase for the reflective mode . 
poly(ether esters ) are rapidly synthesized in moderate yield employing the interfacial polycondensation reaction system from the reaction of alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and group IVB metallocenes . the products are high polymers . infrared spectroscopy shows the formation of new bands derived from the M-O and M-O(CO) linkages . it also shows that the products exist as alternating M-O and M-O(CO) linkages . the products show outstanding inhibition of a variety of cancer cell lines including two pancreatic cancer cell lines . EC <nUm> values for the polymers are in the nanogram / mL range . the ability to inhibit the cancer cell lines is generally Hf > Zr > Ti . thus , future synthesis and testing might consider using compounds containing hafnocene and zirconocene in addition to the titanocene moiety . 
ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers produced with MAO - activated binary metallocene catalysts , such as combinations Cp2ZrCl2 + (Me5Cp)2ZrCl2 , (Ind-H4)2ZrCl2 + (Me5Cp)2ZrCl2 , Cp2ZrCl2 + Cp2TiCl2 , etc. , contain three types of components . two of the components can be attributed to active centers derived from each individual metallocene complex , and one or two materials are produced with different types of active center . some of the binary catalysts generate the three components in comparable proportions , whereas other catalysts produce copolymers with one dominant component , which does not resemble the copolymers produced with the individual complexes . A mechanism is proposed for the formation of the “ new ” copolymer materials . 
A binuclear titanium complex LaTi2 with methylene-bridged salicylaldiminato tridentate [ONS] ligand bearing octylthio sidearm was synthesized and used for the copolymerization of ethylene and norbornene ( E-NB ) . the complex exhibited activity over <nUm> g / mol(Ti ). h.atm and high degree incorporation of co-monomer ( up to <nUm> mol % ) , affording high-molecular-weight copolymers with narrow molecular weight distribution . the E-NB copolymers produced by LaTi2 / MMAO contained NN dyad and NNN triad sequences even at low norbornene feeds , in contrast to the observation of such sequences only at high level of NB incorporation for most other catalyst systems . the monomer reactivity ratios were calculated to be rE = <nUm> and rN = <nUm> , of which the rN value was much larger than that from non-metallocene titanium catalyst systems . the catalytic performances of the binuclear complex LaTi2 and its mononuclear analogue TiLb were also compared , with the binuclear complex exhibiting higher catalytic activity and NB incorporation ratio due to the binuclear cooperative effect , and producing much higher molecular weight copolymer due to the increased steric hindrance caused by close proximity of two growing chains . to the best of our knowledge , this is one of the few examples of binuclear catalyst for E-NB copolymerization with high activity and efficient incorporation of norbornene . 
homogeneous catalyst system , Cp2MCl2 / Et3Al + R3SiCl ( cp = e5 = CH , m = TI , ZR ; r = me , ph ) , polymerizes ethylene in toluene medium . the activity of such catalyst systems are governed by the factors like nature of metallocene dichloride , chlorosilane , and polymerization parameters such as Al / m , Si / Al molar ratios and temperature . it is observed that zirconocene dichloride system shows higher polymerization efficiency as compared to titanium analogues . furthermore , the use of trimethylchlorosilarn in combination with triethylaluminum ( TEAL ) as cocatalyst yields more polymer in comparison to triphenylchlorosilane and TEAI system . 
linear a-olefins from propene to 1-eicosene have been polymerized using a zirconocene catalyst and a hafnocene catalyst . the resulting isotactic polymers were characterized by NMR , GPC and DSC analysis . compared to the zirconocene products the molecular weights of the poly-a - olefins made with the hafnocene catalyst were higher . the molecular weight distribution was found to be narrow as expected for metallocene polymers . DSC measurements showed that side chain crystallization occurs for the polymers from poly-1-decene to poly-1-eicosene . 
three chiral coordination polymers have been prepared by reaction of (S)-(-)-nicotine with silver (I) salts . X-Ray crystal structure determinations revealed that these all contain polymer chains in which the nicotine molecule acts as a bridging ligand between four - coordinate silver atoms . In one case additional bridging by nitrate anions leads to a three - dimensional network structure .

here progress in the development of the catalytic addition polymerization and copolymerization of norbornene by various transition - metal complexes is described . A full literature account is given in this review mostly covering the years of <nUm> to the early of <nUm> . the interest in vinyl homo-polynorbornene is driven by its dielectric and mechanical properties for the technical application as an interlevel dielectric in microelectronics applications . for comparison , the norbornene / olefin copolymerization is also considered . the metal catalysts of Ti , Cr , Zr , V , Fe , Co , Ni , Pd and Cu are introduced and methylalumoxane ( MAO ) or perfluorinated borane , e.g. BC18F15 , cocatalysts are presented in terms of their activity and ligand effects are emphasized . 
the copolymerization mainly of ethylene and propylene with various polar functional comonomers , using various metallocenes and the methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) cocatalyst , has been primarily reviewed from the perspective of the following two subjects . one is the influence of the various functional groups on the copolymerization reactions , and the properties of the resulting products ; the other is the areas of future research . the functional groups have been classified into oxygen- , nitrogen- , and halogen - containing moieties ; borane - containing - olefins ; silanes ; dienes ; cyclic olefins ; as well as styrene and its various derivatives . the following areassynthesis of easily soluble functional cooligomer / copolymer ; products with uniform distribution of the comonomer ; establishment of relation among the catalyst structure and the various steps of copolymerization ( initiation , propagation , and chain termination ) ; the degradation and stabilization study of the functional copolymers and the correlation of the same with the catalyst structure ; the application of supported metallocenes to synthesize the resulting polymer ; the minimization of multi-step synthesis ; and the development MAO cocatalyst formulation ( to improve the activity and comonomer incorporation)have been identified to be the subjects of future research , which will be of special importance to the researchers working in functional polyolefins . 
copolymerization of ethylene and propylene was carried out in the presence of racethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 ) with O2Si as the support for the catalyst . the effect of trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) was investigated using two methods of providing a supported system . the resultant data were analyzed in detail . 
the AIEt3 - promoted tandem reductive rearrangement reactions of epoxides was studied at B3LYP / 6-31G(d,p) level . for the model compound a-hydroxy epoxides , two possible reaction pathways I and II were calculated . the main difference is the order of ethylene release and six- to five - member ring rearrangement . the ring contraction rearrangement in pathway I is the first step and this step is the rate controlling step with a free energy barrier of <nUm> kJ / mol . for pathway II , the ethylene release occurs first , and is followed by a six - member ring opening reaction which is the rate controlling step , and the barrier is <nUm> kJ / mol . the reason for such high barrier is that the ethylene release results in the following reaction being more difficult . the results show that pathway I ( C-C rearrangement and then ethylene release ) is more favorable , which is consistent with experimental results . 
the anticancer activity of synthetic organogermanium , b- or bis-carboxyethylgermanium sesquioxide ( Ge - <nUm> ) , has been demonstrated in several cancer cell models and human studies . Ge - <nUm> increases pro-inflammatory responses by enhancing interferon-g ( IFN-g ) , natural killer cell and t-cell activity , and is significantly less toxic than other widely used metal - based anticancer drugs such as cisplatin . In this small - scale laboratory study , we effectively assessed the physicochemical characteristics and purity of Ge - <nUm> , our main objective being to develop a novel oral anticancer formulation , using conventional tabletting excipients which do not alter the chemistry of Ge - <nUm> . we determined that solid Ge - <nUm> decomposes at <nUm> ° C ; is virtually insoluble in most common organic solvents ; and readily dissolves in water ( saturation solubility ≈ <nUm> g / <nUm> ml ) to form germane triol ( pH <nUm> - <nUm> ) . 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed the structure of our compound showing two identical proton environments at <nUm> and <nUm> ppm ( triplets ) and three distinct carbon environments at <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> ppm . the mass spectrum indicated the formation of numerous complex ion fragments with masses ranging from m / z <nUm> to m / z <nUm> . FT - infrared and FT - raman spectra showed characteristic sesquioxide peaks at <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> cm-1 and , most importantly , confirmed the absence of toxic , inorganic GeO2 , at <nUm> cm <nUm> . while parenteral formulations exist for many anticancer medicines , here we successfully developed uncoated tablets containing Ge - <nUm> ( <nUm> % w / w ) by manual direct compression ( powder particle size ≤ <nUm> mm ) . the tablets passed british pharmacopoeia ( BP ) content uniformity testing ( ultraviolet - visible , <nUm> nm ) , and BP disintegration testing in both acidic and basic media , disintegrating between <nUm> min <nUm> s and <nUm> min <nUm> s , respectively . we prepared gastro-resistant formulations using eudragit ® ; however , these failed content uniformity tests and had lower disintegration times ( ≤ <nUm> min <nUm> s ) , indicating that compatibility of polymers with Ge - <nUm> requires further investigation . the results presented here support further larger - scale research on Ge - <nUm> as a novel metal - based oral anticancer drug which can be conveniently administered alone or included within a chemotherapy regimen . future formulation studies on Ge - <nUm> could focus on compatibility assessments with nano-formulations in keeping with current advancements in metal - based anticancer therapies . published by oxford university press . 
OBJECTIVESArterial graft spasm occasionally causes circulatory collapse immediately following coronary artery bypass graft . the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of our developed materials , which were composed of milrinone ( phosphodiesterase III inhibitor ) or diltiazem ( calcium - channel blocker ) , with nano-scaled fibre made of biodegradable polymer to prevent arterial spasm.METHODSMilrinone- or diltiazem - releasing biodegradable nano-scaled fibres were fabricated by an electrospinning procedure . In vivo milrinone- or diltiazem - releasing tests were performed to confirm the sustained release of the drugs . an in vivo arterial spasm model was established by subcutaneous injection of noradrenalin around the rat femoral artery . rats were randomly divided into four groups as follows : those that received <nUm> mg of milrinone - releasing biodegradable nano-scaled fibre ( group m , n = <nUm> ) ; <nUm> mg of diltiazem - releasing biodegradable nano-scaled fibre ( group d , n = <nUm> ) ; or those that received fibre without drugs ( as a control ; group C , n = <nUm> ) implanted into the rat femoral artery . In the fourth group , sham operation was performed ( group S , n = <nUm> ) . one day after the implantation , noradrenalin was injected in all groups . the femoral arterial blood flow was measured continuously before and after noradrenalin injection . the maximum blood flow before noradrenalin injection and minimum blood flow after noradrenalin injection were measured.RESULTSIn vivo drug - releasing test revealed that milrinone - releasing biodegradable nano-scaled fibre released <nUm> % of milrinone and diltiazem - releasing biodegradable nano-scaled fibre released <nUm> % diltiazem on the first day . the ratios of rat femoral artery blood flow after / before noradrenalin injection in groups m ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) and d ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) were significantly higher than those of groups C ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) and S ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) ( P < <nUm> ). CONCLUSIONNoradrenalin - induced rat femoral artery spasm was inhibited by the implantation of milrinone - releasing biodegradable nano-scaled fibre or diltiazem - releasing biodegradable nano-scaled fibre . these results suggested that our materials might be effective for the prevention of arterial graft spasm after coronary artery bypass graft . published by oxford university press on behalf of the european association for Cardio-Thoracic surgery . 
In this contribution , olefin block copolymers were produced via chain shuttling polymerization ( CSP ) , using a new combination of catalysts and a chain shuttling agent ( CSA ) diethylzinc ( ZnEt <nUm> ). the binary catalyst system included nonbridged halftitanocene catalyst , cp ∗ ClTi <nUm> ( O-2,6- i Pr <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> ) ( cat A ) and bis(phenoxy-imine) zirconium , η <nUm> -1-[C(H) = NC <nUm> H <nUm> ]-2-O-3-tBu- C <nUm> H <nUm> g <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( cat B ) , as well as co-catalyst methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . In contrast to dual - catalyst system in the absence of CSA , the blocky structure was obtained in the presence of CSA and rationalized from rheological studies . the binary catalyst system could cause the CSP reaction to occur in the presence of CSA ZnEt <nUm> , which yielded broad distribution ethylene / 1-octene copolymers ( mw / Mn : <nUm> ) containing block polymer chains with high mw . the presented dual - catalytic system was applied for the first time in CSP and has a potential to be extended to produce a library of olefin block copolymers that can be used as advanced additives for thermoplastics .

In the crystal structure of the title compound , [ Zr(C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > )(C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ](C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > HB < inf > <nUm> < / inf > F < inf > <nUm> < / inf > O ) , the [ Zr(C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ( (t-Bu)-C = C(H) - C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ( t-Bu ) ) ] < sup > + < / sup > cation displays a buta-1-en-3-yne ligand side-on coordinated to a typical bent zirconocene [ centroid(cp)-Zr - centroid(cp) = <nUm> ° , Zr - c(buta-1-en-3-yne) = <nUm> ( 3 ) , <nUm> ( 3 ) and <nUm> ( 2 ) Å ] .

preceramic polymers were proposed over <nUm> years ago as precursors for the fabrication of mainly Si - based advanced ceramics , generally denoted as polymer - derived ceramics ( PDCs ) . the polymer to ceramic transformation process enabled significant technological breakthroughs in ceramic science and technology , such as the development of ceramic fibers , coatings , or ceramics stable at ultrahigh temperatures ( up to <nUm> ° C ) with respect to decomposition , crystallization , phase separation , and creep . In recent years , several important advances have been achieved such as the discovery of a variety of functional properties associated with PDCs . moreover , novel insights into their structure at the nanoscale level have contributed to the fundamental understanding of the various useful and unique features of PDCs related to their high chemical durability or high creep resistance or semiconducting behavior . from the processing point of view , preceramic polymers have been used as reactive binders to produce technical ceramics , they have been manipulated to allow for the formation of ordered pores in the meso-range , they have been tested for joining advanced ceramic components , and have been processed into bulk or macroporous components . consequently , possible fields of applications of PDCs have been extended significantly by the recent research and development activities . several key engineering fields suitable for application of PDCs include high - temperature - resistant materials ( energy materials , automotive , aerospace , etc. ) , hard materials , chemical engineering ( catalyst support , food- and biotechnology , etc. ) , or functional materials in electrical engineering as well as in micronanoelectronics . the science and technological development of PDCs are highly interdisciplinary , at the forefront of micro- and nanoscience and technology , with expertise provided by chemists , physicists , mineralogists , and materials scientists , and engineers . moreover , several specialized industries have already commercialized components based on PDCs , and the production and availability of the precursors used has dramatically increased over the past few years . In this feature article , we highlight the following scientific issues related to advanced PDCs research : ( 1 ) general synthesis procedures to produce silicon - based preceramic polymers . ( 2 ) special microstructural features of PDCs . ( 3 ) unusual materials properties of PDCs , that are related to their unique nanosized microstructure that makes preceramic polymers of great and topical interest to researchers across a wide spectrum of disciplines . ( 4 ) processing strategies to fabricate ceramic components from preceramic polymers . ( 5 ) discussion and presentation of several examples of possible real - life applications that take advantage of the special characteristics of preceramic polymers . note : In the past , a wide range of specialized international symposia have been devoted to PDCs , in particular organized by the american ceramic society , the european materials society , and the materials research society . most of the reviews available on PDCs are either not up to date or deal with only a subset of preceramic polymers and ceramics ( e.g. , silazanes to produce CNSi - based ceramics ) . thus , this review is focused on a large number of novel data and developments , and contains materials from the literature but also from sources that are not widely available . 
we review our experimental investigations of photopolymerizable nanoparticle - polymer composites ( CsNP ) for holography and diffractive optics . various types of hyperbranched polymer ( HBP ) were systhesized and used as transporting organic nanoparticles . these HBPs include hyperbranched poly(ethyl methacrylate ) ( HPEMA ) , hyperbranched polystyrene ( HPS ) and hyperbranched triazine / aromatic polymer units ( HTA ) whose refractive indices are <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . each HBP was dispersed in (meth)acrylate monomer whose refractive index was so chosen that a refractive index difference between HBP and the formed polymer was large . such monomer - HBP syrup was mixed with a titanocene photoinitiator for volume holographic recording in the green . we used a two - beam interference setup to write an unslanted transmission volume grating at grating spacing of <nUm> mm and at a wavelength of <nUm> nm . it is shown that NPC volume gratings with the saturated refractive index modulation amplitudes as large as <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> can be recorded in CsNP incorporated with HPEMA , HPS and HTA at their optimum concentrations of <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> vol. % , respectively . we show the usefulness of HBP - dispersed NPC volume gratings for holographic applications such as holographic data storage and diffractive optical devices . 
In the dense gel that is the intracellular matrix forming part of living cells electrochemical reactions take place provoking the interchange of ions and water with the surroundings . systems containing conducting polymers mimic this feature of biological organs . In particular , conducting polymers are being studied as dual sensing - actuating reactive materials giving new multifunctional sensing - actuators , which allow the construction and theoretical description of artificial proprioceptive devices . here films of polypyrrole / dodecyl benzene sulfonate ( PPy - DBS ) coating a platinum electrode were submitted to potential sweeps at different sweep rates in order to explore if the polymer reaction senses the working electrochemical conditions . the effective consumed electrical energy per cycle follows a fast decrease when the scan rate increases described by the addition of two exponential sensing functions . moreover , the variation of the hysteresis from the parallel charge / potential loop with the scan rate is also described by the addition of two exponential functions . In both cases the exponential functions fitting results at low scan rates are related to reaction - driven conformational movements of the polymer chains , being closer to biochemical conformational and allosteric sensors . the second exponential functions fitting results at high scan rates are related to diffusion kinetic control , being closer to present electrochemical sensors . 
multifunctional acrylate formulations containing nematic liquid crystals have been shown to form holographic polymer dispersed liquid crystal gratings ( H-PDLCs ) easily using ultra-violet AND / OR visible photoinitiators . laser wavelengths of <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> nm have been used for the fabrication of the gratings . recently , the use of a thiol - ene based monomer system has been shown to overcome some of the adverse effects like post polymerization , voltage creep , and non-uniform shrinkage incurred when using highly functional acrylate monomers . however , bragg reflection gratings have only been demonstrated utilizing ultra-violet ( UV ) ( <nUm> nm argon ion ) photopolymerization . using UV irradiation and single prism geometry limits the upper end of the reflection notch wavelength . In this work , we report on new visible photoinitiator systems developed for the formation of reflective H-PDLCs using thiol - ene monomers . using these new photoinitiator systems , reflection notches have been routinely written from the visible to the near infrared ( IR ) regions . the visible photoinitiator systems included the photoinitiator and radical generator titanocene organo-metallic complex ( commercially known as irgacure <nUm> ( ciba - geigy ) , rhodamine 6G , pyrromethene , and a radical generating organic peroxide as coinitiator . reflection gratings were written using laser wavelengths <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> nm with diffraction efficiencies ( DE 's ) above <nUm> % . angle tuning allowed for gratings with reflection notches in the near IR ( 900-1500 nm ) to be written using these initiator systems . rhodamine 6G was found to be more efficient than the other two initiators . we discuss here this new chemistry , the morphology , and electro-optical properties of the reflection gratings . 
photopolymers are promising as holographic recording media as they are inexpensive , versatile materials , which can be made sensitive to a broad range of wavelengths . A deeper understanding of the processes , which occur during holographic grating formation in photopolymers , is necessary in order to develop a fully comprehensive model , which represents their behaviour . one of these processes is photo - initiation , whereby a photon is absorbed by a photosensitiser producing free radicals , which can initiate free radical polymerisation . these free radicals can also participate in polymer chain termination ( primary termination ) and it is therefore necessary to understand their generation in order to predict the temporally varying kinetic effects present during holographic grating formation . In this paper , a study of the photoinitiation mechanisms of irgacure <nUm> dye , in an epoxy resin matrix , is carried out . this is achieved by analysing the temporal evolution of a series of simultaneously captured experimental transmittance curves , captured at different wavelengths , but at the same location , to enable the change in photon absorption during exposure to be estimated . we report on the experimental results and present a theoretical model to predict the physically observed behaviour . 
crystalline nanofibers of linear polyethylene with an ultrahigh molecular weight ( 6,200,000 ) and a diameter of <nUm> to <nUm> nanometers were formed by the polymerization of ethylene with mesoporous silica fiber- supported titanocene , with methylalumoxane as a cocatalyst . small - angle x-ray scattering analysis indicated that the polyethylene fibers consist predominantly of extended - chain crystals . this observation indicates a potential utility of the honeycomb - like porous framework as an extruder for nanofabrication of polymeric materials.Crystalline nanofibers of linear polyethylene with an ultrahigh molecular weight ( 6,200,000 ) and a diameter of <nUm> to <nUm> nanometers were formed by the polymerization of ethylene with mesoporous silica fiber - supported titanocene , with methylalumoxane as a cocatalyst . small - angle x-ray scattering analysis indicated that the polyethylene fibers consist predominantly of extended - chain crystals . this observation indicates a potential utility of the honeycomb - like porous framework as an extruder for nanofabrication of polymeric materials . 
triphenylmethyl salts of the very weakly - coordinating borate anions [CN{B(C6F5)3}2]- ( 1 ) , [H2N{(C6F5)3}2] - and [ M{CNB(C6F5)3} 4]2- ( m = Ni , Pd ) have been prepared in simple one - pot reactions . mixtures of (SBI)ZrMe2 / <nUm> / AlBu <nUm> i ( SBI = rac-Me2Si(Ind)2 ) are 30-40 times more active in ethylene polymerizations at 60-100 ° C than BCl2ISZr / MAO . the quantification of anion effects on propene polymerization activity at <nUm> ° C gives the order [CN{B(C6F5)3}2] - > [ H2N{(C6F5)3} 2]- ≈ BC6F5 <nUm> - ≫ [MeB(C6F5)3]- . the highest productivities were of the order of ca. <nUm> × <nUm> g PP ( mol zr)-1 h-1 [C3H6]-1 , about <nUm> - <nUm> times higher than with BC6F5 <nUm> - as the counter anion . the titanium system CGCTiMe <nUm> / <nUm> / AlBu <nUm> i gave activities that were very similar to the zirconocene catalyst . the concentration of active species [C*] as determined by quenched - flow kinetic techniques indicates typical values of around <nUm> % , independent of the counter anion , for both the borate and MAO systems . pulsed field - gradient spin echo and nuclear overhauser effect NMR experiments on systems designed to be more realistic models for active species with longer polymeryl chains , (SBI)M(CH2SiMe3)(m-Me) BC18F15 and [ (SBI)MCH2SiMe <nUm> + ... BC6F5 <nUm> - ] ( m = Zr , Hf ) , demonstrated the influence of bulky alkyl chains on the ion pair solution structures : while the MeB(C6F 5)3 compound exists as a simple inner - sphere ion - pair , the BC6F5 <nUm> - compound is an outer - sphere ion pair ( OSIP ) , a consequence of the relegation of the anion into the second coordination sphere by the g-agostic interaction with the alkyl ligand . the OSIP aggregates to ion hextuples ( <nUm> mM ) or quadruples ( <nUm> mM ) . implications for the polymerization mechanism are discussed ; the process follows an associative interchange ( I a ) pathway . 
nowadays , the phillips CrOx / O2Si catalyst is still attracting interest from both industrial and academic fields owing to its unique characteristics for HDPE production . compared with other industrial catalysts for ethylene polymerization , the phillips catalyst can be activated by ethylene monomer , CO or Al - alkyl cocatalyst after a simple calcination process ( thermal activation ) . In this work , a brief review of our recent new understanding on various activation procedures , including thermal activation , monomer activation , and CO activation , on industrial phillips catalyst was presented . A new initiation mechanism , ethylene metathesis mechanism , was proposed according to some experimental evidence during the induction period when ethylene monomer was used to activate the catalyst . such an ethylene metathesis mechanism was also indirectly confirmed in CO-prereduced phillips catalyst . the formation of short chain branches in polymer can be rationalized well by this newly proposed unique mechanism during ethylene homo-and copolymerization with hexene-1 using CO-prereduced phillips catalyst in the presence of triethylaluminum cocatalyst . 
the structures of intermediates formed upon the activation by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) of a wide range of metallocene and post-metallocene catalysts of olefin polymerization were studied by 13C , 1H , and 19F NMR . for all metallocenes considered ( L 2ZrCl2 and L2TiCl2 ) , under conditions similar to real polymerization conditions ( Al / Zr > <nUm> ) , two types of intermediates were identified in the reaction solution , namely , heterodinuclear ion pairs [ L2 M(m-Me)2AlMe 2]+[Me-MAO]- ( III ) and zwitterionic intermediates L2 MMe+-Me-Al- ≡ MAO ( IV ( m = Zr , Ti ) . the relative concentration of III increases with an increase in the Al / Zr ratio . In the post-metallocene / MAO catalytic systems , the reaction solution can be dominated either by heterodinuclear pairs of type III ( bis(imino)pyridyl iron complexes ) or by zwitterionic intermediates of type IV ( half - titanocenes , complexes with restricted geometry ) . both species III and species IV catalyze olefin polymerization . both the species initiating polymerization , [ L2' TiMe(S)]+[Me-MAO]- , and the species responsible for chain growth , [ L [ L2' PTi ] +[Me-MAO]- ( P is the polymer chain , and S is a solvent molecule ) , were characterized in the bis(phenoxyimine) titanium complex / MAO system . 
ethylene and propylene polymerization on immobilized catalysts of composition MMT-H2O / AlR3 / Zr - cene ( MMT = montmorillonite ) and on the corresponding homogeneous catalysts of composition Zr-cene-MAO ( Zr - cene = rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 , rac-Me2Si(Ind) 2ZrCl2 , rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind) 2ZrCl2 , rac-1-(9-e5-Flu)2-(5,6-Cp2-Me-1- e5-Ind)Et]ZrCl2 ) is considered . here , the activating support for the zirconocenes is montmorillonite containing methylaluminoxane or isobutylaluminoxane synthesized directly on the monmorillonite surface by the partial hydrolysis of an alkylaluminum ( AlMe3 , Al(i-Bu)3 , Al(i-Bu)2H ) with the mobile water of the support ( MMT-H 2O / AlR3 ) . the MMT-H2O / AlR3 supports are demonstrated to be effective activators for ansa - zirconocenes . the catalytic properties of the immobilized systems ( process kinetics and efficiency , the molar mass of the resulting polymer , and the structure of the macromolecules ) depend on the activating support and the zirconocene precatalyst . the complexes of the MMT-H2O / Al(i-Bu)3 support with all zirconocene precatalysts are more active in propylene polymerization than the same complexes of MMT-H2O / AlMe3 . the zirconcenes immobilized on MMT-H2O / AlR3 afford polyethylene and polypropylene with a higher molar mass than the corresponding homogeneous systems . furthermore , immobilization causes activesite heterogeneity . As compared to the homogeneous single - site catalysts of composition Zr-cene-MAO , the corresponding catalysts immobilized on MMT-H2O / AlR3 / Zr - cene are more stereospecific in the case of rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl <nUm> ( C <nUm> symmetry ) and are less stereospecific in the case of rac-[1-(9-e5-Flu)2-(5,6-Cp-2-Me-1-e5-Ind)Et] Cl2Zr ( C s symmetry ) . 
the kinetics of methyl methacrylate polymerization in the presence of benzoyl peroxide + metallocene ( ferrocene , titanocene dichloride , and zirconocene dichloride ) initiating systems is considered , and the effects of the nature and amount of metallocene in the system are reported . the polymerization is assumed to be a complex - radical process . the structure of the complex - radical sites of chain propagation and a scheme of their formation are deduced from quantum - chemical calculations . 
A quantum - chemical study of the mechanism of ethylene oxide hydration on titanium oxide ( anatase ) modified with phosphorus additives was performed . it was demonstrated that the hydroxyl groups of the anatase surface are of importance for the activation interaction of ethylene oxide with the catalyst surface . the activation of the ethylene oxide molecule and proton transfer occur with the participation of these hydroxyl groups . it was found that the modification of the titanium oxide surface with phosphorus additives plays a crucial role in proton transfer . 
the article deals with applying NMR and EPR spectroscopy to the study of the active sites of catalysts in two important classes of reactions : enantioselective olefin epoxidation with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by iron aminopyridine complexes and olefin polymerization in the presence of titanium and vanadium post-metallocene catalysts . 
the effects of the structure of organomodified montmorillonite and the conditions of its catalytic activation by titanium and vanadium chlorides on the synthesis of nanocomposite materials based on ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene with an exfoliated structure by an in situ polymerization method were studied . it was shown that , with the use of organomodified montmorillonite with the interplanar spacing d001 = <nUm> – <nUm> nm , in which the alkyl radicals of a modifier are arranged in parallel to the basal silicate surfaces , the catalyst is adsorbed only on the external surface of particle , and it does not penetrate into the interlayer space ( in this case , the exfoliation of a filler does not occur ) . with the use of montmorillonite samples with d001 > <nUm> nm with the packing of a modifier as paraffin - like mono- or bilayers , the catalyst is predominantly intercalated into the interlayer space of the layer silicate . As a result , in the course of polymerization , polyethylene is formed in the interlayer space of particles to facilitate the exfoliation of the filler in separate nanolayers . conditions for the supporting of a catalyst onto organomodified montmorillonite , which prevent the transfer of the catalyst into solvent and the formation of a free polymer on the synthesis of nanocomposites under the conditions of suspension polymerization in n-heptane , were determined . the intercalation of a catalyst into the interlayer space of the particles of layered silicates and the exfoliation of filler particles in the course of the synthesis of composites were confirmed by x-ray diffraction analysis . 
the homopolymerization of vinyl chloride and its copolymerization with ethylene over dibutyl ether – modified O2Si - supported ziegler – natta catalysts based on titanium and vanadium chlorides have been studied . the supported metal complexes are sufficiently active in the polymerization of vinyl chloride . their activity depends on the catalyst composition and conditions of formation of the catalyst on the surface of the support . the chain structure of the resulting polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) has been studied by NMR spectroscopy . the thermal properties of the synthesized PVC have been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry . the PVC obtained possesses enhanced thermal stability owing to the specific features of its chain structure . vinyl chloride polymerization over the supported metalorganic catalyst proceeds mainly via a free - radical mechanism . process conditions have been found for conducting the copolymerization of vinyl chloride with ethylene over supported metal complexes resulting in the formation of true statistical copolymers , which is confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopy . 
polymerization of methyl methacrylate , initiated by benzoyl peroxide in the presence of titanocene dichloride , is considered from the point of view of formal kinetics . based on the kinetic scheme of the process ( which includes the reactions of classical radical polymerization , the reaction of benzoyl peroxide with titanocene dichloride , the reactions of the controlled radical polymerization of organometallic mediated radical polymerization ( OMRP ) and atom transfer radical polymerization ( ATRP ) , the reaction of the formation of a coordinating active site and the coordinating chain propagation on a mathematical model of the kinetics of the process is created . this model also makes it possible to calculate the molecular - mass characteristics of poly(methyl methacrylate ) . As a result of the solution of the inverse kinetic problem at a temperature of <nUm> K , the values of the reaction rate constants of the kinetic scheme are found under which the discrepancy between the calculated models and experimental data is minimal . using the developed model of the kinetics of the process , a numerical experiment is performed ( i.e. , a direct kinetic problem is solved ) . this problem revealed the following regularities of the process . ( 1 ) an increase in the initial concentration of titanocene dichloride at a constant initial concentration of benzoyl peroxide leads to an increase in the rate of consumption of benzoyl peroxide but not to an increase in the initial rate of the process compared to classical radical polymerization . ( 2 ) with an increase in the initial concentration of titanocene dichloride , the lifetime of the macroradicals at the initial stage of the process is reduced , and hence the molecular weight of the resulting polymethyl methacrylate is less than that of the polymethyl methacrylate obtained in the absence of titanocene dichloride , and it will increase during the process of approaching the final values . ( 3 ) during the polymerization of methyl methacrylate , initiated by benzoyl peroxide in the presence of titanocene dichloride , a smoothing gel effect ( as in the case of the polymerization of methyl methacrylate initiated by benzoyl peroxide in the presence of ferrocene ) does not occur since titanocene dichloride forms stable complexes with methyl methacrylate and , consequently , it participates in reactions consuming macroradicals to a lesser degree than ferrocene . 
A new zirconocene ansa-Me2Si-(2Me-4-p-Tol-cyclopenta[b]indol-3- yl)2ZrCl2 complex ( I ) , in which the cp ligand is fused with the indole ring , has been synthesized and studied by x-ray diffraction anal- ysis . light brown crystals are triclinic , space group P1 ; m = <nUm> , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , z = <nUm> , rcalc = <nUm> g / cm3 . the structural parameters of complex I are compared with the known bis-indenyl zirconium complexes : rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( II ) and rac-Me 2Si(2Me-2Ph-1-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( III ) and analogous substituted rac-Me2Si(2,5-Me2-3Ph-6-Cp[b]Tp) 2ZrCl2 ( IV ) and rac-Me2Si(2,5-Me 2-1Ph-4-Cp[b]Py)2ZrCl2 ( V ) . complex I alkylated by the grignard reagent ( MgMe2 ) in the presence of the Al-iso-Bu3 cocatalyst is an effi- cient catalyst for the polymerization of propylene into isotactic polypropylene . , <nUm> . 
density functional theory was used to study model ethylene reactions with CpTiIIIEt+A- ( A- = CH 3B(C6F5)3- , or B(C 6F5)4- ; A- can be absent ) compounds . the polymerization of ethylene on an isolated CpTiEt + cation is hindered because of equilibrium between the CpTi(C 2H4)Et+ primary complex and the primary product of CpTiBu+ insertion . At the same time , the polymerization of ethylene on CpTiEt+A- ion pairs ( A- = CH 3B(C6F5)3- or B(C 6F5)4- ) is thermodynamically allowed ( DE from <nUm> to <nUm> kcal / mol and DG298 from <nUm> to <nUm> kcal / mol ) and is not related to overcoming substantial energy barriers ( DE # = <nUm> - <nUm> kcal / mol and DG 298[?] ) = <nUm> - <nUm> kcal / mol ) . the degree of polymerization can be low because of the effective occurrence of polymer chain termination by hydrogen transfer from the polymer chain to the monomer . 
density functional theory was used to study gas - phase reactions between the Cp2*ZrMe+ cations , where cp* = C 5H5 ( 1 ) , Me5Cp = C5Me5 ( 2 ) , and flu = C13H9 ( 3 ) , and the ethylene molecule , Cp2*ZrMe+ + CH2 → Cp2*ZrPr+ → Cp2*ZrAllyl + + H . the reactivity of the cp2* ZrMe+ cations with respect to the ethylene molecule decreased in the series <nUm> > <nUm> ≈ <nUm> . substitution in the cp ring decreased the reactivity of the Cp2*ZrMe+ cations toward ethylene , in agreement with the experimental data on the comparative reactivities of complexes <nUm> and <nUm> . the two main energy barriers along the reaction path ( the formation of the C-C bond leading to the primary product Cp2*ZrPr+ and hydride shift leading to the secondary product Cp2*Zr(H 2)Allyl+ ) vary in opposite directions in the series of the compounds studied . for flu ( 3 ) , these barriers are close to each other , and for the other compounds , the formation of the C-C bond requires the overcoming of a higher energy barrier . A comparison of the results obtained with the data on the activity of zirconocene catalysts in real catalytic systems for the polymerization of ethylene led us to conclude that the properties of the catalytic center changed drastically in the passage from the model reaction in the gas phase to real catalytic systems .

the copolymerization of ethylene with propylene in the liquid propylene initiated by ansa - metallocenes of the C <nUm> symmetry , rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1- e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride and rac-[1-(9- e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1-e5- indenyl)ethane]hafnium dichloride , activated by methylaluminoxane has been studied . triisobutylaluminum has been used as a cocatalyst . the propylene-ethylene copolymers thus prepared contain 5-60 mol % ethylene units . the reactivity ratios have been measured . In the case of the zirconocene - based catalyst , the molecular mass of the copolymers decreases with an increase in the content of ethylene units . the reverse situation is observed in the case of the hafnocene - based catalytic system . the copolymers are characterized by the low T g values ( down to <nUm> ° C ) . incorporation of a small amount of ethylene units ( <nUm> mol % ) results in a rise in the elastomeric behavior of the polymers .

the free - radical polymerization of styrene and methyl methacrylate in the presence of dicyclopentadienyltitanium chloride and dicyclopentadienyltitanium dichloride has been studied . it has been shown that the process proceeds without autoacceleration up to high conversions and is characterized by a linear increase in molecular mass with conversion . on the basis of quantum chemical calculations and ESR spectroscopic data , a scheme describing the growth of polymer chains with participation of organotitanium compounds is proposed . 
the quantum - chemical model formerly designed is described , which explains the high reactivity of the d 0-transition metal-carbon s-bond in concerted reactions including polymerization of olefins . In this model , the energy of transition from the ground singlet state to the excited singlet or triplet state corresponding to the transfer of electron density from the metal-carbon bond to vacant d-atomic orbitals correlates with its relative elongation after which a change in the valence state of a metal begins . this change is caused by the difference in the geometries of valence s- , p- , and d-atomic orbitals having close energies ; as a result , at a certain bond elongation , partial uncoupling of electrons involved in bonding takes place so that one of them becomes localized on d-atomic orbital . this process facilitates formation of the reactive state of the bond of the biradical type and leads to a reduction in the energy barrier of the insertion of an olefin molecule into this bond . lower energies of this barrier correspond to lower values of DE(S <nUm> → S j ) and DE(S <nUm> → T j ). As shown at the example of zirconocenes cp 2ZrMe2 and Me2CCp2ZrMe2 , alongside with a reduction in the energy barrier of olefin insertion into the Zr-Me bond of the cationic complex being formed , the characteristic absorption band in the spectrum of the corresponding neutral derivative shifts to the long - wave region . this band is attributed to the transfer of the electron density from the Zr-Me bond to the Zr atom . analysis is performed of the causes for bathochromic shifts of the long - wave absorption band for adduct formation in the systems including metallocene and Al - containing cocatalyst . 
the compositional heterogeneity of ethylene-1-hexene copolymers synthesized with various types of supported catalysts , namely , the titanium - magnesium catalyst Cl4Ti / Cl2Mg and the zirconocene catalyst OSi 2(MAO) / Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 , is studied via the method of successive self-nucleation-annealing ( SSA ) with the use of differential scanning calorimetry . on the basis of the data on the temperatures of individual peaks on SSA curves , the thickness of lamellas composed of macromolecules with a certain degree of short - chain branching is estimated . the copolymer synthesized with the zirconocene catalyst has a narrower range of fusion and does not contain large lamellas composed of molecules with a low degree of short - chain branching . with the use of the broadness index , it is shown that the copolymer synthesized with the zirconocene catalyst has a more uniform distribution of the comonomer than does the copolymer synthesized with the titanium - magnesium catalyst . for the copolymers synthesized with the titanium - magnesium catalyst , the compositional heterogeneity increases with an increase in the content of 1-hexene .

Ti - HMS ( hexagonal mesoporous silica , HMS ) was vapor silylated at <nUm> – <nUm> ° C . the samples were characterized by si29 CP / MAS NMR , FTIR , TG , XRD , and N - adsorption , respectively , as well as evaluated by the continuous epoxidation of propylene with cumene hydroperoxide ( CHP ) as oxidant . there showed only a peak at <nUm> ppm assigned to (CH3)3Si*OSi(OSi)3 species in NMR spectra when silylated at low temperatures . the samples at higher temperatures ( > <nUm> ° C ) gave an additional peak at <nUm> ppm , which was assigned to novel titanium species of (CH3)3Si*OTi(OSi)3 . the intensity of peaks relevant to trimethyl groups increased with the silylation temperature at <nUm> – <nUm> ° C and decreased at <nUm> – <nUm> ° C due to decomposing of organic groups . the intensity reached the highest point at <nUm> ° C . the catalytic results showed that the propylene oxide yield also changed as the same trend and reached the longest life of <nUm> % PO yield at <nUm> ° C silylation . In conclusion , <nUm> ° C is an optimal silylation temperature . 
the effect exerted by organometallic iron complexes ( ferrocene , tricarbonyl cyclooctatetraene iron , and dimer cyclopentadienyldicarbonyl iron ) on the benzoyl peroxide initiated homo- and copolymerization of methyl methacrylate and n-butyl methacrylate was studied . the ligand surrounding in the organometallic complexes influences the shape of the kinetic curves of the methyl methacrylate and n-butyl methacrylate polymerization . In the presence of organometallic iron complexes , the copolymerization constants are close to unity . that is , the azeotropic copolymerization occurs , with the copolymer composition equal to the composition of the monomer mixture and with the random distribution of monomeric units in the copolymer chain . on the other hand , the presence of metallocenes influences the microstructure and molecular - mass characteristics of the copolymers . these changes are due to the formation of macromolecules with the participation of both free radicals and coordination - active polymerization sites formed in the presence of organometallic complexes . 
catalytic cyclometalation of disubstituted acetylenes and ethylene with ethylmagnesium halides EtMgHlg ( hlg = Cl , Br ) and diethylmagnesium et 2Mg in the presence of Cp2ZrCl2 gave tetrasubstituted magnesacyclopenta-2,4-dienes and disubstituted magnesacyclopent-2-enes . A probable scheme of formation of cyclic unsaturated organomagnesium compounds was proposed , according to which the reactive intermediates in the cyclometalation process are zirconacyclopentadienes and zirconacyclopentenes generated from Cp2ZrCl2 , EtMgHlg , Et2Mg , acetylenes , and ethylene .

polyvinylcarbazole layers containing ruthenium ( II ) tetra-15-crown-5- phthalocyanate axially coordinating ethylisonicotinate molecules are found to have photoelectric and photorefractive sensitivity at <nUm> nm . the effect is determined by the formation of supramolecular ensembles with the electronic optical absorption and photoelectric sensitivity in the near IR range up to <nUm> or <nUm> nm and nonlinear optical properties .

this paper describes in detail the electrochemical properties of potentiodynamically synthesized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy)thiophene ( PEDOTh ) modified by the entrapment of hexacyanoferrate anions ( C6FeN6 3- ) . cyclic voltammetric data clearly shows that during polymer redox conversion / immobilized anion reduction and re-oxidation , charge compensation occurs at the expenses of the insertion - deinsertion of appropriate cations from solution . In aqueous electrolyte mainly protons are involved whereas in organic media the process requires small highly mobile ions such as lithium . PEDOTh / Pt and PEDOTh / C6FeN6 3- / Pt have been used for the detection of ascorbic acid ( AA ) in mixed medium ( <nUm> m TBAPF6 in acetonitrile + <nUm> % H2O ) . compared to that of bare platinum electrode , the analyte oxidation peak potential occurs at significant less positive values at both modified electrodes , revealing their good electrocatalytic activity . for the polymer incorporating ferricyanide ion , the observed decrease in the AA oxidation onset potential along with the fading away of Fe(CN)63- reduction signal , supports a mechanism taking into account the mediator character of the embedded anion . 
protocols for obtaining defined zirconocene complexes with polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes with mono- , di- , and trisilanol functionality ( SIPOSS , DIPOSS , and TRIPOSS ) were established . the TRIPOSS silanolates binding one zirconocene and one chlorozirconocene moiety , [ {(c-C5H9)7Si7O9O3} Zr2Cl(c5-C5H4R)4 ] ( <nUm> , r = bu ; <nUm> , r = H ) , were obtained by reacting the silanol with the respective zirconocene dichloride and triethylamine in CCl2H2 in a <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio , an excess of the zirconocene dichloride being required to suppress intramolecular dehydration of TRIPOSS . the related SIPOSS complex , [{(c-C5H9)7Si8O12O}2-Zr(c5-C5H4Bu)2] ( 3 ) , was prepared similarly at the stoichiometric ratio of [ZrCl2(c5-C5H4Bu)2] / SIPOSS / NEt3 equal to <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> . when employed in the <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> ratio , the same reagents afforded only the impure complex [{(c-C5H9)7Si8O12O}ZrCl(c5-C5H4Bu)2] ( 4 ) , contaminated with <nUm> and unreacted [ZrCl2(c5-C5H4Bu)2] . finally , the zirconocene complexes with SIPOSS and DIPOSS moiety , [ {(c-C5H9)7Si8O12O} 2Zr(c5-C5H5)2 ] ( 5 ) and [(c-C5H9)7Si7O9(OSiMe3)O2}-Zr(c5-C5H5)2] ( 6 ) , respectively , were obtained by reacting [ZrMe2(c5-C5H5)2] with stoichiometric amounts of the appropriate silanols . all complexes were characterized by 1H , 13C , 29Si NMR and IR spectra , and by elemental analysis from XPS spectra . preliminary ethene polymerization experiments showed that compounds <nUm> or <nUm> when combined with an excess of methylaluminoxane were nearly as active as [ZrCl2(c5-C5H5)2] whereas compound <nUm> was by about one order of magnitude less active .

group <nUm> metallocene - mediated cationic ring - opening polymerizations of a series of lactones and cyclic carbonates , with different ring sizes ( n = 4-8 ) have been theoretically studied . using the " naked cation " approach in combination with density functional theory , the activated chain - end mechanism and the influence of transition metals , solvent and monomer ring size on the polymerizability were explored in detail . the results showed that the cationic metallocene - monomer complex , [catalyst][monomer]+ , is formed , generating cationic ( carbocation ion ) species responsible for polymer chain growth . we found that poor polymerizability of five - membered lactone and six - membered ring carbonate depends not only on the nature of the monomer ring size but also the relative stability of the complex , which was found to correlate well with the ring strain . subsequently , several propagation steps take place through an N2S reaction which involves ring opening of an active monomer , via alkyl-oxygen bond cleavage . based on the computed activation energies of all metallocene systems , the first propagation was found to be the rate - determining step of the overall propagation and the hafnocene was found to be most active with the energy barrier of 17.6kcal / mol , followed by zirconocene ( 18.6kcal / mol ) and titanocene ( 19.5kcal / mol ) , respectively . the mechanistic study may be applicable to the cationic ROP of lactides and other related monomers . 
by treating disodium(thiophenedimethylene)dicyclopentadienide C 4H2S(CH2C5H4Na) <nUm> with two equivalent of CpTiCl3 or CpZrCl3 DME at <nUm> ° C in THF , two new thiophenedimethylene bridged binuclear metallocenes [Cl2MC5H5][C5H4CH 2C4H2SCH2C5H 4][C5H5MCl2] ( m = Ti <nUm> , m = Zr <nUm> ) were synthesized in high yield and their structures were characterized by 1H - NMR . these complexes were used as catalysts for ethylene polymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the effects of polymerization temperature , time , concentration of catalyst , molar ratio of MAO / cat on polymerization were studied in detail . the catalytic activities of thiophenedimethylene bridged binuclear metallocene catalysts ( 3,4 ) reached <nUm> × <nUm> g PE mol - 1*cat -1*h-1 , <nUm> × <nUm> g PE mol <nUm> cat- 1*h-1 respectively , which are higher than that of pheneyldimethylene bridged binuclear metallocene catalysts and much higher than that of corresponding mononuclear metallocenes ( cp 2TiCl2 and Cp2ZrCl2 ) . the molecular weight distribution curves of polyethylenes produced by binuclear metallocene catalysts ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) and by mononuclear metallocene catalyst have only single peak , but the former ( MWD = <nUm> - <nUm> ) is obviously broader than the latter ( MWD = <nUm> - <nUm> ) . 
three ansa - metallocenes (Me2C)(Me2Si)Cp 2TiCl2 ( 1 ) , [(CH2)5C](Me 2Si)Cp2TiCl2 ( 2 ) and (Me2C)(Me 2Si)Cp2ZrCl2 ( 3 ) with larger dihedral angles and longer distance from metal to the center of cp planes were synthesized and used as catalysts for ethylene polymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . In the case of ethylene polymerization , compared the feature structures of unbridged metallocenes , singly bridged metallocenes and doubly bridged metallocenes <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , there exhibit the relationship between structural characteristics and the catalytic properties with behavior of polymers . and the view that the dimensions of the short dimethylsilylene and isopropylidene bridges of metallocene <nUm> do not match the co-ordination requirement of the larger zirconium atom can also explain the result for ethylene polymerization . catalyzed by complexes <nUm> and <nUm> respectively , the copolymerizations of ethylene with 1-hexene , 1-octene , especially the long chain a-olefins ( 1-tetradecene , 1-hexadecene ) were investigated , and showed high incorporations and comonomer effects in almost all the examples . the melting points of the copolymers are approximately <nUm> % <nUm> % below those of the homopolymers , and the enthalpies of fusion decrease greatly due to the lower crystallinity . the microstructures of the copolymer were analyzed with 13C - NMR to determine the comonomer sequence distributions and numberaverage sequence lengths . comparison between results for the complexes <nUm> and <nUm> with different bridging groups respectively showed that the nature of the bridge has a significant effect on both the incorporation and sequence distribution of the a-olefin . because of the bridges in ansa - metallocene complexes , the copolymerization behavior was different in using catalyst <nUm> and catalyst <nUm> . 
polymerization of isobutyl vinyl ether ( IBVE ) has been studied with mononuclear half - titanocene , CpTiCl3 [1] and dinuclear half - titanocenes , [ C11H9 2)n][(TiCl3)2] [ <nUm> ( n = <nUm> ) , <nUm> ( n = <nUm> ) ] , and [ C11H10 n][(TiCl2OR)2] ( r = 2,6-diisopropylphenoxyl ) [ <nUm> ( n = <nUm> ) , <nUm> ( n = <nUm> ) ] , in the presence of methyl aluminoxanes ( MAO ) as cocatalyst in methylene chloride . the influences of the length of polymethylene brigde and the substitution of aryloxy group at the metal center have been investigated at three polymerization temperature ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> ° C , and <nUm> ° C ) . it was observed that the structure of catalyst displayed significant effects on not only the polymerization behavior but also the properties of the produced polymers . At <nUm> ° C it was noted that polymerization catalyzed by dinuclear titanocenes indicated a living character where a linear relation between molecular weight of the polymers and monomer conversion . the catalytic activity decreased in the order of <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> whereas the stereoregularity of PIBVE , calculated by racemic dyad value , r , increased in the order of <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> . the collected polymers have the high molecular weight ( <nUm> × 105-3 × <nUm> ) and narrow molecular weight distribution ( PDI ≤ <nUm> ) . very interestingly the dinuclear half - titanocenes containing a different bridge and substituent generated the polymers containing a different level of syndiotacticity from <nUm> % to <nUm> % according to the employed catalyst , which clearly demonstrated the property of aryloxy substituent at the metal center played a key role to adjust polymer stereoregularity . 
A series of titanium complexes Ar[O , E]Cp*TiCl ( cp* = C 5Me5 , Ar = 1,2-phenylene , e = NH ( 1a ) ; Ar = 1,2-phenylene , e = O ( 1b ) ; Ar = 2,2'-diphenylene , e = O ( 1c ) ; Ar = 2,2'- dinaphthalene , e = O ( 1d ) ) has been prepared by the reaction of corresponding phenol derivatives with Cp*TiCl3 in the presence of excessive triethylamine . under the conditions of low Al / Ti molar ratio ( e.g. <nUm> ) and high reaction temperatures ( < <nUm> ° C ) , all the titanium complexes display higher catalytic activities towards the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene , in the presence of modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) as a cocatalyst , than their mother complex Cp*TiCl3 . the catalyst activities and polymer yields as well as polymer properties are considerably affected by the steric and electronical effects of the bidentate ligands . 
emulsion copolymerization of styrene and ethylene catalyzed by a series of neutral nickel (II) complexes was carried out in an aqueous system to give high-molecular-weight copolymers . the copolymers and emulsions were characterized by an array of techniques including NMR , GPC , TEM , WAXD and DSC . the results indicate that the copolymers obtained are mostly block copolymers of polyethylene with random insertion of styrene units , and their mw is in the range of <nUm> . by enhancing the electron withdrawing of the substituents on the phenoxy ring , the ethylene contents in the copolymers varied from <nUm> to <nUm> % . the molecular weight distribution of the copolymers was bimodal . with reducing the steric effect of substituents on the aniline ring , the solid contents of the emulsions decreased . the polydispersity of the copolymer varied from <nUm> to <nUm> , and the ethylene content in the copolymer was below <nUm> % . the homopolymer of styrene was obtained when the substitutent on the aniline ring was hydrogen . 
we describe application of a novel refinement method for an accurate determination of the chemical diffusion coefficient . d , and the generalized kinetic parameter . A , from experimental potentiostatic intermittent titration technique ( PITT ) data suited for a variety of electrochemically doped electroactive polymers and inorganic intercalation host materials . the proposed , simple , two - step refinement procedure , based on earlier derived analytical expressions for the PITT response , is exemplified by the analysis of chronoamperometric responses to small - amplitude potential perturbation for p- and n - doped pory(fluorenone-bithiophene) ( PFDOBT-HH ) thin film electrode . the initial p - doping and the entire region of n - doping of this polymer is characterized by a mixed kinetic control of the doping processes due to a combination of ohmic drops ( in solution and in the bulk polymer ) , slow interfacial charge transfer , and diffusion kinetics . In these cases , the refinement procedure leads to meaningful values of the diffusion time constant , td and hence , d . it is believed that this relatively simple refinement procedure will facilitate accurate determination of the chemical diffusion coefficients of practical , composite insertion electrodes . 
ethylene polymerization was done to form polyethylene nano-composite with nanoaluminum nitride using zirconocene catalysts . results show that the catalytic activity is maximum at a filler loading of <nUm> mg nanoaluminum nitride . differential scanning calorimeter ( DSC ) and x-ray diffraction ( XRD ) results show that percentage crystallinity was also marginally higher at this amount of filler . thermal behavior of polyethylene nanocomposites ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> ) mg was studied by DSC and thermal gravimetric analyzer ( TGA ) . morphology of the component with <nUm> mg aluminium nitride is more fibrous as compared to <nUm> mg aluminium nitride and higher filler loading as shown by SEM images . In order to understand combustibility behavior , tests were performed on microcalorimeter . its results showed decrease in combustibility in polyethylene nanocomposites as the filler loading increases . 
two commercial nanoclays were used here as catalytic fillers for production of polyethylene ( PE ) and linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) nanocomposites via in situ polymerization with zirconocene / MAO catalyst . it was found that both types of nanoclays designated as clay A and clay B can improve thermal stability to the host polymers as observed from a thermal gravimetric analysis ( TGA ) . the distribution of the clays inside the polymer matrices appeared good due to the in situ polymerization system into which the clays were introduced during the polymer forming reaction . upon investigating the clays by x-ray diffractometer ( XRD ) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ) , it was observed that the crucial differences between the two clays are the crystallite sizes ( A < B ) and the amounts of amine group ( A < B ) . the higher amount of amine group in clay B was supposed to be a major reason for the lower catalytic activity of the polymerization systems compared to clay A resulting from its deactivating effect on zirconocene catalyst . however , for both clays , increasing their contents in the polymerization systems reduced the catalytic activity due to the higher steric hindrance occurring . 
polypropylene was synthesized using binary metallocene catalysts , rac-ethylenebis-(1-e5-indenyl)-zirconium dichloride ( rac - Et(Ind) 2ZrCl2 : cata A ) and zirconocene dichloride ( cp 2ZrCl2 : cata B ) , in the presence of ZnEt2 . the results indicated that ZnEt2 was an effective agent in modulating isotactivity of polypropylene . moreover , it was found that the [mmmm] pentad value of polypropylene prepared in the presence of diethyl zinc decreased to <nUm> , and the new peaks of [rmmr] and [ rmrr + mmrm ] appeared , in contrast to the peaks from polyproplene obtained in the absence of diethyl zinc . therefore , the possible reason was the occurrence of chain - shuttling polymerization in the CataA / CataB / ZnEt2 catalyst system . 
In our experiments , monospheres ( balls of silica , diameter 200-250 nm ) , carbon fibers ( diameter <nUm> nm , length 0.5-3 mm ) and carbon nanotubes ( diameter 15-25 nm , length <nUm> mm ) were used as fillers . before polymerization , the fillers were separated by ultrasound and then treated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the MAO reacts partially with the OH - groups of the silica and the formation of methane . catalytically active centers are formed after adding the zirconocenes or other transition metal complexes . the thickness of the polyolefins can be controlled by the pressure of ethene or propene and by the polymerization time . by this method , highly filled nanocomposite polypropenes can be obtained with a silica content of up to <nUm> wt % . such combined materials are stiff and hard . every particle is surrounded by a thin film of polyolefin with a thickness of <nUm> to <nUm> nm . carbon fibers and carbon nanotubes can be covered also within isotactic or syndiotactic polypropene . because of the hydrophobic character of the carbon surface , the polymer is drawing on the fiber . this leads to a reinforced combined polymer with special properties . 
different metallocene catalysts were used to synthesize propene / 1-hexene and ethene / styrene copolymers . for the propene / 1-hexene copolymerization , [Me2Si(2-Me-4-PhInd)2]ZrCl2 and [Me2Si(2-Me-4-NaphthylInd)2]ZrCl2 give high activity and random copolymers . In contrast for the ethene / styrene copolymerization , silyl-bridged zirconocenes produce polymers with only a low amount of styrene units . here , isopropyl-bridged C2 and CS symmetric zirconocenes incorporate high amounts of styrene up to <nUm> mol % . A comparison was carried out in respect of the catalyst activity and its ability to incorporate styrene as well as of the properties of the resulting polymers , such as molar masses , melting and glass transition temperatures . 
metallocene complexes Cp2TiCl2 , cp 2ZrCl2 , Cp2Zr(NnBu2) <nUm> , Cp2Ti(e 1-OC(O)C6H 5)2 and Cp2Zr(e 1-OC(O)C 6H5)2 were supported on ClMg <nUm> / SiCl4-n (n-C6H13O)n carrier and used for ethylene polymerization . the supported complexes result in highly active catalysts when treated with different aluminum alkyl-based co-catalysts . these catalysts are able of tuning the final properties of the produced polyethylenes . mixed composites of metallocenes and conventional ziegler - natta catalysts supported on the same carrier were also studied . A supported zirconocene Cp2Zr(e 1-OC(O)C 6H5)2 on Cl2Mg / SiCl4-n (n-C6H13O)n resulted in a highly active catalyst that eject control on the molecular weight , crystallinity and morphology of the resultant polyethylene . 
A comparative kinetic study of the polymerization of tetraethyleneglycol dimethacrylate ( TEEGDM ) under visible light irradiation was carried out in order to determine the effectiveness of titanocene as photoinitiator in this process . the pair camphorquinone / dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate , CQ / DMAEMA ( <nUm> / <nUm> % , by weight ) , was used as a reference photoinitiatior system . the reactions were carried out both in the presence and absence of oxygen ( in N ) and with variable and constant titanocene concentration and incident light intensity . it was observed that in both atmospheres the polymerization reaction commenced rapidly and its initial rate was comparable with that obtained in the presence of the classic initiation system . however , after reacting for a few seconds this process suffered abrupt deactivation , this tendency being more noticeable at low titanocene concentrations . to explain the observed kinetic behavior , the study of the photofragmentation of titanocene upon irradiation with visible light in both atmospheres was carried out . the quantum yield calculated in the presence of O ( phfr = <nUm> at <nUm> nm ) suggests the existence of a chain reaction with participation of oxygen , and this explains , in turn , the high value of the initial rate of polymerization and also the rapid disappearance of the photoinitiator . In an inert atmosphere the photofragmentation occurs in a conventional way , this being a very effective process with quantum yield of <nUm> at <nUm> nm . however , it seems that only a small part of the active species acts as initiating radicals and these are not sufficient to achieve the appropriate monomer conversion . 
<nUm> mole ratio ) , promoted by a mixture of AgNO <nUm> -H <nUm> ClPt <nUm> ( <nUm> / <nUm> mole ratio ) readily gave poly(alkoxysilane)s in good yield ( 62-91 % ) . the addition of small amount of platinum complex to form nanoparticles facilitated the silicon polymer formation when compared to the reaction rate with AgNO <nUm> alone . the primary / secondary hydrosilanes [ p-X-C <nUm> H <nUm> HSi <nUm> ( x = H , CH <nUm> , OCH <nUm> , F ) , PhCH <nUm> HSi <nUm> , and ( PhSiH <nUm> ) <nUm> ] and alcohols [ MeOH , EtOH , i HOPr , PhOH , and CF <nUm> ( CF <nUm> ) <nUm> CH <nUm> OH ] were used for the reaction . the weight average molecular weight and polydispersity of the poly(alkoxysilane)s were in the range of 1,690-7,100 dalton and <nUm> - <nUm> , respectively . the reaction of phenylsilane with ethanol ( <nUm> : <nUm> mole ratio ) using the Ag-Pt complexes produced triethoxyphenylsilane only , as expected . the reaction of phenylsilane with Ge - <nUm> produced an insoluble cross-linked gel . 
In this study , synthesis of controlled graft copolymers onto syndiotactic polystyrene using nitroxide - mediated living radical polymerization and <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , 6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy ( TEMPO ) iniferter is reported . syndiotactic polystyrene has been synthesized using half - sandwich titanocene / methylaluminoxane catalyst in homogenous conditions . then , a-phenyl chloroacetylation of syndiotactic polystyrene was accomplished in a heterogeneous process using carbon disulfide as dispersing medium and a-phenyl chloroacetyl chloride and anhydrous aluminum chloride as acetylating agent and catalyst , respectively . then , 1-hydroxy <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , 6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy ( TEMPO-OH ) was synthesized by the reduction of TEMPO with sodium ascorbate . this functional nitroxyl compound was coupled with arylated syndiotactic polystyrene . the graft copolymerizations of styrene and methyl styrene were initiated by arylated syndiotactic polystyrene carrying TEMPO groups as a macroinitiator . the product of polymerization was then heated in the presence of styrene and methyl styrene to form graft copolymer . the structure of obtained copolymer was investigated by 1H - NMR , and fourier transform - infrared spectroscopy , and thermal behavior of copolymers was performed by differential scanning calorimetry analyses . 
polystyrene ( PS ) nanolatexes were successfully prepared via emulsion polymerization using sodium dodecyl sulfonate as the emulsifier . the effects of emulsifier concentration , initiator concentration , polymerization reaction time , and polymerization reaction temperature on particle size and size distribution of PS colloidal spheres were investigated , respectively . the particle size of the diluted polymer emulsion was about <nUm> nm , as determined by laser scattering . these obtained PS particles were also characterized using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy . 
A series of ( P[?]N[?]P ) cobalt ( II ) complexes were prepared by the reaction of TV - containing diphosphine ligands and anhydrous cobalt dichloride and their catalytic performance in the polymerization of styrene were also investigated . upon activation with ethylaluminum sesquichloride ( EASC ) , all these cobalt complexes showed high catalytic activities up to <nUm> . <nUm> × <nUm> g ( PS ) · mol-1 ( Co ) · h-1 for the solution polymerization of styrene in toluene . the reaction parameters , such as styrene concentration ( <nUm> ∼ <nUm> mL ) , Al / Co molar ratio ( <nUm> ∼ <nUm> ) , reaction temperature ( <nUm> ∼ <nUm> ° C ) and ligand structure of cobalt complexes were employed in order to study their influences on the polymerization of styrene and the properties of the resulting polymers . the molecular weight , molecular weight distribution and microstructure of the resulting polymers were characterized by GPC and <nUm> C - NMR spectra . the GPC results indicated that all the polystyrenes obtained had low molecular weight ( Mn = <nUm> ∼ <nUm> ) and narrow molecular weight distribution ( <nUm> . <nUm> ∼ <nUm> . <nUm> ) . the <nUm> C - NMR spectra demonstrated that the microstructure of polystyrenes obtained was atactic . 
two half - titanocenes , containing a phosphinimide ligand [ (t-Bu)3P = N]CpTiCl2 ( PT1 ) and [ (t-Bu)3P = N]CpTiMe2 ( PT2 ) as the main catalysts for olefin polymerization , were examined in propylene polymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] as the co-catalyst . the catalytic performance was also compared with typical {rac-[En(IndH4)2]ZrC12} ( 1 ) , CpTiCl3 ( 2 ) and Cp2TiCl2 ( 3 ) catalysts . the effects of experimental conditions , including feeding molar ratio of the co-catalyst to the main catalyst [Al] / [Ti] , temperature , propylene pressure and reaction time , on the catalytic activity of the polymerization , the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the resulting polypropylenes ( PPs ) were investigated in detail . A maximal activity of <nUm> × <nUm> g PP / molTi*h was attained using PT2 / [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] in the presence of MAO at [Al] / [Ti] = <nUm> . meanwhile , a highest molecular weight of mw = <nUm> × <nUm> with a molecular weight distribution of <nUm> was reached with PT1 / MAO at [Al] / [Ti] = <nUm> . the molecular weights were increased with decreased polymerization temperature , increased reaction pressure and polymerization time ( tp ) . interestingly , it was noted that an asymptotic plot of mw versus tp was almost linear up to <nUm> min , indicating a “ single - site ” catalytic polymerization . 13C - NMR and IR analyses revealed that the resulting polymers were atactic PPs , which were more or less syndiotactically enriched atactic ones with higher diads r ( <nUm> % ) than m ( <nUm> % ) . furthermore , a calculated value of <nUm> for [ mr / ( <nUm> mm + mr ) ] + [ mr / ( 2rr + mr ) ] indicated that the polymerization was conducted in agreement with the statistical model of bernoullian . DSC measurements further confirmed the atactic microstructure of the PPs with a glass transition temperature ( tg ) ranged from ? <nUm> oC to ? <nUm> oC without any melting endotherm . accordingly , the PPs produced in this study by the phosphinimide catalysts were mainly made up of 1,2-insertion units together with a small number of 2,1-insertion units . 
background : monomeric group IVB ( Ti , Zr and Hf ) metallocenes represent a new class of antitumor compounds . there is literature on the general biological activities of some organotin compounds . unfortunately , there is little information with respect to the molecular level activity of these organotin compounds . we recently started focusing on the anti-cancer activity of organotin polymers that we had made for other purposes and as part of our platinum anti-cancer effort . methods : for this study , we synthesized a new series of metallocene - containing compounds coupling the metallocene unit with dienestrol , a synthetic , nonsteroidal estrogen . this is part of our effort to couple known moieties that offer antitumor activity with biologically active units hoping to increase the biological activity of the combination . the materials were confirmed to be polymeric using light scattering photometry and the structural repeat unit was verified employing matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy results . results : the polymers demonstrated the ability to suppress the growth of a series of tumor cell lines originating from breast , colon , prostrate , and lung cancers at concentrations generally lower than those required for inhibition of cell growth by the commonly used antitumor drug cisplatin . conclusion : these drugs show great promise in vitro against a number of cancer cell lines and due to their polymeric nature will most likely be less toxic than currently used metal - containing drugs such as cisplatin . these drugs also offer several addition positive aspects . first , the reactants are commercially available so that additional synthetic steps are not needed . second , synthesis of the polymer is rapid , occurring within about <nUm> seconds . third , the interfacial synthetic system is already industrially employed in the synthesis of aromatic nylons and polycarbonates . thus , the ability to synthesize large amounts of the drugs is straight forward . 
all right reserved.Several heterogeneous ziegler - natta catalysts were prepared by loading Cl4Ti using mixture of modified montmorillonite ( MMT ) and functionalized muti - walled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs ) as effective composite nanofillers . the polyethylene nanocomposites were produced by in-situ polymerization with these catalysts . the effect of composition of MMT and MWCNTs on the mechanical properties of polyethylene nanocomposite was investigated . the results show that highly active polymerization catalyst with the nanofillers containing MMT and modified MWCNTs can be obtained . the composition of nanofiller has a remarkable influence on mechanical properties of polyethylene nanocomposite . the maximum tensile strength of polyethylene nanocomposite is <nUm> MPa using the mass ratio of MMT to MWCNTs of <nUm> : <nUm> . 
all right reserved . biodegradable polymers , such as polylactic acid ( PLLA ) , poly-e-caprolactone ( PCL ) , polyvinylpyrrolidone ( PVP ) , polyacrylonitrile ( PAN ) , polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , etc. with different ratios were intermittent electrospun to obtain nanofibers . the morphologies , structures , and properties of those nanofibers were characterized by SEM , XRD , FT-IR , etc . the degradation behavior of nanofibers was investigated in different solution . by analyzing the use of different degradation behaviors , the carrier for different types of DDS was preliminarily discussed for choosing suitable controllable - degradation carrier for different drugs to construct drug composite nanofibers . 
nanostructures are objects or structures which has at least one of its dimensions within nano-scale range . nanofibers geometrically fall into thecategory of 1D nano-scale elements . nanofiber can be considered either as a nanomaterial in view of its diameter or as a nanostructured material when filled with nanoparticles . nanofibers gives rise to novel functions and find its applications in various fields such as catalysis , drug delivery , filter technology , functionalization of textiles , tissue engineering , cellular matrices , ultra-strong composites , bioreactors , electronics and energy application . In this chapter , a brief introduction to the different fabrication techniques for synthesizing nanofibers ; in particular electrospinning , its working principle , the polymers and solvents used for nanofiber fabrication , parameters influencing the fiber formation and the applications of electrospun nanofibers in drug delivery are reviewed and discussed . 
about one - half of all synthetic resin produced worldwide is polyolen.1 the two principal compositions are polyethylene ( mainly its high density and linear , low - density forms ) and polypropylene ( mainly its isotactic form ) . the widespread and enduring commercial success of olens derives from a combination of favorable properties : they are inexpensive , highly processible , durable , and biocompatible . polyolens have even been described as “ green polymers , ” based on their low density and high recyclability , as well as their chemical simplicity ( halogen - free ). <nUm> . 
one of the most disruptive discoveries of twentieth century has been metal - catalyzed polymerization of ethylene to polyethylene by prof. karl ziegler from the max plank institut fuer kohlenforschung , mulheim , germany . this discovery marked the beginning of an era , which revolutionized the field of chemistry , in particular , the field of polymer chemistry in many aspects and saw an avalanche of patents and publications . unlike typical academic discoveries , this invention did not stop at the academic labs , but led to the development of a large - scale process that produces about <nUm> million tons of polyolefins ( annually ) today . <nUm> but the very obvious question that comes to our mind is what prompted prof. ziegler to react ethylene with the two components ( that we will discuss later in this chapter ) ? it was not an overnight realization , but instead , it was rational analysis of a serendipitous observation and systematic experimentation by prof. ziegler . 
the [ H2Si (Ind)2ZrCH3]+ ( ind = indenyl ) catalyzed stereoregularity of propylene polymerization mechanism has been investigated at M06 level of theory . four different approaches of propylene to the reactive catalyst lead to four isomeric products due to the C2 symmetry of bridged ind ligand of the catalyst . consequently , various possibilities of propylene attack as well as orientation of polymer chain yield numerous stereoisomers . the calculations of the first and second insertions with various conformers clarified the most favorable reaction pathway and showed that isotactic propagation is more favorable ( <nUm> kcal mol1 ) than syndiotactic propagation . the structures of resting state catalysts displayed various agostic interactions of the CH bond with the Zr center which stabilize the catalytic systems and play important roles in determining the favorable reaction pathway . the influence of counter anion [CH3B(C6F5)3] on the reactivity of the catalyst was also studied . the results also confirm that the trans orientation of the counter anion with respect to propylene is more favorable than its cis orientation and clarify the most favorable reaction pathway in the first and second insertion . because agostic interactions are involved in various aspects , AIM analysis has been used to find the bonding nature of agostic interactions as well as ion - pair bonds . the overall results suggest that rigidity of ansa - zirconocene , unique structure of C2 symmetric ansa ligand , influence of [CH3B(C6F5)3] and β agostic interaction may restrict the attack of propylene only to isotactic polymerization and not to syndiotactic polymerization . 
novel zirconium - iron dinuclear complexes , [ FcSiMe <nUm> ( r <nUm> r <nUm> Cp)ZrCl <nUm> cp ] ( fc ; ferrocenyl , r <nUm> = r <nUm> = H ; 2a , r <nUm> = me , r <nUm> = H ; 2b , r <nUm> = r <nUm> = me ; 2c , r <nUm> = ph , r <nUm> = H ; 2d ) , [ FcSiMe <nUm> Cp{ZrCl <nUm> ( me <nUm> cp ) } ] ( 3a ) , hafnium - iron dinuclear complex , [ FcSiMe <nUm> Cp{HfCl <nUm> ( me <nUm> cp ) } ] ( 3b ) and zirconium - iron trinuclear complex , [ ClZr <nUm> ( FcSiMe <nUm> cp ) <nUm> ] ( 4 ) , were synthesized and complexes 2d and <nUm> were characterized by an x-ray diffraction method . olefin polymerizations were conducted by using these multimetallic zirconocene catalysts with the coexistence of methylaluminoxane or tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borates . the maximum catalytic activities of complexes <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> were observed at low temperatures ( 15-45 ° C ) in ethylene polymerization , contrary to the conventional zirconocene catalyst ( [ ClZr <nUm> cp <nUm> ] ) , showing the maximum activity at between 70-80 ° C . A detailed investigation of ethylene polymerization and NMR measurements of the active species suggested that the interesting behavior of these complexes arose from an electronic cooperative effect between the zirconium and iron atoms . it was also revealed that complexes <nUm> were highly reactive toward propylene or diene in the copolymerization of ethylene and propylene or terpolymerization of ethylene , propylene and diene . 
dialkylzirconocenes in situ generated such as Cp2Zr(n-Bu)2 , Cp2ZrEt2 , and Cp2Zr(t-Bu)(i-Bu) are thermolyzed to afford zirconocene - alkene complexes . In the cases of Cp2Zr(n-Bu)2 and Cp2Zr(t-Bu)(i-Bu) , Cp2Zr-alkene complexes generated from them tend to act as a " Cp2Zr " equivalent , since the initially generated alkene is often replaced by another p-bond containing compound . In the presence of alkynes , for example , alkyne complexes may be generated . on the other hand , Cp2Zr(ethylene) tends to serve as an intermediate since the ethylene moiety is often incorporated in the final organic products . ring expansion and contraction , ligand substitution , transmetallation , migratory insertion , stereoisomerization , regioisomerization , oxidative addition involving these Cp2Zr-alkene and Cp2Zr - alkyne complexes as well as their structures are reviewed . 
synthetic reactions utilizing titanium carbene complexes prepared by the desulfurizative titanation of thioacetals and related organosulfur compounds with the titanocene(II) species [ Cp2Ti{P(OEt)3} <nUm> ] are described . the wittig type olefination of carbonyl compounds including carboxylic acid derivatives with the titanium carbene complexes affords a variety of olefinic compounds . the reaction is successfully applied to the intramolecular carbonyl olefination of carboxylic acid derivatives , giving various carbo- and hetero - cycles . the organotitanium species generated by the treatment of gem - dihalides and certain alkyl halides with the titanocene(II) species are also useful for the transformation of carbonyl compounds into highly substituted olefins or into olefins bearing a bulky substituent . the alkylidenetitanocenes generated from thioacetals react with olefins in both inter- and intramolecular fashions to give olefin metathesis products . the ring - closing olefin metathesis of the carbene complexes formed from thioacetals having a terminal olefin provides a variety of unsaturated heterocyclic compounds . on the other hand , cyclopropanation proceeds when terminal olefins are treated with alkenyl- and alkynyl-carbene complexes . cyclopropanes are also obtained by treatment of gem - dihalides having a terminal carbon-carbon double bond . the carbene complexes are also highly reactive toward triple bonds . their reactions with nitriles afford the acylation products after hydrolysis of intermediary titanium vinylimido complexes . the reactions of the carbene complexes with internal alkynes via the formation of titanacyclobutene intermediates afford conjugated dienes with high stereoselectivity , whereas metathesis polymerization proceeds to give trans-polyacetylene when the carbene complexes are treated with excess acetylene . the carbene complexes also react with t-alkyl halides and group <nUm> metal hydrides . 
the reaction of dilithiated silylene-bridged cp - ligands , whose silylene had one or two vinyl substituents , with Cl4Zr gave racemo - rich mixtures of the complex RR'Si(C5H2-2,4-Me2)2ZrCl <nUm> ( <nUm> : r = vinyl , R' = me , rac / meso = <nUm> / <nUm> , <nUm> : r = R' = vinyl , rac / meso = <nUm> / <nUm> ) . the pure racemic complex 1-rac was isolated after several recrystallization processes in a satisfactory yield ( <nUm> % , rac / meso > <nUm> / <nUm> ) and was structurally characterized . polymerization of propylene with 1-rac / MAO gave highly isotactic polypropylene . 
A zirconocene-ethylene complex C p2Zr(CH2 = CH2 ) - ( PMe3 ) reacted with R3EX ( e = Si , Ge , Sn ; r = ph or bu ; x = Cl , OE1 , or OER3 ) to give R3EEt in high yields after hydrolysis . the reaction mixture of the ethylene complex with Bu3SnCl further reacted with phenylacetylene to give homoallyltin compounds . when the reaction mixture was treated with Ph3SnCl or Ph3GeCl instead of phenylacetylene , Ph3SnEt or Ph3GcEt was obtained in high yields after hydrolysis via the replacement of the b-SnBu3 moiety . 
nonbridged zirconocene dichlorides , ( 1,2-Me <nUm> -4-RC <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( r = me ( 3 ) , ph ( 4 ) , p-FC <nUm> H <nUm> ( 5 ) , 2-furyl ( 6 ) , 2-thienyl ( 7 ) , and fc ( 8 ) ) , and meso- and rac-(1-Me-3-PhC <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) , in the presence of MAO show a high catalytic activity ( <nUm> - <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> gPP / molZr · h ) in the polymerization of propylene and produce almost an atactic elastomeric polymer of high molecular weight ( m w = <nUm> - <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> ). In contrast , rac-(1-Me-3-t-BuC <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( 12 ) shows very low activity and produces a rather high isotactic polymer of low molecular weight . 
the introduction of furyl groups to the position next to the silylene bridge of an ansa - zirconocene catalyst was found to remarkably enhance the catalytic activity and the molecular weight of PP during the isospecific polymerization of propylene . 
disilane unit containing polytitana- and polyzirconasiloxanes were synthesized by the reaction of 1,1,2,2-tetramethyl-1,2-disilanediol with bis(2,4-pentanedionato)titanium diisopropoxide or bis(2,4-pentanedionato)zirconium diisopropoxide . these polymers consisted of disilane unit and metalloxane bonding as main chain with pendants of methyl and 2,4-pentanedionato groups and terminals of isopropoxy and silanol groups . on the other hand , a cyclotitanasiloxane was prepared by the reaction of 1,1,2,2-tetramethyl-1,2-disilanediol with titanocene dichloride in the presence of triethylamine . 
new stereorigid bridged zirconocene having an indenyl group and a fluorenyl group as ligand was synthesized and investigated as an ethylene / 1-hydroxy-10-undecene copolymerization catalyst . this catalyst using MAO as a cocatalyst promoted polymerization to produce copolymers having high molecular weight ( mw : <nUm> ) and high polar monomer content ( <nUm> mol % ) , displaying higher polymerization activities at higher temperature . 
the catalyst system composed of the complex <nUm> and modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) exhibits the characteristics of a quasi-living polymerization of 1-hexene in toluene at130 ° C , producing a syndiotactic - rich polymer with a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution ( mw / Mn = <nUm> ) . moreover , this catalyst system is also capable of promoting the quasi-living copolymerization of 1-hexene with norbornene at room temperature , yielding random copolymers with narrow molecular weight distributions . the quasi-living nature of the catalyst allows the synthesis of syndiotactic - rich poly(1-hexene)-block-poly(1-hexene-ran-norbornene) diblock copolymers . 
this strategy is distinct from conventional approaches based on steric influences to control olefin polymerization processes . In this perspective , the concept , generality and beneficial effects of applying non-covalent interactions to control polymerization reactions are discussed , with particular emphasis given to intramolecular C-H*F-C interactions between a fluorinated ligand and growing polymer chain . 
here , we review the structure and characteristics of SPS , which is a semi-crystalline engineering thermoplastic with a crystalline melting point of <nUm> ° C . because of its crystalline nature , SPS has a high heat resistance , an excellent chemical and water / stream resistance . furthermore , some mechanistic model for polymerization and stereo regulation as well as the factors which affect the activity and stereospecificity of the catalysts , are discussed . 
cycloolefin polymers have attracted much attention because of their high transparency and thermal stability . late transition metal complexes are found to promote smooth and stereoselective cyclopolymerization of dienes to afford the polymers having cycloalkane groups along the polymer chain . Pd - diimine complexes initiate cyclopolymerization of the dienes to afford polymers containing trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclopentane rings . use of Pd complexes with a C2 - symmetric ligand affords polymers with highly regulated tacticity . Pd - catalyzed copolymerization of dienes with ethylene and a-olefins accompanies quantitative cyclization of each diene unit . 7-Alkyl-1,6-heptadienes undergo the cyclopolymerization with chain walking of the growing polymer catalyzed by the Pd complexes , leading to the polymers with trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclopentane groups located regularly along the linear polymer chain . the Fe and Co complexes with a bis ( imino ) pyridine ligand promotes the polymerization of unsubstituted 1,6-heptadienes with quantitative cyclization to yield polymers containing five - membered rings . the Fe complex - catalyzed reaction affords the polymers composed of cis-fused five - membered rings , whereas the polymerization using Co catalyst forms the polymers with trans-fused rings . 
we have synthesized polyethylene and polypropylene copolymers having cyclopentane units in the main chain by copolymerization of ethylene and propylene , respectively , with cyclopentene ( CPE ) or 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) using metallocene catalyst . among the obtained copolymers , poly ( ethylene-co-HD ) , which has 1,3-cyclopentane units in the main chain , shows isomorphism with a transition of the crystalline structure from orthorhombic to hexagonal . we used this finding for the molecular design of a liquid crystalline polyolefin . A liquid crystalline phase was discovered in poly(methylene-1,3-cyclopentane) ( PMCP ) , which was obtained by cyclization polymerization of HD using zirconocene catalysts . PMCPs clearly showed a birefringent texture which indicates a nematic liquid crystalline phase . A high cyclization selectivity of inserted HD units , a high trans-content of the 1,3-cyclopentane unit , and a low molecular weight without crosslinking were necessary to induce the liquid crystalline phase . 
dinuclear complexes attracted attention as ethylene and olefin polymerization catalysts because they frequently show different catalytic properties than their mononuclear analogues . most of the known dinculear catalysts are composed of the same transition metal centers . herein we synthesized novel dinuclear complexes by the olefin metathesis reaction and used them as the catalysts for olefin polymerization . olefin metathesis of the zirconocenes with alkenyl group affords the dinuclear Zr complexes having a bridging spacer with various lengths . the dinuclear complexes show higher catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization than the corresponding mononuclear complexes . heterodinuclear complexes containing early and late transition metals were synthesized by facile cross-metathesis reaction . they promote polymerization of ethylene to afford polyethylene with various branched structures depending on the combination of the metal centers . the polymerization mechanism includes formation of ethylene oligomers on the late transition metal center followed by copolymerization of ethylene with those oligomers on early transition metal center .

the reactions of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) or I2 with the living zirconium - polyolefin bond ( Zr-PO ) using zirconocene catalyst system were examined . although the reaction of MMA with the living Zr-PP does not proceed , I2 readily reacts with the living Zr-PO , such as atactic polypropylene ( ataPP ) , iso poly(1-hexene) and syndiotactic poly(propylene) ( synPP ) , quantitatively to give the terminal iodized polyolefins ( PO-I ) . moreover , PO-poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) block copolymers could be obtained by the reaction of MMA with living Sm-PO , which was formerly prepared by the transformation of PO-I by Cp2*Sm .

all right reserved . ethylene-propylene rubber ( EPR ) and ethylene-propylene-diene rubber ( EPDM ) have important market shares of the industry due to their excellent resistance toward heat , oxidation , weather , and other chemicals . EPR and EPDM have been synthesized by ethylene / propylene copolymerization and ethylene / propylene / nonconjugated diene copolymerization , respectively , employing ziegler - natta , metallocene and metal complex catalysts . catalyst plays important roles in the copolymerization of ethylene and propylene . the progress of ziegler - natta , metallocene and metal complex catalysts and their use in ethylene / propylene copolymerization were reviewed . the characteristics and application in the industry of these advanced catalysts were introduced . the effects of metals and their valence in catalysts , chemical structure of ligands , cocatalysts and additives on the catalytic activity , composition , molecular weight , molecular weight distribution and sequence of the resulting ethylene-propylene copolymer were discussed . vanadium based ziegler - natta catalyst is still promising in ethylene / propylene copolymerization . the open active site of vanadium catalyst results in random ethylene-propylene copolymers , which prevent the formation of long crystallized ethylene sequences . meanwhile , the good solubility in alkanes and low cost of vanadium - based ziegler - natta catalyst are benefit for the application for the production of ethylene-propylene rubber in industry . about <nUm> % of the commercial e / P copolymers are conducted by using vanadium based ziegler - natta catalysts . however , the unstable active centers brought low activity and the catalyst residues should be removed from the polymer product after deactivation . In order to improve the catalytic activity of vanadium - based ziegler - natta catalyst , the additives including electron donor and promoter are usually introduced to the catalytic system . the reactivity ratio of the monomer and the microstructure of the resulting ethylene-propylene copolymer could be adjusted by the additives . metallocene catalyst , as a single - site catalyst , becomes a promising choice for ethylene / propylene copolymerization because of its high activity , high thermal stability and excellent copolymerization ability . the microstructure of resulting ethylene-propylene copolymer could be controlled by modification of chemical structure of metallocene catalyst . the alternating ethylene-propylene copolymer could be prepared by ethylene / propylene copolymerization using bridged zirconocenes . the half - titanocenes containing monodentate anionic nitrogen ligand exhibit high catalytic activity for ethylene-propylene copolymerization in high reaction temperature . some of metallocene catalyst such as constrained geometry catalyst and half - titanocene catalyst have been applied in the production of ethylene-propylene rubber . the metal complex catalyst for olefin coordination polymerization and copolymerization have attracted considerable attention . the titanium , zirconium and vanadium complexes exhibit high activity for ethylene / propylene copolymerization and ethylene-propylene copolymers with high and ultra-high molecular weight could be prepared by using these complex catalysts . living copolymerization of ethylene and propylene is achieved by using titanium complex containing phenoxy-imine ligands . the application in industry for the preparation of ethylene-propylene rubber using complex catalyst is still on the way .

dynamic formation of a volume holographic grating is mainly caused by the diffusion polymerization of a photoinitiator in TI / poly-(methyl methacrylates ) ( PMMAs ) . here , we consider the time - dependent absorption coefficient in this material to establish an absorption modulated diffusion polymerization model . an experimental and theoretical investigation in TI / PMMAs with different sample thicknesses ( <nUm> – <nUm> mm ) is presented . it is indicated that the thickness can regulate the holographic sensitivity and constancy in TI / PMMAs . furthermore , we also examined the dark diffusion process , multiplexed gratings recording , pre-exposure holographic enhancement , and long - term full exposure in TI / PMMAs with different thicknesses to analyze their holographic sensitivity and constancy . it is predicted that , in general , the absorption characteristics in TI / PMMA can be further affected by changing its thickness , thus it is able to satisfy different requirements in high - density holographic memories . 
the range of exposure for which the holographic reciprocity law holds in photopolymers , is mainly dependent on the light exposure intensity and polymerization rate between photo - initiator and monomers . matching this is the key to improving performance . characterization of the dependence on diffraction efficiency of the volume transmission gratings on holographic reciprocity matching of TI / PMMAs under different milliseconds with different thickness ( 1-3 mm ) has been carried out for the novel high - sensitive TI / PMMA polymers . diffraction gratings can be recorded in TI / PMMAs under <nUm> ms with the exposure intensity of <nUm> mW / cm2 . the physical and chemical mechanism under and after single shot exposure is analyzed which can be divided into three parts , namely , photo - induced polymerization , dark diffusion of photosensitive molecules , and counter-diffusion of photoproducts . holographic properties of TI / PMMAs of different thickness ( 1-3 mm ) under different shingle - shot durations and repetition rates are investigated in detail as well . the diffraction efficiency reaches <nUm> % with the response time of <nUm> s . by this way , volume holographic gratings with no reciprocity failure can be recorded under multi-pulse exposure , with high grating strength and rapid sensitivity in TI / PMMAs , which indicates the volume holographic memories have the potential for recording and storing transient information in life and in the military . 
all right reserved.Allyl and aryl groups with weak coordination effect have great influences on the catalytic behavior of metallocene . In order to investigate the catalytic behavior of metallocene in the presence of both allyl and aryl groups , the group IV metal complexes with allyl and aryl groups on cyclopentadienyl ligands(Cp) were synthesized and characterized with 1H - NMR , 13C - NMR , MS and EA . when combined with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , the bifunctional metallocene complexes indicated relativelyhigh catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization and ethylene copolymerization with 1-hexene . when T = <nUm> ℃ , p = <nUm> MPa , the catalytic activity for ethylene polyerization reaches <nUm> kg / ( mol*h ) . the polymerization results showed that the steric effect of substituent group on cp ring has great influence on the behavior of catalyst , while the (BifunctionalCp)2MCl2 displayed very low activity . however , the mixed CpMCl2 showed moderate activity under same condition . it is worth to note that compared to mono functional group , the introduction of both allyl and aryl groups not only enhances the copolymerization ability ( inserting yield of 1-hexene reaches <nUm> % ) , but also makes the catalyst keeping moderate activity at higher polymerization temperature ( activity reached <nUm> kg / ( mol*h ) at <nUm> ° C ) , which is called as bifunctional effect . the effects of polymerization reaction factors such as temperature , mole ratio of Al / metal and the concentration of catalyst on polymerization reaction have been investigated . it is found that upon incrasing temperature the catalytic activity increased first and then decreased . the activity reached <nUm> kg / ( mol*h ) when polymerization temperature is <nUm> ℃ . In fact , the catalytic activity of bifunctional metallocene increased continually as the ratio of nAl / nTi increased , but the polymer molecular weight decreased continually at the same time . however , the catalytic activity decreased as the concentration of catalyst increased , while the polymer 's molecular weight increased first and then decreased . 
hydrogenation of C = C bonds in styrene-isoprene-styrene ( SIS ) block copolymers in the presence of CpTiCl2(OC6H 4Y-p ) / BuLi and CpTiCl2(OC6H4Y-p) / Et3Al catalytic systems ( cp = cyclopentadienyl , bu = butyl , et = ethyl ; Y = Cl , H , CH3O ) was investigated . all of the catalytic systems were active in these reactions . their activity depended on the kind of the metal alkyl , the copolymer composition , reaction time , temperature and hydrogen pressure.Itwas established that access of catalytic species to the C = C bonds in the isoprene blocks is the most important factor in the hydrogenation efficiency . the smallest steric hindrances occur when phenoxy ligands in the catalytic systems are unsubstituted ( Y = H ) and styrene - isoprene diblocks ( SI ) are present in the SIS copolymer . thus , the catalytic systems CpTiCl 2(OC6H4Cl) / BuLi were the most active in kraton ® D-1161 copolymers hydrogenation . 
monocyclopentadienyl titanium complexes of the type Cp*TiX2L ( cp* = C5Me5 , <nUm> : L = C6F5S , x = OMe ; <nUm> : L = C6F5S , x = Cl ; <nUm> : L = <nUm> , 6-Me2-C6H3S , x = OMe ) have been synthesized with high yields . these complexes are used as the catalysts for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene . high catalytic activity is observed , and a polymer with high molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution is obtained . it is concluded that not only the sulfur - containing donor ligand but also the anion ligand strongly affects the polymerization activity and the molecular weight of the resultant polymer . 
trialkylsilanols were reported to modify and also to improve the catalytic performance in ethylene polymerization when added to zirconocene / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) systems . In order to obtain more information about the chemistry involved , a new stable catalytic precursor was investigated in this work . the precursor bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)bistriphenylsilanolatozirconium(IV) [ZrCp2(OSiPh3)2] was compared to ZrCp2(CH3)2 and ZrCp4 , which can generate ZrCp2(OSiPh3)2 in situ on triphenylsilanol addition . In ethylene polymerization , ZrCp2(OSiPh3)2 exibits a comparable activity and a larger stability than dicyclopentadienylzirconium complexes . on addition of triphenylsilanol to zirconocenes , the productivity increased and the molecular weight sharply decreased , thus suggesting the occurrence of ligand substitution in solution . the reported results are discussed with reference to the proposed mechanism of ethylene polymerization with the conventional ZrCp2Cl2 / MAO system . 
this paper describes our recent results in the field of zirconocene - catalyzed a-oltfin transformations , and focuses on questions regarding the reaction mechanism , rational design of zirconocene pre-catalysts , as well as prospective uses of a-olefin products . it has been determined that a wide range of a-olefin - based products , namely vinylidene dimers , oligomers and polymers , can be prepared via catalysis by zirconocene dichlorides , activated by a minimal ( 10-20 eq. ) amount of MAO . we assumed that in the presence of minimal quantities of MAO , various types of zirconocene catalysts form different types of catalytic particles . In the case of bis-cyclopentadienyl complexes , the reactive center is formed under the influence of R2AlCl , which makes the chain termination via b-hydride elimination significantly easier , with a-olefin dimers being formed as the primary product . bis-indenyl complexes and their heteroanalogues , form stable cationic catalytic particles and effectively catalyze the polymerization . mono-indenyl and mono-substituted bis-cyclopentadienyl-ansa complexes catalyze a-olefin oligomerization . effective catalysts of dimerization , oligomerization and polymerization of a-olefins in the presence of minimal MAO quantities are proposed . prospects of using a-olefin dimers , oligomers and polymers in the synthesis of branched hydrocarbon functional derivatives ( dimers ) , high quality , low viscosity motor oils ( oligomers ) , and thickeners and absorbents ( polymers ) are examined .

the inadequacy of strategies used for the heterogeneization of metallocene catalysts is pointed out as one of the main causes of the lack of industrial employability of such polymerization catalysts . the main problems are the necessity of large quantity of MAO ( cocatalyst ) and the inability to control molecular mass distribution of the polymers . based on this background , the main strategies for the heterogeneization of metallocenes are here reviewed . the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy are presented and discussed on theoretical and practical perspective . considering the results reported on the different researches , outcomes of heterogeneization strategies are pointed out . 
styrene polymerization with a series of nickel and titanium complexes based on sterically hindered tris(pyrazolyl)borate ligands , TpMs = HB(3-mesityl-pyrazolyl)3 and TpMs* = HB(3-mesityl-pyrazolyl)2(5-mesityl-pyrazolyl) have been studied in the presence of MAO cocatalyst under various polymerization conditions . all complexes showed to be active for styrene polymerization producing almost exclusively atactic polystyrene . the catalytic activities as well as the styrene conversions with nickel complexes were higher than those with the titanium analogues . higher activities were found at <nUm> ° C . polystyrene properties are substantially affected by the reaction conditions such as temperature of polymerization , time , and [Al] / [M] molar ratio . the GPC results showed that the molecular weight ( mw ) of the polystyrene is sensitive to the temperature of polymerization varying from <nUm> to <nUm> g mol-1 . 
ethylene / 1-hexene was copolymerized by an unbridged zirconocene , ( 2-PhInd ) 2ZrCl2 / MAO ( methyl aluminoxane ) at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> ° C respectively . high copolymerization activity and 1-hexene incorporation were observed at <nUm> ° C , with the copolymer formed having random sequence distribution and narrow molecular weight distribution . ethylene polymerization at <nUm> ° C showed high activity , but copolymerization at <nUm> ° C showed much lower activity , which decreased sharply with increasing 1-hexene concentration in the monomer feed . copolymer formed at <nUm> ° C showed blocky sequence distribution and broad molecular weight distribution . A mechanism model based on ligand rotation hindered by the propagation chain has been proposed to qualitatively explain the observed phenomena . 
In the presence of carbon nanotubes ( CNTs ) , palladium ( Pd ) – polypyrrole ( PPy ) @ CNT nanocomposites have been synthesized by way of one - pot and one - step colloidal synthesis from a solution of a palladium inorganic salt and organic pyrrole as monomeric precursor to PPy . this efficient method leads to the growth of nanoparticles of the palladium inorganic component distributed inside a polymer matrix supported on CNTs . after characterization , palladium – PPy @ CNT nanocomposites have been employed as efficient heterogeneous catalysts for direct C – H bond functionalization toward C – C bond coupling formation . the notable catalytic activity of the palladium – PPy @ CNT nanocomposite decreased with successive catalytic cycles when using the same portion of the composite . this was attributed to palladium redistribution inside the PPy matrix , which occurs by way of a specific mechanism involving the reaction solvent and the composite during C – C coupling reaction . this mechanism is recrystallization of palladium nanoparticles in conductive PPy matrix . nevertheless , the use of palladium – PPy @ CNT nanocomposite in first cycle of investigated catalytic reaction facilitates C-C bond coupling formation : reaction occurs at lower temperature in comparison with homogeneous catalysts .

the purpose has been to achieve a controlled ring - opening polymerization of e-caprolactone , resulting in polymers with desirable properties such as high molecular weight , low polydispersity index , and highly regio- / stereo regular forms . therefore , it is important to synthesize single site or reduced number of active site metal alkoxide compounds as catalysts .

polymeric materials play a key role in the production of medical and clinical devices thanks to their special features such as flexibility , easy processing and good price / performance ratio . among the different polymeric matrixes , one of the most used is poly(vinyl chloride ) ( PVC ) . At room temperature PVC is hard and brittle , thus great amounts ( <nUm> % ) of phthalate esters that act as plasticizers are added to the polymer to make it flexible and appropriate for medical use . di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate ( DEHP ) is the most widely used plasticizer in PVC medical devices . however , DEHP is not chemically bound to PVC and migrates from medical devices with time and use . the potential for DEHP to produce adverse effects in humans has been the subject of considerable discussion and debate in the scientific community . In particular , newborns in the new environment have to be considered at particularly increased risk , because of their small body size and the multiple medical device - related to the DEHP exposure . the major factors determining the degree to which DEHP migrates from medical devices are temperature , amount of DEHP in the device , storage time , shaking of the device while in contact with the medical solutions and degree of PVC degradation . the aim of this review is to present an updated outline of recent ongoing research in the field of PVC degradation and consequent release of phthalates by highlighting their impact on human health , focusing on neonatal exposure .

propylene carbonate ( PC ) is a polar aprotic substance with very similar physicochemical characteristics to the organic solvents traditionally used for organic synthesis , such as acetonitrile and acetone . therefore , PC is beginning to be used as a “ green ” sustainable alternative solvent for chemical transformations . PC is a low toxicity , non-corrosive colourless liquid with a high boiling point and low vapour pressure . it is biodegradable and economical , allowing its large - scale use . PC can be prepared by a reaction between propylene epoxide and carbon dioxide with <nUm> % atomic economy . the easy preparation of propylene epoxide and the use of an available , abundant , economical , and renewable source of carbon , such as CO2 , make this process one of the best routes for the synthesis of PC . therefore , we present in this review numerous catalytic systems that have been studied to improve the efficiency of this reaction . certain interesting examples of reactions using PC are found in the literature , of which we discuss asymmetric hydrogenation , hydrosilylation , asymmetric aldol reactions , the asymmetric synthesis of cyanohydrins , the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds , such as bisindole and tetrahydroquinoline , the hydroacylation of alkynes , a-hydrazination reactions , oxidations , the sonogashira reaction , allylic alkylation and asymmetric amination , the heck reaction , enzymatic kinetic resolution , and isomerisation-hydroformylation reactions . 
As a type of important monomers , α , ω -dienes can be (co)polymerized to afford the polymers with various microstructures . the cyclopolymerization of α , o-dienes performs as an efficient method to obtain the cyclopolyolefins , which usually exhibit remarkable properties , such as high transparency , good mechanical properties , high glass transition temperature , etc. . moreover , incomplete cyclopolymerization of α , o-dienes affords the polymers bearing pendant vinyl groups , which can be modified by post-polymerization modification strategy to generate the functional polymers . therefore , polymerization of α , o-dienes has attracted extensive attention in both industrial and academic researches during recent decades . through years of development , numerous single - site metal catalysts for coordination polymerization of α , o-dienes have been reported , concerning group <nUm> metals , group <nUm> metals and some late transition metals . so , the aim of this review is to highlight these single - site metal catalysts which are used for coordination polymerization of α , o-dienes . 
‘ polysilanes ’ is an important class of inorganic polymers having Si-Si s-conjugation along the backbone . they exhibit extraordinary electronic and photophysical properties and find suitable optoelectronics applications . they are typically synthesized by wurtz coupling reaction of dichlorodialkylsilane or dichlorodiphenylsilane or dichloroalkylphenylsilane and their combinations under drastic reaction conditions by using sodium dispersion in boiling toluene . In such a drastic condition , no functional groups sustain with polysilane polymer . In order to achieve such functional materials , researchers have been interested in synthesizing functional polysilane with a different functional group like a chiral group , azobenzene containing chromophore and other heteroatoms in their main chain or side chain . therefore , it is a very challenging task to synthesize polysilanes having effective functionality integrated with their structures . however , the modern technological demand of materials leads to efforts to obtain polymers having functional and multifunctional activity in a single material . In this review article , we cover the synthesis of polysilane with functional activity via pre-polymerization and post-polymerization with a functional group . 
the oxidation state of the transition metal ( Mt ) active centre is the most disputable question in the polymerization of olefins by ziegler - natta ( ZN ) and metallocene complexes . In this paper the importance and the changes of the Mt active centres are presented and discussed on the basis of a charge percolation mechanism ( CPM ) of olefin polymerization . Mt atoms can exist in different oxidation states and can be easily transformed from one to another state during activation . In all cases , the Mt atoms are present in several oxidation states , i.e. , mt+(n-1) , mt+(n) to mt+(n+1) , producing an irregular charge distribution over the support surface . there is a tendency to equalize the oxidation states by a charge transfer from mt+(n-1) ( donor ) to mt+(n+1) ( acceptor ) . this can not occur since the different oxidation states are highly separated on the support . however , monomer molecules are adsorbed on the support producing clusters with stacked p-bonds , making a p-bond bridge between a donor and an acceptor . once a bridge is formed ( percolation moment ) , charge transfer occurs . the donor and acceptor equalize their oxidation states simultaneously with the polymerization of the monomer . the polymer chain is desorbed from the support , freeing the surface for subsequent monomer adsorption . the whole process is repeated with the oxidation - reduction of other donor - acceptor ensembles . 
preparations of hybrid composites composed of two conducting components , a conducting polymer and silver , are reviewed . they are produced mainly by the oxidation of aniline or pyrrole with silver ions . In another approach , polyaniline or polypyrrole are used for the reduction of silver ions to metallic silver . other synthetic approaches are also reviewed . products of oxidation of aniline derivatives , including phenylenediamines , are considered . morphology of both the conducting polymers and the silver in composites displays a rich variety . conductivity of the composites seldom exceeds <nUm> S cm-1 and seems to be controlled by percolation . interfacial effects are also discussed . potential applications of hybrid composites are outlined ; they are likely to extend especially to conducting inks , printed electronics , noble - metal recovery , antimicrobial materials , catalysts , and sensors .

the use of the coordination properties of metal centres to organise organic ligands in space is a concept that dates back to the seminal work of alfred werner that was recognised by the award of the first nobel proze for chemistry in inorganic chemistry <nUm> years ago . metal ions may be used to control the assembly of one- , two- or three - dimensional structures by matching the coordination number and geometry with the number and arrangement of donor atoms within ligands . these so - called coordination polymers have recently emerged from the category of unwanted insoluble side - products to materials of high scietrific interest and economic potential . this short article presents the simple design principles that lie behind the synthesis of materials possessing useful properties and , often stunningly attractive structural motifs .

heavy metal ions are considered as one of the major water pollutants , revealing health hazards as well as threat to the ecosystem . therefore , investigation of most versatile materials for the sensitive and selective detection of heavy metal ions is need of the hour . proposed work emphasizes the synthesis of conducting polymer and carbon nanotube nanocomposite modified with chelating ligand for the detection of heavy metal ions . carbon nanotubes are having well known features such as tuneable conductivity , low density , good charge transport ability , and current carrying capacity . conducting polymers are the most reliable materials for sensing applications due to their environmental stability and tuning of conductivity by doping and de-doping . formation of nanocomposite of these two idealistic materials is advantageous over the individual material , which can help to tackle the individual limitations of these materials and can form versatile materials with ideal chemical and electrical properties . chelating ligands are the most favorable materials due to their ability of complex formation with metal ions . the present work possesses a sensing platform based on conducting polymer and carbon nanotube nanocomposite , which is stable in various aqueous media and possess good charge transfer ability . chelating ligands played an important role in the increased selectivity toward metal ions . moreover , in present investigation ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) functionalized polypyrrole ( ppy ) and single walled carbon nanotubes ( SWNTs ) nanocomposite was successfully synthesized by electrochemical method on stainless steel electrode ( SSE ) . the electrochemical detection of Pb (II) ions using EDTA - ppy / SWNTs nanocomposite was done from aqueous media . cyclic voltammetry technique was utilized for the electrochemical synthesis of ppy / SWNTs nanocomposite . ppy / SWNTs nanocomposite was further modified with EDTA using dip coating technique at room temperature . the EDTA - ppy / SWNTs modified stainless steel electrode ( SSE ) exhibited good sensitivity and selectivity toward heavy metal ions [Pb(II)] . detection limit achieved for Pb (II) ions was <nUm> mM .

n-vinylcarbazole ( NVK ) is proposed as an additive for acrylates thermal free radical polymerization ( FRP ) and epoxy thermal ring opening polymerization ( ROP ) at room temperature . the new initiating systems are based on a silane / silver salt / n-vinylcarbazole interaction , which ensures good to excellent polymerization . moreover , the polymerization is much more efficient under air than under argon . the effects of the n-vinylcarbazole , silane , silver salt and monomer structures are investigated . interestingly , silver nanoparticles ag(0) are formed in situ . the as-synthesized nanocomposite materials contained spherical nanoparticles homogeneously dispersed in the polymer matrices . polymers and nanoparticles were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , energy - dispersive x-ray spectrometry ( EDS ) , fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ) , and UV - vis spectroscopy . A coherent picture of the involved chemical mechanisms is presented . 
A series of novel half - titanocene complexes CpTiCl2[S-2-R-6-(PPh2)C6H3] ( cp = CH , 2a , r = H ; 2b , r = ph ; 2c , r = SiMe3 ) have been synthesized by treating CpTiCl3 with the sodium of the ligands , 2-R-6-(PPh2)C6H3SNa , which were prepared by the corresponding ligands and HNa . these complexes have been characterized by 1H , 13C and 31P NMR as well as elemental analyses . structures for 2a-b were further confirmed by x-ray crystallography . complexes 2a-b adopt five - coordinate , distorted square - pyramid geometry around the titanium center , in which the equatorial positions are occupied by sulfur and phosphorus atoms of the chelating phosphine-thiophenolate and two chlorine atoms , and the cyclopentadienyl ring is coordinated on the axial position . the complexes 2a-c were investigated as the catalysts for ethylene polymerization and copolymerization of ethylene with norbornene in the presence of MMAO or Ph3CB(C6F5)4 / iBu3Al as the cocatalyst . all complexes exhibited low to moderate activities towards homopolymerization of ethylene . however , they displayed moderate to high activities towards copolymerization of ethylene with norbornene . 
selected results for the synthesis of cyclic olefin copolymers ( CCsO ) — especially copolymerizations of norbornene ( NBE ) or tetracyclododecene ( TCD ) with ethylene and _ - olefins ( 1-hexene , 1-octene , 1-dodecene ) — using group <nUm> transition metal ( titanium and zirconium ) complex catalysts have been reviewed . half - titanocenes containing an anionic ancillary donor ligand , Cp'TiX2(Y) ( cp' = cyclopentadienyl ; x = halogen , alkyl ; Y = anionic donor ligand such as aryloxo , ketimide , imidazolin-2-iminato , etc. ) , are effective catalysts for efficient synthesis of new CCsO ; ligand modifications play an important role for the desired copolymerization . these new CCsO possess promising properties ( high transparency , thermal resistance ( high glass transition temperature ) , low water absorption , etc. ) , thus it is demonstrated that the design of an efficient catalyst plays an essential role for the synthesis of new fine polyolefins with specified properties . 
licensee MDPI , basel , Switzerland.A series of vanadium (III) complexes bearing monodentate tertiary phosphine ligands of the type VCl3(PRnPh3-n)2 ( n = <nUm> ( 1a ) ; n = <nUm> and r = me ( 1b ) , et ( 1c ) , iPr ( 1d ) , cy ( 1e ) ; n = <nUm> and r = me ( 1f ) , et ( <nUm> g ) , cy ( <nUm> h ) ) , and VCl3(PR3)2 ( r = cyp ( 2a ) , cy (2b),nPr (2c),tBu ( 2d ) ) were synthesized and characterized . In the case of 1c , <nUm> g and 2a single crystals were also obtained and their molecular structures were determined . all the complexes were used , in combination with methylaluminoxane ( sMAO ) or AlMe3 – free MAO ( dMAO ) , for the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene , exhibiting rather good activity and giving polymers with different microstructure depending on the nature of the phosphine ligand and the type of co-catalyst employed . 
licensee MDPI , basel , Switzerland.During the past two decades homoleptic tetramethylaluminates of the trivalent rare - earth metals , Ln(AlMe4)3 , have emerged as useful components for efficient catalyst design in the field of 1,3-diene polymerization . previous work had focused on isoprene polymerization applying Ln(AlMe4)3 precatalysts with ln = La , Ce , Pr , Nd , Gd and Y , in the presence of Et2AlCl as an activator . polymerizations employing Ln(AlMe4)3 with ln = La , Y and Nd along with borate / borane co-catalysts [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] , [PhNMe2H][B(C6F5)4] and [B(C6F5)3] were mainly investigated for reasons of comparison with ancillary ligand - supported systems ( cf. half - sandwich complexes ) . the present study investigates into a total of eleven rare - earth elements , namely ln = La , Ce , Pr , Nd , Gd , Tb , Dy , Ho , Y , Er and Lu . A full overview on the polymerization behavior of Ln(AlMe4)3 in the presence of perfluorinated borate / borane cocatalysts and R2AlCl - type activators ( r = me , et ) is provided , probing the monomers isoprene and 1,3-butadiene ( and preliminary ethylene ) . virtually complete cis-1,4-selectivities are obtained for several catalyst / cocatalyst combinations ( e.g. , Gd(AlMe4)3 / Me2AlCl , > <nUm> % ) . insights into the ‘ black box ’ of active species are obtained by indirect observations via screening of pre-reaction time and cocatalyst concentration . the microstructure of the polydienes is investigated by combined1H / 13C NMR and ATR-IR spectroscopies . furthermore , the reaction of [LuMe6(Li(thf)x)3] with AlMe3 has been applied as a new strategy for the efficient synthesis of Lu(AlMe4)3 . the solid - state structures of Gd(AlMe4)3 and Tb(AlMe4)3 are reported . 
licensee MDPI , basel , Switzerland.New ligand platforms of the type p-or m-Ph{-CR(3,6-tBu2 Flu)(Cp)}2 ( para- , r = me ( 2a ) , H ( 2b ) ; meta- , r = me ( 2c ) ) were synthesized via nucleophilic addition of the 3,6-tBu2-fluorenyl-anion onto the parent phenylene-bridged difulvenes ( 1a – c ) . the corresponding discrete homodinuclear zirconium and hafnium bis(dichloro ansa - metallocene ) complexes , Ph[{-CR(3,6-tBu2 Flu)(Cp)}MCl2]2 ( p- , r = me ( 3a-Zr2 , 3a-Hf2 ) , r = H ( 3b-Zr2 ) ; m- , r = me ( 3c-Zr2 ) , were prepared by salt metathesis reactions . an attempt to generate in situ a heterodinuclear complex 3a-Zr-Hf was also undertaken . for the first time , atmospheric pressure PhotoIonization ( APPI ) mass - spectrometric data were obtained for all dinuclear compounds and found to be in excellent agreement with the simulated ones . preliminary studies on the catalytic performances of these dinuclear complexes , upon activation with MAO , in ethylene homopolymerization and ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization revealed a few differences as compared to those of the monometallic analogues . In particular , slightly lower molecular weights and a greater formation of short methyl and ethyl branches were obtained with the dinuclear systems . 
A theoretical investigation of the ring - opening polymerization ( ROP ) mechanism of rac - lactide ( LA ) with an yttrium complex featuring a N - heterocyclic carbine ( NHC ) tethered moiety is reported . it was found that the carbonyl of lactide is attacked by N(SiMe3)2 group rather than NHC species at the chain initiation step . the polymerization selectivity was further investigated via two consecutive insertions of lactide monomer molecules . the insertion of the second monomer in different assembly modes indicated that the steric interactions between the last enchained monomer unit and the incoming monomer together with the repulsion between the incoming monomer and the ligand framework are the primary factors determining the stereoselectivity . the interaction energy between the monomer and the metal center could also play an important role in the stereocontrol . 
group <nUm> metallocene polymers offer a wide variety of unique properties . some of these are reviewed in this paper , including the ability to form fibers and to absorb laser radiation , thereby protecting materials containing them in small amounts ; the possibility of becoming conductive materials through simple doping ; increasing the productivity of damaged , old and mold - infested seeds through incorporation of plant growth hormones ; and acting as anticancer drugs that inhibit a variety of human cancers including breast and pancreatic cancers . 
ziegler - natta polymerization catalysts were characterized by a complex of surface- and bulk - sensitive methods ( DRIFTS , XPS , ESR , and XAS = XANES + EXAFS ) . A diffuse - reflectance fourier - transform IR spectroscopy ( DRIFTS ) study showed the presence of strong lewis acid sites in different concentrations and absence of strong basic sites in the polymerization catalysts . x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) , electron - spin resonance ( ESR ) , and ( x-ray absorption near - edge structure ( XANES ) analysis revealed the presence of ti4+ , ti3+ , ti2+ , and ti1+ species in the surface layers and in the bulk of catalysts . the samples under study differ drastically in terms of the number of ESR - visible paramagnetic sites . the EXAFS study shows the presence of a Cl atom as a nearest neighbor of the absorbing Ti atom . 
In this work we report the polymerization behaviour of natural clays ( montmorillonites , MMT ) as activating supports . these materials have been modified by treatment with different aluminium compounds in order to obtain enriched aluminium clays and to modify the global bronsted / lewis acidity . As a consequence , the intrinsic structural properties of the starting materials have been changed . these changes were studied and these new materials used for ethylene polymerization using a zirconocene complex as catalyst . all the systems were shown to be active in ethylene polymerization . the catalyst activity and the dependence on acid strength and textural properties have been also studied . the behaviour of an artificial silica ( SBA <nUm> ) modified with an aluminium compound to obtain a silicoaluminate has been studied , but no ethylene polymerization activity has been found yet . 
the Cp2ZrCl2 / <nUm> BuLi catalyzed co-polymerization of H2MeSiSiMeH2 and PhSiH3 was compared to the homo-polymerization of H2MeSiSiPhH2 . In contrast to the copolymerization , which gave molecular weights comparable to homo-polymerization of phenylsilane , the reaction of 1-methyl-2-phenyldisilane yielded a partially cross-linked high molecular weight polymer with very broad molecular weight distribution . A higher reactivity of phenyl-substituted silicon atoms compared to methyl-substituted ones was detected . stoichiometric reactions of some disilanes with the slow dehydropolymerization catalyst CpCp*Hf(Cl)Si(SiMe3)3 gave metal disilanyl intermediates with selectivities that reflect the observed polymerization behavior . 
<nUm> years ago , karl ziegler and giulio natta were awarded the nobel prize for their discovery of the catalytic polymerization of ethylene and propylene using titanium compounds and aluminum - alkyls as co-catalysts . polyolefins have grown to become one of the biggest of all produced polymers . new metallocene / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) catalysts open the possibility to synthesize polymers with highly defined microstructure , tacticity , and steroregularity , as well as long - chain branched , or blocky copolymers with excellent properties . this improvement in polymerization is possible due to the single active sites available on the metallocene catalysts in contrast to their traditional counterparts . moreover , these catalysts , half titanocenes / MAO , zirconocenes , and other single site catalysts can control various important parameters , such as co-monomer distribution , molecular weight , molecular weight distribution , molecular architecture , stereo - specificity , degree of linearity , and branching of the polymer . however , in most cases research in this area has reduced academia as olefin polymerization has seen significant advancements in the industries . therefore , this paper aims to further motivate interest in polyolefin research in academia by highlighting promising and open areas for the future .

propene polymerization with isotactic (iso)-specific C <nUm> -symmetric rac-Me <nUm> Si(2-Me-Benz(e)- ind ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( 1 ) and rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-1-Ind)C <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( 2 ) were conducted under various conditions for achieving iso-specific living polymerization of propene . when complex <nUm> was activated with trialkylaluminum - free modified methylaluminoxane ( dMMAO ) at <nUm> ° C , the number - average molecular weight ( m n ) linearly increased against the polymerization time to reach m n = <nUm> within <nUm> min of polymerization , although the molecular weight distributions was broad ( m w / m n < <nUm> ) . thus , it was found that quasi-living polymerization of propene proceeded in the 1-dMMAO system . the living nature of iso-polypropene was confirmed by the block copolymerization , where the m n value increased from <nUm> to <nUm> after the addition of 1-octene to yield the block copolymer with a melting point of <nUm> ° C . 
A series of constrained geometry O - functionalized cyclopentadienylchromium complexes ( 1-6 ) and a S - functionalized cyclopentadienylchromium complex ( 7 ) were first synthesized , characterized , and tested as catalyst precursors for the olefin polymerization . In the presence of MAO , the complexes exhibited high catalytic activity for the polymerization of ethylene . it is shown that ligand variations can have a substantial effect on catalyst activity and stability . the effect of Al / Cr ratio on catalytic activity was also studied . 
licensee MDPI . cationic methylpalladium complexes bearing hemilabile bidentate a-amino – pyridines can serve as effective precursors for catalytic alternating copolymerization of norbornene ( N ) and ethylene ( e ) , under mild conditions . the norbornyl palladium complexes in the formula of {[RHNCH2(o-C6H4N)]Pd(C7H10Me)(NCMe)}(BF4) ( r = iPr ( 2a ) , tBu ( 2b ) , ph ( 2c ) , 2,6-Me2C6H3 ( 2d ) , 2,6-iPr2C6H3 ( 2e ) ) were synthesized via single insertion of norbornene into the corresponding methylpalladium complexes 1a – 1e , respectively . both square planar methyl and norbornyl palladium complexes exhibit facile equilibria of geometrical isomerization , via sterically - controlled amino decoordination – recoordination of amino – pyridine . kinetic studies of e-insertion , n-insertion of complexes <nUm> and <nUm> , and the geometric isomerization reactions have been examined by means of VT - NMR , and found in excellent agreement with the results estimated by DFT calculations . the more facile n-insertion in the cis-isomers , and ready geometric isomerization , cooperatively lead to a new mechanism that accounts for the novel catalytic formation of alternating COC . 
polymerizations of 1-decene ( DC ) , 1-dodecene ( DD ) , and 1-tetradecene ( TD ) by Cp*TiMe2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) ( 1 ) – [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] ( borate ) catalyst have been explored in the presence of Al cocatalyst . the polymerizations of DC and DD , in n-hexane containing a mixture of AliBu3 and Al(n-C8H17)3 , proceeded with high catalytic activities in a quasi-living manner , affording high molecular weight polymers ( activity <nUm> – <nUm> kg - poly(DC) / mol - ti*h , Mn for poly(DC) = <nUm> – <nUm> × <nUm> , after <nUm> min at − <nUm> *C ) . the PDI ( mw / Mn ) values in the resultant polymers decreased upon increasing the ratio of Al(n-C8H17)3 / AliBu3 with decreasing the activities at − <nUm> *C . the PDI values also became low when these polymerizations were conducted at low temperatures ( − <nUm> or − <nUm> *C ) ; high molecular weight poly(DD) with low PDI ( Mn = <nUm> × <nUm> , mw / Mn = <nUm> ) was obtained at − <nUm> *C . the TD polymerization using <nUm> – borate – AliBu3 catalyst ( conducted in n-hexane at − <nUm> *C ) afforded ultrahigh molecular weight poly(TD) ( Mn = <nUm> × <nUm> , mw / Mn = <nUm> ) , and the PDI values also decreased with increasing the Al(n-C8H17)3 / AliBu3 ratio . 
zirconocene - mediated selective dimerization of a-olefins usually occurs when precatalyst (n5-C5H5)2ZrCl2 is activated by minimal excess of methylalumoxane ( MAO ) . In this paper , we present the results of density functional theory ( DFT ) simulation of the initiation , propagation , and termination stages of dimerization and oligomerization of propylene within the framework of Zr-Al binuclear mechanism at m-06x / DGDZVP level of theory . the results of the analysis of the reaction profiles allow to explain experimental facts such as oligomerization of a-olefins at high MAO / (n5-C5H5)2ZrCl2 ratios and increase of the selectivity of dimerization in the presence of R2AlCl . the results of DFT simulations confirm the crucial role of the presence of chloride in the selectivity of dimerization . the molecular hydrogen was found in silico and proven experimentally as an effective agent that increases the rate and selectivity of dimerization . 
licensee MDPI , basel , switzerland . the electrospinning process has gained popularity due to its ease of use , simplicity and diverse applications . the properties of electrospun fibers can be controlled by modifying either process variables ( e.g. , applied voltage , solution flow rate , and distance between charged capillary and collector ) or polymeric solution properties ( e.g. , concentration , molecular weight , viscosity , surface tension , solvent volatility , conductivity , and surface charge density ) . however , many variables affecting electrospinning are interdependent . an optimized electrospinning process is one in which these parameters remain constant and continuously produce nanofibers consistent in physicochemical properties . In addition , nozzle configurations , such as single nozzle , coaxial , multi-jet electrospinning , have an impact on the fiber characteristics . the polymeric solution could be aqueous , a polymeric melt or an emulsion , which in turn leads to different types of nanofiber formation . nanofiber properties can also be modified by polarity inversion and by varying the collector design . the active moiety is incorporated into polymeric fibers by blending , surface modification or emulsion formation . the nanofibers can be further modified to deliver multiple drugs , and multilayer polymer coating allows sustained release of the incorporated active moiety . electrospun nanofibers prepared from polymers are used to deliver antibiotic and anticancer agents , DNA , RNA , proteins and growth factors . this review provides a compilation of studies involving the use of electrospun fibers in biomedical applications with emphasis on nanoparticle - impregnated nanofibers . 
an overview of the methodologies to elucidate the microstructure of copolymers of ethylene and cyclic olefins through 13C nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) analysis is given . 13C NMR spectra of these copolymers are quite complex because of the presence of stereogenic carbons in the monomer unit and of the fact that chemical shifts of these copolymers do not obey straightforward additive rules . we illustrate how it is possible to assign 13C NMR spectra of cyclic olefin - based copolymers by selecting the proper tools , which include synthesis of copolymers with different comonomer content and by catalysts with different symmetries , the use of one- or two - dimensional NMR techniques . the consideration of conformational characteristics of copolymer chain , as well as the exploitation of all the peak areas of the spectra by accounting for the stoichoimetric requirements of the copolymer chain and the best fitting of a set of linear equation was obtained . the examples presented include the assignments of the complex spectra of poly(ethylene-co-norbornene ( E-co-N ) , poly(propylene-co-norbornene ( P-co-N ) copolymers , poly(ethylene-co-4-Me-cyclohexane)s , poly(ethylene-co-1-Me-cyclopentane)s , and poly(E-ter-N-ter-1,4-hexadiene) and the elucidation of their microstructures . 
the 13C NMR microstructure of a polypropylene ( PP ) sample is a fundamental source of information on its properties , and also a ' fingerprint ' of the catalytic species used to produce it . likely due to a much greater technological importance , isotactic polymers ( i-PP ) have been more thoroughly investigated that syndiotactic ones ( s-PP ) . In this paper , we report the first full assignment of regioirregular sequences in s-PP samples made with two well - known molecular catalysts , namely a Cs - symmetric (cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl) ansa - zirconocene and a fluxional bis(phenoxyimine)Ti species . the results shed more light on the mechanism of chain propagation at the two catalysts , and open the door to the investigation of more elusive cases like the formation of s-PP blocks in the presence of multi-sited heterogeneous ziegler - natta systems . 
A C1 - symmetric (methylphenyl)silylene-bridged (fluorenyl)(naphthylamido) titanium complex ( 1 ) and (diphenyl)silylene-bridged (fluorenyl)(naphthylamido) titanium complex ( 2 ) were synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR , element analysis , and x-ray crystal analysis . the coordination mode of the fluorenyl ligand to the titanium metal is an e3 manner in each complex . these complexes were applied for propylene polymerization using dried modified methyaluminoxane ( dMMAO ) as a cocatalyst under different propylene pressures in a semi batch - type method . the catalytic activity was strongly dependent on the structure of the complex and the propylene pressure , where complex <nUm> exhibited the highest activity ( <nUm> kg mol-1*h-1 ) under a propylene pressure of <nUm> atm to produce high molecular weight polypropylene . the polypropylenes obtained were syndiotactic - rich with an rr value of <nUm> , indicating that the silylene bridge was not efficient for the isospecificity of a constrained geometry catalyst ( CGC ) . the mechanical properties of the resulting polymers depended on their microstructure . 
the direct synthesis of syndiotactic polystyrene-block-polyethylene copolymer ( sPS-b-PE ) with a diblock structure has been achieved . the synthetic strategy consists of the sequential stereocontrolled polymerization of styrene and ethylene in the presence of a single catalytic system : cyclopentadienyltitanium(IV) trichloride activated by modified methylaluminoxane ( CpTiCl3 / MMAO ) . the reaction conditions suitable for affording the partially living polymerization of these monomers were identified , and the resulting copolymer , purified from contaminant homopolymers , was fully characterized . gel permeation chromatography coupled with two - dimensional NMR spectroscopy COSY , HSQC , and DOSY confirmed the block nature of the obtained polymer , whose thermal behaviour and thin film morphology were also investigated by differential scanning calorimetry , powder wide angle x-ray diffraction , and atomic force microscopy . 
catalyst speciation during polymerization of 1-hexene in benzene or toluene solutions of the catalyst precursor SBIZr(m-Me)2AlMe2+ B(C6F5)4- ( SBI = rac-dimethylsilyl-bis(1-indenyl) ) at <nUm> ° C is studied by following the accompanying UV-vis-spectral changes . these indicate that the onset of polymerization catalysis is associated with the concurrent formation of two distinct zirconocene species . one of these is proposed to consist of SBIZr-s-polyhexenyl cations arising from BISZr - me+ ( formed from SBIZr(m-Me)2AlMe2+ by release of AlMe3 ) by repeated olefin insertions , while the other one is proposed to consist of SBIZr-e3-allyl cations of composition SBIZr-e3-(1-R-C3H4)+ ( r = n-propyl ) , formed by s-bond metathesis between BISZr - me+ and 1-hexene under release of methane . At later reaction stages , all zirconocene-s-polymeryl cations appear to decay to yet another BISZr - allyl species , i.e. , to cations of the type SBIZr- e3-(x-R-(3-x)-pol-C3H3)+ ( pol = i-polyhexenyl , x = <nUm> or <nUm> ) . renewed addition of excess 1-hexene is proposed to convert these sterically encumbered Zr - allyl cations back to catalytically active SBIZr-s-polymeryl cations within a few seconds , presumably by initial 1-hexene insertion into the e1- isomer , followed by repeated additional insertions , while the initially formed , less crowded allyl cations , SBIZr-e3-(1-R-C3H4)+ appear to remain unchanged . implications of these results with regard to the kinetics of zirconocene - catalyzed olefin polymerization are discussed . 
the stopped - flow ( SF ) technique has been extensively applied to study ziegler - natta ( ZN ) olefin polymerization kinetics within an extremely short period ( typically < <nUm> s ) for understanding the nature of the active sites as well as the polymerization mechanisms through microstructure analyses of obtained polymers . In spite of its great applicability , a small amount of polymer that is yielded in a short - time polymerization has been a major bottleneck for polymer characterizations . In order to overcome this limitation , a large - scale SF ( LSF ) system has been developed , which offers stable and scalable polymerization over an expanded time range from a few tens milliseconds to several seconds . the scalability of the LSF technique has been further improved by introducing a new quenching protocol . with these advantages , the LSF technique has been effectively applied to address several unknown issues in ZN catalysis , such as the role of physical and chemical transformations of a catalyst on the initial polymerization kinetics , and regiochemistry of ZN propylene polymerization . here , we review the development of the LSF technique and recent efforts for understanding heterogeneous ZN olefin polymerization catalysis with this new system . 
poly(norbornene-co-styrene)s were synthesized by the use of anilinonaphthoquinone - ligated nickel complexes [ Ni(C10H5O2NAr)(Ph)(PPh3) : 1a , Ar = C6H3-2,6-iPr ; 1b , Ar = C6H2-2,4,6-Me ; 1c , Ar = C6H5 ] activated with modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) or BC18F15 in toluene . the effects of the cocatalysts were more significant than those of the nickel complexes , and MMAO gave higher activity than BC18F15 . the structural characterizations of the products indicated the formation of statistical norbornene copolymers . an increase of the styrene ratio in feed led to an increase in the incorporated styrene ( S ) content of the resulting copolymer . the molecular weight of the copolymer decreased with increasing the S ratio in feed at <nUm> ° C . the copolymerization activity , using MMAO as a cocatalyst , decreased with lowering of the temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C , accompanied by an increase in the molecular weight of the copolymer . the S incorporation up to <nUm> % with Mn of <nUm> was achieved by the 1b-B(C6F5)3 catalytic system . the glass transition temperatures of the norbornene ( N ) / S copolymers determined by differential scanning calorimetry , decreased from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C according to the S content . 
copolymerizations of propylene with o-alkenols ( aluminum - protected 5-hexene-1-ol ( AH ) and 10-undecene-1-ol ( AU ) ) and non-polar analogues ( 1-hexene and 1-dodecene ) were conducted with a rac-[Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2]ZrCl2 activated by modified methylaluminoxane . the catalytic system showed high activity for each copolymerization , of which value was independent on the comonomer used and decreased with the increase of the comonomer concentration . the comonomer content of the copolymers obtained also decreased with the increase of the comonomer concentration in each copolymer . the evaluation of the monomer reactivity ratios indicates a preference for the propylene insertion regardless of the last inserted monomer unit in growing polymer chain in all the copolymerizations . the relative reactivity of o-alkenols was however significantly lower than that of non-polar analogues . these results suggested that the aluminum protection of polar monomer do not affect the activity of copolymerization but significantly decrease the comonomer reactivity . 
A series of N-acetyl-O-(o-alkenyl)-L-tyrosine ethyl esters were synthesized by the reaction of vinyl bromides ( 4-bromo-1-butene , 6-bromo-1-hexene , 8-bromo-1-octene and 10-bromo-1-decene ) with N-acetyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester . 1H NMR , elemental analysis , FT-IR , and mass spectra were performed for these N-acetyl-O-(o-alkenyl)-L-tyrosine ethyl esters . the novel titanium complex can catalyze the copolymerization of ethylene and N-acetyl-O-(o-alkenyl)-L-tyrosine ethyl esters efficiently and the highest catalytic activity was up to <nUm> × <nUm> gP *(molTi)-1*h-1 . the structures and properties of the obtained copolymers were characterized by FT-IR , (1H)13C NMR , GPC , DSC , and water contact angle . the results indicated that the obtained copolymers had a uniformly high average molecular weight of <nUm> × <nUm> g*mol-1 and a high incorporation ratio of N-acetyl-O-(but-3-enyl)-L-tyrosine ethyl ester of <nUm> mol % within the copolymer chain . the units of the comonomer were isolated within the copolymer chains . the insertion of the polar comonomer into a copolymer chain can effectively improve the hydrophilicity of a copolymer .

licensee MDPI , basel , Switzerland.A series of ansa-silylene(fluorenyl)(amido) titanium complexes ( 1a-1c , 2a , and 2b ) bearing various substituents on the amido and fluorenyl ligands are synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis , 1H NMR , and single crystal x-ray analysis . the coordination mode of the fluorenyl ligand to the titanium metal is ? <nUm> manner in each complex . the propylene polymerization is conducted with these complexes at <nUm> and <nUm> ° C in a semi batch - type method , respectively . the catalytic activity of 1a-1c bearing cumyl-amido ligand is much higher than that of 2a and 2b bearing naphthyl group in amido ligand . high molecular weight polypropylenes are obtained with narrow molecular weight distribution , suggesting a living nature of these catalytic systems at <nUm> ° C . the polymers produced are statistically atactic , regardless of the structure of the complex and the polymerization temperature . 
two poly(3-hexylthiophene) ( P3HT ) macromers containing a donor polymer with a polymerizable methacrylate ( MA ) end group , P3HT-CH2-MA and P3HT-(CH2)2-MA , have been synthesized , and P3HT-(CH2)2-MA has been successfully homopolymerized and copolymerized with methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) into stereoregular brush polymers and graft copolymers , respectively , using chiral ansa - zirconocene catalysts . macromer P3HT-CH2-MA is too sterically hindered to polymerize by the current Zr catalysts , but macromer P3HT-(CH2)2-MA is readily polymerizable via either homopolymerization or copolymerization with MMA in a stereospecific fashion with both C2 - ligated zirconocenium catalyst <nUm> and Cs - ligated zirconocenium catalyst <nUm> . thus , highly isotactic ( with mm % ≥ <nUm> % ) and syndiotactic ( with rr % ≥ <nUm> % ) brush polymers , it-PMA-g-P3HT and st-PMA-g-P3HT , as well as well - defined stereoregular graft copolymers with different grafted P3HT densities , it-P(M)MA-g-P3HT and st-P(M)MA-g-P3HT , have been synthesized using this controlled coordination - addition polymerization system under ambient conditions . these stereoregular brush polymers and graft copolymers exhibit both thermal ( glass and melting ) transitions with tg and Tm values corresponding to transitions within the stereoregular P(M)MA and crystalline P3HT domains . acceptor molecules such as C60 can be effectively encapsulated inside the helical cavity of st-P(M)MA-g-P3HT to form a unique supramolecular helical crystalline complex , thus offering a novel strategy to control the donor / acceptor solar cell domain morphology . 
non-metallocene oxovanadium(V) complexes bearing either [ONNO] - type amine pyridine bis(phenolate) ligands or [ONN] - type amine pyridine phenolate ligands were employed as efficient catalysts to copolymerize ethylene with several unsymmetrical norbornene - containing dienes , such as 5-vinyl-2-norbornene ( VNB ) , 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene ( ENB ) or dicyclopentadiene ( DCPD ) , producing copolymers with high comonomer incorporations ( VNB : <nUm> mol % ; ENB : <nUm> mol % ; DCPD : <nUm> mol % , respectively ) and high molecular weight ( VNB : <nUm> kDa ; ENB : <nUm> kDa ; DCPD : <nUm> kDa , respectively ) . the enchainment of the dienes was proven to be exclusive of vinyl-addition via the C = C double bond of the norbornene ring while the other double bond was retained near the backbone without crosslinking . during the copolymerization of ethylene with ENB , a positive ' comonomer effect ' was observed . the catalytic activities of the catalysts as well as the molecular weights and comonomer incorporations of the resultant copolymers could be tuned within a wide range by varying the structures of the catalysts and copolymerization conditions . the [ONN] - type oxovanadium(V) complexes showed higher catalytic activities than those of [ONNO] - type oxovanadium(V) complexes , irrespective of the structure of the dienes . In addition , the dominant chain transfer pathway of the non-metallocene oxovanadium(V) catalytic system promoted copolymerization was proven to be transfer to aluminum compounds . 
A series of new fluorenylamido-ligated zirconium complexes bearing an electron - donating adamantyl group on the amido ligand were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis , 1H NMR , and single crystal x-ray analysis . the coordination mode of the fluorenyl ligand to the zirconium metal was e3 manner , and all the complexes were Cs - symmetric in solution . the complexes showed moderate activity ( <nUm> × <nUm> g - polymer mol-Zr-1*h-1 ) , even at a low Al / Zr ratio of <nUm> . the increase of propylene pressure improved the activity by one order of magnitude ( up to <nUm> × <nUm> g - polymer mol-Ti-1*h-1 ) . all catalyst systems gave syndiotactic polypropylene , where the complex containing the 3,6-di-t-butyl fluorenyl ligand was more effective for the enhancement of the syndiospecificity . the increase of propylene pressure also improved the syndiospecificity with the syndiotactic pentad of <nUm> and the melting point of <nUm> ° C . 
water - soluble metallocene and organotin - containing polyethers were synthesized employing interfacial polycondensation . the reaction involved various chain lengths of poly(ethylene glycol ) , and produced water - soluble polymers in decent yield . commercially available reactants were used to allow for easy scale up . the polymers exhibited a decent ability to inhibit a range of cancer cell lines , including two pancreatic cancer cell lines . this approach should allow the synthesis of a wide variety of other water - soluble polymers . 
new catalysts of water soluble bifunctional metalloporphyrins M(TTMAPP)I4(X) ( m = Co , Fe , Mn , and Cr ; x = AcO , C2F3O2 , C2Cl3O2 , OTs , Cl , Br , and I ) were synthesized and used to catalyze the synthesis of cyclic carbonate through the coupling reaction of terminal epoxides and CO2 . the effects of reaction temperature , various metals as the lewis acidic center , counterions , and recycling of the catalysts were studied . <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , 20-Tetra-(p-N,N,N-trimethylphenyl ammonium iodide)porphyrinium cobalt (III) acetate [Co(III)-(TTMAPP)I4(OAc)] was efficient in the coupling reaction of various terminal epoxides and CO2 at <nUm> K under <nUm> kPa of CO2 pressure without solvent and molar ratio of epoxide : catalyst = <nUm> . it gave a propylene carbonate yield of <nUm> % within <nUm> h . At <nUm> K in the presence of <nUm> ml methanol with the molar ratio of epoxide : catalyst = <nUm> , it gave a propylene carbonate yield of <nUm> % within <nUm> h . the catalyst could be recovered with diethyl ether and reused five times without significant loss of catalytic activity . 
A titanocene complex of e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyltri-p- chlorophynoxy-titanium [ cp* Ti(O-C6H4Cl-P) <nUm> ] was used in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst to catalyze propylene polymerization.The effects of polymerization conditions such as temperature and Al / Ti molar ratio ( nAl / nTi ) on catalytic activity and molecular weight of polypropylene obtained were investigated . it was found that under the given polymerization conditions the molecular weight of polypropylene increased as the polymerization proceeded at the early stage , and the molecular weight distribution remained narrow ( m w / Mn = <nUm> ∼ <nUm> ) , which displayed the behavior of quasi-living polymerization ; while the bimodal GPC profiles indicated a multi-site system at the early stage . In addition , a kinetics equation was presented to study propylene polymerizations at the depressing stage of polymerization rate , and the depressing coefficients under various conditions were obtained . with the depressing coefficient , the polymerization rate could be estimated at any time of the depressing stage . 
linear and multi-arm atactic polystyrene with functional groups -OH was synthesized via living free radical polymerization promoted by titanocene complexes in the presence of glycidyl-4-methoxyphenyl ether ( I1 ) , <nUm> , 4-butanediol diglycidyl ether ( I2 ) , <nUm> , 4'-methylenebis ( N , n-diglycidylaniline ) ( I4 ) and poly [ ( phenylglycidyl ether)-co-formaldehyde ] ( I5 ) as initiators , and Sn as reducing agent in this catalyst system . the polymerization mechanism was expatiated . In this article , for the first time , titanocene complexes , for example CpTi ( IV ) Cl <nUm> was treated with Sn to form primary free radical CpTi '' ( III ) Cl at room temperature , this radical reacted with epoxide ( initiator ) to give the chain radical which initiated styrene to propagate successfully . the effect of polymerization conditions , such as the structure of the initiator and titanocene complexes , as well as the ratio of initiator to monomers on the performance was investigated . the properties of the obtained polymer were also characterized by GPC . these results showed that the structure of initiator had little influence on the conversion of monomer , the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the obtained polymer . compared with (n-BuCp)2TiCl2 and SiMe2 ( ind ) 2TiCl2 , half - titanocene , CpTICl3 was favorable for the polymerization of styrene via radical mechanism . the monomer conversion was more than <nUm> % , the molecular weight of the polymer was higher than <nUm> × <nUm> , and the molecular weight distribution was at the range of <nUm> to <nUm> . however , when (n-BuCp)2 Cl2Ti and SiMe2 (Ind)2TiCl2 were used as catalysts , the monomer conversion and the molecular weight of the obtained polymer were lower . but the structure of titanocene complex had less impact on the molecular weight distribution ( <nUm> - <nUm> ) . the effect of the ratio of monomer to initiator on the polymerization performance was also studied . A linear dependence of m n of the obtained polymer on the monomer concentration was observed at the ratio of <nUm> / <nUm> , <nUm> / <nUm> and <nUm> / <nUm> . Mn of the obtained polymer increased with increasing the ratio of monomer to initiator , and the molecular weight distribution of the obtained polymer kept at the range of <nUm> to <nUm> . the obtained polymer was also characterized by C - NMR to confirm the atactic structure of the polymer . these results indicated living the free radical mechanism of polymerization . 
modification of polyethylene with polar groups and / or polar polymer side chains has been an issue for both academic and industry fields for a long time . many method have been presented to prepare functional polyethylene , among which the post-functional method has find its industry applications . however , this method shows many disadvantages in controlling polymer structure . the reactive monomer method is characterized by good control of polymer chain structure . we have prepared an ethylene / p-allyltoluene copolymer by et ( ind ) 2ZrCl2 / MAO . this copolymer can be transferred to polyethylene graft copolymers using graft-from technique from the site of benzyl groups . In this paper , copolymerization of ethylene with three kinds of o-p-methylphenyl-a-olefins,p-methylphenyl-1-propylene ( AC <nUm> ) , 4-p-methylphenyl-1-butene ( BC4 ) and 6-p-methylphenyl-1-hexene ( C6H ) using et (Ind)2ZrCl <nUm> / MAO as a catalyst was performed in order to compare the copolymerization abilities of the three reactive comonomers . three comonomers were synthesized by the coupling reactions between benzyl or aryl metal ( magnesium or lithium ) and alkenyl halide . the comonomers were purified to get the polymerization grade . ethylene / reactive comonomer copolymerization was carried out under <nUm> × <nUm> Pa of ethylene with variations of the comonomer quality in the feed . the copolymers were characterized with 1H - NMR , 13C - NMR , GPC and DSC . with the feed of comonomers the catalyst activity increased , reached a maximum value and then decreased . under the same concentration of comonomers , the highest catalyst activity occurred in the BC4 system . the content of comonomer in copolymers increased with the comonomer in the feed . under the same concentration of comonomers , the content of comonomer in copolymers could be used to compare the copolymerization ability of the comonomers . the examination results showed that the best copolymerization ability came from BC4 . with the increase of the content of comonomer in copolymers , the melting point of copolymers decreases , and the peak in DCS curves becomes broad . this is because the incorporation of comonomers destroyed the crystal of polyethylene . the incorporation of comonomers in copolymers caused a decrease in polymer molecular weight . the possible reason was that more b-H chain transfer reactions were induced by the comonomer . three kinds of copolymers were characterized with 1H-and 13C - NMR , all of the H and C atoms could be found in their NMR spectra . and no evidence proved that two comonomer molecules were connected directly . the above results showed that BC4 was a favorable comonomer which had the best incorporation ability . 
this paper demonstrates the successful synthesis of reactive isotacticpolypropylene terminated with styryl groups . the styryl group was introduced into the iPP chain end via chain transfer reaction to <nUm> , 4divinylbenzene or <nUm> , 2-bis ( 4-vinylphenyl ) ethane , during metallocene - catalyzed propylene polymerization by rac-Me2Si[2-Me-4-Ph(Ind)] 2ZrCl2 / MAO complex in the presence of hydrogen . although hydrogen does not influence the polymer molecular weight , it greatly affects the catalyst activity . the iPP molecular weight is strongly dependent on the concentration of chain transfer agent . the isotacticity ( mmmm ) of iPP macromonomers is quite high ( ≥ <nUm> % ) . the polymerization mechanism was also studied by using deuterium as labelled molecule of hydrogen in combination with 13C - NMR technique , and it is clear that the existent double enchainment of chain transfer agent is because the styryl-capped polymer chain would spontaneously insert into Zr - H species with the unique <nUm> , 2-manner . the reactive iPP obtained was used as building block , and two kinds of topological structural polymers were synthesized . styryl-capped iPP was copolymerized with styrene using CpTiCl3 / MAO complex to produce sPS-g-iPP copolymer . crude copolymer was subjected to extraction with chloroform which resulted in pure graft copolymer free of styryl-capped iPP . DSC results show thatT m , xc , and Tc of sPS main chains and iPP side chains are all lower than those of the sPS and iPP homopolymers , separately . the appearance of extremely large supercoolings in sPS main chains is attributed to crystallization starting from homogeneous nuclei in isolated microdomains of graft copolymers which are generated by phase segregation . In addition , the terminal styryl groups of iPP were effectively transformed to azido groups through chlorination and substitutional reaction , and azido-capped iPP was obtained . then , the click reaction between azido-capped iPP and trialkyne - containing couple agent was conducted in the presence of BrCu / PMDETA . 1H - NMR results indicated that the click reaction was fast and highly efficient , and star isopolypropylene was synthesized . 
the selective catalytic hydrogenation of living styrene-butadiene copolymer ( SBS ) prepared in the presence of metallocene catalyst modified by methyl benzoate was studied . the effects of factors , such as number - average molecular weight ( Mn ) of SBS,on the hydrogenation degree of the copolymers under different experimental conditions were discussed . the results show that when the ratio of Ti to <nUm> g dry copolymer is in the range of <nUm> . <nUm> <nUm> . <nUm> mmol,adding methyl benzoate in a special mode can significantly improve the activity of titanocene catalyst . the hydrogenation degree of both SBS basic copolymers with Mn of <nUm> . <nUm> × <nUm> and <nUm> . <nUm> × <nUm> respectively are < <nUm> . <nUm> % after reaction for <nUm> min in the case of using metallocene catalyst not modified by methyl benzoate . on the other hand,the hydrogenation degree of the same SBS samples is ≥ <nUm> . <nUm> % after reaction for <nUm> - <nUm> min under the condition of using the modified metallocene catalyst . In contrast with the similar researches reported before , our experiments could shorten the hydrogenation time by <nUm> - <nUm> min . when the ratio of Ti to <nUm> g dry copolymer falls in the range of <nUm> . <nUm> <nUm> . <nUm> mmol,the hydrogenation degree of the SBS basic copolymer is affected by magnitude of the Mn . for <nUm> min after the reaction , the hydrogenation degree of SBS copolymer with m n of <nUm> . <nUm> × <nUm> is ≥ <nUm> . <nUm> % whereas that of the copolymer with Mn of <nUm> . <nUm> × <nUm> is < <nUm> . <nUm> % . the disparity in hydrogenation degree between the two SBS copolymers is gradually diminished as the hydrogenation process proceeds and becomes unobvious after reaction for <nUm> min . In such a case the hydrogenation degree of both SBS basic copolymers are ≥ <nUm> % . the effect of every influential factor on the hydrogenation degree of the SBS copolymers is elucidated in terms of the hydrogenation mechanism . 
after ClMg <nUm> was dissolved in ethanol with the ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> in mole at <nUm> & degC , the solution was cooled to <nUm> ° C and transferred to the cooling liquid consisting of n-hexane ( <nUm> mL ) and wax ( <nUm> . <nUm> g ) at O ° . precipitate was produced . filtrated and washed with n-hexane,the residue was dried by vacuum at <nUm> ° ,and ClMg 2-CH 3CH 2OH particles were obtained . the size of the particles determined by TEM was at the range from <nUm> nm to <nUm> nm . the nano-sized particles of ClMg 2-CH 3CH 2OH could become nano wires by self - assembly technology at room temperature . WAXD results showed that the crystallinity of the obtained nano-sized ClMg 2CH 3CH 2OH particles became poor , just a broad and weak signal at 20th = <nUm> ° ∼ <nUm> ° was observed , while ClMg <nUm> showed four sharp signals at 20th = <nUm> ° , <nUm> ° , <nUm> ° and <nUm> ° . the obtained particles were useful as support for preparing nano-sized ziegler - natta catalysts . it was confirmed that the prepared catalysts may efficiently polymerize ethylene to form polymer particles with <nUm> ∼ <nUm> nm or <nUm> ∼ <nUm> m,m in diameter , respectively . 
A series of Cr (III) complexes based on quinoline-cyclopentadienyl ligands with additional hemilabile side arms were prepared and used as single - site catalyst precursors for ethylene polymerization . the additional donor functions interact with the metal centers only after activation with the co-catalyst . evidence for this comes from DFT - calculations and from the differing behavior of the complexes in ethylene polymerization . all complexes investigated show very high catalytic activity and the additional side arm minimizes chain - transfer reactions , leading to increase of molecular weights of the resulting polymers . 
to improve the bio-solubility and sustained - release properties of a carbon nanotube (CNT)-drug complex , the present study used a hydrophilic polymer , polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , and b-estradiol ( E2 ) , which targets the estrogen receptor in human breast cancer cells ( BCCsH ) , to modify CNTs carrying lobaplatin ( LBP ) to form E2-PEG-CNT-LBP . the in vitro inhibitory effects against BCCsH and the in vivo pharmacological effect of the complex on heart , liver and kidney tissues were also evaluated . the results indicated that the inhibitory effects of this complex against BCCsH reached <nUm> % within <nUm> h . A blood biochemical test of normal mice indicated that this complex reduced platelet counts , while aspartate aminotransferase levels were increased compared with those in the control group . histopathological analysis revealed no obvious adverse effects on the heart , liver and kidneys . the in vivo results indicated that the novel E2-PEG-CNT-LBP complex had no obvious toxic effects while exhibiting sustained - release properties . the clearance of E2-PEG-CNT-LBP by non-specific uptake systems was delayed and its clearance was increased compared with LBP alone . 
the method of UV / visible absorption spectroscopy for olefin catalytic system was introduced in this paper , whose testing condition was much closer to the polymerization conditions . the actions of olefin polymerization catalyst (dbm)2ZrCl2 with cocatalyst AlEt2Cl ( or MAO ) were investigated by UV / visible absorption spectroscopy at atmosphere temperature . it was shown that the UV / visible main absorption band of the zirconocenium , which can be related to the ligand to metal charge transfer bands ( LMCT ) , varies greatly upon incremental addition of AlEt2Cl or MAO . for the low molar ratios of Al / Zr in the catalytic system , there was the substitution of an electron withdrawing chlorine atom by a donating alkyl group . then a hypsochromic shift of the initial catalyst absorption band , corresponding to the monomethylation of the catalyst , was observed in each catalytic system (dbm)2ZrCl2 / AlEt2Cl ( or (dbm)2ZrCl2 / MAO ) . on the contrary , further addition of AlEt2Cl ( or MAO ) was accompanied by a continuous bathochromic shift of the maximal wavelength , which corresponding to the formation of more dissociated ionic active species . then , there would be a coordination of monomer to the ionic active species . 
copolymerization of norbornene(NBE) with isoprene(IP) catalyzed by traditional ziegler - natta system composed of ClTi <nUm> and Al(i-Bu) <nUm> was studied . the PNBE-co-IP copolymers obtained have number - average molecular weights of <nUm> × <nUm> 4-6.5 × <nUm> <nUm> as well as relatively narrow molecular weight distribution from the range of <nUm> to <nUm> , and soluble in common organic solvents . the influences of catalyst composition , polymerization conditions , and the monomer feeding ratio on the copolymerization were investigated . the copolymer with <nUm> % yield , <nUm> % ( molar fraction ) of NBE , and number - average molecular weight of <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> can be prepared under the following optimum conditions : n(NBE) : n(IP) = <nUm> : <nUm> , n(Al) : n(Ti) = <nUm> : <nUm> , n(Monomer) : n(Ti) = <nUm> : <nUm> , <nUm> ° C , polymerized in toluene for <nUm> h . the NBE content in copolymer can be controlled in the range of <nUm> % <nUm> % by varying the feeding ratio of comonomer , and the T g of the copolymer increased with the increasing of NBE content in copolymer . the microstructures of the obtained copolymers were confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C DEPT135 NMR , and indicate that the NBE monomer undergo an addition - type polymerization during the copolymerization with isoprene . the reactivity ratios of two monomers were determined to be r NBE = <nUm> and r IP = <nUm> by the kelen - tudos method . 
heterogeneous Z-N catalysts were prepared by loading Cl4Ti on a mixture of modified nanoclays and functionalized carbon nanotubes as effective composite nanofillers in magnesium chloride . the polyethylene nanocomposites were produced via in-situ polymerization . the properties of nanocomposites were studied by controlling the content of montmorillonite ( MMT ) , multi-walled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs ) in Cl2Mg . highly active polymerization catalyst with the nanofillers containing MMT , modified MWCNTs and Cl2Mg could be obtained . mechanical properties of polyethylene containing composite nanofillers were better than those of polyethylene resin containing only one kind of nanofiller . WAXD analysis of the composites indicated that composite nanofillers of low content were uniformly dispersed in PE matrix and played an effective enhancement effect . 
the effect of reaction temperature , molar ratio of Al / Cr and ionic liquid concentration on catalytic activity and product distribution was investigated . the results showed that compared with homogeneous catalysis system , the action of catalytic active center in biphase systems changed from ethylene tetramerization to ethylene trimerization . 1-C6 = selectivity was up to <nUm> % . the product existed in the organic solvent while the catalyst was dissolved in ionic liquids , which made the separation of product and recycle of catalyst easy . 
the immobilization of catalytic groups onto a dendrimer either at the core or periphery might give rise to the catalytic properties of catalyst , such as the stability , selectivity , reactivity , etc . these advantageous properties can be defined as a positive dendritic effect . As a novel support , dendrimer is utilized in many catalytic reactions , olefin polymerization being one of them because of the positive dendritic effect and the combination of the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis . the appearance of positive dendritic effect in olefin polymerization from the recent literature will be reviewed . the elements contributing to the positive dendritic effect will be discussed , as well as prospects for further work in this field .

A new process synthesizing oil - soluble drag reducing agent was suggested . the drag reducing efficiency of DRA was determined in simulative loop evaluation apparatus . the results showed that the slurry polymerization process was simple , by which drag reducing efficiency of the product DRA could reach <nUm> % with the intrinsic viscosity [e] of <nUm> dL / g . 
for exploring the reason that the bis[N,N'-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl) imino]acenaphthene dibromonickel catalyst ca n't catalyze the ethylene / norbornene random copolymerization , by using the gaussian software and the density functional theory(DFT) , the copolymerization was divided into three stages : the energy competition of ethylene and norbornene in initiation , the energy competition of ethylene and norbornene in reinsertion , the energy competition of the ethylene ft - hydride transfer and chain propagation . calculating the kinetic energy of each phase by sequence , the results show that three advantage reactions in each phase are norbornene initiation , ethylene rein - sertion , ethylene hydride transfer . they would form a circulation system , so that the copolymerization only produces the short chain product , resulting in non-product copolymerization .

poly(aryl imino sulphone)s ( PAIS ) as novel high - performance polymers have been obtained by the condensation polymerization of 4,4'-dibromodiphenyl solfone with different primary aromatic diamines via palladium - catalyzed aryl amination reaction . the structure of polymers synthesized was characterized by means of FT-IR , NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis , the results showed an agreement with the proposed structure . differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and thermal analysis ( TG ) measurements showed that polymers possessed high glass transition temperature ( tg > <nUm> ° C ) and good thermal stability with high decomposition temperatures ( TD > <nUm> ° C ) . these novel polymers also exhibited good mechanical behaviors and good solubility . 
systems including diphenylzinc , metallocene , and methylaluminoxane , at various combinations has been attempted , as initiating systems for homo- and copolymerization of styrene and various styrene related comonomers including : substituted styrenes , styrene derivatives , a-olefins , dienes and more recently cycohexenes including norbornene . the used metallocenes were those containing titanium , zirconium and for comparatives reasons hafnium . the metallocene efficiency towards syndiotactic polystyrene polymerization showed the order : titanocene > zirconocene > hafnocene . while the polymerization as well the copolymerization of styrene with related to styrene compounds resulted to be much influenced by both electrical and steric hindrance effect . for styrene substituted derivative those group or element having I+ inductive effect depending its position at styrene 's its phenyl ring favours homopolymerization as well their copolymerization with styrene . the steric hindrance also showed a determinant influence on reactivity , so methyl and tert-butyl group , having a I+ effect , when at para-position improve activity and stereoregularity of their polymerization processes . but when placing at orto - position showed a very low capacity to polymerize . the present and previous results indicate that polymerization processes are initiated by monomer coordination to active metal species either of the binary metallocene - MAO or of the ternary Ph2Zn-metallocene-MAO . 
the two different kinds of impregnation ( in situ and ex situ ) were used in the heterogeneous copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene for production of LLDPE / silica composite . for the ex situ impregnation , MMAO cocatalyst was immobilized firmly onto the silica support through washing and drying step before introducing the powder of MMAO / silica support into the copolymerization system . for the in situ impregnation , MMAO was only contacted with silica support for the short period of time before bringing all of the slurry of MMAO / silica support into the copolymerization system . by comparing the catalytic activity between two methods , it was found that the in situ impregnation provided the higher one beneficial from the lower interaction between MMAO and silica due to lower contacting time . the lower interaction enhanced the reactivity of MMAO toward zirconocene catalyst during activation process thus leading to the higher catalytic activity . the said interaction can be proven by thermal gravimetric analysis ( TGA ) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) analysis . In addition , the obtained polymers were further characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , 13C - NMR spectroscopy ( NMR ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) . 
different mesoporous titanias synthesized by hydrolysis and polycondensation reactions of tetrabutyl titanate with various hydrolysis ratios ( H 2O / Ti by mole ) were employed as supports for zirconocene / MAO catalysts in ethylene / 1-olefin copolymerization . the pure anatase phase of titania was detected by x-ray diffraction ( XRD ) and the morphology was seen by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . the titania obtained was then impregnated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the amounts of [Al]MAO were measured by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy ( EDX ) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) . the copolymerization of ethylene / 1-hexene ( EH ) and ethylene / 1-octene ( EO ) was performed using titania - supported zirconocene / MAO catalysts . upon polymerization , it was found that the high surface area of titania apparently exhibited high polymerization activity due to large amounts of [Al]MAO present as seen by EDX and XPS . the obtained copolymer was further characterized by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance ( 13C NMR ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) . it revealed that based on 13C NMR , the random copolymer was obtained for both EH and EO systems . however , EH copolymer exhibited higher melting temperature ( T m ) than EO copolymer indicating that the EH system had less comonomer incorporation . 
Nano-TiO2 and its modification with gallium ( nano-TiO2-Ga ) and zirconium ( nano-TiO2-Zr ) were used here as nanofillers in production of linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) . the nanoparticles were immobilized by modified-methyl aluminoxane ( MMAO ) to be a catalytic filler prior to introducing into the in situ polymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene using zirconocene catalyst , and consequently produced LLDPE / O2Ti nanocomposites . it was found that the modified nano-TiO2 by Ga and Zr can hold more amount of MMAO on the surface than the unmodified one . this is because the modified particles have a stronger interaction between MMAO and the surface , as observed by thermal gravimetric analysis ( TGA ) . however , the stronger interaction leads to lower catalytic activities for the polymerization systems . observing from the molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) of the resulting products , it was found that the modified nano-TiO2 with Ga can produce the LLDPE / O2Ti nanocomposites with bimodal MWD . this result was due to the heterogeneity of the surface after modification , which can generate the multiple active sites for the catalyst , leading to multimodal properties of the polymer . 
ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization was performed over titania - supported zirconocene / dMMAO catalysts . effects of titania having different phases on the catalytic activity and polymer properties were investigated . it was found that anatase titania exhibited the highest catalytic activity , and afforded copolymer with high 1-hexene incorporation among other titanias . according to TGA result , the stronger interaction between dMMAO and titania for anatase phase led to the highest catalytic activity , because the stronger interaction between cocatalyst and support would prevent the leaching of cocatalyst . additionally , based on EDX mapping , a good dispersion of dMMAO over support surface is another reason for an increase in the catalytic activity . SEM analysis indicated that no significant change in polymer morphology was found for all supported catalysts . the incorporation of 1-hexene determined by 13C NMR suggested that titania which possessed high amount of Al.dMMAO over support surface showed high ability to incorporate 1-hexene . the random copolymers were produced in all systems . 
In this study , the polyethylene filled celluloses regarded as biocomposites was produced via in situ polymerization with zirconocene / MMAO catalyst . three types of celluloses including microcrystalline cellulose ( MCC ) , bacterial cellulose prepared from pineapple shell extract ( BCP ) , and bacterial cellulose prepared from coconut ( BCC ) were used as fillers and also catalytic support in the polymerization system . it was found that the presence of cellulose fillers slightly decreased catalytic activity of the polymerization system , but it was still higher compared with that of other natural fillers such as coir dust . this is caused by the lower impurity of cellulose . the MCC provided the highest catalytic activity among all cellulose fillers . the obtained biocomposites were characterized with different techniques including scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) and thermal gravimetric analysis ( TGA ) . it was observed that all obtained biocomposites exhibited good morphology compared with the neat polyethylene . thermal stability of the polymers was improved with the cellulose fillers . 
coulson ( ZINDO ) , mulliken ( MP2 / 6-31G* ) and natural ( MP2 / 6-31G* ) population analyses of several large molecules were performed by the fragment reassociation ( FR ) method . the agreement between the conventional ZINDO ( or conventional MP2 ) and FR - ZINDO ( or FR - MP2 ) charges of these molecules was excellent . the standard deviations of the FR - ZINDO net atomic charges from the conventional ZINDO net atomic charges were <nUm> for C5H11 ( <nUm> atoms ) , <nUm> for NH2-C16O2H28-COOH ( <nUm> atoms ) , <nUm> for NH3+-C16O2H28-COOH ( <nUm> atoms ) , <nUm> for NH2-C16O2H28-COO- ( <nUm> atoms ) , <nUm> for NH3+-C16O2H28- COO- ( <nUm> atoms ) , <nUm> for a conjugated model ( O = CH - ( CH = CH)15-C = O-(CH = CH)12-CH = CH2 ) , <nUm> atoms ) , <nUm> for aglycoristocetin ( C60N7O19H52+ , <nUm> atoms ) , <nUm> for a polypropylene model complexed with a zirconocene catalyst ( C68H121Zr+ , <nUm> atoms ) and <nUm> for magainin ( C112H177N29O28S , <nUm> atoms ) , respectively . the standard deviations of the FR - MP2 mulliken ( or natural ) partial atomic charges from the conventional ones were <nUm> ( or <nUm> ) for C5H11 , <nUm> ( or <nUm> ) for NH2-C16O2H28-COOH and <nUm> ( or <nUm> ) for NH3+-C16O2H28- COO- , respectively . these errors were attributed to the shape of molecules , the choice of fragments and the degree of ionic characters of molecules as well as the choice of methods . the CPU time of aglycoristocetin , conjugated model , polypropylene model complexed with zirconocene and magainin computed by the FR - ZINDO method was respectively <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> times faster than that by the normal ZINDO method . the CPU time of NH2-C16O2H28-COOH and NH3+-C16O2H28- COO- computed by the FR - MP2 method was , respectively , <nUm> and <nUm> times faster than that by the normal MP2 method . the largest molecule calculated by the FR - ZINDO method was B-DNA ( <nUm> atoms ) . these results will enable us to compute atomic charges of huge molecules near future .

highly efficient catalytic reactions have been achieved via activation of Si-H bonds of organohydrosilanes by triruthenium carbonyl clusters bearing bridging acenaphthylene or azulene ligands . A ruthenium complex , ( μ <nUm> , n2:n3:n 5-acenaphthylene)Ru3(CO)7 ( 1 ) catalyzes hydrosilylation of ketones and aldehydes in solution at room temperature to form the corresponding silyl ether in high yields . prior activation of the catalyst by excess amounts of the hydrosilane results in dramatic increase of the catalytic activity . application of the hydrosilylation catalyzed by preactivated <nUm> to the reduction of carboxylic acids and their derivatives has provided efficient preparative methods for silyl and alkyl ethers from esters , silyl ethers from carboxylic acids , and amines from amides , which are hardly achieved with other transition metal catalysts . the cluster <nUm> also behaves as an active catalyst for ring - opening polymerization of cyclic ethers and cyclic siloxanes and addition polymerization of vinyl ethers , which are induced by hydrosilanes . spectroscopic analysis of the polymers obtained reveals existence of an organosilyl moiety at the end group , which is useful for further chemical transformation of the formed polymer . isolation , characterization , and reactions of possible catalytically active species help discussion on the reaction mechanisms , in which a triruthenium hydridosilyl cluster is involved in the catalytic cycle . 
this article reviews our recent studies on cyclopolymerization of 1,6-heptadiene derivatives catalyzed by late transition metal complexes . Pd - diimine complexes initiate cyclopolymerization of the 1,6-heptadienes with functional groups to afford the polymers containing functionalized trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclopentane rings along the polymer chain . copolymerization of the dienes with ethylene and a-olefins also causes quantitative cyclization of the diene during the polymer growth . 1,6-Octadiene and higher mono-terminal dienes undergo the cyclopolymerization accompanied by chain walking of the growing polymer , leading to the polymers with trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclopentane groups located regularly along the linear polymer chain . the Fe and Co complexes with a bis(imino)pyridine ligand promote the polymerization of unsubstituted 1,6-heptadiene with quantitative cyclization to yield the polymers containing five - membered rings . the Fe complex - catalyzed reaction affords the polymers composed of cis-fused five - membered rings , whereas the polymer obtained by using Co catalyst contains trans-fused rings selectively .

the half - sandwich mono - and dialkyl rare earth metal complexes are prepared either by the alkane elimination reactions or by the metathetical reactions . half - sandwich scandium alkyl complex bearing the silylene-linked cyclopentadienyl- amido ligand can serve as a unique catalyst for the ortho-selective C-H silylation of various alkoxy-substituted benzene derivatives without requirement for a hydrogen acceptor to achieve high conversion . the reaction of the dialkyl complexes with an equivalent of a borate compound such as [Ph3C] [B(C6F5)4] generates easily the corresponding cationic monoalkyl species , which serve as excellent catalysts for the polymerization and copolymerization of a variety of olefins to yield a new family of polymer materials that show novel properties but are difficult to prepare by other catalysts . mechanistic aspects of these catalytic processes are also described . 
it is well known that the mechanical properties of highly isotactic polypropene depend on the crystalline structure of the material . up to now , the polymer properties were modified by varying either the processing conditions - e.g. , extrusion , annealing etc. - or the composition - e.g. , blending , nucleation . highly active ethylene bridged C1 - symmetric zirconocene catalysts can be used to design the material properties by varying the crystallinity of thermoplastic ( elastic ) polypropenes . with the new unsymmetric catalyst rac-dichloro[1-(9-fluorenyl)-2-(R , s)-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methylinden-1-e5-yl)ethane]zirconium ( IV ) / MAO ( 1 ) polypropenes of variable isotacticities are accessible . the variable and thus defined use of two different sides of the catalytically active species allows the placement of single , cumulated and consecutive [rr] - triads within an isotactic polymer chain . the formation of these stereoerrors is adjusted in an arbitrary manner by the polymerization conditions temperature and monomer concentration . the mechanical properties of polypropenes produced with <nUm> / MAO vary from tough thermoplastic to excellent elastic . stress - strain behavior of these physically crosslinked elastomers can be designed similar to the ones of polyisoprene or partly crosslinked natural rubber .

metallacycles , especially those small rings , play an important role in the field of organometallic and coordination chemistry . they are considered as reactive intermediates in metal promoted or catalyzed reactions including olefin metathesis reactions and alkyne polymerization reactions . due to the high ring strain , small metallacycles can easily react with unsaturated compounds to produce ring expansion products with lower ring strain . to further understand the importance of small metallacycle intermediates in the catalytic reactions and synthesis methodology , the ring expansion reactions of several typical three- , four- and five - membered metallacycles is summarize .

In order to study the effect of the benzyl benzene ring on the catalytic behavior of binuclear metallocene , the binuclear metallocene [m,m-1,4-(CH2)2(C6H4)] [(e5-C5H5)TiCl2(e5-(C6H5)C(Me)2(C5H3)]2 [(TiBz)2] is synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR , 13C NMR , mass spectra and elemental analysis . when combined with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , the (TiBz)2 / MAO system catalyzed ethylene polymerization and the polymer with C(4) branch were obtained . it is suggested that the C(4) branch is from the ethylene trimerization by the weak effect between the benzyl and center metal . the (TiBz)2 / MAO system also showed great ability for ethylene copolymerization with 1-hexene and the incorporation of 1-hexene in polymer reached up to <nUm> mol % . the 13C NMR result of polymer showed that the polymer contained alternatively copolymerized HEHE fragment and the possible mechanism is presented for explaining the special catalytic behavior . it is the weak effect between the benzyl and center metal that led to the alternative insertion of ethylene and 1-hexene , and the narrow molecular weight distribution ( PDI = <nUm> ) meant that there could be a great synergistic effect between the two activate center metals in the polymerization process , which greatly increased the copolymerization capability . 
tritertbutylphosphinimine phenoxy titanium complexes (t-Bu3)PNTi(OAr)Cl2 [ Ar = C6H5(4a) , 2,6-Me2C6H3 ( 4b ) , 2,6-i-Pr2C6H3 ( 4c ) and 2,6-t-Bu2C6H3 ( 4d ) ] were synthesized via the reaction of corresponding substituted phenol lithium salts with tritertbutylphosphinimine trichloride titanium ( 3 ) . the compounds were characterized by means of 1H NMR , 13C NMR , 31P NMR spectroscopic and elemental analyses , and the molecular structures of <nUm> , 4b and 4d were further confirmed by single - crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . when activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , 4a ~ 4d displayed not only high catalytic activities , but also increasing performances on ethylene polymerization with increasing the sterical hindrance of substituents . furthermore , 4c depicted a good thermal stability , with which the polyethylene products of different molecular weights and molecular weight distributions can be obtained by tuning the polymerization conditions .

while the metallocene catalysts were widely used to produce the metallocene polypropylenes ( mPP ) in other countries , the traditional ziegler - natta catalyst has still been dominantly employed for manufacturing the polypropylenes ( PP ) in our country at current time . the property of the mPP appears more improved than that of the PP produced by the ziegler - natta catalyst , and the market demand for the mPP is worldwidely increasing every year . therefore , it is urgent to develop the metallocene catalysts for the industrial use in domestic companies . the metallocene catalysts are of versatile structures , which are able to show more exact control over the propylene polymerization activity and the polypropylene stereostructures than the ziegler - natta catalyst , and thus catalyze to generate new PPs of the diverse structures . this manuscript will give a detailed summary on the metallocene catalysts so far reported . the important factors such as temperature , propylene pressure , catalyst concentration , cocatalyst types and so on will be illustrated , which all have significant influence on the catalytic reaction activity . the reaction mechanism will be discussed as well . 
the synthesized novel 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic titanium complex was used as catalyst for ethylene and norbornene copolymerization . the polymerization behavior of synthesized titanium complex was typically studied by varying various parameters , types of cocatalyst , concentration of norbornene , Al / Ti molar ratio , polymerization temperature and pressure . the resulting copolymers were characterized by 13C NMR , DSC and GPC . it was found that when methylaluminoxane(MAO) was used as cocatalyst , the catalytic activity was higher than that of triethyl aluminum(TEA) as cocatalyst under the same condition , and the copolymerization reaction mechanism was addition polymerization . In addition , the GPC curves of the copolymers showed a unimodal with a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution ( mw / Mn ≈ <nUm> ) . the incorporation ratio of the norbornene linear increased with the increase of norbornene feed ratio , while the melting point of the resulting copolymer was decreased with the norbornene feed ratio .

all right reserved.Within large - volume polyolefin materials , the value - adding polyolefins have been commonly produced through the copolymerization of ethylene with a-olefin . the IV B metal complexes have provided various models of precatalysts toward a-olefin polymerization and copolymerization . meanwhile those metal complexes have also been used as the intermediates or active species in order to understand the mechanism of olefin copolymerization . targeting a practicing catalytic system for polyolefin industry , the IV B metal complexes would meet the demands of highly active catalysis , moreover , the catalytic systems should be remained enough stable at the elevated temperature . to have value - adding materials for higher profits , the catalytic system could be adaptable for polyolefins with various properties through being operated under different parameters ; such features have been fitted well to IV B metal precatalysts , which achieve to produce polyolefins with the molecular weights in the useful range from medium to ultrahigh due to different polymerization conditions as well as functionalized polyolefins through the copolymerization of ethylene with a-olefin containing functional groups . recent progress of IV B metal complexes for olefin polymerization and copolymerization has been reviewed herein , focusing on different metal complexes being classified due to groups of their ligands used . moreover , the correlation between structures of metal complexes and their catalytic activity have been considered along with reaction temperatures . 
all right reserved.Titanium - based catalysts have been not only providing major catalyses in conventionally producing massive polyolefins with low cost as well as good properties , but also advancing the properties of new polyolefins for new plastic materials . therefore it has been a core consideration of finely tuning the structures of titanium complexes and enhancing catalytic performances of the olefin polymerization . besides metallocene catalysts , titanium complexes bearing multi-dentate ligands have been maintained as hot topics , in which tridentate ligands positively stabilize titanium complexes . meanwhile variations of coordination atoms of those ligands greatly enrich the syntheses and manipulation of the catalytic activity of complexes , therefore controlling the polymerization activity as well as improving the microstructures and properties of resultant polyolefin materials . herein the recent progress of titanium complexes bearing tridentate ligands have been reviewed toward olefin polymerization , focusing on the electronic and steric influences of substituents within ligands on their catalytic activities and properties of resultant polyolefins . the observations would be helpful to design titanium complexes and correlations between activities of complexes and structures of ligands used . 
all right reserved.The recent study of the half - metallocene compounds ligated with nitrogen - containing groups as catalysts for precise olefin polymerization has been reviewed in this article . studies have found that these nitrogen - coordinated catalysts exhibit unique properties in the polymerization of olefin monomers , especially for the copolymerization of ethylene . these catalysts can not only obtain new copolymers , which can not be synthesized by ziegler - natta catalysts and traditional metallocene catalysts , but also show the copolymerization activities superior to other half - metallocene catalysts . modification of both cyclopentadienyl fragments and anionic ancillary donor ligands is the key for the improvement of polymerization behaviors . this article relates to the homopolymerization of ethylene and the copolymerization of ethylene with a-olefins(hexene-1 , octene-1 , etc. ) , styrene and cyclic olefins(norbornene , tetracyclododecene , etc ) . 
the present study describes the use of an epoxy functional fatty acid , 9,10-epoxy-18-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid ( EFA ) , extracted from birch ( betula pendula ) outer bark to produce thermosets . the purified epoxy fatty acid was polymerized by enzyme - catalyzed polycondensation utilizing candida antarctica lipase B ( CalB ) to form oligomers with targeted degrees of polymerization ( DP ) of <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> and obtained DPs of <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . it was determined that it is possible to first enzymatically polymerize and aliphatically endcap the epoxy functional fatty acid resulting in controlled oligomer lengths while also maintaining the epoxy functionality for further reaction by main - chain homo-epoxy cationic photopolymerization . the enzymatic polymerized oligomers were characterized in terms of conversion of the residual epoxy groups ( FT-IR ) , the thermal properties ( DSC , TGA ) and the purity by MALDI - TOF and 1H - NMR . the amorphous thermoset films with varying degrees of crosslinking resulting from the cationically photopolymerized oligomers , were characterized in terms of their thermal properties and residual epoxy content ( FT-IR ATR ) . the crosslinked polyesters formed insoluble , amorphous , and transparent films . this work demonstrates that thermoset films with designed properties can be effectively made with the use of forest products to reduce the petroleumbased plastics market .

tailoring polymer properties such as stiffness , strength , or processing requires control of the molecular architecture of the polymers . for the polymerization of olefins like propylene , the development of metallocene catalysts gives access to new polymer microstructures . during the last decade , major advances have been made in metallocene catalysis for polypropylenes , providing higher levels of control over composition , molecular mass distributions , and stereoregularity . this leads to a large variety of polypropylenes with varying types and degrees of stereoregularity,1-4 from amorphous or low - crystallinity types to highly stereoregular ones such as isotactic and syndiotactic polypropylene.4 owing to the regular arrangement of methyl groups , these stereoregular polypropylenes are semicrystalline materials with melting points above <nUm> ° C exhibiting typical thermoplastic deformation behavior ( thermoplast , figure <nUm> ) , but isotactic and syndiotactic polypropylene differ in elastic modulus and impact strength.5 In atactic polypropylenes , the statistically random arrangement of the methyl groups prevents crystallization . therefore , atactic polypropylenes are soft , amorphous polymers ranging from oils to soft , waxy materials ( wax , figure <nUm> ). <nUm> . 
the demonstration of single - site control over polymer stereochemistry by C2 - symmetric ansatitanocene and zirconocene catalysts in <nUm> and <nUm> ushered in a new era in alkene polymerization catalysis.1,2 since then , a plethora of ansa - metallocene ligand designs have been developed for the purpose of controlling the stereochemistry and molecular weight of the polymer product and for increasing the activity of the catalyst . besides numerous ring substitution patterns as well as the replacement of one ring with another moiety ( such as an amide ligand ) , different types of bridges have been used to alter both the geometry and electronic properties of the ansa - metallocene . for the most part , these bridges have consisted of relatively inert carbon-or silicon - based moieties . apart from a few phosphorus-3,4 and arsenic5 - bridged ansa - zirconocene complexes , examples of heteroatombridged group <nUm> ansa - metallocenes were scarce until about a decade ago , when the potential of the heteroatom to expand the functionality of the ansa - metallocene ligand and increase its influence on the polymerization properties of the catalyst was recognized . ( note : the term “ heteroatom ” is DK3712 : “ dk3712_c005 ” - <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> - <nUm> : <nUm> - page <nUm> - # <nUm> generally associated with any p-block element other than carbon ; however , in this chapter it refers to any p-block element outside of group <nUm> . ) so far , only boron , phosphorus , and arsenic have served as single heteroatom bridges in group <nUm> ansa - metallocene complexes , probably owing to the greater synthetic accessibility of these systems . ansa - metallocenes with a single oxygen or nitrogen atom joining the p ligands have not been developed , although these atoms have been combined with one or two other heteroatoms6-9 or have been flanked by carbon and silicon to form the backbone of the bridge.10-15 this chapter will focus only on ansa - metallocenes containing heteroatoms within the backbone of the bridge . heteroatombridged half sandwich complexes of the “ constrained - geometry ” type , in which thep - ligand is linked to an amide ligand,16-18 are also outside the scope of this chapter .

four new mixed - ring zirconium complexes , [ CH2 = CH(CH 2)n-C5H4](RC5H4)ZrCl <nUm> [ n = <nUm> , r = CH3OCH2CH2(3) ; n = <nUm> , r = C3H7O ( 4 ) ; n = <nUm> , r = Me3Si ( 5 ) ; n = <nUm> , r = allyl ( 6 ) ] , have been prepared by the reaction of CH2 = CH(CH2)nC5H4ZrCl 3* DME[n = <nUm> ( 1 ) ; n = <nUm> ( 2 ) ] with RC5H 4Li . when activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , the catalytic activities of the above complexes in ethylene polymerization were tested . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> show high activities similar to Cp2ZrCl <nUm> . introduction of methoxyethyl group into cp - ligand dramatically decreases the catalytic activities of complexes <nUm> and <nUm> , which can be overcome by increasing the amount of MAO . for complex <nUm> , the dependence of activity and molecular weight ( Mn ) on the Al / Zr ratio , the polymerization time ( tp ) , polymerization temperature ( TP ) and the polymerization solvent volume ( V ) was investigated . 
In order to compare with silylene-bridged group <nUm> metallocenes . C2 symmetric dimethylgermylene-bridged zirconocene and hafnocene dichlorides were prepared and employed as the catalyst for polymerization of propylene in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . germylene-bridged metallocenes always produced isotactic polypropylene of higher molecular weight than that produced by silylene-bridged analogues . the molecular structures of four metallocenes prepared from dimethylsilylene and germylenebis(2,3,5-trimethylcyclopentadienyl) were determined by x-ray diffraction and showed no substantial differences of geometry between silylene- and germylene-bridged ones . 
this paper describes ethylene polymerization using four kinds of zirconocene with different substituents in the cp ring as catalysts and aluminoxane as cocatalyst . polymerization activities , polymerization kinetics and me of resultant polyethylene were compared . it was found basically that polymerization activities were in the following order : A2 ≅ B2 > A1 > B1 [ A1 : ( CH2 = CH - CH2 - CH2 - cp)2 Cl2Zr ; B1 : ( CH2 = CH - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CP)2 Cl2Zr ; A2 : ( CH2 = C2H3 - CH2 - cp)2 Cl2Zr ; B2 : ( CH3 ( CH3 ) C = CH - CH2CP)2 CI2Zr ] . A novel kinetic model was developed based on the consideration of reactivation reaction . A possible mechanism of influence of different substituents in the cp ring on polymerization activities was discussed . 
copolymerizations of ethylene and a-olefin with various zirconocene compounds at a high temperature were carried out to study the relationship between the ligand structure of zirconocene compounds and the copolymerization behavior . all of the indenyl-based zirconocene compounds in combination with dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate / triisobutylaluminum produced only low molecular weight copolymers at a high temperature , regardless of the substituents and bridged structures of the zirconocene compounds . however , zirconocene compounds with a fluorenyl ligand gave rise to a significant increase in the activity and molecular weight of the copolymers by the selection of a diphenylmethylene bridge structure even at a high temperature . ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers obtained with the fluorenyl-based catalysts contained inner double bonds accompanied by the generation of hydrogen , presumably because of a C-H bond activation mechanism . the contents of the inner double bonds were significantly influenced by the polymerization conditions , including the 1-hexene feed content , polymerization temperature , and ethylene pressure . 
the primary silane p-TolSiH3 ( p-Tol = p-CH3C6H5 ) can be polymerized to poly(p-tolylsilane) with <nUm> mol % of both the chiral and achiral zirconocenes Cp2ZrCl2 , Cp(CpSi*)ZrCl2 , and (CpSi*)2ZrCl2 ( cp = CH , CpSi* = C5H4Si(CH3)2-(1R)-endo-(+)-OC10H17 ) in combination with <nUm> mol % of n-BuLi . generally , higher molecular weight linear polymers were obtained when using the substituted zirconocenes in comparison to the parent zirconocene , which in turn produced larger quantities of low-molecular-weight cyclic products . each polysilane sample was analyzed by 29Si{1H} DEPT and 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy . deconvolution of selected regions of the 29Si{1H} DEPT and the 1H NMR spectra for higher molecular weight linear polymers indicated that these catenates were predominantly atactic , on the basis of a triad level bernoullian statistical model . the data suggested that , in this case , chiral substitution of the zirconocene rings had no effect on the stereogrowth of the polysilane chain . 
zirconocene supported on alumina or magnesium chloride exhibits modest olefin polymerization activity but not when it is supported directly on silica . the surface silanol as well as siloxane groups must be passivated with appropriate reagents . A very active and stereospecific supported catalyst was obtained by first reacting silica with methylalumoxane and bisphenol A before the impregnation of the ansa - zirconocene precursor . the main difference between a homogeneous and supported catalyst is that at the same gross amount of metallocene , the net concentration of it in the pores of a support material is several orders of magnitude greater than it exists in solution thus the rate of deactivation in the former case is correspondingly faster than in the latter . most other supported metallocene catalysts based on supports such as zeolites , cyclodextrin , polymeric MAO , synthetic polymers , etc. , are poor in olefin polymerization for this and other reasons discussed . 
organometallic complexes , based on group IV metals , are of special fundamental and technological interest due to their important catalytic applications in many organic syntheses , including olefin polymerization and activation of small molecules . In this chapter , the orbital nature of excited states of organometallic p-complexes , based on group IV metals in the d0 electronic configuration , is surveyed , and their photophysical characteristics are discussed . emphasis is given to redox , photophysical , photochemical properties , and their generalization regarding extremely rare ligand - to - metal charge transfer ( LMCT ) excited states of group IV metallocenes , experimental quantities of the highest occupied ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied ( LUMO ) molecular orbitals , a trend in the HOMO-LUMO energy gap upon structural variations in the complexes . experimental key relations ehv ∝ DEredox are demonstrated for early transition metals ( Ti , Zr , and Hf ) . combination of photophysical and electrochemical methods provides first experimental estimate of both HOMO and LUMO relative energies and the HOMO- LUMO energy gap in organometallic p-complexes , having an early transition metal . the tendency in the observed photophysics ( absorption and luminescence spectra , experimental and radiative lifetimes , and emission quantum efficiencies ) in the homologous group IVB metallocenes is discussed in view of the nature of a d0 metal ion and coordination sphere of organometallic complexes . A d0 zirconocene dichloride is reported as a first group IV metal complex , possessing LMCT excited states with remarkable emission quantum yield ( up to <nUm> ) and excited - state lifetime ( in the range of microseconds ) in fluid solutions at room temperature surpassing those of pure LMCT excited states , reported in up - to - date literature . A photophysical approach to estimate the orbital nature of extremely long - lived LMCT excited states and coordinative interactions of basic components of catalytic systems for polymerization ( d0 bent metallocene precatalysts and unsaturated hydrocarbon substrates ) are discussed . orbital interactions between d0 bent metallocenes , unsaturated hydrocarbons , and organic solvents are rationalized in terms of microscopic ( electronic and structural peculiarities ) , rather than macroscopic ( dielectric constants , viscosity , etc. ) properties of the solvent molecules . the photophysical approach is highlighted to enable studying intermolecular ( including fine coordinative ) interactions in homogeneous systems with catalytic concentrations of metal complexes that can not be achieved by other conventional physico - chemical methods . 
the reactivity of group <nUm> zirconocene dichlorides incorporating (1-trimethylsilyl)-e5-indenyl ( Me3SiInd ) and e5-1-(trimethylsilyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydromdenyl ( Me3SiTHI ) ligands toward boron tribromide was investigated . whereas the reaction of (Me3SiInd)CpZrCl2 ( 1 ) with BBr3 in CCl2H2 immediately cleaved the indenyl ligand from the metal , (Me3SiTHI)CpZrCl2 ( 3 ) reacted with BBr3 in CCl2H2 at <nUm> ° C for <nUm> days to obtain [1-(BrSiMe2)THI]CpZrBr2 ( 6 ) in <nUm> % yield . the reaction of (Me3SiInd)Li ( <nUm> equiv ) with ZrCl4(THF)2 afforded pure rac-(Me3-SiInd)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) in <nUm> % yield . hydrogenation of ( 2 ) ( <nUm> bar , O2Pt catalyst ) afforded rac-(Me3-SiTHI)2ZrCl2 ( 4 ) in <nUm> % yield . single - crystal x-ray diffraction analysis of <nUm> showed that the Zr atom lies on a crystallographic C2 axis with the CH2 annelated rings projecting into the Cl2Zr hemisphere of the pseudotetrahedral coordination environment . the reaction of <nUm> with MeLi in toluene afforded rac-(Me3SiTHI)2ZrMe2 ( 5 ) in <nUm> % yield . 1H NMR and 13C NMR analysis confirmed the rac assignment for <nUm> . treatment of <nUm> with BBr3 in CCl2H2 at <nUm> ° C for <nUm> days afforded rac-[1-(BrMe2Si)THI]2ZrBr2 ( 7 ) in <nUm> % yield . the reaction of <nUm> with moisture in ambient air gave the ansa - metallocene rac-[m-O-(1-Me2SiTHI)2]ZrBr2 ( 8 ) in <nUm> % yield . In solution , <nUm> showed time - averaged C2 symmetry ( 1H NMR ) ; however , single - crystal x-ray diffraction analysis showed that <nUm> adopts an asymmetric conformation in which only one of the CH2 annelated rings projects into the Cl2Zr coordination hemisphere . neither <nUm> nor <nUm> served as a precatalyst for alumoxane - cocatalyzed , homogeneous propylene polymerization . 
homo- and copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene were conducted at different temperature and ethylene pressure with several zirconocenes activated with dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( Me2PhNH*B(C6F5) <nUm> ) / triisobutylaluminium ( i-Bu3Al ) to study the effect of ligand structure and polymerization conditions on catalytic activity , molecular weight and chain transfer reactions . At high temperature and low ethylene pressure , rac-ethylene(bisindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) activated with Me2PhNH*B(C6F5)4 / i-Bu 3Al initially gives a highly active catalyst that is rapidly deactivated . trans-Vinylene double bonds , which were not formed at low temperature , were detected in polyethylene synthesized at high temperature and low ethylene pressure . they reasonably arise from b-H transfer after isomerization reaction . the molecular weight of ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers decreases with increasing 1-hexene feed , followed by the formation of vinylidene end groups . this reveals that b-H transfer from propagating chains containing primary inserted 1-hexene as a terminal unit is predominant . this reaction is influenced by the ligand structure . At high temperature and high ethylene pressure , trans-vinylene and vinylidene contents decrease and the vinyl content increases , indicating that the high ethylene pressure controls b-H transfer after isomerization reaction .

A similar observation was made when 2b was used instead of 1b . the sterically more demanding 4b does not show this behaviour . the role of the ligands in ethylene polymerisation was investigated . 
the tantalum carborane complex (Et2C2B4H4)CpTaMe2 ( 1 ) is thermally stable but undergoes clean photochemical insertion with alkynes to give vinyltantalum species , in contrast to the thermal reactivity of isoelectronic group <nUm> metallocenes which give methylidene intermediates . certain tantalum vinyltitanium products display NMR resonances indicative of g-agostic Ta-H3C interactions sufficiently strong to stabilize two different regioisomers . decomposition of these species occurs by apparent alkyne deinsertion and ejection of the tantalum fragment to give R2Et2C4B4H4 ( r = me , et , ph ) carborane clusters . the analogous diphenyl complex (Et2C2B4H4)CpTaPh2 ( 8 ) is thermally reactive , eliminating benzene and undergoing trapping reactions of the derived benzyne intermediate with alkynes . the structures of the resulting metallaindene complexes are supported by x-ray crystallography , protonolysis , and spectroscopy . insertions occur with good regioselectivity , controlled by steric and stereoelectronic factors that differ somewhat from those observed for zirconocene and titanocene analogues . reaction of complex <nUm> with excess styrene results in a novel triple - insertion process in which styrene units are added to both ortho positions of an aryl ligand and to the central boron atom of the B3C2 ring . the proposed mechanism ( supported by the use of styrene-d8 and alkylated metallacarborane starting materials ) features two benzyne intermediates , derived from activation of both ortho-CH bonds , and one insertion into a putative Ta-B bond . an important hypothesis is that a Ta-C fragment can undergo intramolecular insertion into a carborane B-H bond , a step unknown for cyclopentadienyl C-H bonds and one that is potentially relevant to the use of metallacarborane complexes as catalysts for olefin polymerization and related processes . 
the polymerization behavior of three linear asymmetrically substituted dienes , i.e. 6-phenyl-1,5-hexadiene ( A ) , 7-methyl-1,6-octadiene ( B ) and r(+)-5,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene ( isocitronellene , C ) is reported in order to study the effect of substitution at one vinylic group . homopolymerization of these monomers with the catalyst system rac-Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 / MAO resulted in no reaction products in the case of monomer A and in polymers with mw , = <nUm> kg / mol and mw = <nUm> kg / mol with the monomers B and C , respectively . according to NMR analysis , the vinylene end group of isocitronellene remained untouched during polymerization , which excludes the possibility of cyclopolymerization or crosslinking . copolymerization of isocitronellene with propene resulted in incorporation of the diene ( <nUm> mol- % ) equal to the stoichiometric ratio in the monomer feed , with a relatively high catalyst activity . the degree of incorporated isocitronellene is inversely related to the polymerization temperature , providing control over crystallinity ( isotacticity ) and molecular weight of the copolymer . the isocitronellene homo- and copolymers could be epoxidized quantitatively and brominated to an extent of <nUm> % . perfluorohexyl iodide was grafted onto the isocitronellene / propene copolymer by radical reaction ( conversion <nUm> % ) , yielding a poly(a-olefin) with fluorinated side chains . 
unbridged 2-arylindenylmetallocene complexes such as bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) are catalyst precursors for the synthesis of elastomeric polypropylenes . these catalysts are also active for the copolymerization of ethylene and propylene . addition of small amounts of ethylene to a polymerization system derived from the 2-arylindene metallocenes results in a large and nonlinear increase in the polymerization rate . this increase in rate can not be explained by the faster rate of ethylene insertion but is likely the result of the activation of dormant catalyst sites by ethylene . this " ethylene effect " is much larger for bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride / MAO ( (2PhInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO , <nUm> / MAO ) and bis[2-(3',5'-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)indenyl]-zirconium dichloride / MAO ((CF3)2PhInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO , <nUm> / MAO ) metallocene catalysts than for bridged racethylene-bis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride / MAO ( EBIZrCl2 / MAO , <nUm> / MAO ) metallocene . copolymerization parameters for 1-3 / MAO reveal that the unbridged 2-arylindene catalysts show a tendency toward random or slightly blocky incorporation of comonomers ( rerp = <nUm> - <nUm> ≥ <nUm> ) , whereas the ansa - metallocene <nUm> / MAO exhibits a tendency toward alternating comonomer distribution ( rerp = <nUm> < <nUm> ) . 
metallocene / tetramethylaluminoxane ( MAO ) catalysts control the tacticity and the molecular weight and its distribution in the polymer . zirconocene and hafnocene catalysts copolymerize ethene with cyclic olefins such as norbornene and dimethanooctahydronaphthalene ( DMON ) to yield copolymers with the double bond , rather than the ring , opened to extend the chain . these products are atactic and have interesting properties . syndiotactic polystyrene , mp as high as <nUm> ° C , is another class of tailor - made ( titanocene / MAO ) - catalyzed polymers . with the fluorinated ( CpTiF3 ) substituted for the chlorinated ( CpTiCl3 ) titanocenes , the activity rose by a factor of <nUm> - <nUm> . the two types of polymers were studied with numerous metallocenes used as catalysts . nine metallocenes were used to study their activity in the copolymerization of ethylene with cycloolefins . the reactivities of comonomers were established in the ethylene - DMON systems catalyzed by zircono- and hafnocenes . titanocenes proved to be much more active than the systems involving alkoxy-derivatives Ti(OR)4 [14] . 
1-Phenyl-1,4-pentanedione ( 3 ) is selectively converted to the corresponding fulvene - ketone ( 4 ) by treatment with cyclopentadiene in the presence of pyrrolidine . treatment with lithium dimethylcuprate results in selective CH3 - addition at the fulvene carbon and subsequent ring - closure reaction to give <nUm> , which in the presence of lithium diisopropylamide is rapidly dehydrated to yield the bicyclic fulvene <nUm> . its treatment with amalgamated calcium metal leads to reductive fulvene coupling and formation of the calcocene complex ( 10 ) of the substituted 7,7'-bi(tetrahydroindenyl) ligand . only the respective rac - isomer is obtained . hydrolysis of <nUm> followed by double deprotonation with butyllithium yields the corresponding 7,7'-bi(tetrahydroindenyl) dianion equivalent <nUm> . In tetrahydrofuran , <nUm> is cleaved at the 7,7'-linkage with formation of the " monomeric " disproportionation products 11-Li and 12-Li , and treatment of <nUm> with zirconium tetrachloride in THF leads back to the formation of the fulvene <nUm> . transmetalation to zirconium is , however , cleanly achieved when <nUm> is treated with donor - ligand - free Cl4Zr suspended in toluene . the corresponding diastereomerically pure rac-ansa-zirconocene dichloride <nUm> containing the ansa - bridge as part of the a-fused bi(tetrahydroindenyl) ligand system is obtained under these specific conditions . complex <nUm> was characterized by x-ray diffraction , and the outcome of the preliminary propene polymerization experiments is reported . 
we have studied reaction chemistry that appears to be relevant to the mechanism of the dehydrogenative polymerization of phenylsilane by zirconocene and hafnocene catalysts . these investigations suggest that the polymerization proceeds by a two - step mechanism involving sigma-bond metathesis . the active catalysts is therefore proposed to be a coordinatively unsaturated d0 metal hydride complex , which mediates a step ( condensation ) polymerization . 
In this study , a class of bis-1,2-(4-aryl-2-alkyl-1H- inden-1-yl ) ethane was synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic methods such as 1HNMR , 13CNMR , melting point and FTIR . bis-1,2-(4-aryl-2-alkyl-1H- inden-1-yl ) ethane was synthesized by the reaction of butyllithium , arylindenes and dibromoethane in a facile , one - pot strategy . it 's shown that these methods have a wide scope to afford libraries of aryl-substituted indenes . the prepared compounds was then applied as a ligand for the fabrication of a number of metal complexes which can be used as catalyst for the polymerization of the olefins . 
A series of seven new complexes of zirconium and hafnium with bulky o-aryloxyalkyl substituted indenyl ligands were synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis . these complexes were activated with methylaluminoxane and tested for homogeneous ethylene polymerization . the zirconium catalysts showed higher activities than their hafnium analogues . the effects of increasing separation between the indenyl and the aryloxy substituent and the introduction of an extra methyl group on the indenyl moiety were also investigated . catalyst <nUm> bearing a spacer chain of three methylene groups between the indenyl and aryloxy substituents showed the highest activity ( <nUm> kg PE / mol cat . h ) . the increase in the spacer chain length resulted in the decrease in catalyst activities . 
ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization over the O2Si - supported zirconocene / MMAO catalysts was investigated . the silica support was modified by different batches of <nUm> and <nUm> wt % Ga . it was found that Ga was well - dispersed all over the silica granules which can not be detected by XRD . based on the EDX measurement , it was revealed that Ga - modification increased the adsorption ability of MMAO on the silica support after impregnation . thus , Ga - modification showed a promising way to enhance the rate of ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization . based on TGA study , lower interactions between MMAO and support caused by Ga - modification was another reason for increase in catalytic activity . moreover , the Ga - modification increased lewis acid centres or active species on the catalytic system . In addition , a comparative study of polymerization was also conducted with in situ and ex situ impregnation methods . it was found that the in situ impregnation method of the MMAO onto silica exhibited remarkable ( almost <nUm> times ) activity compared to ex situ method which is attributed to lower deactivation effect of the catalyst . 13C NMR analysis , however , indicated that only random copolymers were produced in all systems . these results could be related to the high degree of 1-octene insertion and thus amorphous copolymers were produced in all systems . 
propylene polymerization was carried out using an ansa - zirconocene pyrrolidide based catalytic system of racemic ethylene-1,2-bis(1-indenyl)zirconium dipyrrolidide [ rac-(EBI)Zr(NC4H8)2 or ( rac-1 ) ] and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or a noncoordinating anion . In situ generation of cationic alkylzirconium species was also investigated by NMR - scale reactions of rac-1 and MAO , and rac-1 , AlMe3 , and [Ph3C] [B(C6Fg)4] . In the NMR - scale reaction using CD2Cl2 as a solvent , a small amount of MAO ( [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> ) was enough to completely activate rac-1 to give cationic methyl-zirconium cations that can polymerize propylene . the resulting isotactic polypropylene ( iPP ) isolated in this reaction showed a meso pentad value of <nUm> % . In a similar NMR - scale reaction rac-1 was stoichiometrically methylated by AlMe3 to give rac - (EBI)ZrMe2 , and the introduction of [Ph3C] [B(C6F5)4] into the reaction mixture containing rac - (EBI)ZrMe2 led to in situ generation of cationic [rac-(EBI)Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2]+ species that can polymerize propylene to give iPP showing a meso pentad value of <nUm> % . the catalyst system rac - <nUm> / MAO exhibited an increase of activity as the [Al] / [Zr] ratio increased within an experimental range ( [Al] / [Zr] = 930-6511 ) . the meso pentad values of the resulting iPPs were in the range of <nUm> - <nUm> % . the catalytic activity showed a maximum ( rp = <nUm> × <nUm> g PP / mol Zr h atm ) when [Zr] was <nUm> × 10-6 mol / L in the propylene polymerization according to the concentration of catalyst . MAO - free polymerization of propylene was performed by a rac - <nUm> / AlR3 / noncoordinating anion catalytic system . the efficiency of AlR3 was decreased in the order of AlMe3 ( rp = <nUm> × <nUm> g PP / mol Zr h atm ) > Al(i-Bu)3 ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > AlPr3 ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > Al(i-Bu)2H ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > AlEt3 ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) . the performance of the noncoordinating anion as a cocatalyst was on the order of [HNMePh2][B(C6F5)4] ( rp , = <nUm> × <nUm> g PP / mol Zr h atm ) > [HNMe2Ph] [B(C6F5)4] ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > [Ph3C] [B(C6F5)4] ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > [HNEt2Ph][B(C6F5)4] ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) . the properties of iPP were characterized by 13C - NMR , FTIR , DSC , GPC , and viscometry . 
novel highly active e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyltribenzyloxy titanium catalyst activated by modified methylaluminoxane ( m-MAO ) was prepared for styrene syndiospecific polymerization . the influences of the contents of trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) in m-MAO and external addition of tri-isobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) on the distribution of the oxidation states of titanium were investigated in detail . the Ti ( III ) is in favour of styrene syndiospecific polymerization in higher catalytic activity . 
metallocene / borate catalysts , generated from zirconocene dimethyl compounds , LnZrMe2 , and anilinium borate , [HNMe2Ph]+[B(C6F5)4] - , were used to copolymerize 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene with 1-hexene and 4-methyl-1-pentene . the selected zirconocenes , bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium(IV) dimethyl ( Cp*2ZrMe2 ) and rac-ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium(IV) dimethyl ( rac - EB(THI)ZrMe2 ) , provided atactic and isotactic materials , respectively . the isotactic polymers produced were amorphous or crystalline depending of the monomer . the calculated reactivity ratios for the copolymerization of 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene with 1-hexene and metallocene rac-EB(T-HI)ZrMe2 indicate that this system approximates an ideal azeotropic copolymerization with r1 = <nUm> and r2 = <nUm> . estimates for the reactivity ratios for the copolymerization of 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene with 4-methyl-1-pentene were r1 = <nUm> and r2 = <nUm> for rac - EB(THI)ZrMe2 and r1 = <nUm> and r2 = <nUm> for Cp*2ZrMe2 . the polymerization of 1-hexene in the presence of the saturated 1-N,N-diisopropylaminopentane with rac - EBCTHDZrMe2 / borate was compared with analogous copolymerizations of 1-hexene / 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene . the aminopentene was more effective than the aminopentane in inhibiting the rate of total monomer conversion , implicating both intra- and intermolecular mechanisms for inhibition by the amine . copolymers of 4-methyl-1-pentene / 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene produced with rac-ethylenebisindenyl zirconium(IV) dimethyl ( rac - EBIZrMe2 ) / borate have higher decomposition temperatures with increasing amounts of aminopentene . this copolymer can be protonated with ClH to yield a methanol - soluble material . 
three possible mechanisms of ethylene polymerization in the presence of zirconocene catalysts have been described through density functional calculations . about <nUm> structures ( reactants , intermediates , transition states , and products ) have been located on the potential energy surface . only two mechanisms , called frontside and stepwise backside , appear to be competitive . the frontside mechanism has already been described in the literature , but we present here some important new aspects . In particular , we discuss the important role of the perpendicular form of the olefin p-complex for the frontside process . the stepwise backside mechanism is reported for the first time . the energy barriers in both mechanisms are on the order of <nUm> kcal / mol , which is compatible with the experimental and theoretical values available for similar processes . the energy difference between both mechanisms is certainly below the computational method accuracy , and a definitive conclusion regarding the most favorable mechanism can not be drawn . the influence of other factors such as substituents on the catalysts or the size of the polymer chain could be fundamental .

novel fl / iya - metallocene complexes containing bis(indenyl) ligands bridged at <nUm> position were obtained . ethylene or trimethylene bridged type zirconocene was synthesized from bis(p-tolyl)ethane or bis(p-tolyl)propane as starting material , respectively . dimethylsilylene bridged type zirconocene was prepared from the protected 4-bromo-l-indanone derivative . it turned out that meso-C2H4[4,4'(2,7-dimethylindenyl)2]ZrCl2 and 7-flc-Me2Si[4,4'-(2-methylindenyl)2]ZrCl2 were suitable catalysts for producing ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers ith high molecular weight . highly isotactic polypropylene was obtained by using rac-MejSiXS-methyl-l-phenylindenyOJZrClj catalyst and contained only small amounts of 3,1-type regiodefects . the molecular structures of these complexes were confirmed by x-ray analysis . novel fl / iya - metallocene complexes containing bis(indenyl) ligands bridged at <nUm> position were obtained . ethylene or trimethylene bridged type zirconocene was synthesized from bis(p-tolyl)ethane or bis(p-tolyl)propane as starting material , respectively . dimethylsilylene bridged type zirconocene was prepared from the protected 4-bromo-l-indanone derivative . it turned out that meso-C2H4[4,4'(2,7-dimethylindenyl)2]ZrCl2 and 7-flc-Me2Si[4,4'-(2-methylindenyl)2]ZrCl2 were suitable catalysts for producing ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers ith high molecular weight . highly isotactic polypropylene was obtained by using rac-MejSiXS-methyl-l-phenylindenyOJZrClj catalyst and contained only small amounts of 3,1-type regiodefects . the molecular structures of these complexes were confirmed by x-ray analysis . copyright 
seven new binuclear titanocenes with different linking bridges , unsubstituted or substituted on the cp rings , were synthesized and tested for their effect on ethylene polymerization in the presence of MAO . the polyethylenes thus obtained had broad MWD or even bimodal GPC curves , as compared with that from two reference mononuclear titanocenes . this is explained by the difference in degree of steric hindrance around the active center sites imposed by the bulky substituted ligands assuming different configurations in the rotation of the catalyst molecules . lower polymerization temperatures alleviate the effect of these configuration differences , as reflected in change in MW and mw / Mn . this effect is not caused by decomposition or disproportionation of the binuclear titanocenes as evidenced by the stability of the catalyst . 
two tetramethyldisiloxanediyl bridged binuclear titanocenes Cl 2CpTiCp * ( CH <nUm> ) 2SiOSi(CH <nUm> ) 2Cp * TiCpCl <nUm> ( cp * = substituted cyclopendienyl , r = H in catalyst A , r = Si(CH <nUm> ) <nUm> in catalyst B ) have been synthesized by the reacting dilithium salts of cp * ( CH <nUm> ) 2SiOSi(CH <nUm> ) 2Cp * with CpTiCl <nUm> in the yields of <nUm> % and <nUm> % respectively . their catalysis behavior for the polymerization of ethylene under different conditions were investigated , and compared with mononuclear metallocene , cyclopentadienyl-titanium dichloride . the result showed that these two catalysts have a middle activity for ethylene polymerization . the MWD of the polyethylene were rather wide and the highest molecular weight was as high as <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> g / mol . furthermore , catalyst B exhibited unexpected temperature dependence for ethylene polymerization . 
unexpected inactive byproducts were observed in the catalytic polymerization of acetylene using metallocene alkyne complexes Cp2M(L)(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) , <nUm> : m = Ti , without L ; <nUm> : m = Zr , L = thf . the reaction of <nUm> was investigated in detail by NMR to give quantitatively at <nUm> ° C the titanacyclopentadiene Cp2Ti-CH = CH - C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3) ( 3 ) . around <nUm> ° C <nUm> starts to rearrange to yield the dihydroindenyl complex <nUm> via coupling of one cp - ligand with the titanacyclopentadiene . In the reaction of <nUm> under analogous conditions a zirconacyclopentadiene Cp2Zr-CH = CH - C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3) ( 5 ) and the dimeric complex [ Cp2Zr(C(SiMe3) = CH(SiMe3) ] 2[m-s(1,2)-C ≡ C ] ( 6 ) were observed . whereas <nUm> decomposes to a mixture of unidentified paramagnetic species , <nUm> was isolated and investigated by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray analysis . In the reaction of rac-(ebthi)Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) ( ebthi = ethylenbis-tetrahydroindenyl ) with 2-ethynyl-pyridine the complex rac - (ebthi)ZrC(SiMe3) = CH(SiMe3)](s-C ≡ CPy ) <nUm> was obtained , which was investigated by an x-ray analysis . 
[ ( C13 H8)Si(CH3)2(C 5H3 ) ] was prepared with fluorenyl lithium , dimethyldichlorosilane and cyclopentadienylsodium with <nUm> % total yield . furthermore , a Si - bridged fluorenylidene cyclopen-tadienylidene zirconium complex [ (C13H8)Si(CH3)2(C 5H3)]ZrCl2 was synthesized by reaction of [ (C13H8)Si(CH3)2(C5H <nUm> ) ] and Cl4Zn with THF as a solvent under the schlenk system . the reaction gave the target compound in <nUm> % yield . the zirconium complex was characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR . after activated with methylaluminoxane , the metallocene complex showed a high catalytic activity for the ethylene and propylene polymerization reaction under atmosphere pressure . it was found that the title compound has a catalytic activity in the order of <nUm> g / h , and the molecular weight of ethylene-propylene copolymers is about <nUm> . 
syndiotactic polystyrene and atactic polypropene were synthesized with different titanium compounds , in particular of η 5-cyclopentadienyltri-n-propoxy titanium [ CpTi ( OPr n ) <nUm> ] and modified methylaluminoxane ( m-MAO ) homogeneous catalytic system . the titanium ligands affect catalytic activity of styrene syndiospecific polymerization and propene polymerization . the effects of the percentage contents of the trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) coexisted in m-MAO , which can be controlled by changing H 2O and TMA molar ratio during the preparation of MAO by partial hydrolysis of TMA with Al <nUm> ( SO <nUm> ) <nUm> · 18H 2O , on polymerization of styrene and propene have been studied in detail . the external addition of alkylaluminium ( AIR <nUm> , trimethylaluminum , triethylaluminum , tri-isobutylaluminum ) to CpTi ( OPr n ) <nUm> / m-MAO catalytic systems may also influence both catalytic activity and molecular weights of syndiotactic polystyrene produced . the oxidation states of titanium in different CpTi ( OPr n ) <nUm> / m-MAO catalytic systems were determined by redox titration method . it results that Ti ( III ) is good for styrene syndiospecific polymerization in higher catalytic activity , while Ti ( IV ) is good for propene 's polymerization . oxidation state of tinanium in catalyst system does not clearly affect the tacticity of these two kind of polymers obtained . 
A closely related ansa - metallocene system was investigated as a model for propylene polymerization utilizing unbridged 2-arylindenyl metallocenes . the propylene polymerization behavior of rac- and meso- dimethylsilyl(bis(2-phenylindenyl))zirconium dichloride was also examined . polymerizations were run with mixtures 1-rac and 1-meso to give visually homogeneous reactor blends of isotactic and atactic polypropylene . the 1-meso was more productive than 1-rac which was consistent with the polymerization results from unbridged catalyst . the polymerization for meso conformation was higher than that for the rac conformation in the unbridged system as well . 
{ [ 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl ] cyclopentadienyl } titanium trichloride ( CpNTiCl3 , <nUm> ) was activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) to catalyze polymerizations of ethylene ( e ) , propylene ( P ) , ethylidene norbornene ( ENB ) , vinylcyclohexene ( VCH ) , and 1,4-hexadiene ( HD ) . the dependence of homopolymerization activity ( A ) of <nUm> / MAO on olefin concentration ( [M]n ) is n = <nUm> ± <nUm> for e and n = <nUm> ± <nUm> for P . the value of n is <nUm> ± <nUm> for CpTiCl3 / MAO catalysis of ethylene polymerization ; this system does not polymerize propylene . <nUm> / MAO catalyzes HD polymerization at one - tenth of AH for 1-hexene , probably because of chelation effects in the HD case . the copolymerization of e and P has reactivity ratios of rE = <nUm> and rP = <nUm> at <nUm> ° C , and rErP = <nUm> , which suggests <nUm> / MAO may be a multisite catalyst . the copolymerization activity of CpTiCl3 / MAO is <nUm> times smaller than that of CpNTiCl3 / MAO . terpolymerization of e / P / ENB has A of <nUm> g of polymer / ( mol of Ti h ) , incorporates up to <nUm> mol % ( ̃ <nUm> wt % ) of ENB , and high MW 's of <nUm> to <nUm> x <nUm> . all of these parameters are surprisingly insensitive to the ENB concentration . the e / P / VCH terpolymerization has comparable A value of ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) x <nUm> g / ( mol of Ti h ) . the incorporation of VCH in terpolymer increases with increasing [VCH] . terpolymerization with HD occurs at about one - third of the A of either ENB or VCH ; the product HD - EPDM is low in molecular weight and contains less than <nUm> % of HD . these terpolymerization results are compared with those obtained previously for three zirconocene precursors : rac-ethylenebis(1-e5-inde-nyl) dichlorozirconium ( 6 ) , rac- ( dimethylsilylene ) bis ( 1-e5-indenyl ) dichlorozirconium ( 7 ) , and ethylenebis(9-e5-fluorenyl)dichlorozirconium ( 8 ) . the last compound is a particularly poor terpolymerization catalyst ; it incorporates very little VCH or HD and no ENB at all . <nUm> / MAO is a better catalyst for e / P / VCH terpolymerization , while <nUm> / MAO is superior in e / P / HD terpolymerization . 
unbridged 2-arylindenylmetallocene complexes such as bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) are catalyst precursors for the synthesis of elastomeric polypropylenes . these catalysts are also active for the copolymerization of ethylene and propylene . addition of small amounts of ethylene to a polymerization system derived from the 2-arylindene metallocenes results in a large and nonlinear increase in the polymerization rate . this increase in rate can not be explained by the faster rate of ethylene insertion but is likely the result of the activation of dormant catalyst sites by ethylene . this " ethylene effect " is much larger for bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride / MAO ( (2PhInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO , <nUm> / MAO ) and bis[2-(3',5'-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)indenyl]-zirconium dichloride / MAO ((CF3)2PhInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO , <nUm> / MAO ) metallocene catalysts than for bridged racethylene-bis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride / MAO ( EBIZrCl2 / MAO , <nUm> / MAO ) metallocene . copolymerization parameters for 1-3 / MAO reveal that the unbridged 2-arylindene catalysts show a tendency toward random or slightly blocky incorporation of comonomers ( rerp = <nUm> - <nUm> ≥ <nUm> ) , whereas the ansa - metallocene <nUm> / MAO exhibits a tendency toward alternating comonomer distribution ( rerp = <nUm> < <nUm> ) . 
analysis of the published data on the interaction between the components of a zirconocene-poly(methylaluminoxane) system used as the catalyst of olefin polymerization indicates that the yield of the reaction product , methane , is virtually independent of the concentration of the components over a wide concentration range . it is assumed that methane is formed in the absence of the monomer on the catalytic site of polymerization formed by the interaction of the major components and the activating admixtures , including uncontrollable admixtures ( H2O , O ) . under specified conditions it is the admixtures that control the concentration of the catalytic centers and the methane yield . for this reason , the yield of methane is independent of the concentration of zirconocene and poly(methylaminoxane) . 
A procedure for supporting syndiospecific zirconocene on OSi <nUm> opens up a way of retaining the syndiospecificity of metallocene catalyst . the effects of supporting temperature , time and initial concentration of metallocene on the supported amount of metallocene were investigated . using these supported catalysts for propylene polymerization , it is possible to reduce the consumption of cocatalyst MAO ( methylaluminoxane ) and produce syndiotactic polypropylene in high syndiotacticity . if partial MAO was replaced by triisobutylaluminium , it would be shown that the catalytic activity of these catalysts increases greatly . 
electroconductivities of zirconocene complex - derived catalytic system solutions were measured to identify the ionic particles generated by the catalyst activators and to follow the ionic species formed in the absence and presence of olefins . several organoaluminum compounds ( OAC ) and polymethylalumoxane ( MAO ) were studied as metallocene activators . the specific electroconductivity of the solution of each metallocene complex examined in solvents varying in polarity , activated both with OAC and MAO , was always higher than that of the starting reactants . the electroconductivity value and the olefin polymerization rate were found to vary concurrently . the data obtained show that it is possible to trace the ionic particles generated during the formation of active species and their changes in the course of polymerization reaction . 
metallocene / tetramethylaluminoxane ( MAO ) catalysts control the tacticity and the molecular weight and its distribution in the polymer . zirconocene and hafnocene catalysts copolymerize ethene with cyclic olefins such as norbornene and dimethanooctahydronaphthalene ( DMON ) to yield copolymers with the double bond , rather than the ring , opened to extend the chain . these products are atactic and have interesting properties . syndiotactic polystyrene , mp as high as <nUm> ° C , is another class of tailor - made ( titanocene / MAO ) - catalyzed polymers . with the fluorinated ( CpTiF3 ) substituted for the chlorinated ( CpTiCl3 ) titanocenes , the activity rose by a factor of <nUm> - <nUm> . the two types of polymers were studied with numerous metallocenes used as catalysts . nine metallocenes were used to study their activity in the copolymerization of ethylene with cycloolefins . the reactivities of comonomers were established in the ethylene - DMON systems catalyzed by zircono- and hafnocenes . titanocenes proved to be much more active than the systems involving alkoxy-derivatives Ti(OR)4 [14] . 
catalytic behavior was examined in the series of 2- and 1-substituted bisindenyl zirconium and hafnium complexes , (2-PhInd)2ZrCl2 , (2-PhInd)2HfCl2 , (2-p-TolInd)2ZrCl2 , (2-p-TolInd)2HfCl2 , (1-MeInd)2ZrCl2 , (1-i-PrInd)2HfCl2 , (1-cyclo-C6H11Ind)2ZrCl2 , (2-n-BuInd)2ZrCl2 , and (2-All-Ind)2ZrCl2 . 2-Ph - substituted zirconocene showed higher activity in ethylene polymerization than did the unsubstituted indenyl complex under similar conditions , and provided polyethylene of the higher molecular weight . these catalytic features suggest the increase in activity to be caused probably by an increase in chain propagation rate . the lower productivity of (2-p-Tol-Ind)2ZrCl2 complex compared to (2-PhInd)2ZrCl2 is attributed to the electron donating effect of the methyl substituent at the phenyl ring suppressing the effect of the aryl substituent . the two hafnium analogs showed considerably lower activity as compared with zirconium complexes , the feature commonly observed on replacement of zirconium by hafnium . the most pronounced effect of 1-substituents on the metallocene activity was observed for the 1-Me-and 1-i-Pr - substituted complexes . the activities of the complexes examined in ethylene polymerization were found to be linearly correlated with the electronic and steric substituent characteristics . 
the synthesis and activity as precatalysts for stereoregular a-olefin polymerization of the chiral C1 - symmetric zirconocene complexes (R)- and (S)-Me2Si(e5-C13H 16)(e-C5H3R*)ZrR2 ) , where C13H16 = octahydrofluorenyl , r = NMe2 , Cl , or me , and R* = (1R,2S,5R)-trans-5-methyl-cis-2-(2-propyl)cyclohexyl ( (-)-menthyl ) , are described . 
tetrachloroaluminate ionic liquids having 1-n-octyl-3-methylpyridinium [C8-b-mpy]+ [AlCl4]- or 1-n-octyl-4-methylpyridinium cation [C8-gmpy] +[AlCl4]- , respectively , were investigated in the biphasic ionic liquid / hexane mode ethylene polymerization as media of bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV)dichloride ( Cp2TiCl2 ) titanocene catalyst activated by AlEtCl2 alkylaluminum compound . the results were compared to those obtained with using 1-n-octyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroaluminate ionic liquid ( [ C8 - mim]+[AlCl 4]- ) . it was found that the pyridinium ionic liquids enable to obtain better polyethylene ( PE ) yields in total than the imidazolium ionic liquids . the best results were obtained using [C8-gmpy] +[AlCl4]- , in which the alkyl substituents were in para ( γ ) positions at the pyridinium cation . the considerable amount of PE formed in the ionic liquid phase , largely contaminated , was observed at higher activator / catalyst ( Al / Ti ) molar ratio . it results from the mass transfer limitation through the phases . this obstacle disappears at lower activator / catalyst molar ratio and polyethylene produced is easily transported into the hexane phase . the effects of Al / Ti ratio and polymeryzation time on the total PE yield were also studied . PE obtained in the biphasic ionic liquid / hexane mode reveals molecular characteristics similar to polyethylenes produced in the presence of both homogeneous ( low molecular weight ) or heterogeneous ( broad molecular weight distribution ) metallocene catalyst systems . additionally , it shows some unique features , such as high crys - tallinity degree and bulk density . 
A novel syndiotactic polystyrene-b-polypropene(sPS-b-PP)copolymer was synthesized in this laboratory with homgenous metallocene catalyst of η 5-cyclopentadienyltripropoxy titanium and MAO . the influence factor of monomers feed ratio , catalyst concentration , Al / Ti molar ratio and polymerization temperature on block copolymerization has been investigated . the copolymerization products were fractionated by succesive solvents extration with boiling butanone , boiling heptane and <nUm> ° C THF . the titled block copolymer with 20-30wt % percent of total product , chiefly existing in butanone soluble fraction , were isolated and characterized by 13C - NMR , FTIR , WAXD , DSC methods . 
the kinetics of propene polymerization in the liquid monomer medium and the properties of the resulting iso-PP were studied in relation to the interannular bridge nature , (CH2)2Ind2ZrCl2 ( I ) , (CH3)2SiInd2ZrCl2 ( II ) , (CH3)2CInd2ZrCl2 ( III ) , and asymmetric (CH3)(cyclo-C3H5)CInd2ZrCl <nUm> ( IV ) , in MAO - activated 1,1'-bridged bisindenyl zirconocene dichlorides . data are also given for the non-bridged (2-Ph-C9H6)2ZrCl2 ( V ) system used under similar conditions . the systems based on zirconocene III are most active and that based on II is most stable . the replacement of one methyl group in the CH2 < bridge by a cyclopropyl group ( compounds III and IV ) results in the depressed initial activity and in the greater deactivation of the system during the process of polymerization . the stereoblock polymer was formed with the catalyst system based on metallocene V , used under similar experimental conditions . 
highly active syndiotactic - specific catalyst for the polymerization of styrene are obtained by mixing cp* TiMe <nUm> with [ ph 3C ] + [ B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - in the mole ratio <nUm> : <nUm> , producing <nUm> % syndiotactic PS at an activity of <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> gPS / molTi · h . treatment of [ cp* TiMe <nUm> ] with [ ph 3C ] +[B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - results in the formation of [ cp* TiMe <nUm> ] + [ B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - complex , which is a good source in solution of the cationic species [ cp* TiMe <nUm> ] + . both activity and syndiospecificity of the " cationic " catalyst are no less than the cp* TiMe <nUm> / MAO and cp* Ti(OPh) <nUm> / MAO catalysts , but are much more active than cp* TiMe <nUm> / MAO as well as cp* ClTi <nUm> / MAO . the cationic catalyst is a very effective catalyst precursor for the ziegler - natta polymerization of styrene to syndiotactic polystyrene at temperatures ≥ - <nUm> ° C , while the " cationic " contributes to promoting the polymerization of styrene to atactic polystyrene at temperatures ≤ - <nUm> ° C . the molecular weight ( m W ) of sPS increases with the decrease of the temperature , suggesting that lower temperature contributes to reducing the chain transfer and increasing the life of the active species for chain propagation . the T m of the sPS polymerized at - <nUm> - <nUm> ° C is almost constant . the styrene polymerization behaviors were essentially insensitive to the dielectric constant of the polymerization medium . 
1-Phenyl-1,4-pentanedione ( 3 ) is selectively converted to the corresponding fulvene - ketone ( 4 ) by treatment with cyclopentadiene in the presence of pyrrolidine . treatment with lithium dimethylcuprate results in selective CH3 - addition at the fulvene carbon and subsequent ring - closure reaction to give <nUm> , which in the presence of lithium diisopropylamide is rapidly dehydrated to yield the bicyclic fulvene <nUm> . its treatment with amalgamated calcium metal leads to reductive fulvene coupling and formation of the calcocene complex ( 10 ) of the substituted 7,7'-bi(tetrahydroindenyl) ligand . only the respective rac - isomer is obtained . hydrolysis of <nUm> followed by double deprotonation with butyllithium yields the corresponding 7,7'-bi(tetrahydroindenyl) dianion equivalent <nUm> . In tetrahydrofuran , <nUm> is cleaved at the 7,7'-linkage with formation of the " monomeric " disproportionation products 11-Li and 12-Li , and treatment of <nUm> with zirconium tetrachloride in THF leads back to the formation of the fulvene <nUm> . transmetalation to zirconium is , however , cleanly achieved when <nUm> is treated with donor - ligand - free Cl4Zr suspended in toluene . the corresponding diastereomerically pure rac-ansa-zirconocene dichloride <nUm> containing the ansa - bridge as part of the a-fused bi(tetrahydroindenyl) ligand system is obtained under these specific conditions . complex <nUm> was characterized by x-ray diffraction , and the outcome of the preliminary propene polymerization experiments is reported . 
A novel magnesium chloride supported titanocene catalyst was synthesized using a soluble tetrahydrofuran complex of magnesium chloride . the suported catalyst polymerized ethylene with high activities in presence of methylaluminoxane . the significant feature of the supported metallocene catalyst is that it shows high polymerization activity at low Al / Ti ratio and at higher temperatures compared to soluble catalyst . the role of support in stabilizing the active species on the metallocene is discussed . 
the isoselective propene polymerization using the supported catalyst O2Si / MAO / Me2Si(2-Me-Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl <nUm> / AlR3 was investigated and compared with propene polymerization using the corresponding homogeneous catalyst system . the influence of propene concentration , polymerization medium , temperature , comonomer , and external aluminium alkyls on polymerization kinetics and polypropene properties such as molecular mass , stereo- and regioselectivity , morphology , and bulk density was studied .

Me2Si - bridged ansa - zirconocenes of interest for a-olefin polymerization catalysis are prepared in good yield by amine elimination reactions . the reaction of Me2Si(1-C5H4-3-t-Bu)2 ( 3 ) and Zr(NMe2)4 affords Me2Si(1-C5H3-3-tBu) 2Zr(NMe2)2 ( 4 ) in <nUm> % NMR yield ( rac / meso = <nUm> / <nUm> ) and pure meso-4 in <nUm> % isolated yield . the reaction of Me2Si(1-C5H3-2-Me-4-tBu)2 ( 6 ) with Zr(NMe2)4 affords Me2Si(1-C5H2-2-Me-4-tBu) 2Zr(NMe2)2 ( 7 ) in <nUm> % NMR yield ( rac / meso = <nUm> / <nUm> ) and pure rac-7 in <nUm> % isolated yield . the <nUm> / <nUm> rac-4 / meso-4 and <nUm> / <nUm> rac-7 / meso-7 ratios are the thermodynamic ratios , and the rac / meso isomerizations are catalyzed by NMe2H via reversible Zr-Cp bond aminolysis . the thermodynamic bias for meso-4 is ascribed to the ease of distortion of the metallocene framework of this diastereomer by a lateral deformation which reduces steric crowding between the amide ligands and the cp substituents . the reaction of <nUm> and Zr(NEt2)4 proceeds only in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at <nUm> ° C , affording Me2Si(1-C5H2-2-Me-4-tBu) 2ZrCl2 ( rac-1 ) in <nUm> % NMR yield ( rac / meso = <nUm> / <nUm> ) . the reaction of <nUm> and the piperidide complex C20H40N4Zr ( m-xylene , <nUm> ° C , <nUm> h ) affords rac-Me2Si-(1-C5H2-2-Me-4-tBu) 2Zr(NC5H10)2 ( rac-9 ) in <nUm> % NMR yield ( no meso detected ) and pure rac-9 in <nUm> % isolated yield . the reaction of <nUm> and the pyrrolidide complex C16H32N4Zr ( m-xylene , <nUm> ° C , <nUm> h ) affords Me2Si(1-C5H2-2-Me-4-tBu) 2Zr(NC4H8)2 ( 10 ) in <nUm> % NMR yield ( rac / meso = <nUm> / <nUm> ) and pure rac-10 in <nUm> % isolated yield . the molecular structure of rac-10 was determined by x-ray crystallography and exhibits severe crowding between the amide ligands and the cp substituents . treatment of rac-7 or rac-10 with Me3SiCl results in clean conversion to rac-1 without isomerization . 
the preparation and crystal structure of the first group <nUm> ansa - metallocene with an oxygen atom directly bonded to the 2-position of an e5-indenyl moiety , rac-[ethylenebis(2-(tert-butyldimethylsiloxy)indenyl)]zirconium dichloride ( 3 ) , is reported . In combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , complex <nUm> polymerizes propylene to highly isotactic crystalline polypropylene ( Tm = <nUm> ° C ; mw = <nUm> <nUm> ; mw / Mn = <nUm> ) . under similar conditions , the propylene polymerization activity of <nUm> / MAO exceeds that of the conventional ansa - metallocene catalyst system (dimethylsilyl)bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 4 ) / MAO by a factor of <nUm> ( <nUm> vs <nUm> kg of PP / mol of Zr / h ; tp = <nUm> ° C ; C3H6P = <nUm> bar ; [Al] : [Zr] = <nUm> <nUm> : <nUm> ) . complex <nUm> crystallizes in the unusual indenyl-backward conformation . the molecular structure is consistent with the expected C2 symmetry .

by one - pot technique the copolymerization of styrene with ethylene promoted by a cyclopentadienyl titanium trichloride ( CpTiCl3 ) / <nUm> , 4-butanediol diglycidyl ether ( BDGE ) / Zn catalytic system to yield aPs-b-P(S-co-E)-6-PE block copolymers was investigated via sequential monomer addition strategy in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst for the coordination polymerization stage . the effect of temperature , time , ethylene pressure and the ratio of Al / Ti in mol on the polymerization performance was discussed in detail . basically , aPs-b-P(S-co-E)-b-PE block copolymers was obtained , together with atactic polystyrene through the approach , which was determined by solvent extraction . the C14H - soluble product was determined by GPC , DSC , WAXD and 13C - NMR . the molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) of the copolymer varied slightly at the range from <nUm> to <nUm> . the DSC result showed that the copolymer featured one glass transition temperature ( for example tt = <nUm> ° C ) attributed to the tt of oPs domains and one melting point ( for example Tm = <nUm> ° C ) attributed to the tg of PE domains . the blocky microstructure of the copolymer was further confirmed by WAXD and C - NMR . these results indicated that the copolymer was consisted of amorphous aPs segments , P(S-co-E) segments and crystalline PE segments . 
the authors describe the current state of knowledge on how the polymerization of silanes by dehydrogenative coupling occurs , how general ( or limited ) catalytic dehydrogenative coupling may be as a method for catenation of main group atoms , what other catalysts may effect reaction and what other catalytic reactions can be effected by the unusual metallocene intermediates produced in this reaction . 
the present article reviews the recent progress of half - metallocene with donor ligand ( s ) as catalyst for olefin polymerization . half - metallocene with donor ligand ( s ) is an important type of catalyst for olefin polymerization , and attracts more and more attentions . As a novel type of polymerization catalyst , the complex with clear structure could be synthesized in simple procedure . using as catalyst for olefin polymerization , high activity is available , and affording polymer with high molecular weight . for olefin copolymerization , excellent copolymerization ability could be observed , and some of the obtained copolymers could not be produced by ziegler - natta catalyst and traditional metallocene catalyst systems . polymerization behavior and polymer structure could be adjusted through balancing the structures of cyclopentadienyl ligand and donor ligand . the homo- and co-polymerization of ethylene and a-olefin , copolymerization of ethylene and cyclic olefin , and styrene polymerization are involved . 
1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroaluminate ( [EMIM] +[AlCl4]- ) and l-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroaluminate ( [BMIM]+[AlCl4]- ) ionic liquids were applied in biphasic ethylene polymerization as a medium of cp 2TiCl2 titanocene catalyst . the effects of alkylaluminum compound ( MAO , AlEt3 , AlEt2Cl , AlEtCl2 ) , the activator / catalyst molar ratio , polymerization time , ethylene pressure , catalyst recycling and the volume of the ionic liquid / hexane medium on the polymerization yield were investigated . physical properties of polyethylene ( PE ) obtained are presented . it was shown that AlEtCl2 is the best activator investigated so far . the [BMIM]+[AlCl4] - ionic liquid is a better medium for the titanocene catalyst than [EMIM]+[AlCl4]- one . the product obtained is characterized primarily by its high crystallity degree and shows the properties of a typical linear polyethylene . thus , biphasic ionic liquid polymerization of ethylene can be a potential alternative to that with a metallocene catalyst immobilized on a solid carrier . 
zirconocenes Ph2CCpFluZrCl2 ( 1 ) and rac-Me 2Si(2-Me,4-PhInd)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) first preacti - vated with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) at rather low AlMAO / Zr molar ratio = <nUm> - <nUm> mol / mol and further activated either traditionally with MAO or non-traditionally with triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) have been studied and compared from the point of view of catalysts ' activity in propylene polymerizations . the dependence of catalyst productivity on molar ratio of components has been analyzed . it has been shown by 1H NMR that mainly tetraisobutyl alumoxane ( TIBAO ) was formed at about equimolar MAO / TIBA ratios thus assuming TIBAO participation in initiation of the catalysts in examined systems . it has been shown that TIBAO provides higher catalytic activity compared to MAO at lower cocatalyst ( activator ) / catalyst molar ratios and allows conducting of propylene polymerization in the medium of heptane . 
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) ( PEDOT ) films were potentiostatically and potentiodynamically prepared on Pt electrodes from acetonitrile monomer solutions containing TBAPF6 or FcPF6 ( or both ) . the polymer modified electrodes obtained with different growth charges were characterized electrochemically by cyclic voltammetry in a monomer free solution . the results point to the effective immobilization of the ferrocenium ion inside the PEDOT matrix by entrapment during the polymer synthesis in potentiostatic mode . it is discussed the influence of the presence of the organometallic cation in the polymerization solution in the growth process and the efectiveness of the incorporation of the metallocene is analysed on the basis of the electrochemical data collected for the films redox conversion . 
for improving the molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) of metallocene polyethylene ( PE ) , two new asymmetric ethyl_ether bridged dinuclear titanium metallocene complexes : (CpTiCl2)2 [ e5-e5-C9H6 C4H8O C5H4](Cl) and CCl2PTi [ e5-e5-C9H6 C4H8O C5H3 CH3 ] ( C2 ) , have been synthesized by using schlenk technology , and they were characterized with GC-MS , 1H-13C - NMR and IR . after activation with methy aluminoxane ( MAO ) , C1 and C2 are efficient catalytic systems for ethylene polymerization . At the atmosphere pressure , their catalytic activities reached to <nUm> × <nUm> g / ( mol*h ) and <nUm> × <nUm> g / ( mol*h ) , the me of PE reached to <nUm> × <nUm> and <nUm> × <nUm> , and the MWD of PE were <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . 
In this work , the boron ( B ) modification of MCM-41 - supported dMMAO / zirconocene catalysts showed a promising increase ( almost twice ) in catalytic activity in ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization . the enhanced activity can be attributed to the decreased interaction between the support and dMMAO with boron modification as was proved by TGA . it was proposed that boron acted as a spacer anchoring the support and dMMAO . however , at high boron loading ( ca. <nUm> wt % ) , the activity slightly decreased due to the migration of dMMAO into boron layer resulting in less surface concentration of [Al]dMMAO which was measured by XPS . the inhibition of chain transfer reaction during polymerization apparently occurred upon the boron modification providing higher MW polymer . it was also suggested that boron modification has rendered more uniform catalytic sites which was leading to narrower MWD of the polymer observed . based on 13CNMR , boron modification did not affect the microstructure of copolymers obtained . however , the insertion of 1-octene increased with boron modification probably due to decreased steric hindrance of the MCM-41 support . 
all right reserved . the oligomerizations of 1-decene have been carried out with zirconocene catalysts ( ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , A ; [ μ , m-(Me <nUm> Si ) <nUm> ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ][(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> ) ] <nUm> , B ; [ ( C <nUm> H <nUm> )C(Me) <nUm> ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ) ] <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , C ; tBuNC(Me) <nUm> ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> , d ; ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )C(C <nUm> H <nUm> )(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> , e ; ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )C(Me) <nUm> ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> , F ; ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )C(C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> , g ) in combination with MAO and the effects of the dosage of complex F , reaction temperature and Al / Zr ratio on oligomerization and properties of oligomers were also investigated . it was found that the structure of ligands with different steric effects and electronic effects affected the catalytic behavior greatly , and determined the oligomer 's component and microstructure . among them , cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , silicon bridged binuclear zirconocene complex B and sterically hindered complex C mainly produced low viscosity oligomers ( 100 kv : <nUm> ~ <nUm> cSt , dimer content about <nUm> % ) ; As expected , constrained geometry configuration zirconocene complex d with more open coordination space displayed higher catalytic activity and the kinetics viscosity of oligomer was higher than that of cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( 100 kv about <nUm> ~ <nUm> cSt ) ; it was interested to find that Cs symmetrical zirconocene complexes e , F , g showed higher activity and primarily produced medium - high viscosity oligomers ( 100 kv > <nUm> cSt ) , which was attributed to the special structure of the zirconocene catalysts and different polymerization mechanism . the GC-MS results demonstrated that the oligomer mixture was less isomerization and composed of dimer to pentamer . the optimum reaction conditions involved a dosage of complex F 10mmol , a reaction temperature of 80 , and an Al / Zr ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> . 
A review covers advances in research of ziegler - natta catalyst , metallocene catalyst , and non-metallocene single active site catalyst used in polymerization of propylene ; donor technology and process preparation process for ziegler - natta catalyst ; preparation of propylene homopolymer ; propylene living polymerization ; and prospect of the catalyst for propylene polymerization . 
the present study reveals some aspects on properties of polypropylene ( PP ) derived from the supported ziegler - natta ( ZN ) catalyst ( Cl2Mg / Cl4Ti / DEP ) and the supported metallocene ( MC ) catalyst ( OSi <nUm> / MAO / Et[lnd]2ZrCl2 ) . experimentally , PPs were produced using the supported ZN and MC catalysts as mentioned above by varying the conditions such as the polymerization temperatures , propylene pressure , and the [Al]cocatalyst / [Ti]ZN catalyst or [Zr] MC catalyst ratios . based on the study , it was found that activities , mmmm( % ) or isotactivity , and melting temperatures ( Tm ) apparently depended on the polymerization temperatures , propylene pressures , and [Al] cocatalyst / [Ti] or [Zr]catalyst ratios in different ways . the impact of each process variable on the properties of PP obtained was further discussed in more details . In general , it was found that the supported MC catalyst provided more active species compared to the supported ZN catalyst leading to higher activities . In particular , the PP produced from the supported MC catalyst also had high isotacticity , however , lower Tm compared to that produced from the supported ZN catalyst . it is worth noting that by changing those parameters , the properties of PP can be altered based on the nature behaviour of the two catalysts . As a matter of fact , the process variables can be chosen in order to achieve the desired properties of PP under the supported catalytic system . 
metallocenes based on group <nUm> metals were first synthesized by wilkinson et al. in <nUm> ; <nUm> however , the great utility of these compounds as catalyst precursors for the stereoselective polymerization of a-olefins was not realized until the mid-1980s when two key discoveries were made . the first of these was the discovery that alkyl substituents placed on the cyclopentadienyl framework of the metallocene can significantly influence the performance and behavior of the catalyst.2 the second was the discovery that enantioselectivity in the insertion step of an a-olefin polymerization could result if one made metallocene catalysts with the appropriate chirality and stereorigidity.3 . 
the demonstration of single - site control over polymer stereochemistry by C2 - symmetric ansatitanocene and zirconocene catalysts in <nUm> and <nUm> ushered in a new era in alkene polymerization catalysis.1,2 since then , a plethora of ansa - metallocene ligand designs have been developed for the purpose of controlling the stereochemistry and molecular weight of the polymer product and for increasing the activity of the catalyst . besides numerous ring substitution patterns as well as the replacement of one ring with another moiety ( such as an amide ligand ) , different types of bridges have been used to alter both the geometry and electronic properties of the ansa - metallocene . for the most part , these bridges have consisted of relatively inert carbon-or silicon - based moieties . apart from a few phosphorus-3,4 and arsenic5 - bridged ansa - zirconocene complexes , examples of heteroatombridged group <nUm> ansa - metallocenes were scarce until about a decade ago , when the potential of the heteroatom to expand the functionality of the ansa - metallocene ligand and increase its influence on the polymerization properties of the catalyst was recognized . ( note : the term “ heteroatom ” is DK3712 : “ dk3712_c005 ” - <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> - <nUm> : <nUm> - page <nUm> - # <nUm> generally associated with any p-block element other than carbon ; however , in this chapter it refers to any p-block element outside of group <nUm> . ) so far , only boron , phosphorus , and arsenic have served as single heteroatom bridges in group <nUm> ansa - metallocene complexes , probably owing to the greater synthetic accessibility of these systems . ansa - metallocenes with a single oxygen or nitrogen atom joining the p ligands have not been developed , although these atoms have been combined with one or two other heteroatoms6-9 or have been flanked by carbon and silicon to form the backbone of the bridge.10-15 this chapter will focus only on ansa - metallocenes containing heteroatoms within the backbone of the bridge . heteroatombridged half sandwich complexes of the “ constrained - geometry ” type , in which thep - ligand is linked to an amide ligand,16-18 are also outside the scope of this chapter . 
tailoring polymer properties such as stiffness , strength , or processing requires control of the molecular architecture of the polymers . for the polymerization of olefins like propylene , the development of metallocene catalysts gives access to new polymer microstructures . during the last decade , major advances have been made in metallocene catalysis for polypropylenes , providing higher levels of control over composition , molecular mass distributions , and stereoregularity . this leads to a large variety of polypropylenes with varying types and degrees of stereoregularity,1-4 from amorphous or low - crystallinity types to highly stereoregular ones such as isotactic and syndiotactic polypropylene.4 owing to the regular arrangement of methyl groups , these stereoregular polypropylenes are semicrystalline materials with melting points above <nUm> ° C exhibiting typical thermoplastic deformation behavior ( thermoplast , figure <nUm> ) , but isotactic and syndiotactic polypropylene differ in elastic modulus and impact strength.5 In atactic polypropylenes , the statistically random arrangement of the methyl groups prevents crystallization . therefore , atactic polypropylenes are soft , amorphous polymers ranging from oils to soft , waxy materials ( wax , figure <nUm> ). <nUm> . 
polypropylene ( PP ) is one of the most highly utilized engineering plastics , with production in the united states and canada of over <nUm> million metric tons in <nUm> the starting material for PP , propylene , can be transformed into polymers with a range of physical properties by adjusting the relative stereochemistry of the pendant methyl groups on the polymer backbone . for instance , when the DK3712 : “ dk3712_c001 ” - <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> - <nUm> : <nUm> - page <nUm> - # <nUm> methyl groups are placed in a stereorandom configuration , the resulting polymer , known as atactic polypropylene , is amorphous and lacks crystallinity . the vast majority of polypropylene sold is isotactic polypropylene ( iPP ) , a resin valued for its strength , toughness , chemical and heat resistance , and processability . the highly stereoregular structure of iPP , in which the pendant methyl groups reside on the same side of the polymer chain , imparts a crystalline structure to the polymer and allows the material to have a high melting point ( 160-165 ° C ). <nUm> A versatile plastic , iPP can be found in a wide range of applications from packaging to fibers to containers . commercial , highly crystalline iPP is largely synthesized using traditional heterogeneous ziegler - natta catalysis , but the advent of homogeneous group <nUm> metallocenes has enabled polyolefin producers to access a wider range of polymer microstructures and properties . the mechanism of stereoselective polymerization by these catalysts is now well understood ; the issues of stereocontrol and influence of the metallocene catalyst structure on the propylene polymerization behavior have been discussed in detail in earlier reviews.4-6 excellent review articles are also available on the synthesis of chiral group <nUm> metallocenes.7,8 this chapter will introduce some fundamental aspects of metallocenecatalyzed propylene polymerization , discuss the details of how the C2 - symmetry of the catalyst is exploited in the synthesis of iPP , and then survey the general ligand structures that are commonly encountered . 
metallocene / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and other single site catalysts for olefin polymerization have opened a new field of synthesis in polymer chemistry.1-3 strained cyclic olefins such as cyclobutene , cyclopentene , norbornene ( NB ) , and their substituted compounds can be used as monomers and comonomers in a wide variety of polymers.4 much interest is focused on norbornene homo-and copolymers because of the easy availability of norbornene and the special properties of their polymers . norbornene can be polymerized by ring opening metathesis polymerization ( ROMP ) , giving elastomeric materials,5 or by double bond opening ( addition polymerization ) . homopolymerization of norbornene by double bond opening can be achieved by early and late transition metal catalysts , namely Ti , Zr , hf,6-8 ni,9,10 and pd11-13 ( scheme <nUm> ) . 
A series of dinuclear half - sandwich titanium complexes with aryloxy substituent at titanium[(e5-cyclopentadienyl) ( aryloxy ) ClTi 2]2 [(CH2)n](n = <nUm> , n = <nUm> , n = <nUm> ) have been successfully synthesized and their styrene polymerization properties have been investigated . all complexes are characterized by 1H NMR , 13C NMR , elemental analysis , and mass spectrometry . In order to examine the catalytic properties of the dinuclear complexes styrene polymerization has been conducted in the presence of MMAO . it was found that ( i ) all the prepared complexes were very effective catalyst for the production of SPS ( syndiotactic polystyrene ) , ( ii ) the complex with the longest bridge between the two active sites exhibited greatest catalytic activity among the three catalysts , but produced SPS with the smallest molecular weight , ( iii ) the activities of dinuclear half - titanocens with aryloxy substitution at titanium metal were greater than those of the chloride substituted compounds . these results indicate that not only the nature of the bridge between the two active sites but also the property of substituents at the metal exert a significant influence on the polymerization behaviors of the dinuclear half - titanocene . 
the steric and electronic ligand effects in the Ti - catalyzed living radical polymerization ( LRP ) of styrene initiated by epoxide radical ring opening ( RRO ) was investigated in a series of Ti (III) complexes ( L nTiX m ) derived in situ from Zn reduction of commercially available Ti(IV) precursors . based on the ability to perform initiation by epoxide RRO and mediate LRP via reversible C-Ti bond formation , these catalysts ranked : L = metallocene ( η 5-RCp : r = H ∼ et ∼ 1Pr ∼ tBu > ind cp* ) ≫ o-ligands ( alkoxides ) ≫ bisketonates ) ≫ N ligands ( tp > pc ) , while x = Cl > Br ≫ F ∼ me and L nTiCl m > L n-1.TiCl m+1 . the inexpensive cp 2TiCl <nUm> was one of the most active species . 
organic - inorganic hybrid ( SAV ) supported zirconocene was synthesized and its catalysis on ethylene polymerization was examined . the SAV was synthesized by copolymerization of 4-vinylpyridine with vinyl silica monomer ( SA ) , which was modified by reacting silica with allyltrimethoxysilane ( APS ) . after treated by MAO , the SAV was reacted with Cp2ZrCl2 to form organic - inorganic hybrid supported metallocene . the chemical structure and the composition of SA and SAV have been characterized by solid - state <nUm> C - NMR , XPS , and elemental analysis ( EA ) . the SAV supported zirconocene catalyst was effective in ethylene polymerization at a relatively low MAO level ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) giving higher activity than that supported by O2Si . 
within radically initiated MMA and styrene polymerization systems , metallo cenes are shown to be actively participating in formation of two kinds of chain propagation active centers - free radicals and living coordination active centers , and the polymerization takes place as radical coordination one . relative con tribution of each kind of centers into the observed kinetic peculiarities of the polymerization depends much on metallocene kind and the process conditions . 
titanocene and its derivatives are part of a larger division within organometallic chemistry called metallocenes . the diverse uses for these complexes are illustrated by covering three different fields of experimentation : polymerization , cancer research , and organic synthesis . metallocene catalysts are emerging as the leaders of a new era in polymer synthesis . these catalysts produce polyethylene called linear low - density polyetheylene ( LLDPE ) . other processes , like free radical polymerization , produce branched chains and give a lower quality product . new functionalized Cp2TiCl2 compounds synthesized in <nUm> exhibit significant toxicity against a number of different human tumor cell lines . several reaction schemes illustrate the wide range of applications for titanocene complexes as catalysts or reactants in organic synthesis . titanocene dichloride catalyst can be used to promote a double alkylation of styrenes by two alkyl halides under mild conditions . furthermore , titanocene dichloride is also effective in promoting alkylations of alkylol with organoaluminum reagents . all of these applications show that titanocene derivatives have a promising future in many fields of research and development . 
A series of heterogeneous catalysts with Cp2TiCl2 supported on palygorskite were prepared and evaluated by ethylene slurry polymerizations . the so - called direct supported catalyst , for which the pretreatment of palygorskite with MAO or Al(i-Bu)3 was not necessary , gave the highest activity among these supported catalysts and could be more robust than homogeneous Cp2TiCl2 . with the direct supported catalyst , no significant activity loss was observed under low Al / Ti molar ratios ( Al / Ti = <nUm> ) and the decay of polymerization rate was slower when compared to the other supported catalysts . it was found that the surface lewis acidity of palygorskite after thermal treatment played an important role in activation of metallocene compound and resulted in high catalyst activity . 
A new dialkylzirconocene type of complex , (1,2-ph2-4-MeCp)2ZrMe2(2) , was synthesized by reaction of (1,2-Ph2-4-MeCp)2ZrCl2(1) and with <nUm> equivalent of methyl lithium at <nUm> ° C . complex <nUm> was characterized by elemental analysis , 1H NMR and 13C NMR . the structure of complex <nUm> was determined by single crystal x-ray structural analysis . upon activation with Al(iBu)3 / Ph3C+ BC24F20 - , complex <nUm> showed a high catalytic activity for the ethylene polymerization reaction at lower n(Al) / n(Zr) ratios and high molecular weight polyethylene samples with high melting transition temperatures were produced . the polyethylene samples were characterized by molecular weight determination , DSC and XRD analysis . 
In the present study , the linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) / OZr <nUm> nanocomposites were synthesized via in-situ polymerization with rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst . first , the nano-ZrO <nUm> filler was impregnated with the desired amount of MAO . then , copolymerization of ethylene / 1-octene was performed in the presence of nanoZrO2 / MAO filler to produce the LLDPE / O2Zr nanocomposites . the amounts of nanoZrO2 filler employed were varied at <nUm> and <nUm> g corresponding to [Al]MAO / [Zr] ratios = <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . it can be observed that the polymer yield increased with increasing the ratios of [Al]MAO / [Zr] . however , the observed polymer yields were much lower ( about 5-30 times ) compared to the yield with no filler addition . the filler contents in polymer were in the range of 23-25 wt % . the characteristics of LLDPE / O2Zr nanocomposites obtained were determined by means of DSC , SEM / EDX , TEM , 13C NMR , and XPS . it was observed that the LLDPE / O2Zr nanocmposites exhibited slightly lower melting temperature ( Tm ) and crystallization temperature ( Tc ) . SEM micrographs demonstrate the homogeneous matrix of the samples . In addition , with EDX mapping technique , it was also revealed that the nano-ZrO2 filler was well distributed over the polymer matrix . based on the TEM result , it was also revealed that the smaller and more uniform particles can be observed after polymerization . these observations suggested that the fragmentation of nano-ZrO2 particles or segregation of the secondary particles could occur resulting in good dispersion of the particles . the distribution of comonomer was studied by 13C NMR . it was shown to be random as seen in the similar catalytic system without filler addition . the binding energy ( BE ) for C 1s obtained from XPS to be <nUm> eV indicating no significant change in the polymer microstructure with the addition of nano-ZrO2 filler . 
with such a wide diversity of properties and applications , is it any wonder that industry and academia have such a fascination with polymers ? A solid introduction to such an enormous and important field is critical to the modern polymer scientist - to - be , but most of the available books do not stress practical problem solving or include recent advances . serving as the polymer book for the new millennium , introduction to polymer science and chemistry : A problem solving approach unites the fundamentals of polymer science and polymer chemistry in a seamless presentation . emphasizing polymerization kinetics , the author uses a unique question - and - answer approach when developing theory or introducing new concepts . the first four chapters introduce polymer science , focusing on physical and molecular properties , solution behavior , and molecular weights . the remainder of the book explores polymer chemistry , devoting individual , self - contained chapters to the main types of polymerization reactions : condensation ; free radical ; ionic ; coordination ; and ring - opening . it introduces recent advances such as supramolecular polymerization , hyperbranching , photoemulsion polymerization , the grafting - from polymerization process , polymer brushes , living / controlled radical polymerization , and immobilized metallocene catalysts . with numerical problems accompanying the discussion at every step along with numerous end - of - chapter exercises , introduction to chemical polymer science : A problem solving approach is an ideal introductory text and self - study vehicle for mastering the principles and methodologies of modern polymer science and chemistry . 
homogeneous single site catalysts have dominated the research interest in olefin polymerization over the past <nUm> years . sinn and kaminski1 started this trend with the discovery that methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) activates group IV transition metal catalysts . the ability to control regio- and stereochemistries , and comonomer content and distribution are some of the important advantages that metallocene catalysts afford in the polymerization process . A current goal is the reduction of the necessary amount of cocatalyst , typically methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , since its high cost and the large amounts needed at industrial scale are a barrier to making metallocene systems cost effective with respect to ziegler - natta catalysts2 . In this paper , we study the effect of MAO on reaction rate , molecular weight and polymer microstructure in the slurry polymerization of isotactic polypropylene . the active catalyst is a cationic species generated in an equilibrium reaction between a zirconocene dichloride catalyst and MAO . increasing concentrations of MAO shift the equilibrium to the formation of the activated complex . thus , catalyst activity increases with increasing MAO / Zr ratio3,4 . In addition , MAO in solution contains residual trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) in a typical concentration of <nUm> % wt . it is known that TMA can act as a chain transfer agent leading to the formation of an isobutyl-terminated chain and liberation of the activated complex5 . In conditions where chain transfer to TMA becomes a competitive process with respect to the other chain transfer reactions , increasing amounts of MAO reduce the molecular weight . slurry polymerizations of propylene were carried out using rac-ethylene-bis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride / MAO as the catalyst system . polymerizations were performed at <nUm> ° C in a <nUm> mL state - of - the - art semi-batch reactor . the effect of MAO / Zr ratio on the rate of reaction , molecular weight and polymer microstructure was explored in order to allow the chain transfer reaction to TMA to be included in our previously developed kinetic model6 . an exhaustive analysis of end - groups of the polymer chains by 1H and 13C NMR was performed to gain understanding of the chain transfer mechanisms . our kinetic model for the homopolymerization of propylene is developed to predict rate of reaction , molecular weight distribution and percentage of unsaturated end - groups of the polymer6 . it is characterized by : ( 1 ) non-instantaneous initiation by insertion of the first monomer molecule ; ( 2 ) propagation by <nUm> insertion producing a regioerror that lowers the molecular weight through competing chain transfer reactions ; ( 3 ) chain transfer to TMA ; and ( 4 ) catalyst deactivation to account for decreasing catalyst activity with time . the estimation of kinetic rate constants was performed using a systematic optimization approach involving on - line measurements of the reaction rate and end - of - batch measurements of molecular weight distribution and polymer end - groups . A least - square objective function was defined to minimize the difference between the experimental measurements and the model predictions . the minimization was performed subject to constraints imposed by the kinetic model equations . these constraints were posed as a set of nonlinear algebraic equations generated by applying temporal discretization techniques to the dynamic model . this presentation will focus on the experimental and modeling results obtained with the rac-ethylene-bis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride / MAO catalyst system . the ultimate goal of this research is to develop a chemically based kinetic model that can be extensible to a number of single - site metallocene catalyst systems . to accomplish this goal , research work with the catalysts rac-dimethylsilylbis(2-methyl-4-phenyl-indenyl) Cl2Zr and rac-ethylene-bis ( 4,7-dimethyl-1-indenyl ) Cl2Zr is underway . the former species is highly active and stereoselective , while the later species produces isotactic polypropylene with a high frequency of regioirregular <nUm> insertions . our current work with these catalyst systems will be described in the presentation . 
we have studied polymerization of ethylene by half titanocene complexes bearing pyridinethiolate , Cp*Ti(RPyS)Cl2 ( RPyS = 2-pyridinethiolate ( 1 ) , 2-quinolinethiolate ( 2 ) ) . these complexes showed moderate activity in the presence of MMAO as cocatalyst . the activity of complex <nUm> increased with increasing [A1] / [Ti] ratio , while the complex <nUm> showed highest activity at [Al] / [Ti] = <nUm> . DSC analysis showed that the resultant polymer was linear . molecular weight distribution of the polymer obtained by these complexes was significantly narrower than that obtained by non-metallocene type bis(pyridinethiolate) complex . 
chiral ansa-ethylene-bis(tetrahydroindenyl) titanium complexes , EBTHI - TiX2 , first introduced by brintzinger [1] , are highly active and selective catalysts for enantioselective reactions ( e.g. hydrogenations of olefins , ketones and imines , as well as various polymerization reactions ) . we aim to show the use of a homogeneous chiral titanocene catalyst for the asymmetric reduction of imines to prepare chiral amines , which are important intermediates in the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industry . specifically , our research concentrates on the hydrosilylation of 2-phenylpyrroline using (R,R)-ethylene-1,2-bis(e5-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-l-indenyl)titanium (R)-1,1'-binaphth-2-olate ( 1 ) as a precatalyst . after activation with n-BuLi and phenylsilane this catalytic system has proven to be very practical in the preparation of chiral amines with high yields ( > <nUm> % ) and enantioselectivity ( <nUm> % ee ) . the investigation of the reaction kinetics has revealed a strong dependence on reaction temperature and reactant concentration . while there is a general consensus that the key intermediate in titanocene catalyzed hydrosilylations is a Ti(III)-H intermediate [2,3] , we propose this catalyst procedures through a Ti(IV)-H intermediate . In summary , our results clearly demonstrate that the hydrosilylation of imines with the chiral catalyst ( 1 ) offers a very convenient and safe method for the preparation of enantiomerically pure amines . further optimization of the metallocene - catalyzed reaction can lead to more attractive catalytic complexes . 
surface modified silica were reacted with different aluminiumalkyls AlR2R ' ( r = me , et , i-Bu , r ' = H , me , et , i-Bu ) , oligomeric methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and combinations of both , to yield heterogeneous cocatalysts . these cocatalyts were employed to polymerize ethylene using zirconocene dichloride as the catalyst . the polymerization activity profiles have been recorded and compared with the information gained from the scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) images of the polymers . the fragmentation of the heterogeneous cocatalyts upon polymerization has been demonstrated . the degree of fragmentation and the polymerization activity depend on the preparation of the silica supports and on the preparation of the heterogeneous cocatalysts using these supports . the most reactive , fragmentable heterogeneous cocatalysts show polymerization activities slightly higher than MAO in homogeneous solution and almost <nUm> times higher than commercially available MAO on silica ( = MAO on sylopol ) . 
the preparation of polyethylene with a broad distribution of molecular weight was studied using Cp2TiCl2 or Cp2ZrCl2 incorporated with ( me or t-BuCp)2SmCl and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) employed as co-catalyst . the influence of parameters on the polymerization , such as molar ratio of MAO / catalyst , catalyst concentration , temperature and time have been studied in detail . it was found that the polyethylene had higher molecular weight by using Cp2TiCl2 or Cp2ZrCl2 catalytic system combined with (t-BuCp)2SmClas compared with the system combined with (MeCp)2SmCl . meanwhile , the polyethylene obtained from (t-BuCp)2SmCl - contained catalytic system had high polydispersity ( PDI > <nUm> ) . 
group <nUm> metallocene has gained more attention recently as a potential catalyst for ring - opening polymerization of lactones . introduction of a silicon - bridge and / or modifications of biscyclopentadiene ( cp < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) ligand with different p-ligands such as bisindene ( ind < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) , mixed indene / cyclopentadiene ( CpInd ) or mixed uorene / cyclopentadiene ( CpFlu ) have been found to significantly help improve catalyst activities , polymer yields and molecular weight . In order to relate the silicon bridge ( B ) and p-ligand ( L ) effects with the catalyst activities , molecular structures and properties of those bridged dimethylzirconocene complexes as well as their insertion behaviors with e-caprolactone were investigated by using the density functional theory method . calculations showed that different p-ligands had a profound effect on the electronic geometries and related properties of the title complexes . all bridged catalysts were geometric constraints compared to the unbridged catalysts . the HOMO-LUMO gap and dipole moments were decreased as the large p-ligands were introduced ( cp < inf > <nUm> < / inf > > CpInd > ind < inf > <nUm> < / inf > > CpFlu ) . only Si and Zr atoms were observed to carry a positive charge with Si having the most . for the monomer - inserted complexes , most catalyst structures shared the same orientation of e-caprolactone with its ester group pointing away from a methyl group of Zr atom , except the catalyst with ind < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ligand due to steric hindrance . A planar conformation of the monomer was observed in all catalysts and , hence , is required for each insertion . the data provide a structural basis for both inactivated and activated bridged-dimethylzirconocene complex catalysts with different p-ligands , which will be helpful for further studies on the lactone polymerization initiated by group <nUm> metallocene .

it has been synthesized two dinuclear metallocene complexes [(C5H5)MtCl2] [ (C5H4)CMe2 ( C3H2 ) ] [(C5H5)SmCl][Mt = zr(5) , ti(7) ] , which were used for ethylene polymerization with MAO as cocatalyst . detailed study on the effect of polymerization caused by catalyst concentration , molar ratio of [Al] / [Cat] , temperature and time shows that the catalytic activity of complex <nUm> is higher than that of the corresponding mononuclear metallocene of cp2 TiQ2 , while the catalytic activity of complex <nUm> is lower than that of the corresponding mononuclear met allocene of Cp2ZrCl2 ; the molecular weight of polyethylene produced by above two catalyst systems is somewhat decreased , and the molecular weight distribution becomes broader . with prolongation of time , the molecular weight of polyethylene obtained by complex <nUm> decreases , while the molecular weight of polyethylene obtained by complex <nUm> increases . 
polypropylene was obtained using the metallocene homogeneous catalyst Methyl2Si-(2-Methyl-4-Phenyl)2ZrCl2 / MAO and the corresponding silica / MAO - supported system prepared at different conditions . it was observed that long metallocene immobilization time for the preparation of silica / MAO / zirconocene supported catalyst does not imply in higher catalytic activity . the obtained polymers were characterized according to their melting temperature ( Tm ) and crystallinity degree ( xc ) , through DSC analysis . the results showed that the supported catalyst system produce polypropylene with higher Tm and narrower range of melting in relation to the PP obtained by the homogeneous system . 
polyethylene-clay nanocomposites have been prepared using in situ polymerization . In this study we have evaluated two minerals , silica and bentonite ( smectite ) , as catalyst carriers for the polymerization of ethylene with commercially available zirconocene . the activities of the homogeneous and supported metallocene systems were also compared . we have observed that at high temperatures , ethylene consumption sharply decreases with time by employing homogeneous catalyst . also , the polymerization profiles for both supported systems have rapidly achieved a steady state . moreover , the performance of the smectite - supported system was very similar to that of the silica - supported catalyst . the obtained polymers were characterized according to their melting temperature ( T m ) and crystallinity degree ( x c ) , through DSC analysis . the polyethylene melting temperature has significantly increased with the use of both supported systems in comparison with the homogeneous counterpart . the highest T m of the obtained polyethylenes was <nUm> ° C , which corresponds to that synthesized by the smectite - supported catalyst . 
two new hetro - dinuclear metallocene catalyst systems of [(C5H5)MCl2] (C5H4)SiMe5 ( C5H4 ) ] [(C5H5)SmCl] [ m = Ti(D , zr(2) ] activated by MAO were used for the polymerization of ethylene . the affections of catalyst concentration , molar ratio of [Al] / [Cat] , temperature and time on polymerization were studied in detail . the results show that the catalytic activity of dinuclear catalysts is lower than the corresponding mononuclear metallocene , and the molecular weight , melt point and crystallinity of polyethylene produced are somewhat decrease . 
one of the existing problems of metallocene catalyst is the difficulty in controlling its polymer morphology despite of its numerous advantages . according to the morphology replication nature of ethylene polymerization , polymer morphology could be improved by catalyst particle morphology improvement . the catalyst microparticles with narrow particle size distribution were obtained by rapid expansion from supercritical solution ( RESS ) . propane was chosen as a supercritical solvent and Cp2TiCl2 was selected as metallocene sample to catalyze ethylene in hexane medium . As a necessary fundamental research on rapid expansion of supercritical solution ( RESS ) , the solubilities of titanocene dichloride in supercritical propane were measured by the static equilibrium method at temperatures from <nUm> to <nUm> K and pressure from <nUm> to <nUm> MPa . the solubility data were correlated with the peng - Robinson(PR) equation of state and the AARD was <nUm> % . RESS experiments were performed at different operation conditions , including solute concentration , pre-expansion temperature , nozzle length and diameter , and sample collection distance . the size of quasi-spherical and spherical particles formed in the RESS process with several microns decreased with the increase of solution concentration , the decrease of pre-expansion temperature , the increase of nozzle diameter and the decrease of nozzle diameter . and the particle size increased with increasing collection distance until <nUm> mm . the catalyst particles were characterized through ethylene slurry polymerization to obtain the polymer . it was found that polymerization rate of ethylene was accelerated greatly and induced time was shortened for the RESS - reformed catalyst by comparing with the original catalyst particles . and the size distribution of reformed catalyst particles and the morphology of polymer were greatly improved . 
based on dichloride derivatives of zirconocenes with C2 symmetry and borates , active catalysts of propylene polymerization were formed on a polymer support , PE with a grafted poly(acrylic acid ) treated with poly(methylaluminoxane) . it was shown that the nature of aluminoxane affects the activity of the catalytic system : when aluminoxane is synthesized on the support surface , the activity of the catalyst increases . the influence of the nature of zirconocene and borate on the catalytic behavior of a system containing triisobutylaluminum as a cocatalyst was studied . variation in the polymerization conditions ( liquefied propylene or heptane suspension ) was found not to affect the kinetics of polymerization , characterized by the steady - state rate of monomer consumption . particle - size analysis of the polymers prepared using various systems is presented together with their molecular masses , melting temperatures , and isotacticity indices . 
the complex polymorphic behaviour of four syndiotactic polypropylene ( sPP ) samples have been analysed by means of DSC and WAXD techniques . two samples ( sPP1 , sPP2 ) were synthesised via metallocene polymerization by using the ansa - zirconocene ph 2C(Cp)(9-Flu)ZrCl <nUm> as catalyst . finally , two additional specimens with different molar masses ( sPP1 - fr1 , sPP1 - fr2 ) were prepared from the most syndiotactic sPP1 sample by temperature gradient extraction . the WAXD analysis shows that together with the orthorhombic form I , form II can coexist in a variable but small proportion depending on both the chain features and the processing conditions . the relative contribution of the disordered and the ordered types of form I is also dictated by molar mass , configurational microstructure as well as processing conditions . the observed changes in the thermal properties as measured by DSC and in the mechanic - dynamical relaxations of the samples , on slowing the crystallisation rate down , can be rationalised in terms of two concurrent processes , namely the perfection undergone by the crystals and the segregation of the amorphous phase .

A series of phenyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl zirconocenes have been prepared by the reaction of the corresponding ligand with n-BuLi and Cl4Zr in toluene , which were characterized by 1H NMR , MS spectra and elemental analysis . ethylene polymerizations with these complexes in combination with MAO were studied . it is found that the catalytic activity and the molecular weight of polyethylene with one phenyl substituted zirconocene increase with the enhancement of polymerization temperature . 
4,4'-Dibromobiphenyl reacted with n-BuLi to form 4,4'-dilithiobiphenyl , which further reacted with <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , 5-tetramethylcyclopent-2-enone following the elimination of water to give the ligand 4-(C5Me4H) C3H2 - C3H2 (C5Me4H)-4 ( 1 ) . ligand <nUm> reacted with n-BuLi and Cl4Zr to form the p-biphenylene-bridged dinuclear tetramethylcyclopentadienyl zirconium trichlorides 4-(C5Me4ZrCl3) · C3H2 - C3H2 (C5Me4ZrCl3)-4 , which reacted in situ with cyclopentadienyl lithium(CpLi) or indenyl lithium ( IndLi ) to give the corresponding p-biphenylene-bridged dinuclear zirconocenes 4-(C5Me4ZrCl2Cp') C3H2 - C6H4(C5Me4ZrCl 2Cp')-4 [ cp' = cp(2) , ind(3) ] . the zirconocenes <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by 1H NMR , MS spectra and elemental analysis , and were studied for ethylene polymerization with methyl a-luminoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst . both <nUm> and <nUm> show very high activities and reach the maximum at a higher temperature , indicating that the introduction of the p-biphenylene-bridge increased the catalytic activity and thermal stability of the dinuclear zirconocene catalysts . 
A series of new oxygen - substituted , asymmetric zirconocene dichlorides ( rac-{1-[5,6-(ethylenedioxy)-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl]-2- (9-e5-fluorenyl)ethane}zirconium dichloride ( 3a ) , rac{1-[5,6-(ethylenedioxy)-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl]-2- (9-e5-fluorenyl)ethane}dimethylzirconium ( 3b ) and rac-{[5,6-ethylenedioxy)-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl] ( 9-e5-fluorenyl ) dimethylsilane } zirconium dichloride ( 3c ) } have been prepared and their polymerization behavior was investigated in dependence of monomer concentration , temperature and catalyst activation . the presence of oxygen substituents on the indenyl ring results in a strong increase of polymerization activities and also of polymer molecular weights with decreasing Al / Zr ratio . significantly higher molecular masses and activities were found for the dimethyl complex 3b after activation with [(C6H5)3C+] [(C6F5)4B-] deriving from the absence of chain transfer to aluminum and higher concentration of active cata lyst species . the mechanism of stereoerror formation of the oxygen - containing C1 - symmetric catalyst was investigated by deuterium labeling studies on propene monomers . the results are discussed on the basis of a reversible chain transfer to aluminum . 
the polymerized metallocene catalyst <nUm> was prepared by the co-polymerization of ansa - zirconocene complex [ ( CH2 = CH)CH3Si(C 5H4)2]ZrCl2 ( 3 ) containing vinyl substituted silane bridge with styrene in the presence of radical initiator . catalyst <nUm> was found to display high ethylene polymerization activity of <nUm> × <nUm> gPE / ( mol*h ) with a viscosity average molecular weight ( me ) value of <nUm> × <nUm> using methylalumoxane ( MAO ) as a co-catalyst . the ethylene polymerization has been investigated under different conditions . 
A group <nUm> metallocene complex that serves as olefin polymerization catalyst was tethered on a solid support such as silica gel by covalent bonds . A zirconocene complex that has a vinyl group on its cyclopentadienyl ligand was hydrosilated or hydroborated to introduce a functional anchor for immobilization reactions . the complex with a Si-Cl group was tethered on a silica surface by the reaction with a surface Si-OH group . the zirconocene with a BH group was immobilized on a silica gel modified with chlorodimethylvinylsilane . ethylene polymerization using the tethered catalysts showed that the hydroboration-method seems more effective than the hydrosilation-method . it exhibited comparable catalytic activity to the corresponding homogeneous catalyst and produced polyethylene of a higher molecular weight . 
In order to compare with silylene-bridged group <nUm> metallocenes . C2 symmetric dimethylgermylene-bridged zirconocene and hafnocene dichlorides were prepared and employed as the catalyst for polymerization of propylene in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . germylene-bridged metallocenes always produced isotactic polypropylene of higher molecular weight than that produced by silylene-bridged analogues . the molecular structures of four metallocenes prepared from dimethylsilylene and germylenebis(2,3,5-trimethylcyclopentadienyl) were determined by x-ray diffraction and showed no substantial differences of geometry between silylene- and germylene-bridged ones . 
A new cyclopentadiene derivative 1,2-diphenyl-4-propyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene(1) was synthesized by reaction of 3,4-diphenyl-2-cyclopentenone with n-propyl lithium . <nUm> was treated with n-butyl lithium and then reacted with Cl4Zr in toluene to give sterically bulky unbridged zirconocene dichloride (1,2-Ph2-4-PrCp)2ZrCl2(2) . 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopic analyses reveal its c2u- symmetric conformation in solution . upon activation with methylaluminoxane(MAO) , <nUm> effectively polymerizes ethylene and produces high molecular weight polyethylenes with high melting transition temperatures at low Al / Zr ratios . At ambient conditions , <nUm> / MAO system shows high catalytic activity in propylene polymerization and produces oily oligomers . 
the reaction of trimethylaluminum with the inner water of a zeolite ( the Na form of ZSM-5 , O2Si : Al2O3 = <nUm> ) yielded immobilized methylaluminoxanes which in the absence of other organoaluminum cocatalysts reacted with metallocenes ( Cp2ZrCl2 , Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) to form heterogenized complexes active in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene . the kinetics of ethylene and propylene polymerization in the presence of zeolite - supported zirconocene catalysts was studied . the reaction order of ethylene and propylene polymerization with respect to the concentration of the monomer changes from <nUm> to <nUm> as the concentration of the monomer in the reaction zone increases . the apparent activation energies of ethylene and propylene polymerization with the ZSM-5(H2O) / AlMe3 / Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst were found to be <nUm> and <nUm> kJ / mol , respectively . it is inferred that the synthesis of methylaluminoxane directly on the surface of a support and the formation of catalytic complexes in the absence of free methylaluminoxane reduce the probability of leaching active centers from the support surface to a solution . 
based on an extensive review of the literature , the progress made so far in the application of organometalic catalysts in the polymerization of olefins , taking into special consideration the most recent research in this field has been presented . the possibilities of obtaining by this method polyolefins of various structures and properties have also been explored . In accordance with the state - of - art in the technology of polyolefin production , the results of the most recent research in opole , an active center in this field , development and evaluation of the catalytic properties of novel organometalic catalysts have been presented . special attention was devoted to catalysts derived from the postmetallocene system group such as complexes with salene - type or bis(phenoxy-imine) ligands and bis(phenoxy-imine) complexes ( tables 1-4 ) . the influence of the composition , especially the ligand structures ( fig. <nUm> ) , the central metal in complexes and the type of organoaluminium activators ( fig. <nUm> ) on catalyst system activity in the polymerization of ethylene as well as on the properties of the obtained polymerization product ( fig. <nUm> ) was evaluated . 
metallocene - catalyzed polymerization of olefins and diolefins , including styrene and selected polar vinyl monomers , is an important new technology that in recent years has started to make significant inroads into the polyolefin marketplace . metallocenes have broadened our knowledge of the mechanistic understanding of ZieglerNatta catalysis , stereospecific polymerization , and termination reactions . In contrast to classic ZieglerNatta catalysis , the polymerization takes place at a defined transition metal center , which allows precise control of the monomer insertion and other reaction steps . many titanocenes , zirconocenes , and hafnocenes with various symmetries have been synthesized and found to give tailored polymers of totally different structures . methylalumoxane or other bulky cocatalysts are the main causes for the high activities of the metallocene catalysts . single - site catalysts have the capability of permitting the user to control polymer tacticity , molecular weight , and molecular weight distribution more efficiently than in the . 
the polymerization of ethylene using supported zirconocene catalysts with varying support compositions SiO2-MAO-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2+TIBA ( catalyst I ) and MgCl2-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2+TIBA ( catalyst II ) ( MAO is methylaluminoxane , ind is indenyl , and TIBA is triisobutylaluminum ) was studied . the examined catalytic systems differ in their activity , ability to control the molecular mass of the resulting polymer , and kinetics of copolymerization with 1-hexene . the molecular structure of PE prepared with supported catalysts I and II and a homogeneous catalyst Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2+MAO was studied by IR and 13C NMR spectroscopy . As evidenced by 13C NMR spectroscopy , PE samples synthesized with the homogeneous catalyst and catalyst I contain ethyl branches along with the end methyl groups in the low-molecular-mass fractions . on the contrary , PE prepared with supported catalyst II is devoid of ethyl branches but contains vinyl groups as the basic type of unsaturation . 
the influence of the activation procedure applied to a metallocene on its catalytic behavior in ethylene polymerization is discussed and the effect of the zirconocene / activator nature on the properties of PE is demonstrated . MAO and TIBA / CPh <nUm> B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> are intercompared as cocatalysts . the catalytic behavior and the kinetics of ethylene polymerization catalyzed by TIBA / CPh <nUm> B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> - activated metallocene complexes allowed to infer that , in ternary catalytic systems with dichloride precatalysts , TIBA acts not only as an impurity scavenger or simply an alkylating agent , but also as a cocatalyst giving rise to heteronuclear cationic species providing lower chain propagation and chain transfer rates than those generated upon MAO action . when activated with TIBA / CPh <nUm> B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> dichloride zirconocenes were moderately active as compared with MAO and yielded EsP of considerably higher m . A halide or alkyl ligand present in the outer coordination sphere of active sites affects considerably both the catalytic performance of active species and the properties of the resulting PE . the Cl - keeping Al - Zr heteronuclear active sites give rise to high-M linear PE ; alkyl holders are highly capable of chain propagation and chain transfer to monomer . the high reactivity of the Zr - Cl bond in the latter active sites manifests itself also in the high ability to incorporate alfa - olefins to yield PE chains containing branches with <nUm> - <nUm> incorporated ethylene units . 
A new polymer - supported metallocene catalyst has been prepared . the polymer - supported metallocene displayed considerably high activity in ethylene polymerization , the highest being <nUm> x <nUm> <nUm> gPE / molZr*h , the molecular weight of the polyethylene produced was Mn = <nUm> x <nUm> <nUm> , about 3-4 times those of corresponding homogeneous zirconocenes . the polymer - supported metallocene keeps the characteristics of homogeneous metallocene catalysts , and offers some features,such as adaptable to gas phase and slurry processes ; easy to prepare in low cost ; relatively high activity and lower MAO / Zr ratio ; lower inorganic residues in the polyolefins as compared to cases of OSi <nUm> Al <nUm> O <nUm> or ClMg <nUm> ; unitary active structure , no complex surface as with OSi <nUm> ; good control of morphology of the resulting polymer . 
vinyl-type polymerization of norbornene has been carried out with half - titanocene / MAO catalysts . it was found that the cp (cyclopentadienyl)-bearing titanocene catalysts afford the polynorbornene at much higher yield than the related cp * (pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)-bearing one . on the other hand , substitution of - OR ligand for chlorine at the cp - bearing compound causes remarkbaly increase in catalytic activity . the optimum temperature for the polymerization is <nUm> ° C . all the polynorbornenes obtained with CpTi(OCH2Ph)3 / MAO catalyst are soluble in the organic solvents such as cyclohexane and monochlorobenzene . the FTIR and 13C NMR spectra indicate that the polynorbornene obtained is vinyl-type polymer and has low stereo - regularity . 
A kinetic , active centre , and morphological analysis has been carried out on the polymerization of ethylene and propylene in hydrocarbon , aromatic and chloroaromatic media using selected homogeneous and silica supported metallocene catalysts activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . A number of procedures for supporting selected model zirconocene compounds ( biscyclopentadienylzirconium dichloride and ethylenebisindenylzirconium dichloride ) on different types of silica have been investigated . it is established that the overall activities and kinetic behaviour of these supported catalysts are strongly affected by the procedure used for the catalyst preparation . In general supported metallocene catalysts were shown to have lower activities and also lower numbers of propagating active centers than did the corresponding soluble catalyst systems . MAO pretreated silica catalysts were shown by SEM studies to produce polymer with good morphology and the results obtained indicated that silica fragmentation producing microreactor behaviour could be obtained in these polymerizing catalyst systems . 
the copolymerization of ethylene(E) and norbornene ( N ) was examined by using various metallocene catalysts and modified - MAO(MMAO) cocatalyst . for C2 - symmetry catalysts such as rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 , Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 , me2 Si(Cp)2ZrCl2 and Cs - symmetrical iPr(FluCp)ZrCl2 as well as CGC and di-bridged zirconocene , the effects of catalyst structure and [N] / [E] feed ratio on catalyst activity , thermal property and [N] content of copolymer ( COC ) was investigated . for rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst of a constant [N] / [E] feed ratio , the appropriate conditions of [Al] / [Zr] mole ratio , polymerization temperature and cocatalyst structure were found to be <nUm> , <nUm> ° C , MMAO cocatalyst , respectively . As [N] / [E] feed ratio increased , the incorporation of norbornene to copolymer increased while the activity of catalyst decreased except for iPr(FluCp)ZrCl2 . with consideration of catalyst activity as well as N content , it was found that rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MMAO system exhibited relatively high activity and controllable tg . monomer reactivity ratio was determined by kelen - tudos method . 
A MgCl2(THF)2 support modified by organoaluminum chloride or MAO enabled us to obtain specially active zirconocene catalyst systems for ethylene polymerization . the zirconocene system on the bimetallic support was found to be the more active than that on the monometallic support . two kinds of catalytic active sites were found to exist in the supported zirconocene catalyst : unstable active sites that become deactivated during the polymerization of ethylene , and very stable catalytic centers created in the olefin environment . the kinetic investigations on the ethylene polymerization allowed to suggest the reason underlying the creation of the stable active sites . 
A family of zirconocene , yttrocene , and scandocene complexes have been prepared utilizing an easily modified doubly bridged ligand array , ( 1,2-SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> { η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> -4-R}{e <nUm> -C <nUm> H-3,5-(CHMe <nUm> ) <nUm> } , developed in our laboratories . variations in ligand array substitution and metal center provide complexes that exhibit a range of stereoselectivities and activities in a-olefin polymerizations . A series of C s -and C <nUm> -symmetric metallocenes have been utilized for the preparation of polypropylene and polypentene under various polymerization conditions . analysis of the resulting polymer microstructures has provided valuable information about the factors that dictate syndiospecificity , as well as common error forming mechanisms for these systems . 
the catalytic properties of the complexes (RCp)2ZrCl2 ( r = H , me , pri , bun , bui , Me3Si , cyclo-C6H11 ) , and Me2SiCp*NButZrCl2 ( cp* = C3H4 ) combined with the AlBui3-CPh3B(C6F5)4 cocatalyst in ethylene polymerization were studied . the specific activity of the substituted bis-cyclopentadienyl complexes decreases in the sequence : me > pri > bun > bui > Me3Si > cyclo-C6H11 , which corresponds to the activity sequence for these complexes activated by polymethylaluminoxane ( MAO ) but is 4-20 times lower in absolute value . comparison of the polyethylene samples obtained in the presence of the same complexes with MAO and AlBui3-CPh3B(C6F5)4 cocatalysts showed that polyethylene with much higher molecular mass , melting point , and crystallinity is formed in the presence of the ternary catalytic systems , and this indicates a different nature of the active sites of the catalytic systems . the effective activation energy of polymerization ( ∼ <nUm> kcal mol-1 ) , first order with respect to monomer and ∼ <nUm> order with respect to organoaluminum component , was found for the (PriCp)2ZrCl2-AlBui3-CPh3B(C6F5)4 catalytic system . it was proposed on the basis of the kinetic data that AliBu3 enters into the composition of the active site to form a bridged heteronuclear cationic complex . 
star - shaped hydroxyl functionalized atacticpolymethylmethacrylate was synthesized via living / controlled radical polymerization promoted by titanocene complex in the presence of <nUm> , 4'-methylenebis(N , n-diglycidylaniline ) ( I4 ) as the initiator , and Zn as the reducing agent . the effect of polymerization conditions such as temperature , time , as well as the ratio of the initiator to monomer on the polymerization performance was investigated . the results indicate that the monomer conversion is up to <nUm> % at <nUm> ° C and [MMA] / [I4] = <nUm> / <nUm> . the number average molecular weight of the polymer linearly depends on the monomer conversion , implying that the performance shows living manner . the structure and properties of the obtained polymer were characterized by gel permeation in chromatography(GPC) , nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum ( 1H - NMR and 13C - NMR ) . the obtained polymer is atacticspecific and features narrow molecule weight distribution ( <nUm> ~ <nUm> ) under the typical condition . the number of arms and the functional hydroxyl groups of the polymer molecule are four , good corresponding with the number of the epoxy functional groups of the initiator ( I4 ) used . 
the polymethylene-bridged dinuclear half - titanocenes [(CH2)n(C5H4)2][TiCl 3]2 ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) have been synthesized by treating the distannylated derivatives of the ligands with two equivalents of Cl4Ti in toluene . all complexes are characterized by IR , 1H NMR , 13C NMR and mass spectrometry . In order to examine the catalytic properties of the dinuclear complexes styrene polymerization has been conducted in the presence of MMAO . from the polymerization experiments it was found that ( i ) all the prepared complexes 10-12 produced syndiotactic polystyrenes , ( ii ) the complex <nUm> holding the longest bridging ligand exhibited the highest activity but produced a polymer having the smallest molecular weight among the polymethylene-bridged dinuclear half - titanocenes . this behavior was attributed to the influence of electron - donating caused by the polymethylene bridge between two active centers as well as the effect of steric congestion around metal center caused by the proximal distance between two active sites . 
bulk polymerization of propylene was studied over four ansa - zirconocene catalysts , viz. , Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) , Me2Si(4-Ph-2-Et-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) ( rac : meso = <nUm> : <nUm> ) , Ph2C(CpFlu)ZrCl2 ( 3 ) , and Me2C(3-Me-CpFlu)ZrCl2 ( 4 ) , which were characterized by different symmetries ( C1 , C2 , Cs ) . the structure of the metallocene affected the structure of PP . upon reactions with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) , compounds 1-4 produced very active catalytic systems which catalyzed the polymerization to yield various structures of PP . catalysts <nUm> and <nUm> gave isotactic PP , catalyst <nUm> gave syndiotactic PP and catalyst <nUm> gave hemiisotactic PP . Hemiiso-PP was similar in structure to amorphous PP and had no melting point . the catalytic activity of the system and molecular weight and stereospecificity of PP were studied in relation to the mode of preparation of the catalyst . kinetic parameteres were evaluated , viz. , time of insertion of the propylene molecule ( <nUm> - <nUm> s ) and the time of growth of a single PP macromolecule ( 3-6 s ) , and from these data the minimum degree of polymerization was determined . activation energies were evaluated for the polymerization carried out over each catalyst system . young 's modulus , molecular weight and stereoregularity of the PP prepared were determined . 
A novel molecularly hybridized polyethylene / silica composite thin film was obtained by the gas - phase polymerization of ethylene with a titanocene - mounted mesoporous silica layer on a mica plate with mesoscopic pores arranged on the film surface . however , the use of titanocene - mounted hexagonal domains of mesoporous silica on a glass plate for the gas - phase polymerization of ethylene resulted in the formation of an islanded polyethylene / silica hybridized material . 
branched polyethylene was synthesized by ethylene homopolymerization in the presence of a novel metallocene complex of e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl tribenzyloxy titanium [ cp* Ti (OBz)3 ] activated by four types of modified methylaluminoxanes(mMAO) which contained different amounts of residual trimethylaluminum(TMA) . the activity of catalyst and molecular weight , branched degree and branch length of the resultant polymers depend on the oxidation states of active species of titanium and polymerization temperature . the higher content ( % ) of residual TMA in mMAO could strongly reduce complexes Ti(IV) to Ti (III) and Ti (II) and Ti(IV) active species was suggested to be more effective for ethylene polymerization . the products obtained were confirmed by 13C NMR and IR spectra characterization to be branched polyethylene with isolated long branch and methyl pendant . there is a remarkable increase in proportion of methyl pendant with the increase of polymerization temperature . 
new examples of chiral C2 - symmetric zirconocenes of low stereoselectivity are presented . zirconenes <nUm> and <nUm> , upon activation with methylalumoxane , produce amorphous polypropylenes with acceptable molecular weights at practical polymerization temperatures and mmmm pentad values between <nUm> and <nUm> % . non-bonded interaction analysis by molecular mechanics accounts for the low enantioselectivity of <nUm> and <nUm> , and predicts the isospecificity of the rac-H2C(2-Me-3-iPr-1-Ind)2ZrR+ catalyst . 
an unbridged zirconocene complex bis(1,2-diphenylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride [(1,2-Ph2-C5H3)2ZrCl2] <nUm> has been synthesized and structurally characterized . when activated by MAO , <nUm> produces ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene with high melting transition temperature , as well as atactic oligopropylene with average molecular weight of ∼ <nUm> g mol-1 . 
studies related to the behavior of different metallocene catalysts for the homopolymerization of 1-octadecene and its copolymerization with ethylene will be presented . the metallocenes : rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 , rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 and Ph2C(Flu)(Cp)ZrCl2 were chosen for the homopolymerization study . they show important differences in catalytic activity at high temperatures ( ≥ <nUm> ° C ) , with rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 showing the highest activity . At lower temperatures ( ≤ <nUm> ° C ) the differences are negligible . for the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-octadecene only the catalysts rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 were studied . the results show that their catalytic activity is just like that for the homopolymerization of 1-octadecene , with higher activity for the metallocene with the et - bridged catalyst . 13C - NMR analysis shows that the composition of the copolymerization products depends on the catalytic systems . copolymers obtained with rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 have greater comonomer incorporation . thermal analysis shows that poly-1-octadecene synthesized with the catalyst rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 is very dependent on the polymerization temperature . the homopolymer obtained at <nUm> ° C presents two endothermal peaks at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> ° C , as compared with the one obtained at <nUm> ° C which presents one wider peak with a maximum at <nUm> ° C . for the catalyst rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 this trend is not observed . the type of metallocene and the reaction time do not significantly change the intrinsic viscosity , but the polymerization temperature changes it drastically , giving higher values at lower temperature . viscosity measurements on the copolymers show that an increase of comonomer concentration in the feed reduces the molecular weight of the copolymer , and it was also found that for homopolymer , the molecular weight is independent of the catalytic systems . 
Rac-H2C(3-t-Bu-1-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) is a novel , easy to synthesize , high performance catalyst for the polymerization of isotactic propylene ( i-PP ) . methylalumoxane (MAO)-activated <nUm> produces i-PP with good activities at <nUm> ° C in liquid monomer and AlMAO / Zr of <nUm> mol / mol , melting points around <nUm> ° C , and average viscosity molecular weights around <nUm> , at tp = <nUm> ° C . the isotacticity of i-PP from <nUm> / MAO is similar to those of the xylene-insoluble fractions of i-PP from heterogeneous Ti - Cl2Mg catalysts . melting points are lower than those of i-PP from Ti catalysts , but close to or higher than stereospecific zirconocene catalysts . molecular weight distributions are narrow as typical of metallocene catalysts . 
organometallic complexes , based on group IV metals , are of special fundamental and technological interest due to their important catalytic applications in many organic syntheses , including olefin polymerization and activation of small molecules . In this chapter , the orbital nature of excited states of organometallic p-complexes , based on group IV metals in the d0 electronic configuration , is surveyed , and their photophysical characteristics are discussed . emphasis is given to redox , photophysical , photochemical properties , and their generalization regarding extremely rare ligand - to - metal charge transfer ( LMCT ) excited states of group IV metallocenes , experimental quantities of the highest occupied ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied ( LUMO ) molecular orbitals , a trend in the HOMO-LUMO energy gap upon structural variations in the complexes . experimental key relations ehv ∝ DEredox are demonstrated for early transition metals ( Ti , Zr , and Hf ) . combination of photophysical and electrochemical methods provides first experimental estimate of both HOMO and LUMO relative energies and the HOMO- LUMO energy gap in organometallic p-complexes , having an early transition metal . the tendency in the observed photophysics ( absorption and luminescence spectra , experimental and radiative lifetimes , and emission quantum efficiencies ) in the homologous group IVB metallocenes is discussed in view of the nature of a d0 metal ion and coordination sphere of organometallic complexes . A d0 zirconocene dichloride is reported as a first group IV metal complex , possessing LMCT excited states with remarkable emission quantum yield ( up to <nUm> ) and excited - state lifetime ( in the range of microseconds ) in fluid solutions at room temperature surpassing those of pure LMCT excited states , reported in up - to - date literature . A photophysical approach to estimate the orbital nature of extremely long - lived LMCT excited states and coordinative interactions of basic components of catalytic systems for polymerization ( d0 bent metallocene precatalysts and unsaturated hydrocarbon substrates ) are discussed . orbital interactions between d0 bent metallocenes , unsaturated hydrocarbons , and organic solvents are rationalized in terms of microscopic ( electronic and structural peculiarities ) , rather than macroscopic ( dielectric constants , viscosity , etc. ) properties of the solvent molecules . the photophysical approach is highlighted to enable studying intermolecular ( including fine coordinative ) interactions in homogeneous systems with catalytic concentrations of metal complexes that can not be achieved by other conventional physico - chemical methods . 
the tetraphenyl substituted disiloxane bridged ansa - zirconocene has been generated to probe the effect of bridging ligand on metallocene polymerization . the indicated zirconocene has been synthesized by the reaction of Cl4Zr with the distannylated precursor compound . the new disiloxane bridged ansa - metallocene was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR , mass analysis , and elemental analysis . ethylene polymerization was carried out to in- , vestigate the polymerization properties of the prepared complex . polymerization experiments exhibited that the catalytic activity increases with the increase in polymerization temperature as well as the amount of cocatalyst . on the other hand , the molecular weights of the polymers decreased with the increase in polymerization temperature . it turned out that tetraphenyl replacement caused about <nUm> to <nUm> % activity reduction . the most important feature associated in tetramethyl to tetraphenyl substitution was that molecular weights of the polymers from the tetraphenyl substituted complex were enormously improved comparing to those of the polymers from the tetramethyl one . 
zirconocene supported on alumina or magnesium chloride exhibits modest olefin polymerization activity but not when it is supported directly on silica . the surface silanol as well as siloxane groups must be passivated with appropriate reagents . A very active and stereospecific supported catalyst was obtained by first reacting silica with methylalumoxane and bisphenol A before the impregnation of the ansa - zirconocene precursor . the main difference between a homogeneous and supported catalyst is that at the same gross amount of metallocene , the net concentration of it in the pores of a support material is several orders of magnitude greater than it exists in solution thus the rate of deactivation in the former case is correspondingly faster than in the latter . most other supported metallocene catalysts based on supports such as zeolites , cyclodextrin , polymeric MAO , synthetic polymers , etc. , are poor in olefin polymerization for this and other reasons discussed . 
tetramethyldisilane - bridged bis(1 - indenyl and tetrahydroindenyl ) metallocene dichlorides(Me2SiSiMe2)Ind2MCl 2[M = ti(1) , zr(2) ] and (Me2SiSiMe2)[IndH4]2MCl 2[M = ti(3) , zr(4) ] were synthesized . complexes 1-4 were characterized by 1H NMR , mass spectra and elemental analyses . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were used for the polymerization of ethylene after activation with methyl aluminoxane(MAO) at different temperatures and normal pressure . the titanocene <nUm> shows a lower activity but produces polyethylene with a higher molecular weight than zirconocene <nUm> . the catalyst systems show a dependency of the activity and molecular weight on temperature . 
metallocene catalysts in dissolved form are in most cases unsuitable for the production of polyethylene or polypropylene on an industrial scale . In order to use them in existing technical processes , metallocenes have to be supported . Cs - symmetric zirconocenes show a high activity and no leaching additional triisobutyl aluminum is used as scavenger and MAO - covered silica for heterogenization . the aluminum : zirconium ratio can be reduced to values of <nUm> : <nUm> to get optimal activities . the syndiotacticity of the obtained polypropylene is lower compared with polymers of the homogeneous catalyst and decreases strongly with a thinner propene concentration . 
two new unbridged zirconocenes , bis(2,4,7-trimethyl indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( Met-I ) and bis(2-methyl-4,7-diethyl indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( Met-II ) were prepared in order to investigate the steric effects of substituents on the nature of the catalysts for the polymerization of propylene . A mixture of methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) and triisobutylaluminum [Al(iBu)3)] was used as cocatalyst to activate these catalysts . the decrease in steric bulkiness of substituents at <nUm> and <nUm> positions of the indenyl ring resulted in an increase of both activity and molecular weight as well as the isotacticity . 
ethylene is polymerized by heterobimetallic combinations of early and late transition metal catalysts . dual combinations of zirconocenes and cationic nickel and iron catalysts with multidentate nitrogen - donor ligands are described . reactor blends of linear and branched ethylene homopolymers are obtained . with zirconocene / nickel complex catalyst combinations , addition of hydrogen selectively reduces the molecular weight of the linear polyethylene formed by the metallocene catalyst . 
propylene polymerizations in the presence of various monocyclopentadienyltitanium compounds and methylaluminoxanes ( MAO ) have been investigated . it was found that by substituting methyl group for hydrogen in the cyclopentadienyl ring , the titanocene catalyst affords a polypropylene with increasing molecular weight by one order of magnitude . residual AIMe <nUm> content in MAO has an determinative effect on catalytic activity for the propylene polymerization . an excess of AlMe <nUm> in the catalyst system , such as <nUm> % AlMe <nUm> in MAO , hinders the polymerization by reducing the Ti species to inactive lower valent states . the effects of molar ratio of MAO to Ti complex , polymerization temperature and monomer pressure on catalytic activity and molecular weight of the products are studied in detail . thus , atactic polypropylene with the molecular weight range of 20-100 × <nUm> , much higher than that prepared by unsubstiuted cyclopentadienyltitanium complex has been synthsized by η <nUm> pentamethylcyclopentadienyltitanium tribenzyloxide / MAO catalyst . the atatic polypropylenes exhibit excellent elasticity . 
syndiotactic polystyrene ( syndiotacticity > <nUm> % ) was synthesized by bulk polymerization catalyzed with highly active novel titanocene η 5- pentamethylcyclo pentadienyl - tri - <nUm> - methoxyphenoxy titanium(Cp* Ti(OC 6OCH 3)3 ) and methyl - aluminoxane(MAO) catalyst system . the catalytic activity of the styrene bulk polymerization is up to <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> g / ( g · h ) and the monomer conversion is <nUm> % at <nUm> ° C , both are much higher than those of polymerization in toluene solution . the effects of polymerization temperature , catalyst concentration , and molar ratio of MAO / Ti on bulk polymerization are reported . the addition of triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) to the catalytic system can promote the catalyst activity . 
polymerization properties of six dinuclear constrained geometry catalysts ( DCGC ) were investigated . the different length bridges of three catalysts were para-phenyl ( catalyst <nUm> ) , para-xylyl ( catalyst <nUm> ) , and para-diethylene phenyl ( catalyst <nUm> ) . the other three DCGC have the same para-xylyl bridge with the different substituents at the phenyl ring of the bridge . the selected substituents were isopropyl ( catalyst <nUm> ) , n-hexyl ( cataylst <nUm> ) , and n-octyl ( catalyst <nUm> ) . it was found that the longer catalyst not only exhibited a greater activity but also prepared a higher molecular weight copolymer . the catalyst <nUm> having a bulky isopropyl substituent revealed the lower activity but formed the highest molecular weight polymer comparing with the other alkyl substituted DCGCs . these results were able to be understood on the basis of the electronic and steric characteristics of the bridge . this study confirms that the control of the bridge structure of DCGC may contribute to control the microstructure of polymers . 
we have analyzed the computational results for several elementary reactions of the ethylene polymerization process catalyzed by an alternative ( to the existing metallocene catalysts ) " non-cyclopentadienyl " catalysts such as diimine - M(II) ( where m = Ni and Pd ) and chelating bridged ti- and Zr - complexes . the obtained data have been compared with those for the existing zirconocene - based catalysts . In general , it was shown that : ( i ) the resting stage of the process is a metal-olefin-alkyl complex , the olefin coordination energy of which is a few kcal / mol larger for diimine - M(II) systems than zirconocene or dialkoxide systems ; ( ii ) the rate - determining barrier is a migratory insertion barrier calculated from the metal-olefin-alkyl complex , which is found to be a few kcal / mol larger for the diimine - M(II) system compared to the Cp2ZrCH3+ catalyst . the presence of certain flexible bridging ligands x in the Ti - alkoxide complex , [Y(Ph)X(Ph)Y]TiCH3+ , which are capable of donating electron density to the cationic metal center at various stages during the reaction makes this barrier a few kcal / mol smaller for the dialkoxide than the Cp2ZrCH3+ catalyst . it was shown that an increase in the metal - bridge interaction decreases the migratory insertion barrier and , consequently , increases the catalytic activity of these complexes . although the diimine - M(II) catalysts are less active than zirconocene - based ones , the microstructure of the polymers produced by the former catalyst , which is found to be a function of temperature , ethylene , steric bulkiness of the auxiliary ligands , and transition metal center , makes them attractive for practice . we also have studied the mechanisms of several chain termination / transfer reactions , as well as the role of steric effects in the studied elementary reactions . we have clearly demonstrated tremendous possibilities of the computational chemistry in solving complex problems of the homogenous catalyst , and its high capability of predicting new and more active catalysts for different commercially important processes including olefin polymerization reactions . 
some highly active e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyltribenzyloxy titanium complexes [Cp*Ti(OBz)3] activated by modified methylaluminoxane ( mMA ) were prepared and used as the catalyst for styrene syndiospecific polymerization and propene atactic polymerization . styrene could be copolymerized with propene when the propene was prepolymerized for a period , to which styrene and tri-isobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) were then added . the titled block copolymer together with the related homopolymers was obtained . the copolymerization porducts can be divided into the homopolymers and the copolymer by successive solvent extraction with boiling butanone , heptane and tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) , and each fraction was characterized by 13C NMR , DSC and WAXD . it was found that aPS and aPP were soluble in boiling butanone and heptane respectively . the block copolymer ( sPS-e-aPP ) composed of syndiotactic polystyrene segment was soluble in boiling THF and the residue was chiefly sPS . 
new data on the structure of polymethylaluminoxane[-Al(CH3)O-]n ( MAO ) , the nature of its lewis acidity , and the mechanism of formation of the active centers of the metallocene catalysts during interaction between MAO and Cp2ZrMe2 obtained by spectroscopy ( 27Al , 17O , 1H , and 13C NMR and spin probe ESR ) and density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations are considered . A three - dimensional structure of MAO ( a cage structure ) with four - coordinated aluminum atoms and three - coordinated oxygen atoms is found to be the most probable . experimental evidence for the presence of relatively weak lewis acid sites in MAO ( about <nUm> site per <nUm> atoms of Al ) is obtained for the first time . the acidity of MAO depends on the size of a MAO molecule n , and it increases with increasing n . A scheme for the formation and structure of lewis acid sites formed upon interaction between MAO and Al2Me6 , which is always present in the MAO samples is proposed . cationic intermediates formed in the MAO / Cp2ZrMe2 system at high molar ratios Al / Zr = 200-4000 corresponding to real conditions of polymerization are characterized for the first time . A scheme of equilibria between them and the most probable precursors of the active centers in this system are proposed . A new mechanism for the formation of the [Cp2ZrMe]+[MAO · me]- ionic pair involving the abstraction and occlusion of a methyl ligand in the bulk of a MAO molecule is proposed on the basis of quantum - chemical calculations . 
the reactivity of group <nUm> zirconocene dichlorides incorporating (1-trimethylsilyl)-e5-indenyl ( Me3SiInd ) and e5-1-(trimethylsilyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydromdenyl ( Me3SiTHI ) ligands toward boron tribromide was investigated . whereas the reaction of (Me3SiInd)CpZrCl2 ( 1 ) with BBr3 in CCl2H2 immediately cleaved the indenyl ligand from the metal , (Me3SiTHI)CpZrCl2 ( 3 ) reacted with BBr3 in CCl2H2 at <nUm> ° C for <nUm> days to obtain [1-(BrSiMe2)THI]CpZrBr2 ( 6 ) in <nUm> % yield . the reaction of (Me3SiInd)Li ( <nUm> equiv ) with ZrCl4(THF)2 afforded pure rac-(Me3-SiInd)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) in <nUm> % yield . hydrogenation of ( 2 ) ( <nUm> bar , O2Pt catalyst ) afforded rac-(Me3-SiTHI)2ZrCl2 ( 4 ) in <nUm> % yield . single - crystal x-ray diffraction analysis of <nUm> showed that the Zr atom lies on a crystallographic C2 axis with the CH2 annelated rings projecting into the Cl2Zr hemisphere of the pseudotetrahedral coordination environment . the reaction of <nUm> with MeLi in toluene afforded rac-(Me3SiTHI)2ZrMe2 ( 5 ) in <nUm> % yield . 1H NMR and 13C NMR analysis confirmed the rac assignment for <nUm> . treatment of <nUm> with BBr3 in CCl2H2 at <nUm> ° C for <nUm> days afforded rac-[1-(BrMe2Si)THI]2ZrBr2 ( 7 ) in <nUm> % yield . the reaction of <nUm> with moisture in ambient air gave the ansa - metallocene rac-[m-O-(1-Me2SiTHI)2]ZrBr2 ( 8 ) in <nUm> % yield . In solution , <nUm> showed time - averaged C2 symmetry ( 1H NMR ) ; however , single - crystal x-ray diffraction analysis showed that <nUm> adopts an asymmetric conformation in which only one of the CH2 annelated rings projects into the Cl2Zr coordination hemisphere . neither <nUm> nor <nUm> served as a precatalyst for alumoxane - cocatalyzed , homogeneous propylene polymerization . 
the polymeric [Ind2Si(C6H4)]n and [Ind2Si(C6H4)]m compounds ( ind = indenyl ) were synthesized via the condensation reaction of bisindenyldichlorosilane and p-dilithiobenzene or p-dilithiobiphenyl , and the supported - type zirconocene catalysts were prepared by reacting them with zirconium tetrachloride . the content of zirconium in the catalysts is much higher than that in the metallocene catalysts supported by inorganic compounds . polymerizations of ethene and propene were conducted with them using methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or ordinary alkylaluminiums as cocatalysts and toluene as the solvent . the catalysts combined with MAO display very high activities especially for the ethene polymerization . from the polymerization at high temperatures , it was found that the active species are markedly stabilized , probably due to the rigid backbones of the carriers . the activity of the catalysts activated with ordinary alkylaluminiums is far less as compared with those activated with MAO . 
new dinuclear half - titanocenes with polymethylene-bridged cp ligands were prepared and applied to styrene polymerization . the polymerization behavior of the prepared half - titanocenes was compared to that of CpTiCL3 as well as polysiloxane - bridged one . the activity of the half - titanocene increased with temperature but CpTiCl3 decreased indicating that thermal stability of the half - titanocene is better than CpTiCl3 . the polymerization behavior of dinuclear metallocene is influenced by not only the transition metal and ligands but also the structure of bridge linking the ligands . 
nine new fluorinated half - sandwich titanocene complexes ( lb-9b ) based on substituted alkylindenes were synthesized , by reacting Me3SnF with the corresponding chloride species , and employed as catalyst precursors for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene . when activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , the new precursors lb-9b exhibited increased activities by factors of 15-40 compared with the corresponding chlorinated compounds and provided improved syndiotacticity , enhanced melting temperature , and higher polymer molecular weights . the activities of indenyl and methyl- or phenyl-substituted indenyl complexes were found to be higher by factors of 4-12.5 than those of CpTiF3 and CpTiF3 . more importantly , the amount of MAOcan be reduced to an Al : Ti molar ratio of <nUm> in the temperature range of 10-90 ° C . it is likely that Ti-F , more polarized than the Ti-Cl bond in the half - sandwich titanocenes , allows the formation of more active and stable active sites of Ti (III) complexes needed for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene . evidence in this direction is brought via the electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) spectrum and redox titration . the higher activity and syndiospecificity of the fluorinated catalysts are attributable to a greater number , more stable Ti (III) active sites , and / or higher propagation rate con - stant . 
A series of substituted indenyl-fluorenyl asymmetric ethylene-bridged ligands have been prepared from the reaction of 1-(9-fluorenyl)-2-bromoethane and the lithium salt of the desired indenyl moiety . the ligands have been converted to the corresponding substituted asymmetric ethylene-bridged metallocenes ( m = Zr , Hf ) . these metallocenes have been evaluated as catalyst precursors for the polymerization of ethylene and propylene . the influence of substitution on the selectivity of the propylene polymerization has been studied . the metallocene [1-(9-fluorenyl)-2-(2,4,7-trimethyl-1-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride was found to produce highly isotactic polypropylene with an [mmmm] value of <nUm> % . 
A novel polymer - supported metallocene catalyst with crosslinked poly(styrene-co-acrylamide) ( AmPS ) as the support has been prepared and characterized . the probability of long sequences of acrylamide ( Am ) in AmPS is still low even at an Am amount of <nUm> mol % , implying the relatively homogeneous distribution of Am . the infrared spectra of AmPS and the supported catalyst substantiate that an amide group in AmPS coordinates with methylaluminoxane through both oxygen and nitrogen atoms . ethylene / a-octene copolymerization showed that the catalytic activity is not markedly affected by adding a-octene . 13C NMR analysis of the ethylene / a-octene copolymer indicated that the composition distribution of the copolymer is uniform . 
for ethylene polymerization , the supported metallocene catalyst was prepared by anchoring CpIndZrCl2 on silica with an appropriate spacer . the three procedures were applied for CpIndZrCl2 anchoring on silica with a hexamethyltrisiloxane or pentamethylene spacer . the anchoring procedures exerted a strong influence on the catalyst activity since the different anchoring methods gave the formation of different structures of active sites . with the new anchoring route , it was possible to prepare the " heterogeneous single - site " catalyst which was found to have only one catalyst structure on silica and exhibited a higher catalyst activity than that of the other supported catalysts . At a polymerization temperature of <nUm> ° C , the activity of the heterogeneous single - site catalyst was comparable to that of the unsupported homogeneous zirconocene . J appl polym sci <nUm> : 1071-1080 , <nUm> . 
In this study , a class of bis-1,2-(4-aryl-2-alkyl-1H- inden-1-yl ) ethane was synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic methods such as 1HNMR , 13CNMR , melting point and FTIR . bis-1,2-(4-aryl-2-alkyl-1H- inden-1-yl ) ethane was synthesized by the reaction of butyllithium , arylindenes and dibromoethane in a facile , one - pot strategy . it 's shown that these methods have a wide scope to afford libraries of aryl-substituted indenes . the prepared compounds was then applied as a ligand for the fabrication of a number of metal complexes which can be used as catalyst for the polymerization of the olefins . 
recent examples for synthesis of new polyolefins containing polar functionalities by coordination insertion copolymerization using group <nUm> metal complex ( Ti , Zr ) catalysts have been reviewed . In particular , examples by adopting the approaches by direct copolymerization of olefin with polar monomer using coordination insertion methods , and ( b ) controlled incorporation of reactive functionalities ( and the subsequent introduction of polar funtionalities under mild conditions ) have been described . our recent efforts for precise synthesis of polyolefins containing polar functionalities by ( i ) efficient incorporation of reactive functionality by copolymerization of ethylene with nonconjugated diene using nonbridged half - titanocene catalysts and ( ii ) subsequent chemical modifications under mild conditions have been introduced . 
photoinitiated polymerization reactions are characterized by important advantages compared to thermal reactions . the reaction can easily be turned on or off and is intrinsically spatially controlled . most photopolymerization reactions operate without solvent which is strongly demanded nowadays . the search for new photoinitiating systems remains important . particularly , the design of new sources of radicals is the subject of huge research efforts . the design of new initiating radicals with different geometries and properties and / or enhanced reactivity should provide new opportunities for the development of photocurable materials . In the present paper , new photoinitiating systems generating boryl ( L-BR2 ) , silyl ( R3Si ) or germyl ( R3Ge ) radicals are reviewed . these systems based on new radical chemistries improve both free radical photopolymerization ( FRP ) and free radical promoted cationic photopolymerization ( FRPCP ) . 
three - component photoinitiator systems generally include a light - absorbing photosensitizer ( PS ) , an electron donor , and an electron acceptor . to investigate a key factors involved with visible light activated free radical polymerizations involving three - component photoinitiators and 2-ethyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol triacrylate , we used thermodynamic feasibility and kinetic considerations to study photopolymerizations initiated with polymethine dyes as the PS . the rehm - weller equation was used to verify the thermodynamic feasibility for the photo - induced electron transfer reaction . the key kinetic factors for efficient visible light activated initiation process are summarized in two ways : ( i ) to retard back electron transfer process and recombination reaction steps and ( ii ) to use a secondary reaction step for consuming dye - based radical and regenerating the original PS ( dye ) . the paper presents the short review on the influence of a second co-initiator structure on the free radical polymerization ability of photoredox pairs composed of polymethine dye cation acting as an electron acceptor and n-butyltriphenylborate anion acting as an electron donor . it is also presented a very efficient concept to raise the photoinitiators activity by introducing of a second co-initiator to the two - component photoinitiating system being the polymethine borate salts . three - component systems , which contain a light - absorbing species ( dye ) , an electron donor ( borate salt ) , and a third component ( n-alkoxypyridinum salt , 1,3,5-triazine derivative , n-methylpicolinium ester , heteroaromatic mercaptan or cyclic acetal ) , have emerged as efficient , visible light sensitive photoinitiators of free radical polymerization . it was found that three - component photoinitiating systems are more efficient than their two - component counterparts . the photochemical reactions ( primary and secondary ) occurring in the three - component photoinitiating system after irradiation with visible light were proposed basing on the laser flash photolysis . the primary photochemical reaction involves an electron transfer from n-butyltriphenylborate anion to an excited singlet state of the dye , followed by the reaction of the second co-initiator with the resulting dye radical to regenerate the original dye . this reaction simultaneously produces a second radical , which undergoes decomposition yielding radicals active in the initiation of free radical polymerization . the polymethine dyes are able to start a specific chain of an electron transfer reaction involving different additives , giving as a result one photon - two - radicals photochemical response . 
effects of structural features of <nUm> dinuclear constrained geometry catalysts having paraxylene derivative bridge ( DCGC ) on copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene were investigated . the bridges of three catalysts have para-xylene backbone with a different substituent at benzene ring . the substituents were hydrogen ( catalyst <nUm> ) , isopropyl ( catalyst <nUm> ) , n-hexyl ( catalyst <nUm> ) and 1-octyl ( catalyst <nUm> ) . it was found that catalyst <nUm> having hydrogen as a substituent exhibited the greatest activity among the four dinuclear CGCs . on the other hand , catalyst <nUm> containing isopropyl as a substituent showed the smallest activity . very interestingly , catalyst <nUm> was able to produce about <nUm> times higher molecular weight polymer than catalyst <nUm> and <nUm> . catalyst <nUm> and <nUm> having a long alkyl chain substituent revealed the biggest comonomer response to generate polyethylene copolymer containing more than <nUm> % 1-hexene contents . these results suggest that the control of the substituent of para-xylene bridge of dinuclear CGC can provide a proper method to adjust the microstructure of polyethylene copolymers . 
chiral ionic liquids ( CILs ) were discussed as new potential media for enantioselective organic synthesis , including enantioselective polymer synthesis . NMR spectra of new CILs , whose structures are shown in formulas (I)-(IV) , were investigated in detail . In the case of 1H NMR analysis of those compounds two characteristic doublets were observed - diasterotopic protons ( AB spin system ) . In order to precisely determine the spectral position of each proton and carbon , but also to attribute in a detailed way the type of their signals , two - dimensional spectra were obtained . additionally , 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra indicated notable differences in the chemical shifts depending on the anion used . comparing the differences between values of the chemical shifts , the anions , but also the quaternary ammonium salts , depending on the amine used , were ordered according to their increasing shielding capacities . 
based on an extensive review of the literature , the progress made so far in the application of organometalic catalysts in the polymerization of olefins , taking into special consideration the most recent research in this field has been presented . the possibilities of obtaining by this method polyolefins of various structures and properties have also been explored . In accordance with the state - of - art in the technology of polyolefin production , the results of the most recent research in opole , an active center in this field , development and evaluation of the catalytic properties of novel organometalic catalysts have been presented . special attention was devoted to catalysts derived from the postmetallocene system group such as complexes with salene - type or bis(phenoxy-imine) ligands and bis(phenoxy-imine) complexes ( tables 1-4 ) . the influence of the composition , especially the ligand structures ( fig. <nUm> ) , the central metal in complexes and the type of organoaluminium activators ( fig. <nUm> ) on catalyst system activity in the polymerization of ethylene as well as on the properties of the obtained polymerization product ( fig. <nUm> ) was evaluated . 
the syndiotactic and atactic poly (2-N-carbazoylmethyl)styrenes were obtained by a half - titanocene catalyst and a radical initiator for the investigation of photophysical properties , especially excimer formation . the atactic polymer exhibited only monomer emission , but the syndiotactic polymer showed both excimer emission and monomer emission resulting from the partial overlapping arrangement of carbazole pendants . the emission band of syndiotactic polymer was considerably dependent on solution concentration and temperature , however atactic polymer was independent because the excimer formation of syndiotactic helical conformation was more favorable than that of the random coil conformation of atactic polymer . 
hydrogenation of C = C bonds in styrene-butadiene-styrene ( SBS ) block copolymers in the presence of CpTiCl2(OC6H 4Y-p ) / BuLi and CpTiCl2(OC6H4Y-p) / Et3Al catalytic systems ( cp = cyclopentadienyl , bu = butyl , et = ethyl , Y = NO2 , Cl , H , CH3 , OCH3)was investigated . the effect of the kind of metal alkyl , Li : Ti or Al : Ti molar ratio , copolymer composition , reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure on activity of catalytic system was investigated . the best degree of hydrogenation for SBS copolymers ( 80-90 % ) , was obtained for the systems containing p-chlorophenoxy ligand with the most electron - acceptor properties .

star - shaped hydroxyl functionalized atacticpolymethylmethacrylate was synthesized via living / controlled radical polymerization promoted by titanocene complex in the presence of <nUm> , 4'-methylenebis(N , n-diglycidylaniline ) ( I4 ) as the initiator , and Zn as the reducing agent . the effect of polymerization conditions such as temperature , time , as well as the ratio of the initiator to monomer on the polymerization performance was investigated . the results indicate that the monomer conversion is up to <nUm> % at <nUm> ° C and [MMA] / [I4] = <nUm> / <nUm> . the number average molecular weight of the polymer linearly depends on the monomer conversion , implying that the performance shows living manner . the structure and properties of the obtained polymer were characterized by gel permeation in chromatography(GPC) , nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum ( 1H - NMR and 13C - NMR ) . the obtained polymer is atacticspecific and features narrow molecule weight distribution ( <nUm> ~ <nUm> ) under the typical condition . the number of arms and the functional hydroxyl groups of the polymer molecule are four , good corresponding with the number of the epoxy functional groups of the initiator ( I4 ) used . 
polymerization properties of six dinuclear constrained geometry catalysts ( DCGC ) were investigated . the different length bridges of three catalysts were para-phenyl ( catalyst <nUm> ) , para-xylyl ( catalyst <nUm> ) , and para-diethylene phenyl ( catalyst <nUm> ) . the other three DCGC have the same para-xylyl bridge with the different substituents at the phenyl ring of the bridge . the selected substituents were isopropyl ( catalyst <nUm> ) , n-hexyl ( cataylst <nUm> ) , and n-octyl ( catalyst <nUm> ) . it was found that the longer catalyst not only exhibited a greater activity but also prepared a higher molecular weight copolymer . the catalyst <nUm> having a bulky isopropyl substituent revealed the lower activity but formed the highest molecular weight polymer comparing with the other alkyl substituted DCGCs . these results were able to be understood on the basis of the electronic and steric characteristics of the bridge . this study confirms that the control of the bridge structure of DCGC may contribute to control the microstructure of polymers . 
A styrenic monomer containing dicylopentadienyltitanium group and <nUm> , 6-pyridinedicarboxylate was synthesized and characterized . A stable and soluble copolymer was obtained by the solution copolymerization reaction between the titanium - containing monomer and styrene . this copolymer is soluble in THF , CCl2H2 and toluene and exhibit a glass transition temperature of <nUm> ° C . this titanium - containing polystyrene could be used in the fabrication of the micro-spheres for the inertial confinement fusion(ICF) experiments . 
organometallic complexes , based on group IV metals , are of special fundamental and technological interest due to their important catalytic applications in many organic syntheses , including olefin polymerization and activation of small molecules . In this chapter , the orbital nature of excited states of organometallic p-complexes , based on group IV metals in the d0 electronic configuration , is surveyed , and their photophysical characteristics are discussed . emphasis is given to redox , photophysical , photochemical properties , and their generalization regarding extremely rare ligand - to - metal charge transfer ( LMCT ) excited states of group IV metallocenes , experimental quantities of the highest occupied ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied ( LUMO ) molecular orbitals , a trend in the HOMO-LUMO energy gap upon structural variations in the complexes . experimental key relations ehv ∝ DEredox are demonstrated for early transition metals ( Ti , Zr , and Hf ) . combination of photophysical and electrochemical methods provides first experimental estimate of both HOMO and LUMO relative energies and the HOMO- LUMO energy gap in organometallic p-complexes , having an early transition metal . the tendency in the observed photophysics ( absorption and luminescence spectra , experimental and radiative lifetimes , and emission quantum efficiencies ) in the homologous group IVB metallocenes is discussed in view of the nature of a d0 metal ion and coordination sphere of organometallic complexes . A d0 zirconocene dichloride is reported as a first group IV metal complex , possessing LMCT excited states with remarkable emission quantum yield ( up to <nUm> ) and excited - state lifetime ( in the range of microseconds ) in fluid solutions at room temperature surpassing those of pure LMCT excited states , reported in up - to - date literature . A photophysical approach to estimate the orbital nature of extremely long - lived LMCT excited states and coordinative interactions of basic components of catalytic systems for polymerization ( d0 bent metallocene precatalysts and unsaturated hydrocarbon substrates ) are discussed . orbital interactions between d0 bent metallocenes , unsaturated hydrocarbons , and organic solvents are rationalized in terms of microscopic ( electronic and structural peculiarities ) , rather than macroscopic ( dielectric constants , viscosity , etc. ) properties of the solvent molecules . the photophysical approach is highlighted to enable studying intermolecular ( including fine coordinative ) interactions in homogeneous systems with catalytic concentrations of metal complexes that can not be achieved by other conventional physico - chemical methods . 
the catalytic activities of orthometallated ruthenium complex , anchored to macroporous polystyrene beads through the binding of phenylpyridine moiety to the polymer backbone , P-[Ru(phpy)(CO)2Cl]2 ( hphpy = phenylpyridine ) , has been studied towards the carbonylation reaction of nitroaromatics under various reaction conditions . N , n'-diphenylurea is the main product in presence of acidic co-catalyst while methyl-Nphenyl carbamate is formed predominantly when basic co-catalyst and methanol was present in the reaction medium . comparative studies have been done with the corresponding homogeneous ones . the polymer anchored catalyst is found to be superior to its homogeneous counterpart in activity , stability and product selectivity . the catalyst can be recycled several times without significant loss of its catalytic activity . A tentative reaction mechanism has been proposed for the carbonylation process on the basis of kinetic studies and the isolation of reactive intermediates . 
A single - stage , i.e. , degree of polymerization of one , and enantioselective version of the ziegler - natta alkene polymerization was envisioned as a potentially significant and useful method for catalytic asymmetric C-C bond formation , shortly after the corresponding alkyne version involving Zr - catalyzed alkylalumination of alkynes was discovered in <nUm> . however , the discovery of such an asymmetric reaction proved to be a major challenge . At least three widely observable unwanted side reactions , i.e. , ( 1 ) cyclic carbometalation , ( 2 ) b-H transfer hydrometalation , and ( 3 ) alkene polymerization , represented by the ziegler - natta polymerization , were noted and were to be avoided . with Zr as the metal at the catalytic center , we eventually came up with a notion that di- or multiple alkylation of Zr was to be avoided for achieving superior acyclic asymmetric carbometalation . this , in turn , led us to avoid the use of highly nucleophilic alkylmetals containing alkali metals and Mg . aluminum used in ziegler - natta polymerization that can selectively monoalkylate Zr proved to be one of a very limited number of favorable metals . even so , undesirable cyclic carbozirconation can occur in nonpolar solvents via intricate bimetallic routes to cyclic organozirconium species . the vastly different reactant - catalyst stoichiometry and the absence of polymerization promotors , such as methylaluminoxane , in our investigations permit us to ignore the ziegler - natta polymerization as a serious and unwanted side reaction , although use of limited amounts of promotors can in some cases accelerate otherwise sluggish ZACA reactions . selection of the currently used Zr catalysts including (R)- and (S)-(NMI)2)ZrCl)2 ) , dichlorobis(neomenthylindenyl) zirconium was made by screening <nUm> or so known chiral zirconocene derivatives . systematic scientific design and screening of chiral ligands are clearly highly desirable , and efforts along this line are ongoing . even at the current level of development , however , the ZACA reaction shows considerable promise as an efficient and selective method for catalytic asymmetric C-C bond formation , which has already been used to significantly modernize and improve syntheses of natural products including deoxypolypropionates and isoprenoids of biological and medicinal interest . 
the main synthetic strategies for the synthesis of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene ( EDOT ) are reviewed together with the main functionalization reactions of EDOT described to date . the different synthetic strategies employed for the functionalization of EDOT have been divided into two main types , namely : ( i ) modifications in the ethylene bridge of EDOT and ( ii ) basic reactions in the ethylene bridge of EDOT . therefore the main emphasis is placed upon the use of chemical synthesis for the development of EDOT derivatives and not in their properties and applications which have been already revised in different reviews and monographies which are referenced along the review . 
polythiophene derivatives constitute nowadays the most extensively studied class of conducting polymers , thanks to their mechanical and thermal stability , as well as to their physical and chemical properties , such as electronic conductivity , electrochromism , solvatochromism , thermochromism and luminescence . these materials have been proposed for use in a wide range of applications , including chemical sensors , light emitting diodes , thin film transistors , different electrocatalytic systems , batteries , smart windows , and even artificial muscles . peculiar systems are realised by anchoring similar materials on substrates . In particular , conductive substrates suitably coated by polythiophene derivatives constitute particularly interesting electrode systems that can be exploited in numerous electrochemical - electroanalytical applications . however , a notable part of the research activity in these fields is today evolving toward the insertion of metals into the polythiophenes matrix , in order to further improve the performances of the pure organic material . the driving force to these studies lies in the possibility to combine the properties of the organic and inorganic entities , taking advantage of their synergic interaction . basically , two different approaches , resulting in hybrids / composites of quite different nature , have been followed : i ) link of metal complexes to the polymeric backbone ; ii ) inclusion of metal ions and complexes , of clusters , oxides or nanoparticles into the polymer . In similar systems , the presence of the metal is supposed to deeply affect the electronic and electrochemical properties of the resulting hybrid / composite material . the aim of the present contribution is to give a picture of the variety of polythiophene - based hybrid / composite materials developed , with reference to the systems in which the polymer is supported on a conductive substrate , to constitute an electrode system . the different physico - chemical characterisations are treated , mainly devoted to clarify the interactions between the polymer and the metal centres , as well as the nature of the interface between the ambient and the composite as a whole . description is given of some applications in electrochemical environments .

polysilanes are polymers of Si - catenated backbone and each silicon atombares two organic side groups . the sigma-electrons of the Si-Si bondsdelocalize over the long range of the backbone ( sigma-conjugation ) resultingin unusual physical properties such as strong absorption at 300-400 nm andefficient fluorescence in the ultraviolet region , high conductivity upondoping with oxidants , high photoconductivity and high NOL . polysilaneshave , therefore , been studied as a photoconductor , emitting material and / orcarrier transporting materials of LEDs , photoresists , and photo - inducedradical initiators . organic side groups control the conformation of the mainchain which controls the conjugation efficiency . the conformation ofpolysilanes is sensitive to the circumstances of the polymer and , thus , bringsabout various chromotropisms such as thermo- , piezo , electro- , iono- andsolvato-chromisms .

two kinds of core - shell polymers ( PMMA / PS and PS / PMMA ) were prepared separately by semi-continuous seeded emulsion polymerization . PMMA / PS was prepared by polymerization of styrene in the presence of poly(methyle methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) . PS / PMMA was prepared by polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) in the presence of polystyrene ( PS ) . supercritical CO2 was chosen as the solvent and the Cp2TiCl2catalyst was supported into core - shell polymers through the supercritical fluid impregnation . the supported catalysts were characterized through their behaviors during ethylene slurry polymerization . it was found that , when the PMMA / PS-Cp2TiCl2 catalyst was used , the ethylene polymerization rate has a long induce time ( about <nUm> minutes ) , while when PS / PMMA-Cp2TiCl2 catalyst was used , the kinetic behavior of ethylene polymerization is similar to that of the homogeneous polymerization catalyzed by Cp2TiCl2 . the reason for that is the existence of the chemical bond between Cp2TiCl2 and the ester of PMMA , which makes the active material of the catalyst supports mainly on the PMMA section of the core - shell polymers .

the present study reveals some aspects on properties of polypropylene ( PP ) derived from the supported ziegler - natta ( ZN ) catalyst ( Cl2Mg / Cl4Ti / DEP ) and the supported metallocene ( MC ) catalyst ( OSi <nUm> / MAO / Et[lnd]2ZrCl2 ) . experimentally , PPs were produced using the supported ZN and MC catalysts as mentioned above by varying the conditions such as the polymerization temperatures , propylene pressure , and the [Al]cocatalyst / [Ti]ZN catalyst or [Zr] MC catalyst ratios . based on the study , it was found that activities , mmmm( % ) or isotactivity , and melting temperatures ( Tm ) apparently depended on the polymerization temperatures , propylene pressures , and [Al] cocatalyst / [Ti] or [Zr]catalyst ratios in different ways . the impact of each process variable on the properties of PP obtained was further discussed in more details . In general , it was found that the supported MC catalyst provided more active species compared to the supported ZN catalyst leading to higher activities . In particular , the PP produced from the supported MC catalyst also had high isotacticity , however , lower Tm compared to that produced from the supported ZN catalyst . it is worth noting that by changing those parameters , the properties of PP can be altered based on the nature behaviour of the two catalysts . As a matter of fact , the process variables can be chosen in order to achieve the desired properties of PP under the supported catalytic system . 
atactic polystyrene , as an amorphous material , has been known for centuries . In principle , polystyrene can occur with atactic , isotactic , and syndiotactic configurations . with the extensive studies concerning the stereoselective polymerization of olefins by ziegler - natta catalyst systems discovered DK3712 : “ dk3712_c014 ” - <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> - <nUm> : <nUm> - page <nUm> - # <nUm> in the early 1950s , the first stereoregular polystyrene , isotactic polystyrene ( iPS ) , was obtained by natta using the Cl4Ti / AlEt3 system in <nUm> iPS is a semicrystalline polymer that has a high melting point , Tm = <nUm> ° C.2 several companies have tried to commercialize iPS , but its crystallization rate is too slow to be practical in industrial processes . 
many academic and industrial researchers have probed the utility of group <nUm> and group <nUm> metallocenes as catalyst precursors for the polymerization of ethylene and a-olefins such as propylene.1-4 In particular , much emphasis has been placed on the use of an interannular bridge , or linking group , between the two cyclopentadienyl rings in these metallocenes . these complexes are known as ansametallocenes , a term that brintzinger introduced in his landmark work in this field.5 the term ansa ( latin , for “ bent handle ” ) may be used to describe metallocenes with either one or two interannular bridges ( figure <nUm> ) . 
polypropylene ( PP ) is one of the most highly utilized engineering plastics , with production in the united states and canada of over <nUm> million metric tons in <nUm> the starting material for PP , propylene , can be transformed into polymers with a range of physical properties by adjusting the relative stereochemistry of the pendant methyl groups on the polymer backbone . for instance , when the DK3712 : “ dk3712_c001 ” - <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> - <nUm> : <nUm> - page <nUm> - # <nUm> methyl groups are placed in a stereorandom configuration , the resulting polymer , known as atactic polypropylene , is amorphous and lacks crystallinity . the vast majority of polypropylene sold is isotactic polypropylene ( iPP ) , a resin valued for its strength , toughness , chemical and heat resistance , and processability . the highly stereoregular structure of iPP , in which the pendant methyl groups reside on the same side of the polymer chain , imparts a crystalline structure to the polymer and allows the material to have a high melting point ( 160-165 ° C ). <nUm> A versatile plastic , iPP can be found in a wide range of applications from packaging to fibers to containers . commercial , highly crystalline iPP is largely synthesized using traditional heterogeneous ziegler - natta catalysis , but the advent of homogeneous group <nUm> metallocenes has enabled polyolefin producers to access a wider range of polymer microstructures and properties . the mechanism of stereoselective polymerization by these catalysts is now well understood ; the issues of stereocontrol and influence of the metallocene catalyst structure on the propylene polymerization behavior have been discussed in detail in earlier reviews.4-6 excellent review articles are also available on the synthesis of chiral group <nUm> metallocenes.7,8 this chapter will introduce some fundamental aspects of metallocenecatalyzed propylene polymerization , discuss the details of how the C2 - symmetry of the catalyst is exploited in the synthesis of iPP , and then survey the general ligand structures that are commonly encountered . 
metallocenes based on group <nUm> metals were first synthesized by wilkinson et al. in <nUm> ; <nUm> however , the great utility of these compounds as catalyst precursors for the stereoselective polymerization of a-olefins was not realized until the mid-1980s when two key discoveries were made . the first of these was the discovery that alkyl substituents placed on the cyclopentadienyl framework of the metallocene can significantly influence the performance and behavior of the catalyst.2 the second was the discovery that enantioselectivity in the insertion step of an a-olefin polymerization could result if one made metallocene catalysts with the appropriate chirality and stereorigidity.3 . 
tailoring polymer properties such as stiffness , strength , or processing requires control of the molecular architecture of the polymers . for the polymerization of olefins like propylene , the development of metallocene catalysts gives access to new polymer microstructures . during the last decade , major advances have been made in metallocene catalysis for polypropylenes , providing higher levels of control over composition , molecular mass distributions , and stereoregularity . this leads to a large variety of polypropylenes with varying types and degrees of stereoregularity,1-4 from amorphous or low - crystallinity types to highly stereoregular ones such as isotactic and syndiotactic polypropylene.4 owing to the regular arrangement of methyl groups , these stereoregular polypropylenes are semicrystalline materials with melting points above <nUm> ° C exhibiting typical thermoplastic deformation behavior ( thermoplast , figure <nUm> ) , but isotactic and syndiotactic polypropylene differ in elastic modulus and impact strength.5 In atactic polypropylenes , the statistically random arrangement of the methyl groups prevents crystallization . therefore , atactic polypropylenes are soft , amorphous polymers ranging from oils to soft , waxy materials ( wax , figure <nUm> ). <nUm> . 
all right reserved.The Ti incorporated periodic mesoporous organosilicas with benzene or ethane bridging groups in the mesoporous wall were assembled by using mixed tetrabutyl titanate as the titanium sources and tetraethyl orthosilicate as the inorganic silica sources and 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene or 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane as the organic silicon source and triblock copolymer as the structure - directing agent in acidic media through the hydrothermal method . the benzene - bridged mesoporous organosilicas and the ethane - bridged mesoporous organosilicas were signed as Ti-SBA-15-ben and Ti-SBA-15-et , respectively . meanwhile , the hydrogen peroxide was added to adjust the hydrolysis rate of tetrabutyl titanate and got the sample Ti-SBA-15-ben-H and Ti-SBA-15-et-H . samples were characterized by N < inf > <nUm> < / inf > adsorption / desorption , FT-IR , ICP , TG - DSC , UV - vis and TEM . results showed that the benzene - bridged mesoporous organosilicas adding hydrogen peroxide during the synthesis process can maintain the best mesoporous structure and the highest activity of four levels of titanium in the mesoporous wall . the periodic mesoporous organosilicas were evaluated in the cyclohexene oxidation with TBHP ( tert-butyl hydroperoxide ) as oxidant agent . the reaction results were as follows : Ti-SBA-15-ben-H showed the highest catalytic activity and its catalytic reaction is given priority to double bond oxidation products , the cyclohexene conversion and the epoxy cyclohexane selectivity were <nUm> % and <nUm> % , respectively . oxidation of cyclohexene catalyzed by Ti-SBA-15-et gave priority to allyl oxidation products such as 2-cyclohexene-1-ketone , the cyclohexene conversion was <nUm> % and the 2-cyclohexene-1-ketone selectivity was <nUm> % . 
metallocene / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and other single site catalysts for olefin polymerization have opened a new field of synthesis in polymer chemistry.1-3 strained cyclic olefins such as cyclobutene , cyclopentene , norbornene ( NB ) , and their substituted compounds can be used as monomers and comonomers in a wide variety of polymers.4 much interest is focused on norbornene homo-and copolymers because of the easy availability of norbornene and the special properties of their polymers . norbornene can be polymerized by ring opening metathesis polymerization ( ROMP ) , giving elastomeric materials,5 or by double bond opening ( addition polymerization ) . homopolymerization of norbornene by double bond opening can be achieved by early and late transition metal catalysts , namely Ti , Zr , hf,6-8 ni,9,10 and pd11-13 ( scheme <nUm> ) . 
stereoblock polypropylenes are complicated , intriguing , and challenging polymers . it may be worthy to open this chapter by recalling that , according to the IUPAC glossary of basic terms in polymer science,1 a block is “ a portion of a macromolecule comprising many constitutional units , that has at least one feature which is not present in the adjacent portions ” ; a block macromolecule is “ a macromolecule which is composed of blocks in linear sequence ” ; a stereoblock macromolecule is “ a block macromolecule composed of stereoregular , and possibly non-stereoregular , blocks. ” on paper , applying these definitions to propylene polymers is straightforward with the notable exception of the “ stereoblock - isotactic ” case , which will be discussed specifically in the last part of this section . on the other hand , demonstrating that these structures exist for a real polypropylene sample is a formidable microstructural problem ; in fact , of the many cases claimed in the scientific and patent literature , those rigorously proven to be stereoblock polypropylenes can be counted on the fingers of one hand .

A series of dinuclear half - sandwich titanium complexes with aryloxy substituent at titanium[(e5-cyclopentadienyl) ( aryloxy ) ClTi 2]2 [(CH2)n](n = <nUm> , n = <nUm> , n = <nUm> ) have been successfully synthesized and their styrene polymerization properties have been investigated . all complexes are characterized by 1H NMR , 13C NMR , elemental analysis , and mass spectrometry . In order to examine the catalytic properties of the dinuclear complexes styrene polymerization has been conducted in the presence of MMAO . it was found that ( i ) all the prepared complexes were very effective catalyst for the production of SPS ( syndiotactic polystyrene ) , ( ii ) the complex with the longest bridge between the two active sites exhibited greatest catalytic activity among the three catalysts , but produced SPS with the smallest molecular weight , ( iii ) the activities of dinuclear half - titanocens with aryloxy substitution at titanium metal were greater than those of the chloride substituted compounds . these results indicate that not only the nature of the bridge between the two active sites but also the property of substituents at the metal exert a significant influence on the polymerization behaviors of the dinuclear half - titanocene . 
it is generally accepted that controlled polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer ( VCM ) with transition metal complexes is difficult , due to side reactions is related to a high lewis acidity of the central metal between VCM and active sites . to suppress such reactions , electron donative ligand is favor to control polymerization of VCM . we reported that Cp*Ti(OPh)3 complex in combination with MAO achieve control of main chain structure of the polymer . polymerization of VCM with titanocene / MAO catalysts was not investigated in detail . however , the polymerization proceeded easily to give high molecular weight polymers . the molecular weight of PVC obtained from polymerization with <nUm> / MAO catalyst increased with an increase of polymer yield , but do n't give a straight line pass through the origin . the side reactions may compete with propagation reaction in the polymerization . we also examined the stereoregularity of polymer . 
the steric and electronic ligand effects in the Ti - catalyzed living radical polymerization ( LRP ) of styrene initiated by epoxide radical ring opening ( RRO ) was investigated in a series of Ti (III) complexes ( L nTiX m ) derived in situ from Zn reduction of commercially available Ti(IV) precursors . based on the ability to perform initiation by epoxide RRO and mediate LRP via reversible C-Ti bond formation , these catalysts ranked : L = metallocene ( η 5-RCp : r = H ∼ et ∼ 1Pr ∼ tBu > ind cp* ) ≫ o-ligands ( alkoxides ) ≫ bisketonates ) ≫ N ligands ( tp > pc ) , while x = Cl > Br ≫ F ∼ me and L nTiCl m > L n-1.TiCl m+1 . the inexpensive cp 2TiCl <nUm> was one of the most active species .

we have investigated polymerization of vinyl chloride ( VC ) with half - titanocene catalysts . however , the polymerization of VC with typical titanocene catalysts such as Cp2TiCl2 / MAO has not been succeeded . thus , we investigated the polymerization of VC with cp 2Ti(OPh)2 / MAO catalyst instead of Cp2TiCl <nUm> / MAO catalyst . the Cp2Ti(OPh)2MAO catalyst gave a high molecular weight PVC in a good yield . we also examined the control of main chain structure and molecular weight of polymer . 
In the last half decade , living coordination - insertion polymerization of olefins over ziegler - natta catalyst has emerged as a powerful tool for synthesis of advanced polymers with new structures . materials prepared by this method ranged from simple homopolymers , such as linear , branched , isotactic or syndiotactic polypropylenes , to various kinds of block copolymers and end - functionalized polymers . A review covers the recent developments in this rapidly growing research area , covering the fields of organometallic chemistry , polymer chemistry and material science ; and ligand and catalyst design , as well as the polymer properties prepared by such living polymerization . 
titanocene and its derivatives are part of a larger division within organometallic chemistry called metallocenes . the diverse uses for these complexes are illustrated by covering three different fields of experimentation : polymerization , cancer research , and organic synthesis . metallocene catalysts are emerging as the leaders of a new era in polymer synthesis . these catalysts produce polyethylene called linear low - density polyetheylene ( LLDPE ) . other processes , like free radical polymerization , produce branched chains and give a lower quality product . new functionalized Cp2TiCl2 compounds synthesized in <nUm> exhibit significant toxicity against a number of different human tumor cell lines . several reaction schemes illustrate the wide range of applications for titanocene complexes as catalysts or reactants in organic synthesis . titanocene dichloride catalyst can be used to promote a double alkylation of styrenes by two alkyl halides under mild conditions . furthermore , titanocene dichloride is also effective in promoting alkylations of alkylol with organoaluminum reagents . all of these applications show that titanocene derivatives have a promising future in many fields of research and development . 
A series of heterogeneous catalysts with Cp2TiCl2 supported on palygorskite were prepared and evaluated by ethylene slurry polymerizations . the so - called direct supported catalyst , for which the pretreatment of palygorskite with MAO or Al(i-Bu)3 was not necessary , gave the highest activity among these supported catalysts and could be more robust than homogeneous Cp2TiCl2 . with the direct supported catalyst , no significant activity loss was observed under low Al / Ti molar ratios ( Al / Ti = <nUm> ) and the decay of polymerization rate was slower when compared to the other supported catalysts . it was found that the surface lewis acidity of palygorskite after thermal treatment played an important role in activation of metallocene compound and resulted in high catalyst activity .

with such a wide diversity of properties and applications , is it any wonder that industry and academia have such a fascination with polymers ?

chiral ansa-ethylene-bis(tetrahydroindenyl) titanium complexes , EBTHI - TiX2 , first introduced by brintzinger [1] , are highly active and selective catalysts for enantioselective reactions ( e.g. hydrogenations of olefins , ketones and imines , as well as various polymerization reactions ) . we aim to show the use of a homogeneous chiral titanocene catalyst for the asymmetric reduction of imines to prepare chiral amines , which are important intermediates in the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industry . specifically , our research concentrates on the hydrosilylation of 2-phenylpyrroline using (R,R)-ethylene-1,2-bis(e5-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-l-indenyl)titanium (R)-1,1'-binaphth-2-olate ( 1 ) as a precatalyst . after activation with n-BuLi and phenylsilane this catalytic system has proven to be very practical in the preparation of chiral amines with high yields ( > <nUm> % ) and enantioselectivity ( <nUm> % ee ) . the investigation of the reaction kinetics has revealed a strong dependence on reaction temperature and reactant concentration . while there is a general consensus that the key intermediate in titanocene catalyzed hydrosilylations is a Ti(III)-H intermediate [2,3] , we propose this catalyst procedures through a Ti(IV)-H intermediate . In summary , our results clearly demonstrate that the hydrosilylation of imines with the chiral catalyst ( 1 ) offers a very convenient and safe method for the preparation of enantiomerically pure amines . further optimization of the metallocene - catalyzed reaction can lead to more attractive catalytic complexes .

based on the concept of enhancing the ability of forming complex of ligand , a new approach for synthesizing titanocene derivatives catalyzed by supermolecule is presented herein . the feasibility of this approach was demonstrated using the reaction of forming titanocene derivatives in two phase ( H2O / CCl3H ) system catalyzed by water soluble b-cyclodextrin polymer ( WS-b-CDP ) . based on the electronic absorption and fluorescence spectra , it was found that when b-CDP is present as a microreactor in the reaction system , it selects ligand firstly in the aqueous phase to form a supramolecular complex , making ligand more active and react interfacially with titanocene dichloride in the organic phase more easily to form titanocene complex . then , the next ligand substitutes for the titanocene complex and enter the microreactor , thus making the reaction to continue . At the same time , it was found that WS-b-CDP can enhance the stability of the species of titanocene ( " Cp2Ti " ) and form titanocene complexes at pH = <nUm> . 
Ti(III)Cp2Cl - catalyzed radical ring opening ( RRO ) of epoxides or single electron transfer ( SET ) reduction of aldehydes generates Ti alkoxides and carbon centered radicals which add to styrene , initiating a radical polymerization . this polymerization is mediate in a living fashion by the reversible termination of growing chains with the TiCp2Cl metalloradical . In addition , polymers or monomers containing pendant epoxide groups ( glycidyl methacrylate ) can be used as substrates for radical grafting or branching reactions by self condensing vinyl polymerization . In addition , Ti alkoxides generated in situ by both epoxide RRO and aldehyde SET initiate the living ring opening polymerization of e-caprolactone . thus , new initiators and catalysts are introduced for the synthesis of complex polymer architectures .

one of the existing problems of metallocene catalyst is the difficulty in controlling its polymer morphology despite of its numerous advantages . according to the morphology replication nature of ethylene polymerization , polymer morphology could be improved by catalyst particle morphology improvement . the catalyst microparticles with narrow particle size distribution were obtained by rapid expansion from supercritical solution ( RESS ) . propane was chosen as a supercritical solvent and Cp2TiCl2 was selected as metallocene sample to catalyze ethylene in hexane medium . As a necessary fundamental research on rapid expansion of supercritical solution ( RESS ) , the solubilities of titanocene dichloride in supercritical propane were measured by the static equilibrium method at temperatures from <nUm> to <nUm> K and pressure from <nUm> to <nUm> MPa . the solubility data were correlated with the peng - Robinson(PR) equation of state and the AARD was <nUm> % . RESS experiments were performed at different operation conditions , including solute concentration , pre-expansion temperature , nozzle length and diameter , and sample collection distance . the size of quasi-spherical and spherical particles formed in the RESS process with several microns decreased with the increase of solution concentration , the decrease of pre-expansion temperature , the increase of nozzle diameter and the decrease of nozzle diameter . and the particle size increased with increasing collection distance until <nUm> mm . the catalyst particles were characterized through ethylene slurry polymerization to obtain the polymer . it was found that polymerization rate of ethylene was accelerated greatly and induced time was shortened for the RESS - reformed catalyst by comparing with the original catalyst particles . and the size distribution of reformed catalyst particles and the morphology of polymer were greatly improved . 
ionic and covalent derivatives of the chlorine analogue of the nonbasic , weakly coordinating triflate ion , CCl3O3S - or " trichlate " ion , have been prepared and compared with the corresponding more strongly coordinated chloroacetates , ClxCH 3-xCO2M ( x = 1-3 ) , using 35Cl NQR ( nuclear quadrupole resonance ) spectroscopy . the 35Cl NQR frequencies of all types of derivatives are sensitive to the nature of the metal ion or lewis acid and are most sensitive in the case of monochloroacetates . In covalent ( including zirconocene ) derivatives , the average NQR frequencies fall as the pauling electronegativity of m falls . the results for ionic derivatives contrast with previous results for ionic hexachlorometalates : the average 35Cl NQR frequencies drop sharply as the ionic radius of the group <nUm> cation increases . ab initio gaussian <nUm> computations at the B3LYP / 6-311++G(3df,3pd) level on isolated XCH2CO2M ( m = Li , Na , K ; x = F , Cl ) molecules duplicate this trend , showing increasing polarization of the C-Cl bond and smaller electric field gradients for larger group <nUm> ions ; the relevance of this to the solid state polymerization of chloroacetates ( herzberg , O. ; epple , M. eur. J. inorg. chem. <nUm> , 1395-1406 ) is discussed . we have prepared the dihydrate and monohydrate of trichlic acid , CCl3HO3S . although trichlates have the highest average NQR frequencies of any of these salts , the NQR frequencies of trichlic acid dihydrate are anomalously lower than those of trichloroacetic acid , which suggests that it is a strong acid , ionized in the solid state to H 5O2 + and CCl3O3S - ions . 
four kinds of ancillary ligands -O-C6H4-X [ x(p) = F , Cl , Br , I ] were introduced in the design of novel monotitanocene catalysts , cp* Ti(O-C6H4-X)3 . all of the new catalysts show high activity for styrene syndiotactic polymerization . the catalytic activity of the four monotitanocene increased in the order : cp* Ti(O-C6H4-I)3 < cp* -Ti-(O-C 6H4-Br)3 < cp* Ti(O-C 6H4-Cl)3 < cp* Ti(O-C 6H4-F)3 . the addition of triisobutylaluminium ( TIBA ) to the catalyst system caused a dramatic increase of s-PS yield . At <nUm> ° C , MAO / TIBA / Ti = <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> ( molar ratio ) , the catalytic efficiency of cp* Ti(O-C6H4-F)3 is up to <nUm> × <nUm> g polymer / mol*Ti*10 min . the polymerization activity of cp* Ti(O-C6H4-X)3 at MAO / TIBA / Ti = <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> ( molar ratio ) is about <nUm> times higher than that at MAO / Ti = <nUm> ( in the absence of TIBA ) . the catalytic efficiency of the catalyst and the molecular weight were affected by catalyst composition , monomer concentration and polymerization temperature . the kinetics of styrene syndiotactic polymerization in toluene was also studied . 
the kinetics of propylene polymerization initiated by the homogeneous catalytic system (2-p-TolInd)2Zr(CH3)2-Al(i-Bu) <nUm> was studied . it was shown that the initiation of polymerization takes place in the coordination sphere of two active sites differing in deactivation reactions and containing fragments with different stereospecificity . it was proposed that active sites , clusters composed of four zirconocenes , coordinate four CH2 molecules each and the latter concertedly transform into the starting polymer chain . the reversible deactivation of active sites proceeds with the participation of the monomer . A change in the electric conductivity of the catalytic system in the course of polymerization was measured , and a mechanism including repeated transitions of a growing chain to different sites was advanced . 
mechanism of copolymerization of ethylene and norbornene ( NBE ) catalyzed by half - titanocene complexes bearing o-di(phenyl)phosphanylphenolate ligands have been studied via density functional theory ( DFT ) . geometry optimization for catalysts and active species indicated that although this series of half - titanocene complexes have two kinds of structures which are four - coordinated and five - coordinated , they all have similar cationic active species structures in the present of cocatalyst . In polymerization , the olefin coordination insertion reaction will initiate from the trans position to the O atom of active species . energy profiles and reaction - rate calculations results indicated that the insertion of ethylene into the Ti-Me bond process is obviously difficult than the insertion of ethylene into the Ti-Et bond process , lead to the conclusion that the chain initialization process is the rate - determining step of the ethylene homopolymerization . on the contrary , the chain initialization process of norbornene homopolymerization is much more easy , but the insertion of norbornene into the Ti - NBE bond process is very difficult due to the larger steric bulk of norbornene . for the et / NBE copolymerization , the chain initialization process is relatively easy by the presence of NBE monomer , then the ethylene and fewer norbornene can insert into the polymer chain conti- nuously . that is the main reason for why these half - titanocene complexes displayed excellent ability to ethylene / NBE copolymerization in experimental investigations , while they only exhibited low activities for ethylene homopolymerization . 
the mechanism of activation of the CP2TiMeCl / AlMeCl2 catalytic system for polymerizing ethylene in the presence of H2O was studied using the density functional theory . the geometries of the titanocene - aluminum chloride adducts formed in this system were optimized and their energies calculated . the adducts can play the role of catalytic centers of polymerization . the energies of adduct heterolysis ( with the formation of Cp2TiMe+ ) and the energies of formation from neutral precursors were used as criteria of the ability of such adducts to act as catalytic particles . of all compounds under consideration , the most promising one is the adduct of the composition Cp2Ti(Me) ⋯ Cl ⋯ AlCl2-O-Al2Cl5 . the catalytic system activity should therefore become higher as the content of this compound increases . the calculation results are compared with experimental data on the kinetics of ethylene polymerization . 
based on dichloride derivatives of zirconocenes with C2 symmetry and borates , active catalysts of propylene polymerization were formed on a PE polymer support with a grafted poly(acrylic acid ) treated with poly(methylaluminoxane) . it was shown that the nature of aluminoxane affects the activity of the catalytic system : when aluminoxane is synthesized on the support surface , the activity of the catalyst increases . the influence of the nature of zirconocene and borate on the catalytic behavior of a system containing triisobutylaluminum as a cocatalyst was studied . variation in the polymerization conditions ( liquid propylene or heptane suspension ) was found not to affect the kinetics of polymerization , characterized by the steady - state rate of monomer consumption . morphological characteristics of the polymers prepared using various catalytic systems are presented together with their molecular masses , melting temperatures , and isotacticity indices . 
four new mixed - ring zirconium complexes , [ CH2 = CH(CH 2)n-C5H4](RC5H4)ZrCl <nUm> [ n = <nUm> , r = CH3OCH2CH2(3) ; n = <nUm> , r = C3H7O ( 4 ) ; n = <nUm> , r = Me3Si ( 5 ) ; n = <nUm> , r = allyl ( 6 ) ] , have been prepared by the reaction of CH2 = CH(CH2)nC5H4ZrCl 3* DME[n = <nUm> ( 1 ) ; n = <nUm> ( 2 ) ] with RC5H 4Li . when activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , the catalytic activities of the above complexes in ethylene polymerization were tested . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> show high activities similar to Cp2ZrCl <nUm> . introduction of methoxyethyl group into cp - ligand dramatically decreases the catalytic activities of complexes <nUm> and <nUm> , which can be overcome by increasing the amount of MAO . for complex <nUm> , the dependence of activity and molecular weight ( Mn ) on the Al / Zr ratio , the polymerization time ( tp ) , polymerization temperature ( TP ) and the polymerization solvent volume ( V ) was investigated .

group <nUm> lewis acids have long played a leading role as catalysts in organic synthesis , extending from the discovery of AlCl3 - catalysis by friedel and crafts in <nUm> through the aufbau - synthesis of unsolvated aluminum alkyls from ethylene by ziegler in <nUm> and culminating in the discovery of poly(methylaluminoxane) ( MAO ) cocatalysis of olefin polymerization by sinn and kaminsky in <nUm> . In our current work we present how electronic and steric contributions of the ligands attached to the particular group <nUm> metal can modulate the resultant lewis acidity . the inherent lewis acidity of the group <nUm> metal center itself is further dependent upon the extent that its available npz - orbital might interact with adjacent unshared or pi-electrons of the ligand system . In order to evaluate the effect of such electronic factors on their lewis acidity , both a series of bidentate group <nUm> organoboron and organoaluminum candidate acids , as well as their antiaromatic metallole analogs , have been synthesized by exchange reactions between the corresponding organotin compound and the appropriate metal halide . their lewis acidity has been evaluated based upon their efficacy as a cocatalyst with titanocene(IV) methyl chloride or titanocene(IV) dichloride in effecting the polymerization of ethylene . 
A trivalent half - titanocene complex [ Me2(3-'Bu-2-MeO-5-MeC6H2) Si(CpMe4)]TiCl3 ( 5b ) were synthesized and used as olefin polymerization catalysts . In ethylene and 1-hexene copolymerization , both Ti (III) and Ti(IV) complex catalysts showed good activity and good comonomer reactivity . A big difference in the polymerization behavior between these catalysts was due to a difference of stability of active species . although the rate of polymerization with Ti(IV) catalyst quickly decreases . Ti (III) catalyst showed a constant activity during polymerization . Ti (III) catalyst also gave high molecular weight polypropylene , polybutadiene , and poly(ethylene-co-5-hexen-1-01) .

organotin polymers generally offer moderate to good inhibition of a variety of cancer cell lines . here we focus on efforts associated with breast and pancreatic cancers . with respect to breast cancer , for organotin polyethers there is a marked differentiation in the ability to inhibit the MCF-7 estrogen - sensitive cell line in comparison to the MDA non-estrogen cell line where those polyethers that contain the Sn-O-phenyl linkage preferentially inhibit the MDA cell lines in comparison to the MCF-7 cells while those polyethers that do not contain this linkage show little differentiation between the two cell lines . with respect to pancreatic cancer , there are a number of organotin polymers that exhibit good inhibition of the pancreatic cancer cell lines . some structure / property relationships are emerging . ltd. 
the sequential block copolymerization products of styrene and ethylene catalyzed by mono-titanocene catalyst η 5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyltribenzyloxy titanium [ cp * Ti(OB z ) <nUm> ] and modified methylaluminoxane ( mMAO ) were fractionated by successive extraction with boiling butanone , THF and chloroform solvents . the isolated block copolymers ( <nUm> . <nUm> wt % - <nUm> . <nUm> wt % in total ) , chiefly existing in THF and chloroform soluble fractions , were characterized by 13C - NMR , WAXD , DSC and GPC methods . the 13C - NMR spectrum of copolymers showed a special structure which composed of sPS segments and branching PE segments . the WAXD pattern of copolymers displayed low crystallinity of both segments . there are long sPS segments and short PE segments in the block copolymers , which showed single sPS melt peak in DSC curves . GPC curves indicated the block copolymerization of styrene and ethylene with mono-titanocene catalytic system has single active spices character . A block copolymerization mechanism of styrene and ethylene with cp * Ti ( OBz ) <nUm> / mMAO catalyst was proposed . 
polybutadienes were synthesized with η <nUm> -pentamethycyclopentadienyltri group titanium [ cp <nUm> TiL <nUm> , L = chloride , benzyloxy , p-methoxyphenoxy ] in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the influences of polymerization temperature [ T p ] , catalyst concentration [Ti] and Al MAO / Ti molar ratio on butadiene polymerization have been studied . the external addition of triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) into the catalyst system gave a great promotion on the catalytic activity and the molecular weight of polybutadienes . the results showed that the best polymerization conditions with CpTi(OBz) <nUm> / MAO as the catalytical system were [Ti] = <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> mol / L , T p = <nUm> ° C , Al MAO / Ti = <nUm> ( mol / mol ) and AL TIBA / Ti = <nUm> . the oxidation states of active titanium centers in CpTi(OBz) <nUm> / MAO catalytic system have been determined by the redox fitration method . it seems that the active center of Ti (III) is favourable for butadiene polymerization with higher catalytic activity . 
A series of titanocenes[(C5H4R)2TiCl2 , r = H(1) , me(2) , C6H11(3) and (C5H4R)2TiAr2 , r = H , Ar = C6H5(4) , p-MeC6H4(5) , m-MeC6H4(6) ; r = me , Ar = C6H5(7) , p-MeC6H4(8) ; r = C6H11 , Ar = C6H5(9) , p-MeC6H4(10) ] were synthesized . the catalytic hydrogenation of SBS copolymer using these catalysts was studied . the effects of the types of catalyst , the amount of catalyst and the component ratio of catalyst were investigated and found that the SBS was hydrogenated more than <nUm> % when the amount of catalyst was <nUm> . 001-0 . <nUm> mmol / g polymer . among the catalysts , the p-tolyltitanocene <nUm> gives the best result and is a promising catalyst system for catalytic hydrogenation of SBS copolymer . 
this paper describes ethylene polymerization using four kinds of zirconocene with different substituents in the cp ring as catalysts and aluminoxane as cocatalyst . polymerization activities , polymerization kinetics and me of resultant polyethylene were compared . it was found basically that polymerization activities were in the following order : A2 ≅ B2 > A1 > B1 [ A1 : ( CH2 = CH - CH2 - CH2 - cp)2 Cl2Zr ; B1 : ( CH2 = CH - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CP)2 Cl2Zr ; A2 : ( CH2 = C2H3 - CH2 - cp)2 Cl2Zr ; B2 : ( CH3 ( CH3 ) C = CH - CH2CP)2 CI2Zr ] . A novel kinetic model was developed based on the consideration of reactivation reaction . A possible mechanism of influence of different substituents in the cp ring on polymerization activities was discussed . 
syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) was synthesized in the presence of a mono-titanocene complex of e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyltri-4-methoxyph titanium [ cp* Ti C7H7O2 ] activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . influences of different polymerization mediums including heptane , toluene , chlorobenze and neat styrene on the activity , syndiotacticity and molecular weight of polystyrene were investigated . the bulk polymerization was the best choice in all cases for producing sPS with the highest activity and molecular weight . In contrast , much better activity and syndiotacticity of yields arose from polymerization in heptane than in the other solvents . using a solvent with higher dipole moment , such as chlorobenze , lower activity and syndiotacticity were given resulting from the stronger coordination of solvent with Ti ( III ) active species which controlled syndiospecific polymerization of styrene . aggregated structures of sPS obtained respectively from bulk polymerization and polymerization in heptane used as solvent were different . 
vinyl-type polymerization of norbornene has been carried out with half - titanocene / MAO catalysts . it was found that the cp (cyclopentadienyl)-bearing titanocene catalysts afford the polynorbornene at much higher yield than the related cp * (pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)-bearing one . on the other hand , substitution of - OR ligand for chlorine at the cp - bearing compound causes remarkbaly increase in catalytic activity . the optimum temperature for the polymerization is <nUm> ° C . all the polynorbornenes obtained with CpTi(OCH2Ph)3 / MAO catalyst are soluble in the organic solvents such as cyclohexane and monochlorobenzene . the FTIR and 13C NMR spectra indicate that the polynorbornene obtained is vinyl-type polymer and has low stereo - regularity . 
the ethylene-propylene copolymers obtained from half - titanocene catalyst , ( e-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ) titanium triallyloxide ( Cp*Ti(OCH2-CH = CH2)3 ) combined with methylalumiloxane ( MAO ) , have been characterized by several methods including solvent extraction , FT - IR,GPC , X-ray,DSC , TG and DMA mesurements . the ethylene-propylene copolymers could be fractionated by successive solvent extraction . most of them gave mainly two fractions of ether - soluble and hexane - soluble characteristics,some others contained partly hexane - insoluble fraction . these two ether - soluble and hexane - soluble fractions have a similar chemical composition and structure in FT-IR spectra . they show no melting point in DSC mesurements and a wide dispersion peak of non-crystalline phase in x-ray diffraction analysis , indicating that the copolymers are random ones . copolymers containing more ethylene segments have shown some sharp peaks indicating they are crystal line . the glass transition temperature ( tg ) of copolymers increased with the increasing of propylene molar ratio in feeding comonomer from DMA mesurement . ethylene / propylene copolymers have shown high molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution in GPC measurements . 
stereo - structure and monomer sequence distribution of the ethylene-propylene copolymers obtained from half - titanocene catalytic system , ( e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ) titanium triallyloxide ( Cp*Ti(OCH2-CH = CH2)3 ) combined with methylalumiloxane ( MAO ) have been investigated by 13C - NMR spectra . the monomer reactivity ratios of the copolymerization with this catalyst were calculated from the monomer sequence distribution in 13C - NMR spectra , r1 = <nUm> ± <nUm> for ethylene , r2 = <nUm> ± <nUm> for propylene,and the products r1r2 for all runs in various feeding monomer ratio are almost equal to one ( r1r2 ≈ <nUm> ) . the monomer reactivity ratios were also determined according to fineman - ross method , the values of r1 = <nUm> , r2 = <nUm> and r1r2 = <nUm> are very close to those of calculating above by 13C - NMR analysis . these results indicated that the copolymers produced are random ones . the ethylene-propylene copolymers could be fractionated by successive solvent extraction and gave two fractions of ether - soluble and hexane - soluble . these two fractions showed slight differences in their monomer sequence distribution and monomer reactivity ratio . the ether - soluble fraction contained more propylene units , while more ethylene segments existed in the hexane - soluble fraction . 
A novel half - titanocene compound , ( e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ) titanium triallyloxide ( Cp*Ti(OCH2-CH = CH2)3 ) , and modified methylalumiloxane ( mMAO ) were synthesized and employed in the study on ethylene-propylene copolymerization . the influences of the amount of residual TMA in MAO,ethylene-propylene feeding molar ratio,polymerization temperature and the concentrations of catalyst and mMAO on activity of ethylene-propylene copolymerization,molecular weight of copolymer have been discussed in detail . it was found that the catalytic activity increased with the decreasing of the amount of residual TMA in MAO , such as from <nUm> % to <nUm> % TMA content in MAO , resulting in the Ti(IV) species content from <nUm> % up to <nUm> . <nUm> % , which indicated that the Ti ( IV ) species is favorable for the ethylene-propylene copolymerization . the activity also increased with the decreasing of ethylene molar ratio in feeding comonomer,it perhaps related to the chain structure and physical state of copolymer . the catalytic activity was affected obviously by the polymeric temperature,but it was not as sensitive in higher ethylenepropylene feeding molar ratio ( e / P = <nUm> : <nUm> ) as that in lower e / P feeding ratio ( e / P = <nUm> : <nUm> ) , this performance suggested that higher temperature was more suitable for ethylene polymerization than for propylene polymerization . the varying ranges of Al / Ti = 140-230 mol / mol and [Ti] = <nUm> × 10-3 ∼ <nUm> × 10-3 mol / L were the optimum conditions for ethylene-propylene copolymerization . subsequently , high molecular weight random ethylene-propylene copolymer elastomers , most of those can be soluble in hexane , were obtained by the catalyst . 
the stereospecific block copolymer of styrene and 1-butene i.e. sPS-b-PB was synthesized with η 5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyltribenzyloxidetitanium ( cp * Ti ( OBz ) <nUm> ) / modified methylaluminoxane ( m MAO ) catalyst . the effects of external triisobutylaluminium(TIBA) , prepolymerization time of 1-butene and concentration of styrene on catalytic activity and molecular weight were investigated . the catalytic activity of copolymerization increases and then decreases with successive increasing concentration of external TIBA , and exhibited the highest value of <nUm> . 2kgP / gTih at [TIBA] = <nUm> mmol / L . As increasing concentration of styrene , the catalytic activity increases at first and then level off . but it decayed with prolonging prepolymerization time . molecular weight of the polymers obtained decreases with increasing concentration of external TIBA , but it is weak relative to prepolymerization time . those copolymerization products obtained were extracted successively with various solvents to separate the existed homo-and copolymers . the block copolymer of sPS-b-PB are soluble either in boiling tetrahydrofuran or boiling chloroform . it accounted for <nUm> % - <nUm> % of the total weight of copolymerization products . the weight percent of 1-butene segments of the block copolymer was in the range of <nUm> mol % - <nUm> . <nUm> mol % . the block copolymer was characterized and confirmed by 13C-NMR,FTIR,DSC,WAXD and GPC methods . 
branched polyethylene with ethylene as single monomer was synthesized with homogeneous catalyst systems consisting of e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyltrialkyloxy titanium[Cp*Ti(OR)3] and various modified methylaluminoxanes(mMAO ). the effects of the ligands OR and TMA content in mMAO of Cp*Ti(OR)3 / mMAO catalyst system on ethylene polymerization have been studied in details . polymerization conditions such as temperature , [Ti] concentration and molar ratio also have been discussed . characterization by 13C NMR , FTIR and DSC indicates that the polymer is long chain ( carbon atoms ≥ <nUm> ) branched polyethylene . A possible mechanism of branched polyethylene with Cp*Ti(OBz)3 / mMAO catalyst system is proposed . 
syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) and polyethylene were comparatively synthesized with homogeneous catalytic systems composing η 5-pentamethycyclopentadienyltribenzyloxy titanium [ cp* Ti ( OBz ) <nUm> ] and various modified methylaluminoxanes ( mMAO ) . the content of TMA in mMAO can be controlled by regulating H 2O / TMA molar ratio during the preparation of mMAO by partial hydrolysis of TMA with Al <nUm> ( SO <nUm> ) 3*18H 2O . the effect of Al / Ti molar ratio on polymerization of styrene as well as ethylene have been studied in detail . the oxidation states of titanium in cp* Ti(OBz) <nUm> / MAO catalytic systems were determined by redox titration method . it seems that active centre of Ti (III) is favorable for styrene syndiospecific polymerization with higher catalytic activity , while Ti(IV) center is favorable for ethylene polymerization . the styrene syndiospecific polymerization may also be influenced by the external addition of tri-isobutyl-aluminum(TIBA) into the same catalytic sistem giving higher yield but slightly lower molecular weight of sPS . 
half - titanocene compounds were employed to polymerize propylene at ambient pressure . A novel polypropylene elastomer with high molecular weight ( mw = <nUm> × <nUm> ∼ <nUm> × <nUm> ) was produced , its molecular chain possessed random stereo - structure distribution . the effects of polymerization conditions such as Al / Ti ratio , polymerization temperature , etc. on catalytic activity and polymer molecular weight were discussed . 
the interactions , in the excited states , between a coumarin and a ketocoumarin together with bisimidazole derivative , mercaptobenzoxazole , titanocene have been studied by laser absorption spectroscopy and by photoconductivity . the redox potentials of these different compounds have been measured and led to the calculation of free enthalpy change for a possible electron transfer reaction . the whole results show that the coumarin is able to demonstrate the formation of radicals through an electron transfer reaction with the additives . on the other hand , the ketocoumarin rather leads to an energy transfer reaction with bisimidazole and to a hydrogen abstraction reaction with the benzoxazole derivative . this study presumes that several coumarin or ketocoumarin / additives combinations should be able to initiate a radical polymerization reaction . 
copolymerizations of propylene and styrene in the presence of cyclopentadienyltitanium tribenzyloxide ( CpTi(OBz)3 ) and different methylaluminoxanes ( MAO ) have been investigated . it was found that the composition and structure of the polymerization products are strongly dependent on the amount of free alkylaluminium , involving the residual trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) in MAO and external one . propylene-styrene copolymer could be prepared only with the catalyst system containing less TMA . for the copolymerization catalyzed with the titanocene and MAO containing the residual TMA <nUm> mol % , monomer reactivity ratios were estimated to be rP = <nUm> and rS = <nUm> . the copolymers contain certain amount of regioirregular monomer - alternating sequences . 
the copolymerization of ethylene(E) and norbornene ( N ) was examined by using various metallocene catalysts and modified - MAO(MMAO) cocatalyst . for C2 - symmetry catalysts such as rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 , Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 , me2 Si(Cp)2ZrCl2 and Cs - symmetrical iPr(FluCp)ZrCl2 as well as CGC and di-bridged zirconocene , the effects of catalyst structure and [N] / [E] feed ratio on catalyst activity , thermal property and [N] content of copolymer ( COC ) was investigated . for rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst of a constant [N] / [E] feed ratio , the appropriate conditions of [Al] / [Zr] mole ratio , polymerization temperature and cocatalyst structure were found to be <nUm> , <nUm> ° C , MMAO cocatalyst , respectively . As [N] / [E] feed ratio increased , the incorporation of norbornene to copolymer increased while the activity of catalyst decreased except for iPr(FluCp)ZrCl2 . with consideration of catalyst activity as well as N content , it was found that rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MMAO system exhibited relatively high activity and controllable tg . monomer reactivity ratio was determined by kelen - tudos method . 
the polymethylene-bridged dinuclear half - titanocenes [(CH2)n(C5H4)2][TiCl 3]2 ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) have been synthesized by treating the distannylated derivatives of the ligands with two equivalents of Cl4Ti in toluene . all complexes are characterized by IR , 1H NMR , 13C NMR and mass spectrometry . In order to examine the catalytic properties of the dinuclear complexes styrene polymerization has been conducted in the presence of MMAO . from the polymerization experiments it was found that ( i ) all the prepared complexes 10-12 produced syndiotactic polystyrenes , ( ii ) the complex <nUm> holding the longest bridging ligand exhibited the highest activity but produced a polymer having the smallest molecular weight among the polymethylene-bridged dinuclear half - titanocenes . this behavior was attributed to the influence of electron - donating caused by the polymethylene bridge between two active centers as well as the effect of steric congestion around metal center caused by the proximal distance between two active sites . 
A novel molecularly hybridized polyethylene / silica composite thin film was obtained by the gas - phase polymerization of ethylene with a titanocene - mounted mesoporous silica layer on a mica plate with mesoscopic pores arranged on the film surface . however , the use of titanocene - mounted hexagonal domains of mesoporous silica on a glass plate for the gas - phase polymerization of ethylene resulted in the formation of an islanded polyethylene / silica hybridized material . 
two cis-cyclopentene bridged titanocenes have been synthesized . two homogeneous ziegler catalysts prepared by activation of synthesized compounds with methylalumoxane are active for ethylene polymerization reactions . 
branched polyethylene was synthesized by ethylene homopolymerization in the presence of a novel metallocene complex of e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl tribenzyloxy titanium [ cp* Ti (OBz)3 ] activated by four types of modified methylaluminoxanes(mMAO) which contained different amounts of residual trimethylaluminum(TMA) . the activity of catalyst and molecular weight , branched degree and branch length of the resultant polymers depend on the oxidation states of active species of titanium and polymerization temperature . the higher content ( % ) of residual TMA in mMAO could strongly reduce complexes Ti(IV) to Ti (III) and Ti (II) and Ti(IV) active species was suggested to be more effective for ethylene polymerization . the products obtained were confirmed by 13C NMR and IR spectra characterization to be branched polyethylene with isolated long branch and methyl pendant . there is a remarkable increase in proportion of methyl pendant with the increase of polymerization temperature . 
polypropylene-b-syndiopolystyrene block copolymers were synthesized by sequential addition of two monomers with cp* Ti (OBz)3 catalyst activated with modified methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and triisobutylaluminium ( TIBA ) . the result shows that the titanocene has a high activity on propylene / styrene block copolymerization . the concentration of Cp*Ti(OBz)3 , the amount of TIBA and the residual propylene monomer after prepolymerization were investigated and found to have pronounced influence on the catalytic activity . the appropriate concentration of the titanocene complex [ c(Ti) = <nUm> . <nUm> ∼ <nUm> . <nUm> × 10-3 mol · L-1 ] will prevent the active centers from being buried by propylene prepolymers so that the copolymerization of the two monomers was promoted . since the Ti ( VI ) catalytic system is favorable to propylene prepolymerization while the Ti ( III ) catalytic system is required for styrene polymerization , TIBA had played an important role in changing the active centers from Ti(IV) to Ti (III) so that the block copolymerization can take place . the investigation also indicated the existence of residual propylene after propylene prepolymerization will prevent styrene from block copolymerization . the PP-b-sPS block copolymers were separated from the gross products with successive extraction with boiling 2-butanone , heptane , THF , and chloroform . each fraction of materials were characterized by 13C NMR , DSC and elemental analysis . 
the primary silane p-TolSiH3 ( p-Tol = p-CH3C6H5 ) can be polymerized to poly(p-tolylsilane) with <nUm> mol % of both the chiral and achiral zirconocenes Cp2ZrCl2 , Cp(CpSi*)ZrCl2 , and (CpSi*)2ZrCl2 ( cp = CH , CpSi* = C5H4Si(CH3)2-(1R)-endo-(+)-OC10H17 ) in combination with <nUm> mol % of n-BuLi . generally , higher molecular weight linear polymers were obtained when using the substituted zirconocenes in comparison to the parent zirconocene , which in turn produced larger quantities of low-molecular-weight cyclic products . each polysilane sample was analyzed by 29Si{1H} DEPT and 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy . deconvolution of selected regions of the 29Si{1H} DEPT and the 1H NMR spectra for higher molecular weight linear polymers indicated that these catenates were predominantly atactic , on the basis of a triad level bernoullian statistical model . the data suggested that , in this case , chiral substitution of the zirconocene rings had no effect on the stereogrowth of the polysilane chain . 
the four new asymmetric ansa - zirconocene dichlorides rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(2-phenyl- 1-e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 4c ) , rac-[(9-e5-fluorenyl)(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl) dimethylsilane]zirconium dichloride ( 4d ) , rac-[(9-e5-fluorenyl)(2-methyl-1-e5indenyl) dimethylsilane]zirconium dichloride ( 4e ) , and rac-[(9-e5-fluorenyl)(2-phenyl-1-e5-indenyl) dimethylsilane]zirconium dichloride ( 4f ) have been prepared , and their polymerization behavior was compared to the recently published rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1-e5- indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 4a ) and rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl) ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 4b ) . the Si - bridged ligands are easily accessible by the reaction of fluorenyllithium with dimethyldichlorosilane and the subsequent addition of indenyllithium . A similar route using 1-(9-fluorenyl)-2-bromoethane was applied for the synthesis of the ethylene-bridged ligands . the Zr(IV) complexes of all ligands are highly active catalysts for the propene polymerization reaction after activation with MAO . the influence of the bridge and the particular substitution pattern of the indenyl fragments has been studied with respect to monomer concentration and polymerization temperature . the exchange of the ethylene bridge by a dimethylsilane unit results in a strong increase of the molecular weights but also in a decreased polymerization activity deriving from a fast decomposition of the active catalyst species . interestingly , significantly higher polymer molecular weights could be found for the complexes that contain the 5,6-cyclopentyl substituent on the indenyl moiety . all catalysts showed the effect of a declining stereo - selectivity with increasing monomer concentration , leading to the formation of homopolypropene elastomers . the mechanism of stereoerror formation of these C1 - symmetric species was investigated by deuterium labeling studies on the propene monomers and by comparison with C2 - symmetric complexes . 
polynorbornenes were prepared by using catalyst system CpTi(OBZ)3 / MAO . the effects of the ratio of cocatalyst to the titanocene and polymerization temperature on the structure of the polymer product were determined . 
this article describes recent studies on precision copolymerization by rare earth catalysts . the reaction of the rare earth dialkyl complexes with an equivalent of a borate compound such as [Ph3C] [ B(C 6F5)4 ] or [PhNMe2H] [ B(C6F 5)4 ] generates easily the corresponding cationic monoalkyl species , which serve as excellent catalysts for the polymerization and copolymerization of a variety of olefins to yield a new family of polymer materials that show novel properties but are difficult to prepare by other catalysts . 
three new titanocene catalysts e5 - cyclopentadienyltri ( tetrahydro - furfuryloxyl ) titanium , e5 - cyclopentadienyl trifurfuryloxyl titanium , e5 - cyclopentadienyl tribenzyloxyl - titanium were synthesized and characterized by elementary analysis , FTIR , 1H NMR , 13C NMR and MS methods . the syndiotactic polymerization of styrene with these three titanocene catalysts were investigated . 
chemical microstructure of the atactic polypropylenes prepared with cyclopentadienyltitanium tribenzyloxide / methylaluminoxane and pentamethylcyclopentadienyltitanium tribenzyloxide / methylaluminoxane catalysts has been investigated by <nUm> C - NMR spectra . both catalysts give the polymers with similar stereo - structure distributions.A satisfaction of baernoullian statistics , by mr / ( <nUm> mm + mr ) + mr(2rr+ mr ) ≈ <nUm> , indicates that the propylene polymerizations are stereochemically obedient to a chain end control . the present polymers are regioirregular and contain a nonnegligible proportion of propylene units arranged in head to head and tail to tail sequences which can be observed in the methine carbon region of the 13C - NMR spectra . from a statistical analysis of the regiotriad distribution , it was found that polypropylenes with regioblock structure can be produced with the catalysts . considering a binary copolymerization of 1,2-orientation monomer and <nUm> , 1-orientation monomer , the reactivity ratios , r <nUm> and r <nUm> , were calculated . the relations of r <nUm> > 1,r <nUm> > l and r 1r <nUm> ≫ l indicate that the incoming monomers tend to insert into the metalcarbon bonds with the same orientation as the end units . by substituting methyl group for hydrogen in the cyclopentadienyl ring , the titanocene catalyst affords a polypropylene containing shorter regioblocks . the length of the regioblocks increases with reducing the polymerization temperature . 
propylene polymerizations in the presence of various monocyclopentadienyltitanium compounds and methylaluminoxanes ( MAO ) have been investigated . it was found that by substituting methyl group for hydrogen in the cyclopentadienyl ring , the titanocene catalyst affords a polypropylene with increasing molecular weight by one order of magnitude . residual AIMe <nUm> content in MAO has an determinative effect on catalytic activity for the propylene polymerization . an excess of AlMe <nUm> in the catalyst system , such as <nUm> % AlMe <nUm> in MAO , hinders the polymerization by reducing the Ti species to inactive lower valent states . the effects of molar ratio of MAO to Ti complex , polymerization temperature and monomer pressure on catalytic activity and molecular weight of the products are studied in detail . thus , atactic polypropylene with the molecular weight range of 20-100 × <nUm> , much higher than that prepared by unsubstiuted cyclopentadienyltitanium complex has been synthsized by η <nUm> pentamethylcyclopentadienyltitanium tribenzyloxide / MAO catalyst . the atatic polypropylenes exhibit excellent elasticity . 
half - sandwich titanocenes , e. g . (ind)TiRCl2(R-Cl , OMe , OEt ; ind - indenyl group ) and b-diketonate titanium complexes , e. g . (dbm)3TiL ( L-Cl , OPh , OPhMe ; dbm - dibenzoylmethane group ) were investigated for syndiotactic polymerization of styrene . the optimum molar ratios of Al to Ti of b-diketonate titanium complexes were different from those of mono-indenyl titanium complexes . the polymerization activity of ( ind ) TiRCl2 was higher than that of (dbm)3TiL at their own optimum n(Al) / n(Ti) . compared with ( ind ) TiRCl2 , the thermostability of (dbm)3 TiL was higher . the polymerization activity of (dbm)3Ti(OPh) was <nUm> × <nUm> g / ( mol*h ) at <nUm> K , while that of (ind)Ti(OMe)Cl2 was only <nUm> × <nUm> g / ( mol *h ) at the same temperature . after <nUm> h of polymerization , the reaction activity of the nontitanocene was remained at <nUm> × <nUm> g / ( mol*h ) , while that of the half - sandwich titanocene was only <nUm> × <nUm> g / ( mol*h ) . it is indicated that the life - time of (dbm)3TiL was much longer than that of (ind)TiRCl2 . the melting temperatures ( Tm ) and the syndiotacticity of polystyrene by b-diketonate titanium complexes were higher than those of the polymer by mono-indenyl titanium complexes as well . 
copolymerization of ethylene and styrene with the catalytic system Cp*TiMe3-B(C6F5)3 under suitable conditions affords a new polymer having a polyethylenic backbone with 4-phenyl-1-butyl branches as the main product . this unexpected result has been ascribed to the multi-site nature of the catalytic system , containing a species able to co-oligomerize ethylene and styrene to 6-phenyl-1-hexene ( which was actually identified in the polymerization mixture ) , and another species able to copolymerize the latter with ethylene . 
syndiotactic polystyrene ( syndiotacticity > <nUm> % ) was synthesized by bulk polymerization catalyzed with highly active novel titanocene η 5- pentamethylcyclo pentadienyl - tri - <nUm> - methoxyphenoxy titanium(Cp* Ti(OC 6OCH 3)3 ) and methyl - aluminoxane(MAO) catalyst system . the catalytic activity of the styrene bulk polymerization is up to <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> g / ( g · h ) and the monomer conversion is <nUm> % at <nUm> ° C , both are much higher than those of polymerization in toluene solution . the effects of polymerization temperature , catalyst concentration , and molar ratio of MAO / Ti on bulk polymerization are reported . the addition of triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) to the catalytic system can promote the catalyst activity . 
some highly active e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyltribenzyloxy titanium complexes [Cp*Ti(OBz)3] activated by modified methylaluminoxane ( mMA ) were prepared and used as the catalyst for styrene syndiospecific polymerization and propene atactic polymerization . styrene could be copolymerized with propene when the propene was prepolymerized for a period , to which styrene and tri-isobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) were then added . the titled block copolymer together with the related homopolymers was obtained . the copolymerization porducts can be divided into the homopolymers and the copolymer by successive solvent extraction with boiling butanone , heptane and tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) , and each fraction was characterized by 13C NMR , DSC and WAXD . it was found that aPS and aPP were soluble in boiling butanone and heptane respectively . the block copolymer ( sPS-e-aPP ) composed of syndiotactic polystyrene segment was soluble in boiling THF and the residue was chiefly sPS . 
the tetraphenyl substituted disiloxane bridged ansa - zirconocene has been generated to probe the effect of bridging ligand on metallocene polymerization . the indicated zirconocene has been synthesized by the reaction of Cl4Zr with the distannylated precursor compound . the new disiloxane bridged ansa - metallocene was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR , mass analysis , and elemental analysis . ethylene polymerization was carried out to in- , vestigate the polymerization properties of the prepared complex . polymerization experiments exhibited that the catalytic activity increases with the increase in polymerization temperature as well as the amount of cocatalyst . on the other hand , the molecular weights of the polymers decreased with the increase in polymerization temperature . it turned out that tetraphenyl replacement caused about <nUm> to <nUm> % activity reduction . the most important feature associated in tetramethyl to tetraphenyl substitution was that molecular weights of the polymers from the tetraphenyl substituted complex were enormously improved comparing to those of the polymers from the tetramethyl one . 
tetramethyldisilane - bridged bis(1 - indenyl and tetrahydroindenyl ) metallocene dichlorides(Me2SiSiMe2)Ind2MCl 2[M = ti(1) , zr(2) ] and (Me2SiSiMe2)[IndH4]2MCl 2[M = ti(3) , zr(4) ] were synthesized . complexes 1-4 were characterized by 1H NMR , mass spectra and elemental analyses . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were used for the polymerization of ethylene after activation with methyl aluminoxane(MAO) at different temperatures and normal pressure . the titanocene <nUm> shows a lower activity but produces polyethylene with a higher molecular weight than zirconocene <nUm> . the catalyst systems show a dependency of the activity and molecular weight on temperature . 
metallocene catalysts in dissolved form are in most cases unsuitable for the production of polyethylene or polypropylene on an industrial scale . In order to use them in existing technical processes , metallocenes have to be supported . Cs - symmetric zirconocenes show a high activity and no leaching additional triisobutyl aluminum is used as scavenger and MAO - covered silica for heterogenization . the aluminum : zirconium ratio can be reduced to values of <nUm> : <nUm> to get optimal activities . the syndiotacticity of the obtained polypropylene is lower compared with polymers of the homogeneous catalyst and decreases strongly with a thinner propene concentration . 
zirconocene supported on alumina or magnesium chloride exhibits modest olefin polymerization activity but not when it is supported directly on silica . the surface silanol as well as siloxane groups must be passivated with appropriate reagents . A very active and stereospecific supported catalyst was obtained by first reacting silica with methylalumoxane and bisphenol A before the impregnation of the ansa - zirconocene precursor . the main difference between a homogeneous and supported catalyst is that at the same gross amount of metallocene , the net concentration of it in the pores of a support material is several orders of magnitude greater than it exists in solution thus the rate of deactivation in the former case is correspondingly faster than in the latter . most other supported metallocene catalysts based on supports such as zeolites , cyclodextrin , polymeric MAO , synthetic polymers , etc. , are poor in olefin polymerization for this and other reasons discussed . 
new data on the structure of polymethylaluminoxane[-Al(CH3)O-]n ( MAO ) , the nature of its lewis acidity , and the mechanism of formation of the active centers of the metallocene catalysts during interaction between MAO and Cp2ZrMe2 obtained by spectroscopy ( 27Al , 17O , 1H , and 13C NMR and spin probe ESR ) and density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations are considered . A three - dimensional structure of MAO ( a cage structure ) with four - coordinated aluminum atoms and three - coordinated oxygen atoms is found to be the most probable . experimental evidence for the presence of relatively weak lewis acid sites in MAO ( about <nUm> site per <nUm> atoms of Al ) is obtained for the first time . the acidity of MAO depends on the size of a MAO molecule n , and it increases with increasing n . A scheme for the formation and structure of lewis acid sites formed upon interaction between MAO and Al2Me6 , which is always present in the MAO samples is proposed . cationic intermediates formed in the MAO / Cp2ZrMe2 system at high molar ratios Al / Zr = 200-4000 corresponding to real conditions of polymerization are characterized for the first time . A scheme of equilibria between them and the most probable precursors of the active centers in this system are proposed . A new mechanism for the formation of the [Cp2ZrMe]+[MAO · me]- ionic pair involving the abstraction and occlusion of a methyl ligand in the bulk of a MAO molecule is proposed on the basis of quantum - chemical calculations . 
catalytic pauson - khand reaction products with norbornadiene could be effectively transformed to trisubstituted cyclopentadienes , which have been used to synthesize a series of unbridged bis(1-R'-2-R-3-R'-trisubstituted cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichlorides <nUm> ( r = R' = ph ) , <nUm> ( r = ph , R' = me ) , <nUm> ( r = n-Bu , R' = me ) , <nUm> ( r = t-Bu , R' = me ) , <nUm> ( r = (CH2)4OMe ) , R' = me ) , and <nUm> ( r = n-Bu , R' = ph ) . the crystal structure of <nUm> was determined by x-ray crystallography . these zirconium complexes in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) show activities for the polymerization of ethylene . the activities are in the following order : <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> ∼ <nUm> ∼ Cp2ZrCl2 > <nUm> ∼ <nUm> . the activity of <nUm> is four times higher than that of Cp2ZrCl2 under similar conditions . A . 
trimethylphosphine - stabilized ethylene complexes <nUm> of the ethylenebisindenyl-supported zirconocene fragment are prepared via magnesium reduction of rac - (EBI)ZrCl <nUm> in the presence of ethylene and PMe <nUm> . when the reaction is halted after <nUm> h , good yields of a mixture containing rac-(EBI)Zr(e <nUm> -CH <nUm> = CH <nUm> )PMe <nUm> , rac-1 , and the racemic diastereomer of the zirconacyclopentane derivative (EBI)Zr(e <nUm> -CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> ) , rac-2 , are obtained . this mixture may be converted to pure rac-1 if treated with excess PMe <nUm> . if the magnesium reduction of rac - (EBI)ZrCl <nUm> is left for <nUm> days in the presence of magnesium chloride , complete epimerization to meso-1 is observed . thus , both diastereomers of <nUm> are available . compounds meso-1 and rac-2 have been characterized crystallographically . the coordinated ethylene ligands in compounds <nUm> are susceptible to electrophilic attack by the pentafluorophenyl-substituted boranes HB(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> and B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> , forming zwitterionic metallocene products . for reactions involving HB(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> , the products meso-3 and rac-3 are characterized by a strong zirconium - hydrido borate interaction , as well as a weak Zr-Cb bonding . In addition to complete solution characterization , the structure of meso-3 was determined crystallographically . upon treatment of rac-1 with B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> , a more charge - separated zwitterion , rac-4 , was formed . In addition to retaining its PMe <nUm> ligand , the complex is stabilized by a strong b-CH <nUm> interaction , as determined by x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy . structural comparisons between the compounds reported herein and previous examples in metallocene chemistry are presented . 
thermally induced elimination of bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene from its titanocene complex [ {e5-C5Me4(SiMe3)} 2Ti(e2-Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) ] ( 1 ) afforded the stable titanocene [ {e5-C5-Me4(SiMe3)} 2TiII ] ( 2 ) in high yield under mild conditions . compound <nUm> exhibits paramagnetic line broadening of 1H NMR signals , although it is silent in EPR spectra down to <nUm> ° C . the solid - state structure determination revealed an exactly parallel arrangement of the cyclopentadienyl rings in <nUm> due to crystallographically imposed symmetry . complex <nUm> smoothly reacts with ethylene to give the yellow e2-ethylene complex [ {e5-C5Me4(SiMe3)} 2-Ti(e2-CH2 = CH2 ) ] ( 3 ) . the structures of <nUm> and <nUm> , determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction , show the bent - titanocene moieties with the e2-coordinated Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 and CH2 = CH2 ligands , respectively .

In solution , <nUm> showed time - averaged C2 symmetry ( 1H NMR ) ; however , single - crystal x-ray diffraction analysis showed that <nUm> adopts an asymmetric conformation in which only one of the CH2 annelated rings projects into the Cl2Zr coordination hemisphere . neither <nUm> nor <nUm> served as a precatalyst for alumoxane - cocatalyzed , homogeneous propylene polymerization . 
new dinuclear half - titanocenes with polymethylene-bridged cp ligands were prepared and applied to styrene polymerization . the polymerization behavior of the prepared half - titanocenes was compared to that of CpTiCL3 as well as polysiloxane - bridged one . the activity of the half - titanocene increased with temperature but CpTiCl3 decreased indicating that thermal stability of the half - titanocene is better than CpTiCl3 . the polymerization behavior of dinuclear metallocene is influenced by not only the transition metal and ligands but also the structure of bridge linking the ligands . 
the polymeric [Ind2Si(C6H4)]n and [Ind2Si(C6H4)]m compounds ( ind = indenyl ) were synthesized via the condensation reaction of bisindenyldichlorosilane and p-dilithiobenzene or p-dilithiobiphenyl , and the supported - type zirconocene catalysts were prepared by reacting them with zirconium tetrachloride . the content of zirconium in the catalysts is much higher than that in the metallocene catalysts supported by inorganic compounds . polymerizations of ethene and propene were conducted with them using methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or ordinary alkylaluminiums as cocatalysts and toluene as the solvent . the catalysts combined with MAO display very high activities especially for the ethene polymerization . from the polymerization at high temperatures , it was found that the active species are markedly stabilized , probably due to the rigid backbones of the carriers . the activity of the catalysts activated with ordinary alkylaluminiums is far less as compared with those activated with MAO . 
nine new fluorinated half - sandwich titanocene complexes ( lb-9b ) based on substituted alkylindenes were synthesized , by reacting Me3SnF with the corresponding chloride species , and employed as catalyst precursors for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene . when activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , the new precursors lb-9b exhibited increased activities by factors of 15-40 compared with the corresponding chlorinated compounds and provided improved syndiotacticity , enhanced melting temperature , and higher polymer molecular weights . the activities of indenyl and methyl- or phenyl-substituted indenyl complexes were found to be higher by factors of 4-12.5 than those of CpTiF3 and CpTiF3 . more importantly , the amount of MAOcan be reduced to an Al : Ti molar ratio of <nUm> in the temperature range of 10-90 ° C . it is likely that Ti-F , more polarized than the Ti-Cl bond in the half - sandwich titanocenes , allows the formation of more active and stable active sites of Ti (III) complexes needed for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene . evidence in this direction is brought via the electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) spectrum and redox titration . the higher activity and syndiospecificity of the fluorinated catalysts are attributable to a greater number , more stable Ti (III) active sites , and / or higher propagation rate con - stant . 
novel highly active e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyltribenzyloxy titanium catalyst activated by modified methylaluminoxane ( m-MAO ) was prepared for styrene syndiospecific polymerization . the influences of the contents of trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) in m-MAO and external addition of tri-isobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) on the distribution of the oxidation states of titanium were investigated in detail . the Ti ( III ) is in favour of styrene syndiospecific polymerization in higher catalytic activity . 
13C NMR spectroscopic studies of the in situ polymerization of 13C - enriched ethylene ( 13C2H4 ) in the presence of Cp2Zr(13CH3)2 and methylaluminoxane or BC18F15 as cocatalysts were carried out . the first direct observation of Cp2Zr-polymeryl species was made . the in situ polymerization experiments in the presence of different concentrations of dinuclear [(Cp2ZrMe)2(m-Me)]+ and mononuclear cation species [Cp2ZrMe]+ , having [MeB(C6F5)3]- or [MeMAO]- counterions , were performed . these comparisons made it possible to make the assignments of the zirconocene complexes bearing the polymeryl chain as ligands [Cp2Zr13CH2P]+[13CH 3MAO]- , [Cp2Zr13CH2P]+[13CH 3B(C6F5)3]- , and Cp2Zr(13CH2P)(13CH3) . they are in equilibrium with each other . mononuclear Zr - polymeryl ion pairs such as [Cp2Zr13CH2P]+[13CH 3B(C6F5)3]- and [Cp2Zr13CH2P]+[13CH 3MAO]- either are the propagating active species or are intermediates , closely related to the active species , in the polymer propagation .

atactic polypropene was synthsised with homogeneous catalytic systems of varios titanium compounds activated by methylaluminoxane(MAO) . the titanium ligands affect both catalytic activity and stereoregularity of polypropene obtained . for novel e5cyclopentadienyltri-n-propyloxy titanium [ CpTi (O-n-Pr)3 ] / MAO catalytic system , the influencing factors of polymerization temperature , Al / Ti molar ratio and propene pressure on propene polymerization have been studied . the catalytic activity at polymerization temperature <nUm> ° C and Al / Ti molar ratio <nUm> was 220kgPP / molTi*h . the kinetics of early state propene polymerization with CpTi(O-n-Pr)3 / MAO has been investigated . the polymer yield increases almost linearly with increasing the titanium or monomer concentration . the apparent rate of polymerization ( rp ) versus titanium and monomer concentration appears the first order reaction rule , and the apparent rate constant ( kp ) is <nUm> × <nUm> mol · L-1 · h-1 at <nUm> ° C . the calculated polymerization activation energy ( DE ) is <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> · mol-1 , while the impact fractor(A) is <nUm> × 104mol*L-1*h-1 . after boiling heptane extraction of the polypropene for <nUm> h . the soluble fraction with more than <nUm> % by weight was isolated and characterized as atactic polypropene by <nUm> C - NMR , WAXD and FTIR . the molecular weight ( mw ) and its distribution ( mw / Mn ) determined by GPC were <nUm> ∼ <nUm> × <nUm> and <nUm> respectively . 
Cp2TiR ( OMe ) prepared by treating bis ( e5-cyclopentadienyl ) titanacyclobutane compound with one equivalent of methanol was used as a catalyst precursor in the copolymerization of ethylene and propylene in the presence of AlEtCl2 . the effects of the type of alkylaluminum , molar ratio of alkylaluminum to the titanocene and monomer composition on the catalytic activity for the copolymerization were studied . it was found that chlorine - containing alkylaluminums are the efficient co-catalysts . the monomer reactivity ratios of the copolymerization catalyzed with Cp2TiR(OMe)-AlEtCl2 catalyst system were estimated to be rE = <nUm> , rP = <nUm> and rErP = <nUm> , indicating a random copolymerization . the 13C NMR analysis of the sequence distribution of copolymer indicated that the propylene units in copolymer are mostly isolated by ethylene units or ethylene homopolymeric sequences . 
syndiotactic polystyrene and atactic polypropene were synthesized with different titanium compounds , in particular of η 5-cyclopentadienyltri-n-propoxy titanium [ CpTi ( OPr n ) <nUm> ] and modified methylaluminoxane ( m-MAO ) homogeneous catalytic system . the titanium ligands affect catalytic activity of styrene syndiospecific polymerization and propene polymerization . the effects of the percentage contents of the trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) coexisted in m-MAO , which can be controlled by changing H 2O and TMA molar ratio during the preparation of MAO by partial hydrolysis of TMA with Al <nUm> ( SO <nUm> ) <nUm> · 18H 2O , on polymerization of styrene and propene have been studied in detail . the external addition of alkylaluminium ( AIR <nUm> , trimethylaluminum , triethylaluminum , tri-isobutylaluminum ) to CpTi ( OPr n ) <nUm> / m-MAO catalytic systems may also influence both catalytic activity and molecular weights of syndiotactic polystyrene produced . the oxidation states of titanium in different CpTi ( OPr n ) <nUm> / m-MAO catalytic systems were determined by redox titration method . it results that Ti ( III ) is good for styrene syndiospecific polymerization in higher catalytic activity , while Ti ( IV ) is good for propene 's polymerization . oxidation state of tinanium in catalyst system does not clearly affect the tacticity of these two kind of polymers obtained .

transformation of living ring - opening metathesis polymerization into coordination polymerization by converting the titanacyclobutane group attached to a polynorbomene chain into titanocene alkoxide has been used for the synthesis of polynorbornene-poly(ethylene-co-propylene) block copolymer . preliminary characterizations of the copolymerization products by solvent extraction and 13C NMR spectrum are reported . 
cyclic olefin copolymers ( COC ) which consists of rigid alicyclic polymer - backbone are attractive materials because of their good heat and chemical resistance as well as their low dielectric constants , nonhygroscopicity , and high transparency . despite the expectation for copolymerization of cyclic olefins with higher 1-alkene giving new COC , the catalytic systems available for the copolymerization are limited and their activity and the molecular weights of the products were insufficient . ansa-dimethylsilylene(fluorenyl)(t-butylamido) dimethyl titanium complexes ( 1 ) conducted living polymerization of norbornene and 1-alkene activated by a suitable cocatalyst . excellent copolymerization ability of compound <nUm> also enables the introduction of functional groups in COC via copolymerization of norbornene with functionalized 1-alkenes . novel COC synthesized by the use of compound 1-based catalytic systems are presented . 
the tantalum carborane complex (Et2C2B4H4)CpTaMe2 ( 1 ) is thermally stable but undergoes clean photochemical insertion with alkynes to give vinyltantalum species , in contrast to the thermal reactivity of isoelectronic group <nUm> metallocenes which give methylidene intermediates . certain tantalum vinyltitanium products display NMR resonances indicative of g-agostic Ta-H3C interactions sufficiently strong to stabilize two different regioisomers . decomposition of these species occurs by apparent alkyne deinsertion and ejection of the tantalum fragment to give R2Et2C4B4H4 ( r = me , et , ph ) carborane clusters . the analogous diphenyl complex (Et2C2B4H4)CpTaPh2 ( 8 ) is thermally reactive , eliminating benzene and undergoing trapping reactions of the derived benzyne intermediate with alkynes . the structures of the resulting metallaindene complexes are supported by x-ray crystallography , protonolysis , and spectroscopy . insertions occur with good regioselectivity , controlled by steric and stereoelectronic factors that differ somewhat from those observed for zirconocene and titanocene analogues . reaction of complex <nUm> with excess styrene results in a novel triple - insertion process in which styrene units are added to both ortho positions of an aryl ligand and to the central boron atom of the B3C2 ring . the proposed mechanism ( supported by the use of styrene-d8 and alkylated metallacarborane starting materials ) features two benzyne intermediates , derived from activation of both ortho-CH bonds , and one insertion into a putative Ta-B bond . an important hypothesis is that a Ta-C fragment can undergo intramolecular insertion into a carborane B-H bond , a step unknown for cyclopentadienyl C-H bonds and one that is potentially relevant to the use of metallacarborane complexes as catalysts for olefin polymerization and related processes . 
ethylene-bridged bis(N,N-diisopropyl-1-aminoboratabenzene-4-yl)zirconium dichloride ( 5a ) , dimethylsilyl-bridged bist(N,N-diisopropyl-1-aminoboratabenzene-4-yl)zirconium dichloride ( 7a ) , and dimethylmethylene-bridged (cyclopentadienyl)(N,N-diisopropyl-1-aminoboratabenzene-4-yl)zirconium dichloride ( 6a ) have been prepared . x-ray crystal structures of the dimethyl derivatives of <nUm> and <nUm> show that the complexes closely resemble the corresponding ansa - zirconocenes . when activated by excess methylaluminoxane , 5a , 6a , and 7a are catalysts for the polymerization of olefins . 
the reactivity of the alkyl complexes [Cp*Ti(III)(CH3)][RB(C6F5)3] ( cp* = e5-C5Me5 ; r = CH3 , -C6F5 ) with a-13C-enrichedp-chlorostyrene has been investigated by means of ESR spectroscopy in order to gain insight into the chemical structure of the active species in syndiospecific polymerization of styrene and substituted styrenes promoted by " half - titanocene " - based catalysts . secondary ( 2,1 ) polyinsertion of p-chlorostyrene into a Ti (III) - alkyl bond has been observed under polymerization conditions . the role of Cp*TiIIIR+ complexes in syndiospecific styrene polymerization has conclusively been confirmed . furthermore , the reaction of the 13C - enriched complex [Cp*Ti(13CH3)][RB(C6F5) <nUm> ] with PMe3 and Al(13CH3)3 has also been investigated by ESR spectroscopy . PMe3 displaces the methylborate anion from the coordination sphere of the Cp*Ti13CH3(m-13CH3)B(C 6F5)3 ion pair and produces the corresponding phosphine adduct Cp*Ti(CH3)(PMe3)2+ . In the same manner , the reaction of [ Cp*Ti(13- CH3)][B(C6F5)4] with Al(13CH3)3 affords the [ Cp*Ti(m-13CH3)3Al( 13CH3)]+ adduct . the increase of the intensity of the Ti (III) signals observed in the ESR spectra of these catalytic systems after addition of the monomer has been explained on the basis of the ESR results reported above . 
the polymerization behavior of three linear asymmetrically substituted dienes , i.e. 6-phenyl-1,5-hexadiene ( A ) , 7-methyl-1,6-octadiene ( B ) and r(+)-5,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene ( isocitronellene , C ) is reported in order to study the effect of substitution at one vinylic group . homopolymerization of these monomers with the catalyst system rac-Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 / MAO resulted in no reaction products in the case of monomer A and in polymers with mw , = <nUm> kg / mol and mw = <nUm> kg / mol with the monomers B and C , respectively . according to NMR analysis , the vinylene end group of isocitronellene remained untouched during polymerization , which excludes the possibility of cyclopolymerization or crosslinking . copolymerization of isocitronellene with propene resulted in incorporation of the diene ( <nUm> mol- % ) equal to the stoichiometric ratio in the monomer feed , with a relatively high catalyst activity . the degree of incorporated isocitronellene is inversely related to the polymerization temperature , providing control over crystallinity ( isotacticity ) and molecular weight of the copolymer . the isocitronellene homo- and copolymers could be epoxidized quantitatively and brominated to an extent of <nUm> % . perfluorohexyl iodide was grafted onto the isocitronellene / propene copolymer by radical reaction ( conversion <nUm> % ) , yielding a poly(a-olefin) with fluorinated side chains . 
reactions of Cp2Zr(thf)(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ( 1 ) and rac-(ebthi)Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) ( <nUm> ; ebthi = 1,2-ethylene-1,1'-bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl) ) with 2-vinylpyridine lead , under elimination of the alkyne , to the five - membered azazirconacycles , which are best described as 1-zircona-2-azacyclopent-3-enes ( 1-azadiene complexes ) . one of these complexes couples with ethylene to yield a stable a-2-pyridyl-substituted zirconacyclopentane and reacts in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio with water to yield a b-2-pyridyl-substituted dimeric s-ethylzirconoxane . In the reaction of the 2-derived complex with BF4H , rac-[1,2-ethylene-1,1'-bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl)]zirconium difluoride was obtained . both 1-zircona-2-azacyclopent-3-enes insert carbon dioxide to give structurally different binuclear carbonate - bridged complexes . 
titanocene complexes based on an amido-fluorenyl ligand bridged by a dimethylsilylene group , ( e1-:e5-C13H8SiMe 2NCMe3)TiCl2 ( 3 ) and ( e1:e5-C13H8SiMe 2NCMe3)TiMe2 ( 5 ) , have been synthesized . reaction of <nUm> with <nUm> equiv of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] ( 2 ) was almost quantitative to give the " cationic " compound [ ( e1:e5-C13H8SiMe 2NCMe3)TiMe]+[B(C6F 5)4]- ( 1 ) , as identified on the basis of elemental analyses and spectroscopic properties . the " cation " <nUm> was highly active and stereoselective in the copolymerization of ethylene ( e ) and styrene ( S ) , depending upon the polymerization conditions , to produce predominantly a new microstructural E-S copolymer ( together with some polyethylene homopolymer ) with an activity of ( <nUm> - <nUm> ) × <nUm> g of bulk polymer / ( mol of ti*mol of total monomers*h ) . As thoroughly characterized by solvent extraction , GPC , 13C NMR , DSC , and DMA , the E-S copolymer obtained by catalyst <nUm> proved to be a perfectly alternating copolymer with well - defined isotactic polystyrene structure , together with a single glass transition ( tg = <nUm> ° C ) and melting temperature of <nUm> ° C . the findings obtained by catalyst <nUm> suggest that the structure of the active species with the bulkier fluorenyl substituent and the following alternating site migratory insertion of comonomer in the chain propagation is responsible for the preferentially alternating , isotactic comonomer incorporation . 
with mononuclear half - titanocenes such as CpTiCl <nUm> , IndTiCl <nUm> , and me <nUm> CpTiCl <nUm> , as well as the constrained geometry catalyst ( CGC ) and a new dinuclear hexamethyltrisiloxanediylbis(cyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride ) ( TSDT ) , the copolymerization of styrene and ethylene was examined . the thermal properties and structure of copolymerization products were investigated with differential scanning calorimetry and <nUm> C - nuclear magnetic resonance . In addition , the raw polymer was separated into homopolymer and copolymer with an extraction method and cross fractionation chromatography . with the above analysis , it was concluded that the raw polymer obtained with CpTiCl <nUm> and IndTiCl <nUm> was a mixture of syndiotactic polystyrene and polyethylene homopolymers with 10-30 wt % copolymer , whereas that produced by me <nUm> CpTiCl <nUm> and TSDT was a homopolymer mixture with a negligible amount of copolymer . only CGC produced the copolymer of styrene and ethylene perfectly . 
{ [ 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl ] cyclopentadienyl } titanium trichloride ( CpNTiCl3 , <nUm> ) was activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) to catalyze polymerizations of ethylene ( e ) , propylene ( P ) , ethylidene norbornene ( ENB ) , vinylcyclohexene ( VCH ) , and 1,4-hexadiene ( HD ) . the dependence of homopolymerization activity ( A ) of <nUm> / MAO on olefin concentration ( [M]n ) is n = <nUm> ± <nUm> for e and n = <nUm> ± <nUm> for P . the value of n is <nUm> ± <nUm> for CpTiCl3 / MAO catalysis of ethylene polymerization ; this system does not polymerize propylene . <nUm> / MAO catalyzes HD polymerization at one - tenth of AH for 1-hexene , probably because of chelation effects in the HD case . the copolymerization of e and P has reactivity ratios of rE = <nUm> and rP = <nUm> at <nUm> ° C , and rErP = <nUm> , which suggests <nUm> / MAO may be a multisite catalyst . the copolymerization activity of CpTiCl3 / MAO is <nUm> times smaller than that of CpNTiCl3 / MAO . terpolymerization of e / P / ENB has A of <nUm> g of polymer / ( mol of Ti h ) , incorporates up to <nUm> mol % ( ̃ <nUm> wt % ) of ENB , and high MW 's of <nUm> to <nUm> x <nUm> . all of these parameters are surprisingly insensitive to the ENB concentration . the e / P / VCH terpolymerization has comparable A value of ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) x <nUm> g / ( mol of Ti h ) . the incorporation of VCH in terpolymer increases with increasing [VCH] . terpolymerization with HD occurs at about one - third of the A of either ENB or VCH ; the product HD - EPDM is low in molecular weight and contains less than <nUm> % of HD . these terpolymerization results are compared with those obtained previously for three zirconocene precursors : rac-ethylenebis(1-e5-inde-nyl) dichlorozirconium ( 6 ) , rac- ( dimethylsilylene ) bis ( 1-e5-indenyl ) dichlorozirconium ( 7 ) , and ethylenebis(9-e5-fluorenyl)dichlorozirconium ( 8 ) . the last compound is a particularly poor terpolymerization catalyst ; it incorporates very little VCH or HD and no ENB at all . <nUm> / MAO is a better catalyst for e / P / VCH terpolymerization , while <nUm> / MAO is superior in e / P / HD terpolymerization . 
this paper presents data on difencholate of titanocene , new organotitanium coordination compound and its application to a polymerisation of styrene . the new complex was characterised by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and mass - spectrometry . the polymerisation of styrene was realised in tightly closed schlenk tubes under dry N atmosphere in the presence of methylaluminoxane as co-catalyst , providing the necessary [Al] / [Ti] ration of <nUm> . the samples of the polystyrene obtained having syndiotactic configuration structure were analysed by a set of different modern physico - chemical methods : gel - permeation chromatography , fourier transform IR - spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry . it was shown that new catalyst exceeds CpTiCl3 in several principal characteristics of the final polymer ( e.g. mw ) , whilst the latter compounds is one of the best known kaminsky - type species for styrene polymerisation . synthesis of new titanocene derivatives containing bicyclic voluminous frameworks of lateral ligands which impart to the coordination compound more stability in air and more solubility in non-polar organic media could be a possible alternative to rather popular but quite expensive idea to enhance the catalytic activity via synthesis of bridged metallocenes . 
A novel syndiotactic polystyrene-b-polypropene(sPS-b-PP)copolymer was synthesized in this laboratory with homgenous metallocene catalyst of η 5-cyclopentadienyltripropoxy titanium and MAO . the influence factor of monomers feed ratio , catalyst concentration , Al / Ti molar ratio and polymerization temperature on block copolymerization has been investigated . the copolymerization products were fractionated by succesive solvents extration with boiling butanone , boiling heptane and <nUm> ° C THF . the titled block copolymer with 20-30wt % percent of total product , chiefly existing in butanone soluble fraction , were isolated and characterized by 13C - NMR , FTIR , WAXD , DSC methods . 
the styrene polymerizations were carried out with the new dinuclear half - titanocenes , hexamethyltrisiloxanediylbis(cyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride ) ( 1 ) and pentamethylenediylbis ( cyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride ) ( 2 ) in the presence of a modified methylaluminoxane cocatalyst . the styrene polymerization behavior of the above dinuclear titanocene catalysts and the property of the obtained polystyrene ( PS ) were examined and compared with those of PS obtained by mononuclear CpTiCl3 . for a given polymerization condition , the catalyst activity was in the following order ; CpTiCl3 > <nUm> > <nUm> . the syndiotactic index ( SI ) of PS was dependent on the catalyst structure and decreased in the order of <nUm> > CpTiCl3 > <nUm> . the weight - average molecular weight ( mo ) of PS produced with dinuclear <nUm> and <nUm> was much higher than that of PS generated from mononuclear CpTiCl3 , and the polydispersity index ( mo / mn ) of the polymer by <nUm> and especially by <nUm> was larger than that of the polymer by CpTiCl3 . although the pentamethylene-bridged titanocene <nUm> exhibited higher activity and lower SI of PS than the hexamethytrisiloxane - bridged complex <nUm> , the mo and mo / mn of PS prepared with the dinuclear half - titanocene <nUm> were almost identical to those of PS with complex <nUm> . 
highly active syndiotactic - specific catalyst for the polymerization of styrene are obtained by mixing cp* TiMe <nUm> with [ ph 3C ] + [ B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - in the mole ratio <nUm> : <nUm> , producing <nUm> % syndiotactic PS at an activity of <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> gPS / molTi · h . treatment of [ cp* TiMe <nUm> ] with [ ph 3C ] +[B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - results in the formation of [ cp* TiMe <nUm> ] + [ B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - complex , which is a good source in solution of the cationic species [ cp* TiMe <nUm> ] + . both activity and syndiospecificity of the " cationic " catalyst are no less than the cp* TiMe <nUm> / MAO and cp* Ti(OPh) <nUm> / MAO catalysts , but are much more active than cp* TiMe <nUm> / MAO as well as cp* ClTi <nUm> / MAO . the cationic catalyst is a very effective catalyst precursor for the ziegler - natta polymerization of styrene to syndiotactic polystyrene at temperatures ≥ - <nUm> ° C , while the " cationic " contributes to promoting the polymerization of styrene to atactic polystyrene at temperatures ≤ - <nUm> ° C . the molecular weight ( m W ) of sPS increases with the decrease of the temperature , suggesting that lower temperature contributes to reducing the chain transfer and increasing the life of the active species for chain propagation . the T m of the sPS polymerized at - <nUm> - <nUm> ° C is almost constant . the styrene polymerization behaviors were essentially insensitive to the dielectric constant of the polymerization medium . 
metallocene / tetramethylaluminoxane ( MAO ) catalysts control the tacticity and the molecular weight and its distribution in the polymer . zirconocene and hafnocene catalysts copolymerize ethene with cyclic olefins such as norbornene and dimethanooctahydronaphthalene ( DMON ) to yield copolymers with the double bond , rather than the ring , opened to extend the chain . these products are atactic and have interesting properties . syndiotactic polystyrene , mp as high as <nUm> ° C , is another class of tailor - made ( titanocene / MAO ) - catalyzed polymers . with the fluorinated ( CpTiF3 ) substituted for the chlorinated ( CpTiCl3 ) titanocenes , the activity rose by a factor of <nUm> - <nUm> . the two types of polymers were studied with numerous metallocenes used as catalysts . nine metallocenes were used to study their activity in the copolymerization of ethylene with cycloolefins . the reactivities of comonomers were established in the ethylene - DMON systems catalyzed by zircono- and hafnocenes . titanocenes proved to be much more active than the systems involving alkoxy-derivatives Ti(OR)4 [14] . 
with mononuclear half - titanocenes such as CpTiCl3 , IndTiCl3 , Cp*TiCl3 and a siloxane - bridged dinuclear half - titanocene , Cl3Ti-CpSi(CH3)2-O-Si(CH3) 2-O-Si-(CH3)2Cp-TiCl3 cocatalyzed by modified methylaluminoxane , the copolymerization of styrene ( st ) with ethylene(E) , p-methylstyrene ( PMS ) and vinyl naphthalene ( VN ) was carried out , and copolymerization behavior as well as properties of the obtained polymer were examined for each catalyst . In copolymerization of st and e , the mixture of homopolymers , syndiotactic polystyrene and polyethylene , was obtained mainly with a less amount of copolymer , which intimated that these titanocenes are unsuitable for st / e copolymer preparation . by copolymerization of st with PMS , the copolymer was prepared with a enhanced catalyst activity . the melting temperature ( Tm ) and initial decomposition temperature ( tdi ) of copolymer decreased and the difference of Tm and tdi could be controlled with the amount of added PMS . for copolymerization of st and VN , the catalyst activity and Tm of copolymer decreased drastically even with a small amount of VN . 
1-Phenyl-1,4-pentanedione ( 3 ) is selectively converted to the corresponding fulvene - ketone ( 4 ) by treatment with cyclopentadiene in the presence of pyrrolidine . treatment with lithium dimethylcuprate results in selective CH3 - addition at the fulvene carbon and subsequent ring - closure reaction to give <nUm> , which in the presence of lithium diisopropylamide is rapidly dehydrated to yield the bicyclic fulvene <nUm> . its treatment with amalgamated calcium metal leads to reductive fulvene coupling and formation of the calcocene complex ( 10 ) of the substituted 7,7'-bi(tetrahydroindenyl) ligand . only the respective rac - isomer is obtained . hydrolysis of <nUm> followed by double deprotonation with butyllithium yields the corresponding 7,7'-bi(tetrahydroindenyl) dianion equivalent <nUm> . In tetrahydrofuran , <nUm> is cleaved at the 7,7'-linkage with formation of the " monomeric " disproportionation products 11-Li and 12-Li , and treatment of <nUm> with zirconium tetrachloride in THF leads back to the formation of the fulvene <nUm> . transmetalation to zirconium is , however , cleanly achieved when <nUm> is treated with donor - ligand - free Cl4Zr suspended in toluene . the corresponding diastereomerically pure rac-ansa-zirconocene dichloride <nUm> containing the ansa - bridge as part of the a-fused bi(tetrahydroindenyl) ligand system is obtained under these specific conditions . complex <nUm> was characterized by x-ray diffraction , and the outcome of the preliminary propene polymerization experiments is reported . 
reaction of methylaluminoxanes with CH3 and CD3 groups ( MAO and MAOd ) with the components of catalytic systems for a-olefin polymerization composed of Cp2ZrX2 [ x is Cl ( I ) or me ( II ) ] , (CpR)2ZrCl2 [ r is i-Pr ( III ) or t-Bu ( IV ) ] , Me2SiCp2ZrCl2 ( V ) , and EtInd2ZrCl2 ( VI ) was studied in toluene and toluene-d8 . based on the isotopic composition of produced methane , the following conclusions were made : ( 1 ) methane was formed mainly by the reaction of Me-Zr groups with hydrogen in the cp ring . In reactions II + MAO , a-elimination of me groups was also observed . ( 2 ) introduction of alkyl substituents into the cp ring and the presence of the CH2 bridge between indenyl ligands increase the mobility of hydrogen in aromatic rings and cause H-D exchange between CD3 and cp groups . ( 3 ) fast exchange of methyl groups between II and MAOd was observed . reactions I + MAO predominantly yielded Cp2ZrMeCl . methane is formed by the bimolecular reaction of zirconium alkyl derivatives in reactions I + MAO and II + MAO . high yields of methane that substantially exceeded the amount of the introduced Zr are indicative of restoration of Zr-Me bonds . under experimental conditions , the binuclear cations {[Cp3Zr2Me2X]-mCp}+ were formed as intermediates that are active methane generators . 
syndiospecific styrene polymerization promoted by mixtures of Cp*TiR3 ( r = CH3 , CH2Ph ) with MAO , BC18F15 , and CPh3B(C6F5)4 has been investigated by means of conventional kinetic methods . A first - order kinetics of the monomer in the propagation rate has been determined at <nUm> ° C . At polymerization temperatures higher than <nUm> ° C , the b-H migration from the growing polymer chain to the metal of the active species appears to be the main termination reaction . the average molecular weights of the polymer products depend on the type and coordinating behavior of the counterions ( [MAOX]- , [MeB(C6F5)3]- , [(PhCH2)B(C6F5)3]- ) . the trityl-activated catalysts produce sPS samples with the highest molecular weights . the comparison of the molar concentrations of the active species , determined by kinetic methods , with those of Cp*TiIIIR+ ( r = CH3 , CH2Ph ) evaluated in the polymerization conditions by ESR measurements , confirms the involvement of these complexes in syndioepecific styrene polymerization . 
two kinds of liquid crystalline ( LC ) titanocenes have been synthesized with an aim to construct a new type of anisotropic polymerization field . the titanocene derivatives were prepared by introducing LC groups into cyclopentadienyl ligands as substituents , (PCH506Cp)2TiCl2 ( 1 ) or coordinating them to titanium atom as ligands , cp 2Ti(PCH5060)2 ( 2 ) . observations of polarizing optical microscope and measurements of DSC indicated that <nUm> is the first titanium complex exhibiting a thermotropic LC phase . we found that both the titanocene derivatives can polymerize phenylacetylenes to give poly(phenylacetylene)s with an aid of triethylaluminium used as a cocatalyst . molecular weights and polymerization degrees of the polymers were comparable or superior to those by catalysts such as a titanocene dichloride [Cp2TiCl2] and a tetra-n-butoxytitanium [Ti(O-n-Bu)4] . the LC titanocene derivative ( 2 ) was also confirmed to have a high catalytic activity for acetylene polymerization . these results should shed light on development of novel anisotropic reaction field available for syntheses of directly aligned conducting polymers . 
A novel magnesium chloride supported titanocene catalyst was synthesized using a soluble tetrahydrofuran complex of magnesium chloride . the suported catalyst polymerized ethylene with high activities in presence of methylaluminoxane . the significant feature of the supported metallocene catalyst is that it shows high polymerization activity at low Al / Ti ratio and at higher temperatures compared to soluble catalyst . the role of support in stabilizing the active species on the metallocene is discussed . 
the isoselective propene polymerization using the supported catalyst O2Si / MAO / Me2Si(2-Me-Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl <nUm> / AlR3 was investigated and compared with propene polymerization using the corresponding homogeneous catalyst system . the influence of propene concentration , polymerization medium , temperature , comonomer , and external aluminium alkyls on polymerization kinetics and polypropene properties such as molecular mass , stereo- and regioselectivity , morphology , and bulk density was studied . 
for styrene polymerization initiated by using a half - sandwich titanocene catalyst such as cyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride ( CpTiCl3 ) , indenyltitanium trichloride ( IndTiCl3 ) or pentamethylcyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride ( Cp*TiCl3 ) with modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) cocatalyst , the effects of polymerization conditions on polymerization behavior and properties of polystyrene were examined . with increasing MMAO concentrations , the catalyst activity increased and the molecular weight ( MW ) of polystyrene ( PS ) decreased . the catalyst activity of Cp*TiCl3 increased up to <nUm> ° C , while CpTiCl3 and IndTiCl3 gave maximum catalyst activity at <nUm> and <nUm> ° C . MW and syndiotactic index ( SI ) of PS decreased with increasing polymerization temperature . the polydispersity of PS was less dependent on polymerization conditions . by increasing styrene concentration , the catalyst activity and MW of PS increased . for IndTiCl3 , the catalyst activity and MW of PS were promoted with a short aging time . irrespective to polymerization conditions , Cp*TiCl3 gave high catalyst activity and the obtained PS had high SI , MW , and melting temperature . 
the bridging of C2 - symmetric 8,10-dimethyltricyclo[5.2.2.02,6]-2,5-undecadiene ( DMeB - COCpH ) by silicon , methylene , and ethylene was investigated . the dimethylsilyl-bridged bis(BCOCp) ligand was accessible but could not be converted to its titanium , zirconium , or niobium chloride complexes . 8,10-Dimethyl-4-(1-methylethylidene)tricyclo[5.2.2.0 2,6]-2,5-undecadiene ( DMeBCOCp-dimethylfulvene ) was formed , but did not react with cyclopentadienyl anions . A regioisomeric mixture of 1,2-bis[(1R,7R,8R,10R)-8,10-dimethyltricyclo-[5.2.2.0 2,6]-2,5-undecadienyl]ethane [en(DMeBCOCpH)] ligands could be formed and metalated to form (+)-[ethylene-1,2-bis[e 5-(1R,7R,8R,10R)-8,10-dimethyltricyclo[5.2.2.0 2,6]-2,5-undecadien-4-yl]]titanium dichloride [ (+)-b,b-en(DMeBCOCp)2TiCl2 , (+)-11 ] along with its a,a- and a,b-bridged regioisomeric titanocene dichlorides . (+)-11 is unique in that it is a chiral ethylene-bridged ansa - metallocene which contains only homotopic cyclopentadienyl faces . (+)-11 was characterized by x-ray crystallography and was applied as a catalyst for the enantioselective isomerization of alkenes . (+)-11 was less active and less enantioselective than a known chiral ansa - bis(indenyl)titanium catalyst for the enantioselective alkene isomerization . 
Me2Si - bridged ansa - zirconocenes of interest for a-olefin polymerization catalysis are prepared in good yield by amine elimination reactions . the reaction of Me2Si(1-C5H4-3-t-Bu)2 ( 3 ) and Zr(NMe2)4 affords Me2Si(1-C5H3-3-tBu) 2Zr(NMe2)2 ( 4 ) in <nUm> % NMR yield ( rac / meso = <nUm> / <nUm> ) and pure meso-4 in <nUm> % isolated yield . the reaction of Me2Si(1-C5H3-2-Me-4-tBu)2 ( 6 ) with Zr(NMe2)4 affords Me2Si(1-C5H2-2-Me-4-tBu) 2Zr(NMe2)2 ( 7 ) in <nUm> % NMR yield ( rac / meso = <nUm> / <nUm> ) and pure rac-7 in <nUm> % isolated yield . the <nUm> / <nUm> rac-4 / meso-4 and <nUm> / <nUm> rac-7 / meso-7 ratios are the thermodynamic ratios , and the rac / meso isomerizations are catalyzed by NMe2H via reversible Zr-Cp bond aminolysis . the thermodynamic bias for meso-4 is ascribed to the ease of distortion of the metallocene framework of this diastereomer by a lateral deformation which reduces steric crowding between the amide ligands and the cp substituents . the reaction of <nUm> and Zr(NEt2)4 proceeds only in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at <nUm> ° C , affording Me2Si(1-C5H2-2-Me-4-tBu) 2ZrCl2 ( rac-1 ) in <nUm> % NMR yield ( rac / meso = <nUm> / <nUm> ) . the reaction of <nUm> and the piperidide complex C20H40N4Zr ( m-xylene , <nUm> ° C , <nUm> h ) affords rac-Me2Si-(1-C5H2-2-Me-4-tBu) 2Zr(NC5H10)2 ( rac-9 ) in <nUm> % NMR yield ( no meso detected ) and pure rac-9 in <nUm> % isolated yield . the reaction of <nUm> and the pyrrolidide complex C16H32N4Zr ( m-xylene , <nUm> ° C , <nUm> h ) affords Me2Si(1-C5H2-2-Me-4-tBu) 2Zr(NC4H8)2 ( 10 ) in <nUm> % NMR yield ( rac / meso = <nUm> / <nUm> ) and pure rac-10 in <nUm> % isolated yield . the molecular structure of rac-10 was determined by x-ray crystallography and exhibits severe crowding between the amide ligands and the cp substituents . treatment of rac-7 or rac-10 with Me3SiCl results in clean conversion to rac-1 without isomerization . 
the kinetics of polymethylalumoxane ( MAO ) and half titanocene complexes was investigated to understand their structures and behaviour during the syndiostatic polymerization of styrene and styrene-ethylene copolymers . results showed that the mixtures of half titanocene complexes with other cocatalysts prepared in toluene at room temperature , were only marginally active in syndiospecific styrene polymerization at temperatures lower than <nUm> ° C , indicating that propagation kinetic constants ( kp ) and / or the concentration of the active species were very small in that condition . the fast deactivation of the systems at temperatures higher than <nUm> ° C can be related to thermal decomposition of the active species . 
catalytic systems based on zirconocenes can produce polymers with an overall amount of regioirregular placements as high as 2-3 % . the higher regiospecifities of titanocene based , with respect to zirconocene based , catalytic systems has been accounted for by the large contributions of the non-bonded interactions , in favor of the monomer coordination suitable for the primary insertion when shorter Mt-C distances are involved . 
A quantum mechanical study on the feasibility of doubly bridged ansa - zirconocenes based on the norbornadiene skeleton is presented . the enantioselectivity for the propene polymerization by these zirconocenes both with C2 and Cs symmetry has been investigated by molecular mechanics analysis on models of catalytic intermediates corresponding to the monomer coordination step as well as on models of pseudotransition states relative to the possible monomer insertion reaction . according to our analyses , for suitable substitutions of the norbornadiene skeleton , the models are highly enantioselective . this suggests that both isotactic and syndiotactic polyolefins could be prepared by the corresponding catalytic systems . 
the titanocene vinylidene intermediate [ Cp*2Ti = C = CH2 ] ( 4 ) ( cp* , C2H3 ) , formed by ethylene or methane elimination from Cp*2TiCH2CH2C = CH2 ( 3 ) and Cp*2Ti(CH = CH2)(CH3) ( 11 ) , respectively , reacts with symmetrical alkynes such as acetylene ( 12a ) , 2-butyne ( 12b ) , 1,2-diphenylacetylene ( 12c ) , 1,2-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene ( 12d ) , and 1,2-bis(tri-n-butylstannyl)acetylene ( 12e ) by a [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition to give metallacyclobutenes Cp*2TiCR = CRC = CH2 ( 8a-e ) . when unsymmetrical alkynes are used , such as 2-pentyne ( <nUm> g ) , 2,4-hexadiyne ( <nUm> h ) , 1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiyne ( 13i ) , 1-phenyl-1-propyne ( 13j ) , or 1-(trimethylsilyl)-2-phenylacetylene ( 13k ) , different regioisomers can be isolated . for the reaction products of <nUm> with <nUm> g and 13j , kinetic and thermodynamic products can be distinguished . In reactions of 1-pentyne ( 13f ) and <nUm> , a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of the [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition product Cp*2TiCH = C(nPr)C = CH2 ( 17f ) and the alkyne C-H bond activation product , Cp*2Ti(CH = CH2)(C ≡ C-nPr ) ( 19f ) , is formed . by using stronger acidic acetylenes , like phenylacetylene ( 131 ) , or terminal acetylenes with bulky substituents , such as 2,2-dimethyl-3-butyne ( <nUm> m ) or (trimethylsilyl)acetylene ( 13n ) , the vinyl acetylides Cp*2Ti(CH = CH2)(C ≡ CR ) [ r = ph ( 19l ) , t-Bu ( <nUm> m ) , SiMe3 ( 19n ) ] are isolated in high yields . the structures of Cp*2TiC(CH3) = CH = CH2 ( 8b ) and Cp*2TiC(SiMe3) = C(Ph)C = CH2 ( 17k ) were determined . the pseudotetrahedral molecules contain planar cyclobutene rings . the x-ray structure of <nUm> is presented . the regioselectivity of the formation of <nUm> and its regioisomer <nUm> , using unsymmetrically substituted acetylenes , is attributed to the polarity of the C ≡ C bond , on the basis of 13C NMR data . the reactivity of the methylenetitanacyclobutenes depends on the substituents of the alkynes . the formation of trans-poly(acetylene) occurs via 8a with an excess of acetylene . analogous reactions of 8b,c and substituted alkynes are not successful . the isomerization of the titanacyclobutenes <nUm> → <nUm> indicates a cycloreversion . selective insertion reactions of 8b and 8c with C7H11N are observed in the CTi ( r ) = C ( r ) s-bond opposite the exo-methylene group , forming five - membered rings Cp*2TiC( = NC6H11)C ( r ) = C(R)C = CH2 [ r = me ( 25b ) , ph ( 25c ) ] . 
four new Cp*Ti compounds with ortho-substituted phenoxy ligands for the syndio- specific polymerization of styrene were prepared by the reaction of various kinds of ortho- substituted phenol with Cp*TiCl3 in the presence of triethylamine . their catalytic properties for syndiospecific polymerization of styrene were investigated at different AlMAO / Ti ratio , different AlTIBA / Ti ratio and different polymerization temperature . all four compounds in the presence of cocatalyst methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) showed good performance at lower concentrations of titanium , MAO , and TIBA . especially , ( Cp*Ti(OPhMe) <nUm> ) / MAO system afforded syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) with the highest activity and high molecular weight . 
A new mono-substituted titanocene , ( e5-cyclopentadienyl ) [ e5-(1-(4-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexyl) cyclopentadienyl]dichlorotitanium ( I ) , has been prepared via a novel modified synthesis , and its x-ray crystal structure has been determined . it crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with cell constants a = <nUm> <nUm> nm , b = <nUm> <nUm> nm , c = <nUm> <nUm> nm , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> . the I / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) catalyst system produces at different polymerization temperatures either an isotactic or a syndiotactic polypropylene , both of which have the combined influence of enantiomorphic - site control and chain - end control , or an atactic polypropylene controlled by bernoullian propagation mechanism . 
poly(methylsilane) and poly(vinylsilane) were synthesized using a titanocene catalyst , and their pyrolytic conversion to ceramics was followed using a combination of thermal analysis and infrared spectroscopy . the two polymers have distinctly different backbone structures , as determined by 29Si NMR ; methylsilane polymerizes to a polysilane , while vinylsilane polymers have a predominately polycarbosilane backbone , with some polysilane structure as well.The pyrolysis path and char yield were dependent primarily on backbone structure , with little influence of polymer molecular weight . the majority of the weight loss on conversion occurs below <nUm> ° C , although bond rearrangement continues to <nUm> ° C . poly(vinylsilane) produced a C - rich Si-C ceramic in which the carbon was dispersed on a sufficiently fine level to show resistance to oxidation on heating in air to <nUm> ° C . 
the present study reports the synthesis of titanium - containing polyethers employing the interfacial polymerization technique fo the purpose of evaluating the incorporation of various ` flexibilizing ' units on the products flexibility and solubility . the mass spectra of the products derived from PEG and Cp2TiCl2 were investigated . titanium - containing fragments were observed for the products . all of the group IVB metallocene polyethers have been insoluble in all tested liquids including the products described here . 
infrared and raman spectroscopies complement one another , both giving structural information associated with vibrational modes . As a general rule , mode assignments from small molecules can be used as guides in making IR and raman band assignments . the infrared and raman spectra of titanocene dichloride and squaric acid have been reported as well as other characterization data . it was our intention to employ IR and raman data in describing the structure of the condensation product of titanocene dichloride and squaric acid to evaluate the influence on the two moieties of being in a polymer chain . following is a brief description of the interpretation of the IR and raman spectra of the product in the mid-IR region . 
titanocene polymer derivatives with potential antitumor properties were synthesized by interfacial condensation . the preformed polymers used are PAA ( polyacrylic acid ) , CPSMA ( <nUm> : <nUm> alternating copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride ) and DVEMA ( <nUm> : <nUm> copolymer of divinyl ether and maleic anhydride ) . the ratio of practical and theoretical titanium content is <nUm> % , <nUm> % and <nUm> % for PAA , CPSMA and DVEMA polymer derivatives respectively . the IR spectra of the polymer derivatives possess the characteristic absorptions of titanocene . XPS ( x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ) of o1s and ti2p3 / <nUm> supports the existence of Ti-O bonding . 
organosilanes and germanes couple readily by H / / <nUm> elimination under the influence of titanocene and zirconocene - based catalysts . the characterization of the polymers and their functionalisation by hydrosilation are described . the current level of our understanding of the mechanisms of these reactions is discussed . 
the first condensation of this kind polymer containing the niobocene moiety was synthesized employing the classical interfacial polycondensation procedure in <nUm> % yield and with a high chain length of about <nUm> . vibrational spectroscopy shows bands from both reactants and the presence of bands assigned to the formation of the Nb-N and nb-0 bond . proton NMR shows bands from both the niobocene and acyclovir moieties with the expected shifts . MALDI MS results are consistent with the presence of niobocene and acyclovir with high mass ion fragments to two hundred units . chain session to create the ion fragment clusters occurs at heteroatoms . the stability of the polymer in solution was studied for a month where the chain length decreased to <nUm> . the molecular weight half life is relatively short , about <nUm> days , indicating that only freshly prepared samples should be used in biological testing . As the polymer is synthesized , fibers are spontaneously formed . the fibers have aspect ratios of <nUm> to <nUm> . ltd. 
this paper reviewed the studies on five types of non-chromium catalysts for ethylene trimerisation , including zirconium , vanadium , tantalum , titanium and nickel based catalysts in the light of the variety of the metallic elements in active center of the catalysts . the structural character of these catalysts , catalytic mechanism and reaction feature of ethylene trimerization in the presence of the catalysts were introduced . the effects of ligand structure , reaction temperature , pressure , cocatalyst amount on activity and selectivity towards 1-hexene of the catalysts were compared . the titanium - based catalyst exhibits outstanding behavior among the catalysts for its excellent selectivity towards 1-hexene as well as high activity ; however , a very large consumption of methylaluminoxane as its cocatalyst is considered as a shortcoming of the catalytic system . 
A coordination polymer based on zinc (II) and mixed ligands [Zn(oxa)(bbi)] n ( 1 ) ( oxa = oxalate anion , bbi = 1,1'-(1 , 4-butanediyl)bis ( imidazole ) ) , has been prepared and characterized by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . the structure of polymer <nUm> presents an unique two - dimensional ( 2D ) layer structure with ( 4,4 ) topology in the presence of meso-helical chains and a three - dimensional ( 3D ) network distorted with large channels . In addition , moderate fluorescent emission in the solid state at room temperature was observed in the Zn 1-containing polymeric compound <nUm> . and antimicrobial activity of the compound has been investigated . CCDC : <nUm> . 
highly efficient type I photoinitiators ( PI ) based on the silyl radical chemistry are reviewed here for free radical photopolymerization ( FRP ) or free radical promoted cationic photopolymerization ( FRPCP ) . the ability of these structures to initiate the polymerization of acrylates ( FRP ) or epoxy ( FRPCP ) monomers is presented here in detail . these compounds ( 10,10'-bis 10-phenyl-10H-phenoxasilin si-1 and 9,9'-dimethyl-9,9'-bis 9H-9-silafluorene si-2 ) and poly(methyl phenyl silane ) si-3 directly generate silyl radicals under light irradiation . A low oxygen inhibition in the photopolymerization is outlined . In any case , the silylium cations are the initiating species for the ring opening polymerization . A thermal redox process at RT between these organosilanes and oxidizing agents ( silver salts ) also generates initiating species for the cationic polymerization of epoxy monomers . the present results evidence the high potential of this new class of (photo)initiators based on organosilanes for the thermal redox or photoinitiated epoxy monomer polymerization . 
In this study , a class of bis-1,2-(4-aryl-2-alkyl-1H- inden-1-yl ) ethane was synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic methods such as 1HNMR , 13CNMR , melting point and FTIR . bis-1,2-(4-aryl-2-alkyl-1H- inden-1-yl ) ethane was synthesized by the reaction of butyllithium , arylindenes and dibromoethane in a facile , one - pot strategy . it 's shown that these methods have a wide scope to afford libraries of aryl-substituted indenes . the prepared compounds was then applied as a ligand for the fabrication of a number of metal complexes which can be used as catalyst for the polymerization of the olefins . 
A series of seven new complexes of zirconium and hafnium with bulky o-aryloxyalkyl substituted indenyl ligands were synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis . these complexes were activated with methylaluminoxane and tested for homogeneous ethylene polymerization . the zirconium catalysts showed higher activities than their hafnium analogues . the effects of increasing separation between the indenyl and the aryloxy substituent and the introduction of an extra methyl group on the indenyl moiety were also investigated . catalyst <nUm> bearing a spacer chain of three methylene groups between the indenyl and aryloxy substituents showed the highest activity ( <nUm> kg PE / mol cat . h ) . the increase in the spacer chain length resulted in the decrease in catalyst activities . 
group IVB metallocene polyethers containing the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol have been synthesized in moderate yield with chain lengths ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> employing the interfacial polycondensation procedure . infrared spectroscopy shows the absence of the O-H group and formation of the M-O linkage consistent with the formation of the polyether . F-MALDI MS results are consistent with the presence of metal - containing fragmentation clusters containing one and two metal atoms and ion fragments up to several hundred units long . the polymers all show moderate to good inhibition of a group of cancer cell lines including colon , breast , lung , and prostrate cell lines . the titanocene - containing polymer has significant CI50 values showing a preference to inhibit the cancer cell lines in preference to the WI-38 normal cell line . ltd. 
In this work , the boron ( B ) modification of MCM-41 - supported dMMAO / zirconocene catalysts showed a promising increase ( almost twice ) in catalytic activity in ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization . the enhanced activity can be attributed to the decreased interaction between the support and dMMAO with boron modification as was proved by TGA . it was proposed that boron acted as a spacer anchoring the support and dMMAO . however , at high boron loading ( ca. <nUm> wt % ) , the activity slightly decreased due to the migration of dMMAO into boron layer resulting in less surface concentration of [Al]dMMAO which was measured by XPS . the inhibition of chain transfer reaction during polymerization apparently occurred upon the boron modification providing higher MW polymer . it was also suggested that boron modification has rendered more uniform catalytic sites which was leading to narrower MWD of the polymer observed . based on 13CNMR , boron modification did not affect the microstructure of copolymers obtained . however , the insertion of 1-octene increased with boron modification probably due to decreased steric hindrance of the MCM-41 support . 
A review covers advances in research of ziegler - natta catalyst , metallocene catalyst , and non-metallocene single active site catalyst used in polymerization of propylene ; donor technology and process preparation process for ziegler - natta catalyst ; preparation of propylene homopolymer ; propylene living polymerization ; and prospect of the catalyst for propylene polymerization .

A number of seeds were treated with ppm amounts of kinetin and kinetin - containing polymers . the rate of seed germination was generally increased for the seeds that were treated in comparison to those seeds that were not treated . these increases in seed germination ranged to over seven fold . ltd. 
two C2 - symmetric metallocene catalysts in solution were exposed to light , and the rac - meso conversion followed by NMR spectroscopy . both exposed and unexposed catalyst solutions were used , in conjunction with a suitable cocatalyst , to polymerize propylene . the polymers were characterized with respect to their microstructure and fractionated according to crystallinity . the relationship between the catalyst isomerization and the polymer structure is illustrated . the effect of pre-activation of the catalyst before exposure to light was also studied and is reported on . 
the present study reveals some aspects on properties of polypropylene ( PP ) derived from the supported ziegler - natta ( ZN ) catalyst ( Cl2Mg / Cl4Ti / DEP ) and the supported metallocene ( MC ) catalyst ( OSi <nUm> / MAO / Et[lnd]2ZrCl2 ) . experimentally , PPs were produced using the supported ZN and MC catalysts as mentioned above by varying the conditions such as the polymerization temperatures , propylene pressure , and the [Al]cocatalyst / [Ti]ZN catalyst or [Zr] MC catalyst ratios . based on the study , it was found that activities , mmmm( % ) or isotactivity , and melting temperatures ( Tm ) apparently depended on the polymerization temperatures , propylene pressures , and [Al] cocatalyst / [Ti] or [Zr]catalyst ratios in different ways . the impact of each process variable on the properties of PP obtained was further discussed in more details . In general , it was found that the supported MC catalyst provided more active species compared to the supported ZN catalyst leading to higher activities . In particular , the PP produced from the supported MC catalyst also had high isotacticity , however , lower Tm compared to that produced from the supported ZN catalyst . it is worth noting that by changing those parameters , the properties of PP can be altered based on the nature behaviour of the two catalysts . As a matter of fact , the process variables can be chosen in order to achieve the desired properties of PP under the supported catalytic system . 
the demonstration of single - site control over polymer stereochemistry by C2 - symmetric ansatitanocene and zirconocene catalysts in <nUm> and <nUm> ushered in a new era in alkene polymerization catalysis.1,2 since then , a plethora of ansa - metallocene ligand designs have been developed for the purpose of controlling the stereochemistry and molecular weight of the polymer product and for increasing the activity of the catalyst . besides numerous ring substitution patterns as well as the replacement of one ring with another moiety ( such as an amide ligand ) , different types of bridges have been used to alter both the geometry and electronic properties of the ansa - metallocene . for the most part , these bridges have consisted of relatively inert carbon-or silicon - based moieties . apart from a few phosphorus-3,4 and arsenic5 - bridged ansa - zirconocene complexes , examples of heteroatombridged group <nUm> ansa - metallocenes were scarce until about a decade ago , when the potential of the heteroatom to expand the functionality of the ansa - metallocene ligand and increase its influence on the polymerization properties of the catalyst was recognized . ( note : the term “ heteroatom ” is DK3712 : “ dk3712_c005 ” - <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> - <nUm> : <nUm> - page <nUm> - # <nUm> generally associated with any p-block element other than carbon ; however , in this chapter it refers to any p-block element outside of group <nUm> . ) so far , only boron , phosphorus , and arsenic have served as single heteroatom bridges in group <nUm> ansa - metallocene complexes , probably owing to the greater synthetic accessibility of these systems . ansa - metallocenes with a single oxygen or nitrogen atom joining the p ligands have not been developed , although these atoms have been combined with one or two other heteroatoms6-9 or have been flanked by carbon and silicon to form the backbone of the bridge.10-15 this chapter will focus only on ansa - metallocenes containing heteroatoms within the backbone of the bridge . heteroatombridged half sandwich complexes of the “ constrained - geometry ” type , in which thep - ligand is linked to an amide ligand,16-18 are also outside the scope of this chapter . 
many academic and industrial researchers have probed the utility of group <nUm> and group <nUm> metallocenes as catalyst precursors for the polymerization of ethylene and a-olefins such as propylene.1-4 In particular , much emphasis has been placed on the use of an interannular bridge , or linking group , between the two cyclopentadienyl rings in these metallocenes . these complexes are known as ansametallocenes , a term that brintzinger introduced in his landmark work in this field.5 the term ansa ( latin , for “ bent handle ” ) may be used to describe metallocenes with either one or two interannular bridges ( figure <nUm> ) . 
polypropylene ( PP ) is one of the most highly utilized engineering plastics , with production in the united states and canada of over <nUm> million metric tons in <nUm> the starting material for PP , propylene , can be transformed into polymers with a range of physical properties by adjusting the relative stereochemistry of the pendant methyl groups on the polymer backbone . for instance , when the DK3712 : “ dk3712_c001 ” - <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> - <nUm> : <nUm> - page <nUm> - # <nUm> methyl groups are placed in a stereorandom configuration , the resulting polymer , known as atactic polypropylene , is amorphous and lacks crystallinity . the vast majority of polypropylene sold is isotactic polypropylene ( iPP ) , a resin valued for its strength , toughness , chemical and heat resistance , and processability . the highly stereoregular structure of iPP , in which the pendant methyl groups reside on the same side of the polymer chain , imparts a crystalline structure to the polymer and allows the material to have a high melting point ( 160-165 ° C ). <nUm> A versatile plastic , iPP can be found in a wide range of applications from packaging to fibers to containers . commercial , highly crystalline iPP is largely synthesized using traditional heterogeneous ziegler - natta catalysis , but the advent of homogeneous group <nUm> metallocenes has enabled polyolefin producers to access a wider range of polymer microstructures and properties . the mechanism of stereoselective polymerization by these catalysts is now well understood ; the issues of stereocontrol and influence of the metallocene catalyst structure on the propylene polymerization behavior have been discussed in detail in earlier reviews.4-6 excellent review articles are also available on the synthesis of chiral group <nUm> metallocenes.7,8 this chapter will introduce some fundamental aspects of metallocenecatalyzed propylene polymerization , discuss the details of how the C2 - symmetry of the catalyst is exploited in the synthesis of iPP , and then survey the general ligand structures that are commonly encountered . 
metallocenes based on group <nUm> metals were first synthesized by wilkinson et al. in <nUm> ; <nUm> however , the great utility of these compounds as catalyst precursors for the stereoselective polymerization of a-olefins was not realized until the mid-1980s when two key discoveries were made . the first of these was the discovery that alkyl substituents placed on the cyclopentadienyl framework of the metallocene can significantly influence the performance and behavior of the catalyst.2 the second was the discovery that enantioselectivity in the insertion step of an a-olefin polymerization could result if one made metallocene catalysts with the appropriate chirality and stereorigidity.3 . 
tailoring polymer properties such as stiffness , strength , or processing requires control of the molecular architecture of the polymers . for the polymerization of olefins like propylene , the development of metallocene catalysts gives access to new polymer microstructures . during the last decade , major advances have been made in metallocene catalysis for polypropylenes , providing higher levels of control over composition , molecular mass distributions , and stereoregularity . this leads to a large variety of polypropylenes with varying types and degrees of stereoregularity,1-4 from amorphous or low - crystallinity types to highly stereoregular ones such as isotactic and syndiotactic polypropylene.4 owing to the regular arrangement of methyl groups , these stereoregular polypropylenes are semicrystalline materials with melting points above <nUm> ° C exhibiting typical thermoplastic deformation behavior ( thermoplast , figure <nUm> ) , but isotactic and syndiotactic polypropylene differ in elastic modulus and impact strength.5 In atactic polypropylenes , the statistically random arrangement of the methyl groups prevents crystallization . therefore , atactic polypropylenes are soft , amorphous polymers ranging from oils to soft , waxy materials ( wax , figure <nUm> ). <nUm> . 
stereoblock polypropylenes are complicated , intriguing , and challenging polymers . it may be worthy to open this chapter by recalling that , according to the IUPAC glossary of basic terms in polymer science,1 a block is “ a portion of a macromolecule comprising many constitutional units , that has at least one feature which is not present in the adjacent portions ” ; a block macromolecule is “ a macromolecule which is composed of blocks in linear sequence ” ; a stereoblock macromolecule is “ a block macromolecule composed of stereoregular , and possibly non-stereoregular , blocks. ” on paper , applying these definitions to propylene polymers is straightforward with the notable exception of the “ stereoblock - isotactic ” case , which will be discussed specifically in the last part of this section . on the other hand , demonstrating that these structures exist for a real polypropylene sample is a formidable microstructural problem ; in fact , of the many cases claimed in the scientific and patent literature , those rigorously proven to be stereoblock polypropylenes can be counted on the fingers of one hand . 
metallocene / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and other single site catalysts for olefin polymerization have opened a new field of synthesis in polymer chemistry.1-3 strained cyclic olefins such as cyclobutene , cyclopentene , norbornene ( NB ) , and their substituted compounds can be used as monomers and comonomers in a wide variety of polymers.4 much interest is focused on norbornene homo-and copolymers because of the easy availability of norbornene and the special properties of their polymers . norbornene can be polymerized by ring opening metathesis polymerization ( ROMP ) , giving elastomeric materials,5 or by double bond opening ( addition polymerization ) . homopolymerization of norbornene by double bond opening can be achieved by early and late transition metal catalysts , namely Ti , Zr , hf,6-8 ni,9,10 and pd11-13 ( scheme <nUm> ) . 
group <nUm> metallocene has gained more attention recently as a potential catalyst for ring - opening polymerization of lactones . introduction of a silicon - bridge and / or modifications of biscyclopentadiene ( cp < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) ligand with different p-ligands such as bisindene ( ind < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ) , mixed indene / cyclopentadiene ( CpInd ) or mixed uorene / cyclopentadiene ( CpFlu ) have been found to significantly help improve catalyst activities , polymer yields and molecular weight . In order to relate the silicon bridge ( B ) and p-ligand ( L ) effects with the catalyst activities , molecular structures and properties of those bridged dimethylzirconocene complexes as well as their insertion behaviors with e-caprolactone were investigated by using the density functional theory method . calculations showed that different p-ligands had a profound effect on the electronic geometries and related properties of the title complexes . all bridged catalysts were geometric constraints compared to the unbridged catalysts . the HOMO-LUMO gap and dipole moments were decreased as the large p-ligands were introduced ( cp < inf > <nUm> < / inf > > CpInd > ind < inf > <nUm> < / inf > > CpFlu ) . only Si and Zr atoms were observed to carry a positive charge with Si having the most . for the monomer - inserted complexes , most catalyst structures shared the same orientation of e-caprolactone with its ester group pointing away from a methyl group of Zr atom , except the catalyst with ind < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ligand due to steric hindrance . A planar conformation of the monomer was observed in all catalysts and , hence , is required for each insertion . the data provide a structural basis for both inactivated and activated bridged-dimethylzirconocene complex catalysts with different p-ligands , which will be helpful for further studies on the lactone polymerization initiated by group <nUm> metallocene . 
atactic polystyrene , as an amorphous material , has been known for centuries . In principle , polystyrene can occur with atactic , isotactic , and syndiotactic configurations . with the extensive studies concerning the stereoselective polymerization of olefins by ziegler - natta catalyst systems discovered DK3712 : “ dk3712_c014 ” - <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> - <nUm> : <nUm> - page <nUm> - # <nUm> in the early 1950s , the first stereoregular polystyrene , isotactic polystyrene ( iPS ) , was obtained by natta using the Cl4Ti / AlEt3 system in <nUm> iPS is a semicrystalline polymer that has a high melting point , Tm = <nUm> ° C.2 several companies have tried to commercialize iPS , but its crystallization rate is too slow to be practical in industrial processes . 
we investigated copolymerization of propylene and allylmercaptan as a commercially available sulfur containing monomer . after protection of mercapto group with alkylaluminum , the copolymerization was conducted by isotactic ansa - zirconocene / methylaluminoxane catalysts . polypropylene containing sulfur was obtained with triisobutylaluminum - protected allylmercaptan monomer , while the no polymer was obtained with trimethylaluminum - protected allylmercaptan . structure of the products was investigated by NMR and GPC , and it was revealed that end sulfurizated polymer was mainly produced .

organic - inorganic hybrid ( SAV ) supported zirconocene was synthesized and its catalysis on ethylene polymerization was examined . the SAV was synthesized by copolymerization of 4-vinylpyridine with vinyl silica monomer ( SA ) , which was modified by reacting silica with allyltrimethoxysilane ( APS ) . after treated by MAO , the SAV was reacted with Cp2ZrCl2 to form organic - inorganic hybrid supported metallocene . the chemical structure and the composition of SA and SAV have been characterized by solid - state <nUm> C - NMR , XPS , and elemental analysis ( EA ) . the SAV supported zirconocene catalyst was effective in ethylene polymerization at a relatively low MAO level ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) giving higher activity than that supported by O2Si . 
In the last half decade , living coordination - insertion polymerization of olefins over ziegler - natta catalyst has emerged as a powerful tool for synthesis of advanced polymers with new structures . materials prepared by this method ranged from simple homopolymers , such as linear , branched , isotactic or syndiotactic polypropylenes , to various kinds of block copolymers and end - functionalized polymers . A review covers the recent developments in this rapidly growing research area , covering the fields of organometallic chemistry , polymer chemistry and material science ; and ligand and catalyst design , as well as the polymer properties prepared by such living polymerization . 
A series of heterogeneous catalysts with Cp2TiCl2 supported on palygorskite were prepared and evaluated by ethylene slurry polymerizations . the so - called direct supported catalyst , for which the pretreatment of palygorskite with MAO or Al(i-Bu)3 was not necessary , gave the highest activity among these supported catalysts and could be more robust than homogeneous Cp2TiCl2 . with the direct supported catalyst , no significant activity loss was observed under low Al / Ti molar ratios ( Al / Ti = <nUm> ) and the decay of polymerization rate was slower when compared to the other supported catalysts . it was found that the surface lewis acidity of palygorskite after thermal treatment played an important role in activation of metallocene compound and resulted in high catalyst activity .

homogeneous single site catalysts have dominated the research interest in olefin polymerization over the past <nUm> years . sinn and kaminski1 started this trend with the discovery that methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) activates group IV transition metal catalysts . the ability to control regio- and stereochemistries , and comonomer content and distribution are some of the important advantages that metallocene catalysts afford in the polymerization process . A current goal is the reduction of the necessary amount of cocatalyst , typically methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , since its high cost and the large amounts needed at industrial scale are a barrier to making metallocene systems cost effective with respect to ziegler - natta catalysts2 . In this paper , we study the effect of MAO on reaction rate , molecular weight and polymer microstructure in the slurry polymerization of isotactic polypropylene . the active catalyst is a cationic species generated in an equilibrium reaction between a zirconocene dichloride catalyst and MAO . increasing concentrations of MAO shift the equilibrium to the formation of the activated complex . thus , catalyst activity increases with increasing MAO / Zr ratio3,4 . In addition , MAO in solution contains residual trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) in a typical concentration of <nUm> % wt . it is known that TMA can act as a chain transfer agent leading to the formation of an isobutyl-terminated chain and liberation of the activated complex5 . In conditions where chain transfer to TMA becomes a competitive process with respect to the other chain transfer reactions , increasing amounts of MAO reduce the molecular weight . slurry polymerizations of propylene were carried out using rac-ethylene-bis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride / MAO as the catalyst system . polymerizations were performed at <nUm> ° C in a <nUm> mL state - of - the - art semi-batch reactor . the effect of MAO / Zr ratio on the rate of reaction , molecular weight and polymer microstructure was explored in order to allow the chain transfer reaction to TMA to be included in our previously developed kinetic model6 . an exhaustive analysis of end - groups of the polymer chains by 1H and 13C NMR was performed to gain understanding of the chain transfer mechanisms . our kinetic model for the homopolymerization of propylene is developed to predict rate of reaction , molecular weight distribution and percentage of unsaturated end - groups of the polymer6 . it is characterized by : ( 1 ) non-instantaneous initiation by insertion of the first monomer molecule ; ( 2 ) propagation by <nUm> insertion producing a regioerror that lowers the molecular weight through competing chain transfer reactions ; ( 3 ) chain transfer to TMA ; and ( 4 ) catalyst deactivation to account for decreasing catalyst activity with time . the estimation of kinetic rate constants was performed using a systematic optimization approach involving on - line measurements of the reaction rate and end - of - batch measurements of molecular weight distribution and polymer end - groups . A least - square objective function was defined to minimize the difference between the experimental measurements and the model predictions . the minimization was performed subject to constraints imposed by the kinetic model equations . these constraints were posed as a set of nonlinear algebraic equations generated by applying temporal discretization techniques to the dynamic model . this presentation will focus on the experimental and modeling results obtained with the rac-ethylene-bis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride / MAO catalyst system . the ultimate goal of this research is to develop a chemically based kinetic model that can be extensible to a number of single - site metallocene catalyst systems . to accomplish this goal , research work with the catalysts rac-dimethylsilylbis(2-methyl-4-phenyl-indenyl) Cl2Zr and rac-ethylene-bis ( 4,7-dimethyl-1-indenyl ) Cl2Zr is underway . the former species is highly active and stereoselective , while the later species produces isotactic polypropylene with a high frequency of regioirregular <nUm> insertions . our current work with these catalyst systems will be described in the presentation .

ionic and covalent derivatives of the chlorine analogue of the nonbasic , weakly coordinating triflate ion , CCl3O3S - or " trichlate " ion , have been prepared and compared with the corresponding more strongly coordinated chloroacetates , ClxCH 3-xCO2M ( x = 1-3 ) , using 35Cl NQR ( nuclear quadrupole resonance ) spectroscopy . the 35Cl NQR frequencies of all types of derivatives are sensitive to the nature of the metal ion or lewis acid and are most sensitive in the case of monochloroacetates . In covalent ( including zirconocene ) derivatives , the average NQR frequencies fall as the pauling electronegativity of m falls . the results for ionic derivatives contrast with previous results for ionic hexachlorometalates : the average 35Cl NQR frequencies drop sharply as the ionic radius of the group <nUm> cation increases . ab initio gaussian <nUm> computations at the B3LYP / 6-311++G(3df,3pd) level on isolated XCH2CO2M ( m = Li , Na , K ; x = F , Cl ) molecules duplicate this trend , showing increasing polarization of the C-Cl bond and smaller electric field gradients for larger group <nUm> ions ; the relevance of this to the solid state polymerization of chloroacetates ( herzberg , O. ; epple , M. eur. J. inorg. chem. <nUm> , 1395-1406 ) is discussed . we have prepared the dihydrate and monohydrate of trichlic acid , CCl3HO3S . although trichlates have the highest average NQR frequencies of any of these salts , the NQR frequencies of trichlic acid dihydrate are anomalously lower than those of trichloroacetic acid , which suggests that it is a strong acid , ionized in the solid state to H 5O2 + and CCl3O3S - ions .

this paper reviewed the studies on five types of non-chromium catalysts for ethylene trimerisation , including zirconium , vanadium , tantalum , titanium and nickel based catalysts in the light of the variety of the metallic elements in active center of the catalysts . the structural character of these catalysts , catalytic mechanism and reaction feature of ethylene trimerization in the presence of the catalysts were introduced . the effects of ligand structure , reaction temperature , pressure , cocatalyst amount on activity and selectivity towards 1-hexene of the catalysts were compared . the titanium - based catalyst exhibits outstanding behavior among the catalysts for its excellent selectivity towards 1-hexene as well as high activity ; however , a very large consumption of methylaluminoxane as its cocatalyst is considered as a shortcoming of the catalytic system .

group <nUm> lewis acids have long played a leading role as catalysts in organic synthesis , extending from the discovery of AlCl3 - catalysis by friedel and crafts in <nUm> through the aufbau - synthesis of unsolvated aluminum alkyls from ethylene by ziegler in <nUm> and culminating in the discovery of poly(methylaluminoxane) ( MAO ) cocatalysis of olefin polymerization by sinn and kaminsky in <nUm> . In our current work we present how electronic and steric contributions of the ligands attached to the particular group <nUm> metal can modulate the resultant lewis acidity . the inherent lewis acidity of the group <nUm> metal center itself is further dependent upon the extent that its available npz - orbital might interact with adjacent unshared or pi-electrons of the ligand system . In order to evaluate the effect of such electronic factors on their lewis acidity , both a series of bidentate group <nUm> organoboron and organoaluminum candidate acids , as well as their antiaromatic metallole analogs , have been synthesized by exchange reactions between the corresponding organotin compound and the appropriate metal halide . their lewis acidity has been evaluated based upon their efficacy as a cocatalyst with titanocene(IV) methyl chloride or titanocene(IV) dichloride in effecting the polymerization of ethylene .

A trivalent half - titanocene complex [ Me2(3-'Bu-2-MeO-5-MeC6H2) Si(CpMe4)]TiCl3 ( 5b ) were synthesized and used as olefin polymerization catalysts . In ethylene and 1-hexene copolymerization , both Ti (III) and Ti(IV) complex catalysts showed good activity and good comonomer reactivity . A big difference in the polymerization behavior between these catalysts was due to a difference of stability of active species . although the rate of polymerization with Ti(IV) catalyst quickly decreases . Ti (III) catalyst showed a constant activity during polymerization . Ti (III) catalyst also gave high molecular weight polypropylene , polybutadiene , and poly(ethylene-co-5-hexen-1-01) . 
In order to compare with silylene-bridged group <nUm> metallocenes . C2 symmetric dimethylgermylene-bridged zirconocene and hafnocene dichlorides were prepared and employed as the catalyst for polymerization of propylene in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . germylene-bridged metallocenes always produced isotactic polypropylene of higher molecular weight than that produced by silylene-bridged analogues . the molecular structures of four metallocenes prepared from dimethylsilylene and germylenebis(2,3,5-trimethylcyclopentadienyl) were determined by x-ray diffraction and showed no substantial differences of geometry between silylene- and germylene-bridged ones . 
A group <nUm> metallocene complex that serves as olefin polymerization catalyst was tethered on a solid support such as silica gel by covalent bonds .

the sequential homo- and copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene and 1-octene initiated by Cp2ZrCl2-methylaluminoxane and C2H4[Ind]2ZrCl2-methylaluminoxane homogeneous catalysts yielded reactor mixtures based on HDPE and different amounts of ethylene copolymers with these olefins . the composition and properties of polymeric products formed at the stage of copolymerization are independent of the preliminary homopolymerization of ethylene . the components of the reactor mixtures are capable of cocrystallization directly in the course of synthesis . the synthesized reactor mixtures based on HDPE and ethylene-1-hexene copolymers which surpass linear LDPE in tensile strength possess good plastic properties and a high melt flow index . 
the synthetic zeolites are characterized by a great variety of structures and compositions , as well as by the different adsorption ability to ions , clusters and the transition metal complexes . therefore they are interesting as supports for heterogenization of the olefin polymerization catalysts . In addition the natural zeolites due to their considerable content in nature and low cost may be used as fillers for the polymer composite materials . the immobilized metalcomplex catalysts of olefin ( ethylene and propylene ) polymerization have been developed on the base of zeolites . In order to prepare these catalysts , the anchored aluminoxanes have been synthesized by reaction of aluminum alkyls ( AlMe3 , AlEt3 and AliBu3 ) with water contained in intracrystalline cavities and pores of zeolites ( NaY , NaZSM-5 , HZSM-5 , NH4ZSM-5 , mordenite and clinoptilolite - bearing tuff ) . these aluminoxanes , with zirconocenes , vanadium chlorides and other transition metals , form the heterogenized complexes that are active in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene without addition of other organoaluminum cocatalysts . the nature of zeolites used as a support , determines the content of zeolite water and affects the formation of anchored aluminoxanes and activity of immobilized catalysts . polyolefins prepared with the immobilized on zeolites zirconocene catalysts demonstrate higher molecular mass and a wider molecular - mass distribution than those of corresponding homogeneous catalysts . the stereoselectivity of supported catalysts depends on the composition , structure of metallocenes and on the zeolite nature . the new composite materials on the base of ultrahigh-molecular-mass polyethylene UHMPE and natural zeolites were developed . the synthesis of composites was carried out by ethylene polymerization on the catalytically activated surface ofzeolite fillers . depending on the amount of zeolite filler in the UHMPE matrix such compositions can be used as wear - resistant , impact - resistant materials for production of units working in conditions of dry friction at high loading or as organomineral ion - exchange sorbents for water purification from radionuclides and heavy metal ions . 
the activity of a MgCl2(THF)2 / MAO / Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst was studied in copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene in relation to Al : Zr mole ratio ( 1500-7000 at <nUm> ° C ) , experimental temperature ( 20-70 ° C ) , and time ( 20-90 min at <nUm> ° C ; 10-55 min at <nUm> ° C ) .

the influence of the activation procedure applied to a metallocene on its catalytic behavior in ethylene polymerization is discussed and the effect of the zirconocene / activator nature on the properties of PE is demonstrated . MAO and TIBA / CPh <nUm> B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> are intercompared as cocatalysts . the catalytic behavior and the kinetics of ethylene polymerization catalyzed by TIBA / CPh <nUm> B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> - activated metallocene complexes allowed to infer that , in ternary catalytic systems with dichloride precatalysts , TIBA acts not only as an impurity scavenger or simply an alkylating agent , but also as a cocatalyst giving rise to heteronuclear cationic species providing lower chain propagation and chain transfer rates than those generated upon MAO action . when activated with TIBA / CPh <nUm> B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> dichloride zirconocenes were moderately active as compared with MAO and yielded EsP of considerably higher m . A halide or alkyl ligand present in the outer coordination sphere of active sites affects considerably both the catalytic performance of active species and the properties of the resulting PE . the Cl - keeping Al - Zr heteronuclear active sites give rise to high-M linear PE ; alkyl holders are highly capable of chain propagation and chain transfer to monomer . the high reactivity of the Zr - Cl bond in the latter active sites manifests itself also in the high ability to incorporate alfa - olefins to yield PE chains containing branches with <nUm> - <nUm> incorporated ethylene units . 
propylene / ethylene copolymers were prepared over two complex catalyst systems : ( i ) an AlEt3 - activated Cl2Mg - supported titanium catalyst Cl4Ti / Cl2Mg with dibutyl phthalate and propyltrimethoxysilane used as respectively internal and external donors and ( ii ) two methylaluminoxane (MAO)-activated , unsupported zirconocene catalyst systems differing in indenyl ligand structure , viz. , Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 and [Me2Si(4-Ph-2-Et-Ind)2]ZrCl2 ( rac : meso = <nUm> : <nUm> ) . the olefins were copolymerized ( table <nUm> ) in liquid propylene at <nUm> - <nUm> ° C at constant ethylene overpressures ( above C3 pressure ) varying over <nUm> to <nUm> atm corresponding to ethylene concentrations of <nUm> to <nUm> mol / L in the liquid phase . the copolymers contained 1.6-18 % of C2 mers . catalyst activity ( fig. <nUm> ) and kinetics of copolymerization ( fig. <nUm> ) were studied and the microstructure , molecular weight characteristics ( table <nUm> ) and mechanical properties ( tables <nUm> , <nUm> ) of the resulting copolymers were determined . IR spectra ( recorded , not included ) are discussed . the comonomer reactivity coefficients were evaluated for the copolymerizations run over the three catalytic systems . 
A new polymer - supported metallocene catalyst has been prepared . the polymer - supported metallocene displayed considerably high activity in ethylene polymerization , the highest being <nUm> x <nUm> <nUm> gPE / molZr*h , the molecular weight of the polyethylene produced was Mn = <nUm> x <nUm> <nUm> , about 3-4 times those of corresponding homogeneous zirconocenes . the polymer - supported metallocene keeps the characteristics of homogeneous metallocene catalysts , and offers some features,such as adaptable to gas phase and slurry processes ; easy to prepare in low cost ; relatively high activity and lower MAO / Zr ratio ; lower inorganic residues in the polyolefins as compared to cases of OSi <nUm> Al <nUm> O <nUm> or ClMg <nUm> ; unitary active structure , no complex surface as with OSi <nUm> ; good control of morphology of the resulting polymer . 
the polymerization of ethylene using supported zirconocene catalysts with varying support compositions SiO2-MAO-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 + TIBA ( catalyst I ) and MgCl2-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 + TIBA ( catalyst II ) ( MAO is methylaluminoxane , ind is indenyl , and TIBA is triisobutylaluminum ) was studied . the examined catalytic systems differ in their activity , ability to control the molecular mass of the resulting polymer , and kinetics of copolymerization with 1-hexene . the molecular structure of PE prepared with supported catalysts I and II and a homogeneous catalyst Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 + MAO was studied by IR and 13C NMR spectroscopy . As evidenced by 13C NMR spectroscopy , PE samples synthesized with the homogeneous catalyst and catalyst I contain ethyl branches along with the end methyl groups in the low-molecular-mass fractions . on the contrary , PE prepared with supported catalyst II is devoid of ethyl branches but contains vinyl groups as the basic type of unsaturation . 
the complex polymorphic behaviour of four syndiotactic polypropylene ( sPP ) samples have been analysed by means of DSC and WAXD techniques . two samples ( sPP1 , sPP2 ) were synthesised via metallocene polymerization by using the ansa - zirconocene ph 2C(Cp)(9-Flu)ZrCl <nUm> as catalyst . finally , two additional specimens with different molar masses ( sPP1 - fr1 , sPP1 - fr2 ) were prepared from the most syndiotactic sPP1 sample by temperature gradient extraction . the WAXD analysis shows that together with the orthorhombic form I , form II can coexist in a variable but small proportion depending on both the chain features and the processing conditions . the relative contribution of the disordered and the ordered types of form I is also dictated by molar mass , configurational microstructure as well as processing conditions . the observed changes in the thermal properties as measured by DSC and in the mechanic - dynamical relaxations of the samples , on slowing the crystallisation rate down , can be rationalised in terms of two concurrent processes , namely the perfection undergone by the crystals and the segregation of the amorphous phase . 
the asymmetric ansa - ligand precursors (C5Me4H)SiMe2(C5H4R) ( r = H ( 1 ) , me ( 2 ) , SiMe3 ( 3 ) , < Pr ( 4 ) ) and their lithium derivatives [Me2Si(C5Me4)(C5H3R)]Li2 ( r = H ( 5 ) , me ( 6 ) , SiMe3 . , ( 7 ) , ' Pr ( 8 ) ) have been prepared . the cmsa - niobocene imido complexes [ Me2Si( ? / 5-C5Me4)( ? ; 5.C5H3R)]Nb( = N'Bu)Cl ( r = H ( 9 ) , me ( 10 ) , SiMe3 ( 11 ) , ' Pr ( 12 ) ) were synthesized by the reaction of nb( = N'Bu)Cl3(py)2 with [Me2Si(C5Me4)(C5H3R)]Li2 in THF . the tmsa-zirconocene complexes [ Me2SiO;5-C5Me4)0 / 5-C5H3R)]ZrCl2 ( r = H ( 13 ) , me ( 14 ) , SiMe3 ( 15 ) , ' Pr ( 16 ) ) were prepared by the reaction of ZrCLj and the corresponding lithiated cmsa - derivative . the molecular structures of <nUm> , and <nUm> were determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies . preliminary results for the catalytic activity of 13-16 in the polymerization of ethylene are reported . 
the activity and stability of zirconocene catalysts immobilized on magnesium chloride modified with an organoaluminum compound AlR3 ( r = me or et ) were studied in the polymerization of ethylene ( tables <nUm> , <nUm> ) . an original method was used to introduce a lewis internal base into the magnesium support . trace amounts of water present in magnesium chloride were assumed to react with the organoaluminum compound to produce on the surface of the chloride an alkylaluminoxane [R2AlOAlR2] with the basic centers functioning as a lewis internal base . the resulting support was used to immobilize a zirconocene compound which , when activated with MAO , became a very active complex catalyzing the polymerization of ethylene at a constant rate ( <nUm> kg PE / g Zr · h ) . catalytically active centers were found to occur in the solvent solution only ( and not on the solid support surface ) at a concentration found to be nearly equal to that of water in the magnesium chloride . the ethylene polymerization kinetics studied with two catalysts systems prepared and the physical and mechanical property data measured for the resulting PE ( table <nUm> ) allowed to infer the highly stable zirconocene homogeneous catalyst system to have magnesium atom incorporated into the following structure [ ClMgOAlR2 / Cp2ZrCl2 ] . the modifier AlR3 was found to affect the physical and mechanical properties of the resuiting PE ( table <nUm> ) . 
ethylene was sequentially homopolymerized ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> - <nUm> min ) and copolymerized ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> - <nUm> min ) with 1-hexene or 1-octene over a Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO or a C2H4(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst in toluene as solvent ; a-olefin conversions were <nUm> - <nUm> mol % . the preliminary homopolymerization of ethylene was found to affect only slightly the composition and the MW and MWD property data of the resulting ethylene-hexene ( CEH ) and ethylene-octene ( CEO ) copolymers . HDPE / CEH and HDPE / CEO reactor mixtures ( RM ) were synthesized , containing various proportions of the copolymers ( table <nUm> ) . the RM components were found to cocrystallize during the polymerization process . mechanical property data were determined for pure and for modified HDPE ( table <nUm> ) . with the copolymer endowed with desired properties and introduced into HDPE in an appropriate amount , high - strength and simultaneously high - MFR materials can be prepared . 
A MgCl2(THF)2 support modified by organoaluminum chloride or MAO enabled us to obtain specially active zirconocene catalyst systems for ethylene polymerization . the zirconocene system on the bimetallic support was found to be the more active than that on the monometallic support . two kinds of catalytic active sites were found to exist in the supported zirconocene catalyst : unstable active sites that become deactivated during the polymerization of ethylene , and very stable catalytic centers created in the olefin environment . the kinetic investigations on the ethylene polymerization allowed to suggest the reason underlying the creation of the stable active sites . 
the effect of support type on the activity of zirconocene - triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) systems was studied in the polymerization of propylene , and on the properties of the resulting PP . three zirconocenes were used : Me2SiInd2ZrX2 ( x = Cl or me ) and Ph2CCpFluZrCl2 ; and three supports were used : ( i ) O2Si ( spec , area ssp , = <nUm> m2 / g ) ; ( ii ) SiO2-gr-PAAc [ i.e. O2Si modified with poly(acrylic acid ) by radiative grafting ] ; ( iii ) PE-gr-PAAc ( i.e. functionalized by radiative grafting , ssp = <nUm> m2 / g ) . propylene was polymerized in , the liquid monomer . the supports were made to react with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and the product was used to immobilize a zirconocene compound to produce a supported catalyst . with TIBA as cocatalyst , the resulting PP constituted a replica of catalyst particles ; the bulk density of PP was high , up to <nUm> g / cm3 . As the Zr content in the catalyst was increased , the specific productivity ( g PP / g catalyst ) rose to attain a maximum , characteristic for a given support . catalyst activity and m of PP were studied in relation to TIBA concentration . the type of MAO - modified support had little effect on the PP properties . modification of the O2Si / MAO / Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 catalyst with a boron compound , CPh3B(C6F5)4 / did not affect PP properties but reduced the activity of the catalyst system at AlTIBAZr > <nUm> . 
A kinetic , active centre , and morphological analysis has been carried out on the polymerization of ethylene and propylene in hydrocarbon , aromatic and chloroaromatic media using selected homogeneous and silica supported metallocene catalysts activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . A number of procedures for supporting selected model zirconocene compounds ( biscyclopentadienylzirconium dichloride and ethylenebisindenylzirconium dichloride ) on different types of silica have been investigated . it is established that the overall activities and kinetic behaviour of these supported catalysts are strongly affected by the procedure used for the catalyst preparation . In general supported metallocene catalysts were shown to have lower activities and also lower numbers of propagating active centers than did the corresponding soluble catalyst systems . MAO pretreated silica catalysts were shown by SEM studies to produce polymer with good morphology and the results obtained indicated that silica fragmentation producing microreactor behaviour could be obtained in these polymerizing catalyst systems . 
A family of zirconocene , yttrocene , and scandocene complexes have been prepared utilizing an easily modified doubly bridged ligand array , ( 1,2-SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> { η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> -4-R}{e <nUm> -C <nUm> H-3,5-(CHMe <nUm> ) <nUm> } , developed in our laboratories . variations in ligand array substitution and metal center provide complexes that exhibit a range of stereoselectivities and activities in a-olefin polymerizations . A series of C s -and C <nUm> -symmetric metallocenes have been utilized for the preparation of polypropylene and polypentene under various polymerization conditions . analysis of the resulting polymer microstructures has provided valuable information about the factors that dictate syndiospecificity , as well as common error forming mechanisms for these systems . 
the catalytic properties of the complexes (RCp)2ZrCl2 ( r = H , me , pri , bun , bui , Me3Si , cyclo-C6H11 ) , and Me2SiCp*NButZrCl2 ( cp* = C3H4 ) combined with the AlBui3-CPh3B(C6F5)4 cocatalyst in ethylene polymerization were studied . the specific activity of the substituted bis-cyclopentadienyl complexes decreases in the sequence : me > pri > bun > bui > Me3Si > cyclo-C6H11 , which corresponds to the activity sequence for these complexes activated by polymethylaluminoxane ( MAO ) but is 4-20 times lower in absolute value . comparison of the polyethylene samples obtained in the presence of the same complexes with MAO and AlBui3-CPh3B(C6F5)4 cocatalysts showed that polyethylene with much higher molecular mass , melting point , and crystallinity is formed in the presence of the ternary catalytic systems , and this indicates a different nature of the active sites of the catalytic systems . the effective activation energy of polymerization ( ∼ <nUm> kcal mol-1 ) , first order with respect to monomer and ∼ <nUm> order with respect to organoaluminum component , was found for the (PriCp)2ZrCl2-AlBui3-CPh3B(C6F5)4 catalytic system . it was proposed on the basis of the kinetic data that AliBu3 enters into the composition of the active site to form a bridged heteronuclear cationic complex . 
propylene polymerizations were carried out by using rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( zirconocene catalyst ) and a commercial third generation ziegler - natta catalyst in a semibatch reactor . from the polymerization reactions , the optimum reaction conditions and the physical properties of polymers produced from each catalyst system were investigated . the optimum reaction temperatures of rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and ziegler - natta catalyst were <nUm> ° C , <nUm> ° C , respectively . on the basis of the results for the produced polymer particle size distributions and the catalytic activities of polymerization reaction , the reaction temperature should be considered as an important factor for the successful polymerization reactions . especially , the polymer was conglomerated in the higher reaction temperature . it was found that there was an upper limitation to co-catalyst concentration . reaction rates and polymer yields rather decreased with increasing the concentration of co-catalyst , i.e. , MAO and TEA1 affected only polymerization activities , but the PEEB in ziegler - natta catalyst system affected isotactic indexes of produced polymer as well as activities . based on these observations , the production yield seems to exhibit a first order linear relationship to the partial pressure of monomer . 
bulk polymerization of propylene was studied over four ansa - zirconocene catalysts , viz. , Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) , Me2Si(4-Ph-2-Et-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) ( rac : meso = <nUm> : <nUm> ) , Ph2C(CpFlu)ZrCl2 ( 3 ) , and Me2C(3-Me-CpFlu)ZrCl2 ( 4 ) , which were characterized by different symmetries ( C1 , C2 , Cs ) . the structure of the metallocene affected the structure of PP . upon reactions with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) , compounds 1-4 produced very active catalytic systems which catalyzed the polymerization to yield various structures of PP . catalysts <nUm> and <nUm> gave isotactic PP , catalyst <nUm> gave syndiotactic PP and catalyst <nUm> gave hemiisotactic PP . Hemiiso-PP was similar in structure to amorphous PP and had no melting point . the catalytic activity of the system and molecular weight and stereospecificity of PP were studied in relation to the mode of preparation of the catalyst . kinetic parameteres were evaluated , viz. , time of insertion of the propylene molecule ( <nUm> - <nUm> s ) and the time of growth of a single PP macromolecule ( 3-6 s ) , and from these data the minimum degree of polymerization was determined . activation energies were evaluated for the polymerization carried out over each catalyst system . young 's modulus , molecular weight and stereoregularity of the PP prepared were determined . 
rac-[isopropylidenebis(4,5-benzindenyl)] zirconium dichloride / MAO promotes copolymerization of ethylene and styrene to form a random copolymer with a high activity . the random copolymer has head to tail St-St sequences and isotactic stereo - regularity both of the head to tail St-St and alternating Et-St sequences . this catalytic system also promotes homo-polymerization of styrene to form isotactic polystyrene . the steric interaction of the C <nUm> symmetric ligand framework to polymer chain ends and monomer phenyl groups may control isotactic propagation , similarly to the isotactic polymerization of propene reported , with complexes having C <nUm> symmetry . 
the oligomerization of ethylene catalyzed by Cp2ZrL2 ( L = Cl , me , OC6H4-p-Me ) / EAO ( ethylaluminoxane ) afforded not only common chain oligomers but also methylenecyclopentane . it is the first example of oligomerization and simultaneous cyclization of ethylene to a cyclic oligomer . the selectivity of methylenecyclopentane , affected by the structure and the concentration of precatalysts , solvents , aging and reaction temperature and some other factors , came up to <nUm> % when a third - component C5H5N was added to the Cp2ZrCl2 / EAO system under optimal conditions . 
the copolymerization of ethylene(E) and norbornene ( N ) was examined by using various metallocene catalysts and modified - MAO(MMAO) cocatalyst . for C2 - symmetry catalysts such as rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 , Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 , me2 Si(Cp)2ZrCl2 and Cs - symmetrical iPr(FluCp)ZrCl2 as well as CGC and di-bridged zirconocene , the effects of catalyst structure and [N] / [E] feed ratio on catalyst activity , thermal property and [N] content of copolymer ( COC ) was investigated . for rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst of a constant [N] / [E] feed ratio , the appropriate conditions of [Al] / [Zr] mole ratio , polymerization temperature and cocatalyst structure were found to be <nUm> , <nUm> ° C , MMAO cocatalyst , respectively . As [N] / [E] feed ratio increased , the incorporation of norbornene to copolymer increased while the activity of catalyst decreased except for iPr(FluCp)ZrCl2 . with consideration of catalyst activity as well as N content , it was found that rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MMAO system exhibited relatively high activity and controllable tg . monomer reactivity ratio was determined by kelen - tudos method . 
this paper describes how benzene derivatives were formed with high selectivity in one - pot from three different alkynes in excellent yields . firstly , a novel method for pair - selective coupling of an alkyne with ethylene forming zirconacyclopentenes was developed ; then , highly selective cross - coupling of two different alkynes forming zirconacyclopentadienes was achieved ; finally , transmetallation of Zr - C bonds to Cu - C bonds in the presence of a third alkyne led to the formation of benzene derivatives of three different alkynes . new evidences were obtained for understanding the reaction mechanism . 
the polymethylene-bridged dinuclear half - titanocenes [(CH2)n(C5H4)2][TiCl 3]2 ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) have been synthesized by treating the distannylated derivatives of the ligands with two equivalents of Cl4Ti in toluene . all complexes are characterized by IR , 1H NMR , 13C NMR and mass spectrometry . In order to examine the catalytic properties of the dinuclear complexes styrene polymerization has been conducted in the presence of MMAO . from the polymerization experiments it was found that ( i ) all the prepared complexes 10-12 produced syndiotactic polystyrenes , ( ii ) the complex <nUm> holding the longest bridging ligand exhibited the highest activity but produced a polymer having the smallest molecular weight among the polymethylene-bridged dinuclear half - titanocenes . this behavior was attributed to the influence of electron - donating caused by the polymethylene bridge between two active centers as well as the effect of steric congestion around metal center caused by the proximal distance between two active sites . 
half - titanocene compounds were employed to polymerize propylene at ambient pressure . A novel polypropylene elastomer with high molecular weight ( mw = <nUm> × <nUm> ∼ <nUm> × <nUm> ) was produced , its molecular chain possessed random stereo - structure distribution . the effects of polymerization conditions such as Al / Ti ratio , polymerization temperature , etc. on catalytic activity and polymer molecular weight were discussed . 
the reduction in THF and oxidation in CCl2H2 of the bent - sandwich complex (e5-Ind)2ZrMe2 ( 1 ) ( ind = C9H7 , indenyl ) were studied by cyclic voltammetry . complex <nUm> in THF undergoes one - electron reduction to radical anion 1._ , which partially decomposes with the liberation of the ind- anion . even at <nUm> ° C the one - electron oxidation leads to the formation of an unstable 15-electron radical cation undergoing fast heterolytic decomposition to the me . radical and (e5-Ind)2ZrMe+ cation , which is the key reaction center in the catalytic polymerization of olefins . comparative analysis of electron - transfer - induced transformations of bent - sandwich dimethyl and dichloride zirconocenes of the general formula L2ZrX2 ( L = e5-Ind , e5-Cp ; x = Cl , me ) was performed . 
copolymerizations of propylene and styrene in the presence of cyclopentadienyltitanium tribenzyloxide ( CpTi(OBz)3 ) and different methylaluminoxanes ( MAO ) have been investigated . it was found that the composition and structure of the polymerization products are strongly dependent on the amount of free alkylaluminium , involving the residual trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) in MAO and external one . propylene-styrene copolymer could be prepared only with the catalyst system containing less TMA . for the copolymerization catalyzed with the titanocene and MAO containing the residual TMA <nUm> mol % , monomer reactivity ratios were estimated to be rP = <nUm> and rS = <nUm> . the copolymers contain certain amount of regioirregular monomer - alternating sequences . 
metal - mediated (meth)acrylate polymerizations provide a good example of the versatility and importance of transition metal catalysis in polymer design . this chapter surveys several of these processes with respect to " living " behavior , experimental condition and monomer restrictions , and types of polymer architectures available . In addition to anionic methods , group transfer polymerization ( GTP ) with silyl enolates or zirconocenes , organolanthanide-and aluminum porphyrin - initiated polymerization , and atom transfer radical polymerization ( ATRP ) are discussed . 
copolymerizations of ethylene and a-olefin with various zirconocene compounds at a high temperature were carried out to study the relationship between the ligand structure of zirconocene compounds and the copolymerization behavior . all of the indenyl-based zirconocene compounds in combination with dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate / triisobutylaluminum produced only low molecular weight copolymers at a high temperature , regardless of the substituents and bridged structures of the zirconocene compounds . however , zirconocene compounds with a fluorenyl ligand gave rise to a significant increase in the activity and molecular weight of the copolymers by the selection of a diphenylmethylene bridge structure even at a high temperature . ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers obtained with the fluorenyl-based catalysts contained inner double bonds accompanied by the generation of hydrogen , presumably because of a C-H bond activation mechanism . the contents of the inner double bonds were significantly influenced by the polymerization conditions , including the 1-hexene feed content , polymerization temperature , and ethylene pressure . 
the four new asymmetric ansa - zirconocene dichlorides rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(2-phenyl- 1-e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 4c ) , rac-[(9-e5-fluorenyl)(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl) dimethylsilane]zirconium dichloride ( 4d ) , rac-[(9-e5-fluorenyl)(2-methyl-1-e5indenyl) dimethylsilane]zirconium dichloride ( 4e ) , and rac-[(9-e5-fluorenyl)(2-phenyl-1-e5-indenyl) dimethylsilane]zirconium dichloride ( 4f ) have been prepared , and their polymerization behavior was compared to the recently published rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1-e5- indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 4a ) and rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl) ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 4b ) . the Si - bridged ligands are easily accessible by the reaction of fluorenyllithium with dimethyldichlorosilane and the subsequent addition of indenyllithium . A similar route using 1-(9-fluorenyl)-2-bromoethane was applied for the synthesis of the ethylene-bridged ligands . the Zr(IV) complexes of all ligands are highly active catalysts for the propene polymerization reaction after activation with MAO . the influence of the bridge and the particular substitution pattern of the indenyl fragments has been studied with respect to monomer concentration and polymerization temperature . the exchange of the ethylene bridge by a dimethylsilane unit results in a strong increase of the molecular weights but also in a decreased polymerization activity deriving from a fast decomposition of the active catalyst species . interestingly , significantly higher polymer molecular weights could be found for the complexes that contain the 5,6-cyclopentyl substituent on the indenyl moiety . all catalysts showed the effect of a declining stereo - selectivity with increasing monomer concentration , leading to the formation of homopolypropene elastomers . the mechanism of stereoerror formation of these C1 - symmetric species was investigated by deuterium labeling studies on the propene monomers and by comparison with C2 - symmetric complexes . 
the primary silane p-TolSiH3 ( p-Tol = p-CH3C6H5 ) can be polymerized to poly(p-tolylsilane) with <nUm> mol % of both the chiral and achiral zirconocenes Cp2ZrCl2 , Cp(CpSi*)ZrCl2 , and (CpSi*)2ZrCl2 ( cp = CH , CpSi* = C5H4Si(CH3)2-(1R)-endo-(+)-OC10H17 ) in combination with <nUm> mol % of n-BuLi . generally , higher molecular weight linear polymers were obtained when using the substituted zirconocenes in comparison to the parent zirconocene , which in turn produced larger quantities of low-molecular-weight cyclic products . each polysilane sample was analyzed by 29Si{1H} DEPT and 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy . deconvolution of selected regions of the 29Si{1H} DEPT and the 1H NMR spectra for higher molecular weight linear polymers indicated that these catenates were predominantly atactic , on the basis of a triad level bernoullian statistical model . the data suggested that , in this case , chiral substitution of the zirconocene rings had no effect on the stereogrowth of the polysilane chain . 
new examples of chiral C2 - symmetric zirconocenes of low stereoselectivity are presented . zirconenes <nUm> and <nUm> , upon activation with methylalumoxane , produce amorphous polypropylenes with acceptable molecular weights at practical polymerization temperatures and mmmm pentad values between <nUm> and <nUm> % . non-bonded interaction analysis by molecular mechanics accounts for the low enantioselectivity of <nUm> and <nUm> , and predicts the isospecificity of the rac-H2C(2-Me-3-iPr-1-Ind)2ZrR+ catalyst . 
an unbridged zirconocene complex bis(1,2-diphenylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride [(1,2-Ph2-C5H3)2ZrCl2] <nUm> has been synthesized and structurally characterized . when activated by MAO , <nUm> produces ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene with high melting transition temperature , as well as atactic oligopropylene with average molecular weight of ∼ <nUm> g mol-1 . 
studies related to the behavior of different metallocene catalysts for the homopolymerization of 1-octadecene and its copolymerization with ethylene will be presented . the metallocenes : rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 , rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 and Ph2C(Flu)(Cp)ZrCl2 were chosen for the homopolymerization study . they show important differences in catalytic activity at high temperatures ( ≥ <nUm> ° C ) , with rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 showing the highest activity . At lower temperatures ( ≤ <nUm> ° C ) the differences are negligible . for the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-octadecene only the catalysts rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 were studied . the results show that their catalytic activity is just like that for the homopolymerization of 1-octadecene , with higher activity for the metallocene with the et - bridged catalyst . 13C - NMR analysis shows that the composition of the copolymerization products depends on the catalytic systems . copolymers obtained with rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 have greater comonomer incorporation . thermal analysis shows that poly-1-octadecene synthesized with the catalyst rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 is very dependent on the polymerization temperature . the homopolymer obtained at <nUm> ° C presents two endothermal peaks at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> ° C , as compared with the one obtained at <nUm> ° C which presents one wider peak with a maximum at <nUm> ° C . for the catalyst rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 this trend is not observed . the type of metallocene and the reaction time do not significantly change the intrinsic viscosity , but the polymerization temperature changes it drastically , giving higher values at lower temperature . viscosity measurements on the copolymers show that an increase of comonomer concentration in the feed reduces the molecular weight of the copolymer , and it was also found that for homopolymer , the molecular weight is independent of the catalytic systems . 
A versatile zirconocene - coupling route to a family of conjugated polymers containing thiophene-1-oxide and selenophene units is presented . these polymers have lower band gaps than those associated with related thiophene structures . conjugated polymers have a unique chemical , electronic and optical properties . such properties are determined by the polymer structure and by the composition of the polymer backbone . the properties of interest are varied by changing the polymer structure via appropriate synthetic methods . many of the synthetic methods that are employed are based on transition metal - mediated coupling reactions , primarily with palladium and nickel reagents . 
the use of zirconocene coupling reactions for the synthesis of novel conjugated polymers with interesting electronic properties is explored . it is demonstrated that zirconocene - coupling reactions provide a versatile method for tuning the electronic and optical properties via manipulation of the chemical structure and composition of the polymer backbone . this chemistry is used to synthesize highly emissive polymers containing electron - deficient thiophene-1-oxide and dioxide units and a base - dopable cp - containing polymer . 
recent examples for synthesis of new polyolefins containing polar functionalities by coordination insertion copolymerization using group <nUm> metal complex ( Ti , Zr ) catalysts have been reviewed . In particular , examples by adopting the approaches by direct copolymerization of olefin with polar monomer using coordination insertion methods , and ( b ) controlled incorporation of reactive functionalities ( and the subsequent introduction of polar funtionalities under mild conditions ) have been described . our recent efforts for precise synthesis of polyolefins containing polar functionalities by ( i ) efficient incorporation of reactive functionality by copolymerization of ethylene with nonconjugated diene using nonbridged half - titanocene catalysts and ( ii ) subsequent chemical modifications under mild conditions have been introduced . 
Rac-H2C(3-t-Bu-1-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) is a novel , easy to synthesize , high performance catalyst for the polymerization of isotactic propylene ( i-PP ) . methylalumoxane (MAO)-activated <nUm> produces i-PP with good activities at <nUm> ° C in liquid monomer and AlMAO / Zr of <nUm> mol / mol , melting points around <nUm> ° C , and average viscosity molecular weights around <nUm> , at tp = <nUm> ° C . the isotacticity of i-PP from <nUm> / MAO is similar to those of the xylene-insoluble fractions of i-PP from heterogeneous Ti - Cl2Mg catalysts . melting points are lower than those of i-PP from Ti catalysts , but close to or higher than stereospecific zirconocene catalysts . molecular weight distributions are narrow as typical of metallocene catalysts . 
the morphology of the thermoplastic polypropylene elastomer generated with unbridged bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconocene is studied using differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and nitric acid digestion . thermal fractionation DSC reveals the presence of many melting fractions which is likely caused by a broad distribution in crystallizable block lengths . hard crystalline domains dispersed in a continuous amorphous matrix are clearly visible in the AFM images . images of stretched samples show irreversible morphology changes at high elongations . high temperature nitric acid digestion study provides another estimate of the crystalline domain size in the polymers . 
the synthesis and propene polymerization performance of the novel rac - [ CH <nUm> ( 3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl ) <nUm> ]ZrCl <nUm> ( 2 ) and rac - [ CH <nUm> ( 3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl ) <nUm> ]ZrMe <nUm> ( 2-Me <nUm> ) are described . the ligand precursor , bis(1-tert-butyl-3-indenyl)methane ( L2 ) , is obtained in ca. <nUm> % conversion from the condensation of 3-tert-butylindene and formaldehyde in DMF at room temperature and is isolated as a yellow powder by washing with pentane . red <nUm> is obtained in 50-60 % yield and free from its meso stereoisomer by reacting an et <nUm> O solution of the ligand dianion , (L2)Li <nUm> ( et <nUm> O ) x , with a slurry of ClZr <nUm> in either pentane or toluene . yellow 2-Me <nUm> is prepared in <nUm> % yield by reaction of <nUm> with excess MeMgCl in toluene . alternatively , 2-Me <nUm> ( contaminated with about <nUm> % of its meso isomer ) can be obtained directly from the ligand L2 , by reacting L2 in et <nUm> O with <nUm> equiv of MeLi and then <nUm> equiv of ClZr <nUm> in toluene . both <nUm> and 2-Me <nUm> are remarkably soluble in pentane ( <nUm> , ca. <nUm> g / L ; 2-Me <nUm> , ca. <nUm> g / L ) and toluene ( <nUm> , ca. <nUm> g / L ) . <nUm> / MAO and 2-Me <nUm> / MAO polymerize liquid propene with good activities to highly isotactic ( mmmm = 95-98 % ) , fully regioregular polypropene with medium - high molecular weights ( M w = <nUm> 000-780 <nUm> ) and high melting points ( T m = 154-163 ° C ) in the T p range 30-70 ° C . the behavior of <nUm> is compared to that of the prototypical montell zirconocene rac - [ me <nUm> C(3-t-Bu-Ind) <nUm> ]ZrCl <nUm> ( 1 ) . <nUm> is the first example of a highly efficient and at the same time simple and inexpensive zirconocene catalyst for isotactic polypropene . the molecular structures of <nUm> and its Hf analogue ( hf-2 ) have been determined and compared to that of <nUm> . 
the complex (C5H5)2Zr(Me)(methallyl) ( 1 ) was prepared and studied as a model for Zr - bound allyl species which are likely to arise in zirconocene - based polymerization systems . <nUm> undergoes allyl-alkyl exchange with trimethyl aluminum ( TMA ) or with methyl alumoxane ( MAO ) at rates that are proportional to the Al concentration , but remain 1-2 orders of magnitude below those of typical olefin insertions . its perfluorotriphenylborane adduct <nUm> , i.e. , the contact ion pair (C5H5)2Zr(methallyl)++H 3CB(C6F5)3- , has been characterized with regard to the rearrangement dynamics of its allyl ligand . propene reacts with <nUm> , at rates which are substantially lower again than those of cationic Zr - alkyl species , under insertion between Zr and one of the allylic termini . scrambling of deuterium from an allylic CD2 terminus over several C atom positions next to the unsaturated chain end indicates rather extensive metal migration within an initial olefin insertion product . density - functional calculations indicate that insertion of propene directly into an e3-coordinated Zr - allyl unit occurs with lower activation energy than insertion into an e1-bound Zr - allyl species and that the lowest - energy pathway for the reactivation of a cationic zirconocene allyl species is its reconversion to the corresponding Zr - alkyl species by molecular hydrogen . 
homopolymerization of 4-methyl-1-pentene and its copolymerization with ethylene in the presence of catalysts based on zirconocenes , [(CH3)5Cp]ZrCl3 , [(CH3)2C(Cp)2]ZrCl2 , [(CH3)2C(Ind)2]ZrCl2 , [(C6H5)(C2H5)C(Ind)2]ZrCl <nUm> , [(CH3)2Si(Ind)2]ZrCl2 , [(CH3)2C(CH3Cp)(Flu)]ZrCl2 , and [(Ph)2C(Cp)(Flu)]]ZrCl2 , were studied . it was shown that the order of loading of the reagents affects the yield of poly ( 4-methyl-1-pentene ) . unsymmetrical , bridged metallocenes exhibit the highest activity in polymerization . for the [(CH3)2C(CH3Cp)(Flu)]ZrCl2-methylalu minoxane system , formation of a syndiotactic poly(4-methyl-1-pentene) was observed . In the copolymerization of 4-methyl-1-pentene with ethylene , conditions providing preparation of a linear LDPE with a variable content of 4-methyl-1-pentene units were determined . the effect of the molar ratio of methylaluminoxane : Zr on the yield and composition of the resulting copolymer was revealed . 
the catalytic activity of Cp2ZrCl2 supported on three types of molecular sieves ( MCM-41 , VPI-5 and Y zeolites ) was evaluated in the polymerization of ethylene . the supports were dehydrated , pre-treated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , and then reacted with Cp2ZrCl2 . after heterogenization of Cp2ZrCl2 on the molecular sieves , the MAO concentration could be reduced without significant effect on the catalytic activity . the polymers obtained with the heterogeneous catalysts showed higher melting points and molecular weights , as well as narrower polydispersion than those obtained with the homogeneous catalyst precursor . V . 
several supported zirconocene catalysts were prepared by using Cl2Mg · 6H2O as a precursor for producing an active support . such catalysts combined with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) obtained by reacting Cl2Mg · 6H2O with AlMe3 show good activity for ethylene polymerization similar to that of anhydrous Cl2Mg supported zirconocene catalyst . 
two new unbridged zirconocenes , bis(2,4,7-trimethyl indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( Met-I ) and bis(2-methyl-4,7-diethyl indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( Met-II ) were prepared in order to investigate the steric effects of substituents on the nature of the catalysts for the polymerization of propylene . A mixture of methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) and triisobutylaluminum [Al(iBu)3)] was used as cocatalyst to activate these catalysts . the decrease in steric bulkiness of substituents at <nUm> and <nUm> positions of the indenyl ring resulted in an increase of both activity and molecular weight as well as the isotacticity . 
tetramethyldisilane - bridged bis(1 - indenyl and tetrahydroindenyl ) metallocene dichlorides(Me2SiSiMe2)Ind2MCl 2[M = ti(1) , zr(2) ] and (Me2SiSiMe2)[IndH4]2MCl 2[M = ti(3) , zr(4) ] were synthesized . complexes 1-4 were characterized by 1H NMR , mass spectra and elemental analyses . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were used for the polymerization of ethylene after activation with methyl aluminoxane(MAO) at different temperatures and normal pressure . the titanocene <nUm> shows a lower activity but produces polyethylene with a higher molecular weight than zirconocene <nUm> . the catalyst systems show a dependency of the activity and molecular weight on temperature . 
the chemical structures of end groups of medium - low molecular weight atactic and isotactic polypropylenes ( a-PP and i-PP ) , produced with zirconocene / methylalumoxane catalysts , have been analyzed and used to infer the chain - transfer reaction mechanisms , which are then correlated with the zirconocene ligand structure and the polymerization conditions . for the chiral , isospecific ansa - zirconocenes such as rac-[ethylenebis(1-indenyl)]ZrCl2 / methylalumoxane ( <nUm> / MAO ) and rac-[ethylenebis(4,7-dimethyl-1-indenyl)]ZrCl2 / methylalumoxane ( <nUm> / MAO ) catalysts , i-PP molecular weight is dependent on the reg / ospecificity of the catalyst , as shown by the presence of cis-2-butenyl end groups , formed by chain transfer to the monomer after a secondary propylene insertion . At low monomer concentration , chain - transfer with <nUm> / MAO shifts from predominant transfer to the monomer after a secondary propylene insertion to b-methyl ( allyl end groups ) and b-hydrogen transfers after a primary insertion ( 2-propenyl , or vinylidene , end group ) . Ansti-bis(3-R-indenyl)ZrCl2 ( ansa = CH2 , Me2Si , Me2C ; r = me , t-Bu , Me3Si ) catalysts , which are highly regiospecific , produce polypropylenes with chain transfer via both b-hydrogen transfer after a primary insertion and b-methyl transfer . for example , rac-Me2C(3-t-Bu-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 4 ) exhibits the highest selectivity for b-methyl transfer so far observed in an isospecific zirconocene . As for <nUm> / MAO , the rate of b-methyl transfer in <nUm> / MAO increases by lowering [propylene] . 
based on an extensive review of the literature , the progress made so far in the application of organometalic catalysts in the polymerization of olefins , taking into special consideration the most recent research in this field has been presented . the possibilities of obtaining by this method polyolefins of various structures and properties have also been explored . In accordance with the state - of - art in the technology of polyolefin production , the results of the most recent research in opole , an active center in this field , development and evaluation of the catalytic properties of novel organometalic catalysts have been presented . special attention was devoted to catalysts derived from the postmetallocene system group such as complexes with salene - type or bis(phenoxy-imine) ligands and bis(phenoxy-imine) complexes ( tables 1-4 ) . the influence of the composition , especially the ligand structures ( fig. <nUm> ) , the central metal in complexes and the type of organoaluminium activators ( fig. <nUm> ) on catalyst system activity in the polymerization of ethylene as well as on the properties of the obtained polymerization product ( fig. <nUm> ) was evaluated . 
metallocene catalysts in dissolved form are in most cases unsuitable for the production of polyethylene or polypropylene on an industrial scale . In order to use them in existing technical processes , metallocenes have to be supported . Cs - symmetric zirconocenes show a high activity and no leaching additional triisobutyl aluminum is used as scavenger and MAO - covered silica for heterogenization . the aluminum : zirconium ratio can be reduced to values of <nUm> : <nUm> to get optimal activities . the syndiotacticity of the obtained polypropylene is lower compared with polymers of the homogeneous catalyst and decreases strongly with a thinner propene concentration . 
the tetraphenyl substituted disiloxane bridged ansa - zirconocene has been generated to probe the effect of bridging ligand on metallocene polymerization . the indicated zirconocene has been synthesized by the reaction of Cl4Zr with the distannylated precursor compound . the new disiloxane bridged ansa - metallocene was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR , mass analysis , and elemental analysis . ethylene polymerization was carried out to in- , vestigate the polymerization properties of the prepared complex . polymerization experiments exhibited that the catalytic activity increases with the increase in polymerization temperature as well as the amount of cocatalyst . on the other hand , the molecular weights of the polymers decreased with the increase in polymerization temperature . it turned out that tetraphenyl replacement caused about <nUm> to <nUm> % activity reduction . the most important feature associated in tetramethyl to tetraphenyl substitution was that molecular weights of the polymers from the tetraphenyl substituted complex were enormously improved comparing to those of the polymers from the tetramethyl one . 
zirconocene supported on alumina or magnesium chloride exhibits modest olefin polymerization activity but not when it is supported directly on silica . the surface silanol as well as siloxane groups must be passivated with appropriate reagents . A very active and stereospecific supported catalyst was obtained by first reacting silica with methylalumoxane and bisphenol A before the impregnation of the ansa - zirconocene precursor . the main difference between a homogeneous and supported catalyst is that at the same gross amount of metallocene , the net concentration of it in the pores of a support material is several orders of magnitude greater than it exists in solution thus the rate of deactivation in the former case is correspondingly faster than in the latter . most other supported metallocene catalysts based on supports such as zeolites , cyclodextrin , polymeric MAO , synthetic polymers , etc. , are poor in olefin polymerization for this and other reasons discussed . 
we have analyzed the computational results for several elementary reactions of the ethylene polymerization process catalyzed by an alternative ( to the existing metallocene catalysts ) " non-cyclopentadienyl " catalysts such as diimine - M(II) ( where m = Ni and Pd ) and chelating bridged ti- and Zr - complexes . the obtained data have been compared with those for the existing zirconocene - based catalysts . In general , it was shown that : ( i ) the resting stage of the process is a metal-olefin-alkyl complex , the olefin coordination energy of which is a few kcal / mol larger for diimine - M(II) systems than zirconocene or dialkoxide systems ; ( ii ) the rate - determining barrier is a migratory insertion barrier calculated from the metal-olefin-alkyl complex , which is found to be a few kcal / mol larger for the diimine - M(II) system compared to the Cp2ZrCH3+ catalyst . the presence of certain flexible bridging ligands x in the Ti - alkoxide complex , [Y(Ph)X(Ph)Y]TiCH3+ , which are capable of donating electron density to the cationic metal center at various stages during the reaction makes this barrier a few kcal / mol smaller for the dialkoxide than the Cp2ZrCH3+ catalyst . it was shown that an increase in the metal - bridge interaction decreases the migratory insertion barrier and , consequently , increases the catalytic activity of these complexes . although the diimine - M(II) catalysts are less active than zirconocene - based ones , the microstructure of the polymers produced by the former catalyst , which is found to be a function of temperature , ethylene , steric bulkiness of the auxiliary ligands , and transition metal center , makes them attractive for practice . we also have studied the mechanisms of several chain termination / transfer reactions , as well as the role of steric effects in the studied elementary reactions . we have clearly demonstrated tremendous possibilities of the computational chemistry in solving complex problems of the homogenous catalyst , and its high capability of predicting new and more active catalysts for different commercially important processes including olefin polymerization reactions . 
the production of polyethylene by zirconocene catalysis is a multistep process that includes initiation , propagation , and termination . each of these steps has a number of associated equilibrium and transition state structures . these structures have been studied in the gas - phase environment using density functional and integrated methods . we have also examined the effects of solvation upon the energetics of the various polymerization steps employing continuum and explicit representations of the solvent ( toluene ) . the reaction steps we have studied are initiation , propagation , propylene and hexene incorporation , termination by hydrogenolysis , termination by b-H transfer to the metal , termination by b-H transfer to the monomer , and reactivation . the solvation effect of toluene takes on special significance for the initiation , termination by hydrogenolysis and by b-H transfer to the metal , and reactivation steps . 
copolymerization of ethylene and styrene with the catalytic system Cp*TiMe3-B(C6F5)3 under suitable conditions affords a new polymer having a polyethylenic backbone with 4-phenyl-1-butyl branches as the main product . this unexpected result has been ascribed to the multi-site nature of the catalytic system , containing a species able to co-oligomerize ethylene and styrene to 6-phenyl-1-hexene ( which was actually identified in the polymerization mixture ) , and another species able to copolymerize the latter with ethylene . 
ethylene is polymerized by heterobimetallic combinations of early and late transition metal catalysts . dual combinations of zirconocenes and cationic nickel and iron catalysts with multidentate nitrogen - donor ligands are described . reactor blends of linear and branched ethylene homopolymers are obtained . with zirconocene / nickel complex catalyst combinations , addition of hydrogen selectively reduces the molecular weight of the linear polyethylene formed by the metallocene catalyst . 
the moderate electrophilicity of palladium (II) - phosphine catalysts compared to those of zirconocene dichlorides makes them more tolerant toward a variety of polar functionalities of olefinic monomers . this allows use of Pd (II) complexes as catalysts for the copolymerization of olefins with readily available polar monomers , like acrylic acid derivatives or carbon monoxide . In particular , developments during the recent years have opened the way to a new and broad family of high molecular weight 1-olefin / CO co- and terpolymers . these 1,4-polyketone materials show interesting and easily variable properties which can be tuned from insoluble , highly crystalline to thermoplastic elastic . the latter polymers resemble in some cases flexible PVC and even vulcanized natural rubbers . 
new data on the structure of polymethylaluminoxane[-Al(CH3)O-]n ( MAO ) , the nature of its lewis acidity , and the mechanism of formation of the active centers of the metallocene catalysts during interaction between MAO and Cp2ZrMe2 obtained by spectroscopy ( 27Al , 17O , 1H , and 13C NMR and spin probe ESR ) and density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations are considered . A three - dimensional structure of MAO ( a cage structure ) with four - coordinated aluminum atoms and three - coordinated oxygen atoms is found to be the most probable . experimental evidence for the presence of relatively weak lewis acid sites in MAO ( about <nUm> site per <nUm> atoms of Al ) is obtained for the first time . the acidity of MAO depends on the size of a MAO molecule n , and it increases with increasing n . A scheme for the formation and structure of lewis acid sites formed upon interaction between MAO and Al2Me6 , which is always present in the MAO samples is proposed . cationic intermediates formed in the MAO / Cp2ZrMe2 system at high molar ratios Al / Zr = 200-4000 corresponding to real conditions of polymerization are characterized for the first time . A scheme of equilibria between them and the most probable precursors of the active centers in this system are proposed . A new mechanism for the formation of the [Cp2ZrMe]+[MAO · me]- ionic pair involving the abstraction and occlusion of a methyl ligand in the bulk of a MAO molecule is proposed on the basis of quantum - chemical calculations . 
the polyethylene obtained in the presence of the catalyst constituted by the meso isomer of the prototypical zirconocene complex (ethylene)bis(l-indenyDzirconium dichloride activated by methylalumoxane is characterized by the presence of ethyl branches . the intensities of the 13C NMR signals associated with these branches indicate that there are about 1-2 ethyl groups per <nUm> monomer units . As a consequence , the melting temperature is 10-15 ° C lower than the linear polyethylene obtained with the rac mixture of the same zirconocene complex . on the basis of kinetic evidence , a branching mechanism that involves a 9-H transfer to the coordinated ethylene is proposed . 
catalytic pauson - khand reaction products with norbornadiene could be effectively transformed to trisubstituted cyclopentadienes , which have been used to synthesize a series of unbridged bis(1-R'-2-R-3-R'-trisubstituted cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichlorides <nUm> ( r = R' = ph ) , <nUm> ( r = ph , R' = me ) , <nUm> ( r = n-Bu , R' = me ) , <nUm> ( r = t-Bu , R' = me ) , <nUm> ( r = (CH2)4OMe ) , R' = me ) , and <nUm> ( r = n-Bu , R' = ph ) . the crystal structure of <nUm> was determined by x-ray crystallography . these zirconium complexes in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) show activities for the polymerization of ethylene . the activities are in the following order : <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> ∼ <nUm> ∼ Cp2ZrCl2 > <nUm> ∼ <nUm> . the activity of <nUm> is four times higher than that of Cp2ZrCl2 under similar conditions . A . 
trimethylphosphine - stabilized ethylene complexes <nUm> of the ethylenebisindenyl-supported zirconocene fragment are prepared via magnesium reduction of rac - (EBI)ZrCl <nUm> in the presence of ethylene and PMe <nUm> . when the reaction is halted after <nUm> h , good yields of a mixture containing rac-(EBI)Zr(e <nUm> -CH <nUm> = CH <nUm> )PMe <nUm> , rac-1 , and the racemic diastereomer of the zirconacyclopentane derivative (EBI)Zr(e <nUm> -CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> ) , rac-2 , are obtained . this mixture may be converted to pure rac-1 if treated with excess PMe <nUm> . if the magnesium reduction of rac - (EBI)ZrCl <nUm> is left for <nUm> days in the presence of magnesium chloride , complete epimerization to meso-1 is observed . thus , both diastereomers of <nUm> are available . compounds meso-1 and rac-2 have been characterized crystallographically . the coordinated ethylene ligands in compounds <nUm> are susceptible to electrophilic attack by the pentafluorophenyl-substituted boranes HB(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> and B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> , forming zwitterionic metallocene products . for reactions involving HB(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> , the products meso-3 and rac-3 are characterized by a strong zirconium - hydrido borate interaction , as well as a weak Zr-Cb bonding . In addition to complete solution characterization , the structure of meso-3 was determined crystallographically . upon treatment of rac-1 with B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> , a more charge - separated zwitterion , rac-4 , was formed . In addition to retaining its PMe <nUm> ligand , the complex is stabilized by a strong b-CH <nUm> interaction , as determined by x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy . structural comparisons between the compounds reported herein and previous examples in metallocene chemistry are presented . 
BC18F15 opens the ring of the N-tBu azazirconacyclobutane <nUm> by abstracting the carbon from the zirconium ; the resulting amido cation <nUm> reacts slowly with ethylene to form a chelating g-iminoalkyl zirconocene cation , <nUm> . similarly , BC18F15 removes carbon from the Zr of the N-Ph azazirconacyclopentane 5a and the N-SiMe3 azazirconacyclopentane 5b , forming amido cations that are stabilized in the solid state by coordination of phenyl substituents on N ( <nUm> , from 5a ) or C ( <nUm> , from 5b ) ; <nUm> slowly loses hydrogen , forming an azaallyl cation <nUm> . In contrast AlMe2Cl coordinates the N of the zirconaaziridines <nUm> , resulting in an sp2 N coordinated to Zr through a p orbital . the structures of <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and 11a have been established by x-ray crystallography . 
A large range of bis(Rn-3-indenyl)methanes were obtained in good to fair yields with the base - catalyzed condensation between formaldehyde and ( substituted ) indenes . for example , bis(indenyl)methane and bis(4,7-dimethylindenyl)methane have been synthesized in <nUm> % and <nUm> % yield , respectively , from the corresponding indenes . typical reaction conditions are as follows : indene in DMF or DMSO , <nUm> equiv of CH2O , <nUm> - <nUm> equiv of EtONa , room temperature . this process provides an inexpensive and atom - efficient protocol for the synthesis of methylene-bridged ligands , providing a facile entry into methylene-bridged ansa - zirconocenes : MAO - activated C2 - symmetric rac-dichloro[methylenebis(e5-1-indenyl)]zirconium ( 1 ) and rac-dichloro[methylenebis(4,7-dimethyl-e5-1-indenyl)]zirconium ( 2 ) polymerize ethylene to low molecular weight , vinyl-terminated linear polyethylene , and liquid propylene to low molecular weight , low isotacticity polypropylene . the microstructure , molecular weight , and end - group structure of these isotactic polypropylenes ( i-PP ) are compared to those from rac-[isopropylidenebis(1-indenyl)]ZrCl2 ( 3 ) , rac-[ethylenebis(1-indenyl)]ZrCl2 ( 4 ) , rac-[ethylenebis(4,7-dimethyl-1-indenyl)]ZrCl2 ( 5 ) , and the silicon - bridged rac-[dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl)]ZrCl2 ( 6 ) . the molecular structures of <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined and compared to those of 3-6 . In liquid monomer at <nUm> ° C , the amount of secondary insertions increases on going from the more open to the more hindered systems . At the same time , there is an increase of the fraction of secondary units undergoing isomerization from the normal <nUm> unit to the <nUm> unit ( tetramethylene sequence ) . 
the reactivity of group <nUm> zirconocene dichlorides incorporating (1-trimethylsilyl)-e5-indenyl ( Me3SiInd ) and e5-1-(trimethylsilyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydromdenyl ( Me3SiTHI ) ligands toward boron tribromide was investigated . whereas the reaction of (Me3SiInd)CpZrCl2 ( 1 ) with BBr3 in CCl2H2 immediately cleaved the indenyl ligand from the metal , (Me3SiTHI)CpZrCl2 ( 3 ) reacted with BBr3 in CCl2H2 at <nUm> ° C for <nUm> days to obtain [1-(BrSiMe2)THI]CpZrBr2 ( 6 ) in <nUm> % yield . the reaction of (Me3SiInd)Li ( <nUm> equiv ) with ZrCl4(THF)2 afforded pure rac-(Me3-SiInd)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) in <nUm> % yield . hydrogenation of ( 2 ) ( <nUm> bar , O2Pt catalyst ) afforded rac-(Me3-SiTHI)2ZrCl2 ( 4 ) in <nUm> % yield . single - crystal x-ray diffraction analysis of <nUm> showed that the Zr atom lies on a crystallographic C2 axis with the CH2 annelated rings projecting into the Cl2Zr hemisphere of the pseudotetrahedral coordination environment . the reaction of <nUm> with MeLi in toluene afforded rac-(Me3SiTHI)2ZrMe2 ( 5 ) in <nUm> % yield . 1H NMR and 13C NMR analysis confirmed the rac assignment for <nUm> . treatment of <nUm> with BBr3 in CCl2H2 at <nUm> ° C for <nUm> days afforded rac-[1-(BrMe2Si)THI]2ZrBr2 ( 7 ) in <nUm> % yield . the reaction of <nUm> with moisture in ambient air gave the ansa - metallocene rac-[m-O-(1-Me2SiTHI)2]ZrBr2 ( 8 ) in <nUm> % yield . In solution , <nUm> showed time - averaged C2 symmetry ( 1H NMR ) ; however , single - crystal x-ray diffraction analysis showed that <nUm> adopts an asymmetric conformation in which only one of the CH2 annelated rings projects into the Cl2Zr coordination hemisphere . neither <nUm> nor <nUm> served as a precatalyst for alumoxane - cocatalyzed , homogeneous propylene polymerization . 
thermally induced elimination of bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene from its titanocene complex [ {e5-C5Me4(SiMe3)} 2Ti(e2-Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) ] ( 1 ) afforded the stable titanocene [ {e5-C5-Me4(SiMe3)} 2TiII ] ( 2 ) in high yield under mild conditions . compound <nUm> exhibits paramagnetic line broadening of 1H NMR signals , although it is silent in EPR spectra down to <nUm> ° C . the solid - state structure determination revealed an exactly parallel arrangement of the cyclopentadienyl rings in <nUm> due to crystallographically imposed symmetry . complex <nUm> smoothly reacts with ethylene to give the yellow e2-ethylene complex [ {e5-C5Me4(SiMe3)} 2-Ti(e2-CH2 = CH2 ) ] ( 3 ) . the structures of <nUm> and <nUm> , determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction , show the bent - titanocene moieties with the e2-coordinated Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 and CH2 = CH2 ligands , respectively . 
the polymeric [Ind2Si(C6H4)]n and [Ind2Si(C6H4)]m compounds ( ind = indenyl ) were synthesized via the condensation reaction of bisindenyldichlorosilane and p-dilithiobenzene or p-dilithiobiphenyl , and the supported - type zirconocene catalysts were prepared by reacting them with zirconium tetrachloride . the content of zirconium in the catalysts is much higher than that in the metallocene catalysts supported by inorganic compounds . polymerizations of ethene and propene were conducted with them using methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or ordinary alkylaluminiums as cocatalysts and toluene as the solvent . the catalysts combined with MAO display very high activities especially for the ethene polymerization . from the polymerization at high temperatures , it was found that the active species are markedly stabilized , probably due to the rigid backbones of the carriers . the activity of the catalysts activated with ordinary alkylaluminiums is far less as compared with those activated with MAO . 
this paper describes the use of several kinds of group IV cp based catalyst systems , in the synthesis of co- and terpolymers of ethylene , propylene and . a-olefins endowed with OH and COOH functional groups . the hydroxy monomers used were 5-hexen-l-ol ( 4 ) and 10-undecen-l-ol ( 5 ) and the carboxy monomer was 10-undecen-l-oic acid ( 6 ) . the three catalyst systems used were the C2 symmetric ansa - zirconocene ( 1 ) the " in-site " titanium complex ( 2 ) and the non-rigid zirconocene ( 3 ) , all activated by methylaluminoxane . trimethylaluminium was used to protect the functional group of polar monomers . the first two catalyst systems suffer similar activity loss in the presence of polar monomer whereas the third one exhibited better tolerance toward the hydroxyolefins . NMR and FTIR spectroscopies were used to characterize the polymerization products . all three catalyst systems afforded functionalized co- and terpolymers by direct polymerization of ethylene / propylene / hydroxy-a - olefins but only the catalyst system ( 1 ) / MAO displays appreciable activities for direct polymerization of ethylene , propylene and carboxy-a-ole-fins . 
nine new fluorinated half - sandwich titanocene complexes ( lb-9b ) based on substituted alkylindenes were synthesized , by reacting Me3SnF with the corresponding chloride species , and employed as catalyst precursors for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene . when activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , the new precursors lb-9b exhibited increased activities by factors of 15-40 compared with the corresponding chlorinated compounds and provided improved syndiotacticity , enhanced melting temperature , and higher polymer molecular weights . the activities of indenyl and methyl- or phenyl-substituted indenyl complexes were found to be higher by factors of 4-12.5 than those of CpTiF3 and CpTiF3 . more importantly , the amount of MAOcan be reduced to an Al : Ti molar ratio of <nUm> in the temperature range of 10-90 ° C . it is likely that Ti-F , more polarized than the Ti-Cl bond in the half - sandwich titanocenes , allows the formation of more active and stable active sites of Ti (III) complexes needed for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene . evidence in this direction is brought via the electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) spectrum and redox titration . the higher activity and syndiospecificity of the fluorinated catalysts are attributable to a greater number , more stable Ti (III) active sites , and / or higher propagation rate con - stant . 
liquid co- and terpolymers based on inexpensive and abundant a-olefins and ethylene feed stocks were produced using a single site zirconocene catalyst . the process is based , in part , on the formation of synthetic hydrocarbon base oils ( SHC ) with catalysts having a high viscosity index , low pour point , low volatility , low cold cranking viscosity , high flash point , and excellent oxidation stability . the characteristics of the liquid polymers were modified by cracking and hydrogenation to generate SHC . the oils ' performance properties were comparable to or better than PAO and are an economical alternative to formulating high performance motor oils and lubricants . 
A stereoregular alternating ethylene-styrene copolymer , also stretchable in fiber form , has been obtained with rac-isopropylidenebis(1-indenyl)zirconium dimethyldiamide activated by the methyl-alumoxane catalytic system . from x-ray diffraction fiber spectra , an isotactic structure has been assigned to this copolymer as well as the previously described stereoregular ethylene-styrene copolymers . the polymer has zigzag planar chain conformation with phenyl groups oriented perpendicularly to the chain axis . the crystallographic symmetry in B2 / m . lattice constants ( monoclinic , unique axis c ) : a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å ; γ = <nUm> ° . the disagreement index for measured reflections is R1 = <nUm> . 
A series of substituted indenyl-fluorenyl asymmetric ethylene-bridged ligands have been prepared from the reaction of 1-(9-fluorenyl)-2-bromoethane and the lithium salt of the desired indenyl moiety . the ligands have been converted to the corresponding substituted asymmetric ethylene-bridged metallocenes ( m = Zr , Hf ) . these metallocenes have been evaluated as catalyst precursors for the polymerization of ethylene and propylene . the influence of substitution on the selectivity of the propylene polymerization has been studied . the metallocene [1-(9-fluorenyl)-2-(2,4,7-trimethyl-1-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride was found to produce highly isotactic polypropylene with an [mmmm] value of <nUm> % . 
homo- and copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene were conducted at different temperature and ethylene pressure with several zirconocenes activated with dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( Me2PhNH*B(C6F5) <nUm> ) / triisobutylaluminium ( i-Bu3Al ) to study the effect of ligand structure and polymerization conditions on catalytic activity , molecular weight and chain transfer reactions . At high temperature and low ethylene pressure , rac-ethylene(bisindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) activated with Me2PhNH*B(C6F5)4 / i-Bu 3Al initially gives a highly active catalyst that is rapidly deactivated . trans-Vinylene double bonds , which were not formed at low temperature , were detected in polyethylene synthesized at high temperature and low ethylene pressure . they reasonably arise from b-H transfer after isomerization reaction . the molecular weight of ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers decreases with increasing 1-hexene feed , followed by the formation of vinylidene end groups . this reveals that b-H transfer from propagating chains containing primary inserted 1-hexene as a terminal unit is predominant . this reaction is influenced by the ligand structure . At high temperature and high ethylene pressure , trans-vinylene and vinylidene contents decrease and the vinyl content increases , indicating that the high ethylene pressure controls b-H transfer after isomerization reaction . 
A general investigation of the elementary reactions involved in the activation processes of zirconocene and Ni - based derivatives by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) was performed through the association of polymerization kinetics and spectroscopic investigation of the catalytic system . this study demonstrates the close correlation between polymerization activities and the changes in the UV / visible characteristic absorption bands of the transition metal derivative used as catalyst . hex-1-ene was chosen as model monomer . 
ethylene polymerization and ethylene / a-olefin copolymerization were conducted using diphenylmethylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( Ph2C(Cp)(Flu)ZrCl2 ) as a catalyst activated with dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( Me2PhNH · BC24F20 ) / triisobutylaluminium ( i-Bu3Al ) at high temperature and different ethylene pressure . this catalyst produces high molecular weight polyethylene with high activity . the molecular weight of the copolymers hardly decreases with increasing amount of comonomer in the feed . this is attributed to the control b-H transfer from the propagating chain containing primary inserted comonomer . the occurrence of inner trisubstituted double bonds was confirmed . these bonds are probably formed by dehydrogenation reactions after b-H transfer from the propagating chain followed by ethylene insertion . therefore , this reaction might play an important role in the production of high molecular weight ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers at high temperature . At high ethylene pressure , isomerization reactions from inserted ethylene or primary inserted a-olefin as terminal units , which were observed under low ethylene pressure , can be controlled at low level . 
A novel polymer - supported metallocene catalyst with crosslinked poly(styrene-co-acrylamide) ( AmPS ) as the support has been prepared and characterized . the probability of long sequences of acrylamide ( Am ) in AmPS is still low even at an Am amount of <nUm> mol % , implying the relatively homogeneous distribution of Am . the infrared spectra of AmPS and the supported catalyst substantiate that an amide group in AmPS coordinates with methylaluminoxane through both oxygen and nitrogen atoms . ethylene / a-octene copolymerization showed that the catalytic activity is not markedly affected by adding a-octene . 13C NMR analysis of the ethylene / a-octene copolymer indicated that the composition distribution of the copolymer is uniform . 
A single - stage , i.e. , degree of polymerization of one , and enantioselective version of the ziegler - natta alkene polymerization was envisioned as a potentially significant and useful method for catalytic asymmetric C-C bond formation , shortly after the corresponding alkyne version involving Zr - catalyzed alkylalumination of alkynes was discovered in <nUm> . however , the discovery of such an asymmetric reaction proved to be a major challenge . At least three widely observable unwanted side reactions , i.e. , ( 1 ) cyclic carbometalation , ( 2 ) b-H transfer hydrometalation , and ( 3 ) alkene polymerization , represented by the ziegler - natta polymerization , were noted and were to be avoided . with Zr as the metal at the catalytic center , we eventually came up with a notion that di- or multiple alkylation of Zr was to be avoided for achieving superior acyclic asymmetric carbometalation . this , in turn , led us to avoid the use of highly nucleophilic alkylmetals containing alkali metals and Mg . aluminum used in ziegler - natta polymerization that can selectively monoalkylate Zr proved to be one of a very limited number of favorable metals . even so , undesirable cyclic carbozirconation can occur in nonpolar solvents via intricate bimetallic routes to cyclic organozirconium species . the vastly different reactant - catalyst stoichiometry and the absence of polymerization promotors , such as methylaluminoxane , in our investigations permit us to ignore the ziegler - natta polymerization as a serious and unwanted side reaction , although use of limited amounts of promotors can in some cases accelerate otherwise sluggish ZACA reactions . selection of the currently used Zr catalysts including (R)- and (S)-(NMI)2)ZrCl)2 ) , dichlorobis(neomenthylindenyl) zirconium was made by screening <nUm> or so known chiral zirconocene derivatives . systematic scientific design and screening of chiral ligands are clearly highly desirable , and efforts along this line are ongoing . even at the current level of development , however , the ZACA reaction shows considerable promise as an efficient and selective method for catalytic asymmetric C-C bond formation , which has already been used to significantly modernize and improve syntheses of natural products including deoxypolypropionates and isoprenoids of biological and medicinal interest . 
novel heterobimetallic complexes that consist of zirconium and rhodium , LRh(e2CH2 = CH)2Si(e5-C 5H2-2,4-Mc2)2ZrCl2 ( 3a L = e5-C9H7 , 3b e2-C5H5 , 3c e-C5Me5 ) , were synthesized , and 3b was structurally characterized . the complexes have a " C2 - symmetric " ansa - zirconocene part and the rhodium metal on the bridge part . the complexes 3a - c in combination with methylaluminoxane catalyzed highly isospecific polymerization of a-olefins . their catalytic activities were higher than that of the parent zirconocene complex , and the obtained polymer had a larger molecular weight . 
for ethylene polymerization , the supported metallocene catalyst was prepared by anchoring CpIndZrCl2 on silica with an appropriate spacer . the three procedures were applied for CpIndZrCl2 anchoring on silica with a hexamethyltrisiloxane or pentamethylene spacer . the anchoring procedures exerted a strong influence on the catalyst activity since the different anchoring methods gave the formation of different structures of active sites . with the new anchoring route , it was possible to prepare the " heterogeneous single - site " catalyst which was found to have only one catalyst structure on silica and exhibited a higher catalyst activity than that of the other supported catalysts . At a polymerization temperature of <nUm> ° C , the activity of the heterogeneous single - site catalyst was comparable to that of the unsupported homogeneous zirconocene . J appl polym sci <nUm> : 1071-1080 , <nUm> . 
propylene polymerization was carried out using an ansa - zirconocene pyrrolidide based catalytic system of racemic ethylene-1,2-bis(1-indenyl)zirconium dipyrrolidide [ rac-(EBI)Zr(NC4H8)2 or ( rac-1 ) ] and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or a noncoordinating anion . In situ generation of cationic alkylzirconium species was also investigated by NMR - scale reactions of rac-1 and MAO , and rac-1 , AlMe3 , and [Ph3C] [B(C6Fg)4] . In the NMR - scale reaction using CD2Cl2 as a solvent , a small amount of MAO ( [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> ) was enough to completely activate rac-1 to give cationic methyl-zirconium cations that can polymerize propylene . the resulting isotactic polypropylene ( iPP ) isolated in this reaction showed a meso pentad value of <nUm> % . In a similar NMR - scale reaction rac-1 was stoichiometrically methylated by AlMe3 to give rac - (EBI)ZrMe2 , and the introduction of [Ph3C] [B(C6F5)4] into the reaction mixture containing rac - (EBI)ZrMe2 led to in situ generation of cationic [rac-(EBI)Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2]+ species that can polymerize propylene to give iPP showing a meso pentad value of <nUm> % . the catalyst system rac - <nUm> / MAO exhibited an increase of activity as the [Al] / [Zr] ratio increased within an experimental range ( [Al] / [Zr] = 930-6511 ) . the meso pentad values of the resulting iPPs were in the range of <nUm> - <nUm> % . the catalytic activity showed a maximum ( rp = <nUm> × <nUm> g PP / mol Zr h atm ) when [Zr] was <nUm> × 10-6 mol / L in the propylene polymerization according to the concentration of catalyst . MAO - free polymerization of propylene was performed by a rac - <nUm> / AlR3 / noncoordinating anion catalytic system . the efficiency of AlR3 was decreased in the order of AlMe3 ( rp = <nUm> × <nUm> g PP / mol Zr h atm ) > Al(i-Bu)3 ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > AlPr3 ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > Al(i-Bu)2H ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > AlEt3 ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) . the performance of the noncoordinating anion as a cocatalyst was on the order of [HNMePh2][B(C6F5)4] ( rp , = <nUm> × <nUm> g PP / mol Zr h atm ) > [HNMe2Ph] [B(C6F5)4] ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > [Ph3C] [B(C6F5)4] ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > [HNEt2Ph][B(C6F5)4] ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) . the properties of iPP were characterized by 13C - NMR , FTIR , DSC , GPC , and viscometry . 
13C NMR spectroscopic studies of the in situ polymerization of 13C - enriched ethylene ( 13C2H4 ) in the presence of Cp2Zr(13CH3)2 and methylaluminoxane or BC18F15 as cocatalysts were carried out . the first direct observation of Cp2Zr-polymeryl species was made . the in situ polymerization experiments in the presence of different concentrations of dinuclear [(Cp2ZrMe)2(m-Me)]+ and mononuclear cation species [Cp2ZrMe]+ , having [MeB(C6F5)3]- or [MeMAO]- counterions , were performed . these comparisons made it possible to make the assignments of the zirconocene complexes bearing the polymeryl chain as ligands [Cp2Zr13CH2P]+[13CH 3MAO]- , [Cp2Zr13CH2P]+[13CH 3B(C6F5)3]- , and Cp2Zr(13CH2P)(13CH3) . they are in equilibrium with each other . mononuclear Zr - polymeryl ion pairs such as [Cp2Zr13CH2P]+[13CH 3B(C6F5)3]- and [Cp2Zr13CH2P]+[13CH 3MAO]- either are the propagating active species or are intermediates , closely related to the active species , in the polymer propagation . 
metallocene / borate catalysts , generated from zirconocene dimethyl compounds , LnZrMe2 , and anilinium borate , [HNMe2Ph]+[B(C6F5)4] - , were used to copolymerize 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene with 1-hexene and 4-methyl-1-pentene . the selected zirconocenes , bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium(IV) dimethyl ( Cp*2ZrMe2 ) and rac-ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium(IV) dimethyl ( rac - EB(THI)ZrMe2 ) , provided atactic and isotactic materials , respectively . the isotactic polymers produced were amorphous or crystalline depending of the monomer . the calculated reactivity ratios for the copolymerization of 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene with 1-hexene and metallocene rac-EB(T-HI)ZrMe2 indicate that this system approximates an ideal azeotropic copolymerization with r1 = <nUm> and r2 = <nUm> . estimates for the reactivity ratios for the copolymerization of 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene with 4-methyl-1-pentene were r1 = <nUm> and r2 = <nUm> for rac - EB(THI)ZrMe2 and r1 = <nUm> and r2 = <nUm> for Cp*2ZrMe2 . the polymerization of 1-hexene in the presence of the saturated 1-N,N-diisopropylaminopentane with rac - EBCTHDZrMe2 / borate was compared with analogous copolymerizations of 1-hexene / 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene . the aminopentene was more effective than the aminopentane in inhibiting the rate of total monomer conversion , implicating both intra- and intermolecular mechanisms for inhibition by the amine . copolymers of 4-methyl-1-pentene / 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene produced with rac-ethylenebisindenyl zirconium(IV) dimethyl ( rac - EBIZrMe2 ) / borate have higher decomposition temperatures with increasing amounts of aminopentene . this copolymer can be protonated with ClH to yield a methanol - soluble material . 
alkyl zirconocenes [Zr(e-C5H4R)2X2] ( where r = CH2Ph , x = Cl 1a or me 1b ; r = CHPh2 , x = Cl 2a or me 2b ; r = Si(SiMe3)3 , x = Cl 4a or me 4b ) and for comparison [ Zr(e-C5H5)(e-C5H4CH 2Ph)Cl2 ] 3a were prepared and characterised . the reactions of these compounds with the methide abstracting reagents BC18F15 , B(o-C6F5C6F4)3 and [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4] - were investigated by low temperature NMR spectroscopy . compound 1b reacts with [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4] - to form the homodinuclear complex [ {Zr(e-C5H4CH2Ph)2Me} 2(m-Me)]+[B(C6F5) 4]- . the related compound [ {Zr(C5H4CH2Ph)2Me} 2(m-Me)]+[MeB(C6F5) 3]- 5a was formed from the reaction of 1b with <nUm> equivalent of BC18F15 . reaction between 1b and <nUm> equivalent BC18F15 gave [ Me(e-C5H4CH2Ph) 2Zr(m-Me)B(C6F5)3 ] 6a and the ion pair [Zr(e-C5H4CH2Ph)2Me][MeB(C 6F5)3 ] 6b which are in equilibrium with each other . A similar observation was made when 2b was used instead of 1b . the sterically more demanding 4b does not show this behaviour . the role of the ligands in ethylene polymerisation was investigated . 
three possible mechanisms of ethylene polymerization in the presence of zirconocene catalysts have been described through density functional calculations . about <nUm> structures ( reactants , intermediates , transition states , and products ) have been located on the potential energy surface . only two mechanisms , called frontside and stepwise backside , appear to be competitive . the frontside mechanism has already been described in the literature , but we present here some important new aspects . In particular , we discuss the important role of the perpendicular form of the olefin p-complex for the frontside process . the stepwise backside mechanism is reported for the first time . the energy barriers in both mechanisms are on the order of <nUm> kcal / mol , which is compatible with the experimental and theoretical values available for similar processes . the energy difference between both mechanisms is certainly below the computational method accuracy , and a definitive conclusion regarding the most favorable mechanism can not be drawn . the influence of other factors such as substituents on the catalysts or the size of the polymer chain could be fundamental . 
novel fl / iya - metallocene complexes containing bis(indenyl) ligands bridged at <nUm> position were obtained . ethylene or trimethylene bridged type zirconocene was synthesized from bis(p-tolyl)ethane or bis(p-tolyl)propane as starting material , respectively . dimethylsilylene bridged type zirconocene was prepared from the protected 4-bromo-l-indanone derivative . it turned out that meso-C2H4[4,4'(2,7-dimethylindenyl)2]ZrCl2 and 7-flc-Me2Si[4,4'-(2-methylindenyl)2]ZrCl2 were suitable catalysts for producing ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers ith high molecular weight . highly isotactic polypropylene was obtained by using rac-MejSiXS-methyl-l-phenylindenyOJZrClj catalyst and contained only small amounts of 3,1-type regiodefects . the molecular structures of these complexes were confirmed by x-ray analysis . novel fl / iya - metallocene complexes containing bis(indenyl) ligands bridged at <nUm> position were obtained . ethylene or trimethylene bridged type zirconocene was synthesized from bis(p-tolyl)ethane or bis(p-tolyl)propane as starting material , respectively . dimethylsilylene bridged type zirconocene was prepared from the protected 4-bromo-l-indanone derivative . it turned out that meso-C2H4[4,4'(2,7-dimethylindenyl)2]ZrCl2 and 7-flc-Me2Si[4,4'-(2-methylindenyl)2]ZrCl2 were suitable catalysts for producing ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers ith high molecular weight . highly isotactic polypropylene was obtained by using rac-MejSiXS-methyl-l-phenylindenyOJZrClj catalyst and contained only small amounts of 3,1-type regiodefects . the molecular structures of these complexes were confirmed by x-ray analysis . copyright

analysis of the published data on the interaction between the components of a zirconocene-poly(methylaluminoxane) system used as the catalyst of olefin polymerization indicates that the yield of the reaction product , methane , is virtually independent of the concentration of the components over a wide concentration range . it is assumed that methane is formed in the absence of the monomer on the catalytic site of polymerization formed by the interaction of the major components and the activating admixtures , including uncontrollable admixtures ( H2O , O ) . under specified conditions , it is the admixtures that control the concentration of the catalytic centers and the methane yield . for this reason , the yield of methane is independent of the concentration of zirconocene and poly(methylaminoxane) . 
copolymerization of ethylene / 1-octene with three ansa - zirconocene / MAO catalyst systems were investigated . the polymerization activity is dependent upon the influence of electronic effects . it decreases in the following order ; C 6H <nUm> ( CH <nUm> ) 2Cp 2ZrCl <nUm> > C 5H 3N(CH <nUm> ) 2Cp 2ZrCl <nUm> > CH 3N(CH <nUm> ) 2ZrCl <nUm> . the composition and sequence distribution of copolymer were calculated from 13C - NMR spectra . it was found that the activityes of three ansacatalysts were lower than Et(Ind) 2ZrCl <nUm> under the same 1-octeone concentration . and their copolymer had lower 1-octene incorporation than that of Et(Ind) 2ZrCl <nUm> . other properties such as molecular wieght , melting point of copolymer were compared . 
unexpected inactive byproducts were observed in the catalytic polymerization of acetylene using metallocene alkyne complexes Cp2M(L)(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) , <nUm> : m = Ti , without L ; <nUm> : m = Zr , L = thf . the reaction of <nUm> was investigated in detail by NMR to give quantitatively at <nUm> ° C the titanacyclopentadiene Cp2Ti-CH = CH - C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3) ( 3 ) . around <nUm> ° C <nUm> starts to rearrange to yield the dihydroindenyl complex <nUm> via coupling of one cp - ligand with the titanacyclopentadiene . In the reaction of <nUm> under analogous conditions a zirconacyclopentadiene Cp2Zr-CH = CH - C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3) ( 5 ) and the dimeric complex [ Cp2Zr(C(SiMe3) = CH(SiMe3) ] 2[m-s(1,2)-C ≡ C ] ( 6 ) were observed . whereas <nUm> decomposes to a mixture of unidentified paramagnetic species , <nUm> was isolated and investigated by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray analysis . In the reaction of rac-(ebthi)Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) ( ebthi = ethylenbis-tetrahydroindenyl ) with 2-ethynyl-pyridine the complex rac - (ebthi)ZrC(SiMe3) = CH(SiMe3)](s-C ≡ CPy ) <nUm> was obtained , which was investigated by an x-ray analysis . 
the catalytic activity of Cp2ZrCl2 supported on MgCl2(THF)2 with MAO as a cocatalyst , was investigated in low - pressure polymerization of ethylene . this catalyst system was found to be active [ <nUm> kg PE / ( g zr*h ) ] and stable during the polymerization process . the PE obtained has a narrow molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) ; its molecular weight ( mw ) was about <nUm> <nUm> . the kinetic investigation of the polymerization process revealed <nUm> % of the zirconium atoms to be involved in the formation of catalytic active sites . 
organometallic complexes , based on group IV metals , are of special fundamental and technological interest due to their important catalytic applications in many organic syntheses , including olefin polymerization and activation of small molecules . In this chapter , the orbital nature of excited states of organometallic p-complexes , based on group IV metals in the d0 electronic configuration , is surveyed , and their photophysical characteristics are discussed . emphasis is given to redox , photophysical , photochemical properties , and their generalization regarding extremely rare ligand - to - metal charge transfer ( LMCT ) excited states of group IV metallocenes , experimental quantities of the highest occupied ( HOMO ) and lowest unoccupied ( LUMO ) molecular orbitals , a trend in the HOMO-LUMO energy gap upon structural variations in the complexes . experimental key relations ehv ∝ DEredox are demonstrated for early transition metals ( Ti , Zr , and Hf ) . combination of photophysical and electrochemical methods provides first experimental estimate of both HOMO and LUMO relative energies and the HOMO- LUMO energy gap in organometallic p-complexes , having an early transition metal . the tendency in the observed photophysics ( absorption and luminescence spectra , experimental and radiative lifetimes , and emission quantum efficiencies ) in the homologous group IVB metallocenes is discussed in view of the nature of a d0 metal ion and coordination sphere of organometallic complexes . A d0 zirconocene dichloride is reported as a first group IV metal complex , possessing LMCT excited states with remarkable emission quantum yield ( up to <nUm> ) and excited - state lifetime ( in the range of microseconds ) in fluid solutions at room temperature surpassing those of pure LMCT excited states , reported in up - to - date literature . A photophysical approach to estimate the orbital nature of extremely long - lived LMCT excited states and coordinative interactions of basic components of catalytic systems for polymerization ( d0 bent metallocene precatalysts and unsaturated hydrocarbon substrates ) are discussed . orbital interactions between d0 bent metallocenes , unsaturated hydrocarbons , and organic solvents are rationalized in terms of microscopic ( electronic and structural peculiarities ) , rather than macroscopic ( dielectric constants , viscosity , etc. ) properties of the solvent molecules . the photophysical approach is highlighted to enable studying intermolecular ( including fine coordinative ) interactions in homogeneous systems with catalytic concentrations of metal complexes that can not be achieved by other conventional physico - chemical methods . 
the norbornene / ethylene copolymerization was investigated by using me 2SiCp 2MtCl <nUm> ( Mt = Zr , TO / MAO catalyst system . the copolymerization kinetics was studied under different conditions . the copolymer was characterized by DSC and 13C - NMR methods . it was found the zirconocene has better catalyst ability for copolymerization of ethylene and norbornene than titanocene . under similar feed ratio , the copolymers with high norbornene content and glass transition temperature were synthesized compared with literature . 
two tetramethyldisiloxanediyl bridged binuclear titanocenes Cl 2CpTiCp * ( CH <nUm> ) 2SiOSi(CH <nUm> ) 2Cp * TiCpCl <nUm> ( cp * = substituted cyclopendienyl , r = H in catalyst A , r = Si(CH <nUm> ) <nUm> in catalyst B ) have been synthesized by the reacting dilithium salts of cp * ( CH <nUm> ) 2SiOSi(CH <nUm> ) 2Cp * with CpTiCl <nUm> in the yields of <nUm> % and <nUm> % respectively . their catalysis behavior for the polymerization of ethylene under different conditions were investigated , and compared with mononuclear metallocene , cyclopentadienyl-titanium dichloride . the result showed that these two catalysts have a middle activity for ethylene polymerization . the MWD of the polyethylene were rather wide and the highest molecular weight was as high as <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> g / mol . furthermore , catalyst B exhibited unexpected temperature dependence for ethylene polymerization . 
seven new binuclear titanocenes with different linking bridges , unsubstituted or substituted on the cp rings , were synthesized and tested for their effect on ethylene polymerization in the presence of MAO . the polyethylenes thus obtained had broad MWD or even bimodal GPC curves , as compared with that from two reference mononuclear titanocenes . this is explained by the difference in degree of steric hindrance around the active center sites imposed by the bulky substituted ligands assuming different configurations in the rotation of the catalyst molecules . lower polymerization temperatures alleviate the effect of these configuration differences , as reflected in change in MW and mw / Mn . this effect is not caused by decomposition or disproportionation of the binuclear titanocenes as evidenced by the stability of the catalyst . 
analysis of the published data on the interaction between the components of a zirconocene-poly(methylaluminoxane) system used as the catalyst of olefin polymerization indicates that the yield of the reaction product , methane , is virtually independent of the concentration of the components over a wide concentration range . it is assumed that methane is formed in the absence of the monomer on the catalytic site of the process formed by the interaction of the major components and the activating admixtures , including uncontrollable admixtures ( H2O , O ) . under specified conditions , it is the admixtures that control the concentration of the catalytic centers and the methane yield . for this reason , the yield of methane is independent of the concentration of zirconocene and poly(methylaminoxane) . 
the syntheses of the doubly - [SiMe2] - bridged zirconocene complexes , (Me2Si)2{e5-C5H 2-4-CHMe2}{e5-C5H-3,5-(CHMe 2)2}ZrR2 ( r = Cl ( 2 ) ; r = CH2Ph ( 3 ) ; r = CH3 ( 4 ) ) are described . the structure of (Me2Si)2{e5-C5H 2-4-CHMe2}{e5-C5H-3,5-(CHMe 2)2}-Zr(CH2Ph)2 ( 3 ) has been examined by single crystal x-ray diffraction methods . it crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-1 , with a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> , β = <nUm> , γ = <nUm> ° and z = <nUm> . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> are active stereospecific pre-catalysts for the [Ph3C] [B(C6F5)4] co-catalyzed polymerization of 1-pentene . polymerization reactions at low temperature in liquid monomer produced poly(1-pentene) with syndiotactic microstructure and narrow molecular weight distribution . by contrast , in 1-pentene / toluene solutions a broad molecular weight distribution is observed . under all conditions examined <nUm> / MAO systems produced high molecular weight , highly syndiotactic poly-1-pentene with narrow molecular weight distributions . A . 
the tantalum carborane complex (Et2C2B4H4)CpTaMe2 ( 1 ) is thermally stable but undergoes clean photochemical insertion with alkynes to give vinyltantalum species , in contrast to the thermal reactivity of isoelectronic group <nUm> metallocenes which give methylidene intermediates . certain tantalum vinyltitanium products display NMR resonances indicative of g-agostic Ta-H3C interactions sufficiently strong to stabilize two different regioisomers . decomposition of these species occurs by apparent alkyne deinsertion and ejection of the tantalum fragment to give R2Et2C4B4H4 ( r = me , et , ph ) carborane clusters . the analogous diphenyl complex (Et2C2B4H4)CpTaPh2 ( 8 ) is thermally reactive , eliminating benzene and undergoing trapping reactions of the derived benzyne intermediate with alkynes . the structures of the resulting metallaindene complexes are supported by x-ray crystallography , protonolysis , and spectroscopy . insertions occur with good regioselectivity , controlled by steric and stereoelectronic factors that differ somewhat from those observed for zirconocene and titanocene analogues . reaction of complex <nUm> with excess styrene results in a novel triple - insertion process in which styrene units are added to both ortho positions of an aryl ligand and to the central boron atom of the B3C2 ring . the proposed mechanism ( supported by the use of styrene-d8 and alkylated metallacarborane starting materials ) features two benzyne intermediates , derived from activation of both ortho-CH bonds , and one insertion into a putative Ta-B bond . an important hypothesis is that a Ta-C fragment can undergo intramolecular insertion into a carborane B-H bond , a step unknown for cyclopentadienyl C-H bonds and one that is potentially relevant to the use of metallacarborane complexes as catalysts for olefin polymerization and related processes . 
ethylene-bridged bis(N,N-diisopropyl-1-aminoboratabenzene-4-yl)zirconium dichloride ( 5a ) , dimethylsilyl-bridged bist(N,N-diisopropyl-1-aminoboratabenzene-4-yl)zirconium dichloride ( 7a ) , and dimethylmethylene-bridged (cyclopentadienyl)(N,N-diisopropyl-1-aminoboratabenzene-4-yl)zirconium dichloride ( 6a ) have been prepared . x-ray crystal structures of the dimethyl derivatives of <nUm> and <nUm> show that the complexes closely resemble the corresponding ansa - zirconocenes . when activated by excess methylaluminoxane , 5a , 6a , and 7a are catalysts for the polymerization of olefins . 
the alternating copolymerization of styrene ( st ) and ethylene ( et ) with high stereo - regularity were monitored by using rac[isopropylidenebis(benzindenyl)] zirconocene catalysts under reduced temperature conditions . the 13C - NMR spectra of the polymers were measured using a spectrometer . the DSC measurement was carried out under flowing N at a temperature rate of <nUm> ° C / min . In general , significant results were obtained . 
the polymerization behavior of three linear asymmetrically substituted dienes , i.e. 6-phenyl-1,5-hexadiene ( A ) , 7-methyl-1,6-octadiene ( B ) and r(+)-5,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene ( isocitronellene , C ) is reported in order to study the effect of substitution at one vinylic group . homopolymerization of these monomers with the catalyst system rac-Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 / MAO resulted in no reaction products in the case of monomer A and in polymers with mw , = <nUm> kg / mol and mw = <nUm> kg / mol with the monomers B and C , respectively . according to NMR analysis , the vinylene end group of isocitronellene remained untouched during polymerization , which excludes the possibility of cyclopolymerization or crosslinking . copolymerization of isocitronellene with propene resulted in incorporation of the diene ( <nUm> mol- % ) equal to the stoichiometric ratio in the monomer feed , with a relatively high catalyst activity . the degree of incorporated isocitronellene is inversely related to the polymerization temperature , providing control over crystallinity ( isotacticity ) and molecular weight of the copolymer . the isocitronellene homo- and copolymers could be epoxidized quantitatively and brominated to an extent of <nUm> % . perfluorohexyl iodide was grafted onto the isocitronellene / propene copolymer by radical reaction ( conversion <nUm> % ) , yielding a poly(a-olefin) with fluorinated side chains . 
all right reserved . the oligomerizations of 1-decene have been carried out with zirconocene catalysts ( ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , A ; [ μ , m-(Me <nUm> Si ) <nUm> ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ][(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> ) ] <nUm> , B ; [ ( C <nUm> H <nUm> )C(Me) <nUm> ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ) ] <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , C ; tBuNC(Me) <nUm> ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> , d ; ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )C(C <nUm> H <nUm> )(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> , e ; ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )C(Me) <nUm> ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> , F ; ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )C(C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> , g ) in combination with MAO and the effects of the dosage of complex F , reaction temperature and Al / Zr ratio on oligomerization and properties of oligomers were also investigated . it was found that the structure of ligands with different steric effects and electronic effects affected the catalytic behavior greatly , and determined the oligomer 's component and microstructure . among them , cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , silicon bridged binuclear zirconocene complex B and sterically hindered complex C mainly produced low viscosity oligomers ( 100 kv : <nUm> ~ <nUm> cSt , dimer content about <nUm> % ) ; As expected , constrained geometry configuration zirconocene complex d with more open coordination space displayed higher catalytic activity and the kinetics viscosity of oligomer was higher than that of cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( 100 kv about <nUm> ~ <nUm> cSt ) ; it was interested to find that Cs symmetrical zirconocene complexes e , F , g showed higher activity and primarily produced medium - high viscosity oligomers ( 100 kv > <nUm> cSt ) , which was attributed to the special structure of the zirconocene catalysts and different polymerization mechanism . the GC-MS results demonstrated that the oligomer mixture was less isomerization and composed of dimer to pentamer . the optimum reaction conditions involved a dosage of complex F 10mmol , a reaction temperature of 80 , and an Al / Zr ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> . 
two series of solution polymerizations of propene were conducted : ( i ) using three different methylaluminoxane (MAO)-activated zirconocenes , rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( EI ) , rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( MI ) , and rac-Me2Si(Benz-[e]-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( MBI ) , at the same temperature ( <nUm> ° C ) and varying propene pressure from <nUm> to <nUm> bar and ( ii ) using rac-Me2Si(Benz-[e]-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( MBI ) at the propene partial pressure <nUm> bar and at a range of temperatures from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C ( ind = indenyl ) . 1H and 13C NMR investigation of the unsaturated chain end groups in these samples was performed , with particular attention being paid to ( i ) a detailed re-examination of the NMR assignments reported in the literature , ( ii ) the distinction between unsaturated species formed during the polymerization reactions and those formed afterward due to thermal treatment ( i.e. during the NMR experiments ) , ( iii ) determination of the dependence of the quantities of different types of terminals on the polymerization conditions ( temperature and monomer partial pressure ) . it was shown that four unsaturated chain end groups are formed during polymerization , that is , vinylidene , 2-butenyl , allyl , and the previously unidentified 4-butenyl terminals . In the oligomeric fraction of samples , no further types of unsaturated terminals were observed . two further types of unsaturated groups observed , isobutenyl and the unidentified species x , were not formed during polymerization but , at least prevalently , afterward during the high - temperature NMR experiments . A previously unidentified regiomisinsertion , lateral n-butyl , is also described . 
ansa - ligands , me <nUm> Si(RInd) <nUm> [ r = 2-p ( 1 ) and 3-p-tolyl ( 2 ) ] , have been prepared as a mixture of rac- and meso-isomers in a ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> from the reactions of me <nUm> ClSi <nUm> with cyanocuprates of 1-p-tolylindene and 2-p-tolylindene in diethyl ether , respectively . pure rac - isomers , 1r and 2r , have been isolated by fractional recrystallization of <nUm> and <nUm> . thermal diastereomerization of <nUm> and <nUm> between rac- and meso-isomers has been studied by <nUm> H - NMR spectroscopy . these results imply that <nUm> and <nUm> undergo the diastereomerization process by migration of silicon moiety and hydrogen atom , respectively . ansa - zirconocenes , me <nUm> Si(RInd) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> [ r = 2-p ( 3 ) and 3-p-tolyl ( 4 ) ] , have been prepared from the reactions of the corresponding dilithiated ligands with ClZr <nUm> in diethyl ether and hexane at <nUm> ° C . the molecular structure of rac-3 has been determined by a single crystal x-ray diffraction study . propylene polymerization has been studied using rac-3 and meso-4 in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . catalyst rac-3 produces a highly isotactic polypropylene ( PP ) at <nUm> ° C by the enantiomorphic site control mechanism and meso-4 affords a syndiotactic dominant PP having a rr triad of <nUm> % at - <nUm> ° C by the chain end control mechanism . A . 
the organotin compound (e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)tin tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( 1 ) has been synthesized from a reaction between (pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)tin chloride and lithium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate . this cation proved to be an effective ziegler - natta a-olefin cocatalyst . activities for ethylene polymerizations using dimethylzirconocene and <nUm> were <nUm> × <nUm> g of PE / ( mol of 1*[C2H4]*h ) at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> × <nUm> g of PE / ( mol of 1*[C2H4]*h ) at <nUm> ° C . this system was also effective for the polymerization of propylene . activities using rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)-dimethylzirconium with the tin cation were <nUm> × <nUm> g of PP / ( mol of 1*[C3H6]*h ) . activities increased markedly when using zirconocene dichlorides / tri(i-butyl)aluminum / <nUm> . activities for ethylene polymerization using zirconocene dichloride / tri(i-butyl)aluminum / <nUm> at <nUm> ° C were <nUm> × <nUm> g of PE / ( mol of 1*[C2H4]*h ) . activities for the polymerization of propylene using rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride / tri(i-butyl)aluminum / <nUm> at <nUm> ° C were <nUm> × <nUm> g of PP / ( mol of 1*[C3H6]*h ) . 
reactions of Cp2Zr(thf)(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ( 1 ) and rac-(ebthi)Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) ( <nUm> ; ebthi = 1,2-ethylene-1,1'-bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl) ) with 2-vinylpyridine lead , under elimination of the alkyne , to the five - membered azazirconacycles , which are best described as 1-zircona-2-azacyclopent-3-enes ( 1-azadiene complexes ) . one of these complexes couples with ethylene to yield a stable a-2-pyridyl-substituted zirconacyclopentane and reacts in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio with water to yield a b-2-pyridyl-substituted dimeric s-ethylzirconoxane . In the reaction of the 2-derived complex with BF4H , rac-[1,2-ethylene-1,1'-bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl)]zirconium difluoride was obtained . both 1-zircona-2-azacyclopent-3-enes insert carbon dioxide to give structurally different binuclear carbonate - bridged complexes . 
titanocene complexes based on an amido-fluorenyl ligand bridged by a dimethylsilylene group , ( e1-:e5-C13H8SiMe 2NCMe3)TiCl2 ( 3 ) and ( e1:e5-C13H8SiMe 2NCMe3)TiMe2 ( 5 ) , have been synthesized . reaction of <nUm> with <nUm> equiv of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] ( 2 ) was almost quantitative to give the " cationic " compound [ ( e1:e5-C13H8SiMe 2NCMe3)TiMe]+[B(C6F 5)4]- ( 1 ) , as identified on the basis of elemental analyses and spectroscopic properties . the " cation " <nUm> was highly active and stereoselective in the copolymerization of ethylene ( e ) and styrene ( S ) , depending upon the polymerization conditions , to produce predominantly a new microstructural E-S copolymer ( together with some polyethylene homopolymer ) with an activity of ( <nUm> - <nUm> ) × <nUm> g of bulk polymer / ( mol of ti*mol of total monomers*h ) . As thoroughly characterized by solvent extraction , GPC , 13C NMR , DSC , and DMA , the E-S copolymer obtained by catalyst <nUm> proved to be a perfectly alternating copolymer with well - defined isotactic polystyrene structure , together with a single glass transition ( tg = <nUm> ° C ) and melting temperature of <nUm> ° C . the findings obtained by catalyst <nUm> suggest that the structure of the active species with the bulkier fluorenyl substituent and the following alternating site migratory insertion of comonomer in the chain propagation is responsible for the preferentially alternating , isotactic comonomer incorporation . 
with mononuclear half - titanocenes such as CpTiCl <nUm> , IndTiCl <nUm> , and me <nUm> CpTiCl <nUm> , as well as the constrained geometry catalyst ( CGC ) and a new dinuclear hexamethyltrisiloxanediylbis(cyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride ) ( TSDT ) , the copolymerization of styrene and ethylene was examined . the thermal properties and structure of copolymerization products were investigated with differential scanning calorimetry and <nUm> C - nuclear magnetic resonance . In addition , the raw polymer was separated into homopolymer and copolymer with an extraction method and cross fractionation chromatography . with the above analysis , it was concluded that the raw polymer obtained with CpTiCl <nUm> and IndTiCl <nUm> was a mixture of syndiotactic polystyrene and polyethylene homopolymers with 10-30 wt % copolymer , whereas that produced by me <nUm> CpTiCl <nUm> and TSDT was a homopolymer mixture with a negligible amount of copolymer . only CGC produced the copolymer of styrene and ethylene perfectly . 
{ [ 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl ] cyclopentadienyl } titanium trichloride ( CpNTiCl3 , <nUm> ) was activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) to catalyze polymerizations of ethylene ( e ) , propylene ( P ) , ethylidene norbornene ( ENB ) , vinylcyclohexene ( VCH ) , and 1,4-hexadiene ( HD ) . the dependence of homopolymerization activity ( A ) of <nUm> / MAO on olefin concentration ( [M]n ) is n = <nUm> ± <nUm> for e and n = <nUm> ± <nUm> for P . the value of n is <nUm> ± <nUm> for CpTiCl3 / MAO catalysis of ethylene polymerization ; this system does not polymerize propylene . <nUm> / MAO catalyzes HD polymerization at one - tenth of AH for 1-hexene , probably because of chelation effects in the HD case . the copolymerization of e and P has reactivity ratios of rE = <nUm> and rP = <nUm> at <nUm> ° C , and rErP = <nUm> , which suggests <nUm> / MAO may be a multisite catalyst . the copolymerization activity of CpTiCl3 / MAO is <nUm> times smaller than that of CpNTiCl3 / MAO . terpolymerization of e / P / ENB has A of <nUm> g of polymer / ( mol of Ti h ) , incorporates up to <nUm> mol % ( ̃ <nUm> wt % ) of ENB , and high MW 's of <nUm> to <nUm> x <nUm> . all of these parameters are surprisingly insensitive to the ENB concentration . the e / P / VCH terpolymerization has comparable A value of ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) x <nUm> g / ( mol of Ti h ) . the incorporation of VCH in terpolymer increases with increasing [VCH] . terpolymerization with HD occurs at about one - third of the A of either ENB or VCH ; the product HD - EPDM is low in molecular weight and contains less than <nUm> % of HD . these terpolymerization results are compared with those obtained previously for three zirconocene precursors : rac-ethylenebis(1-e5-inde-nyl) dichlorozirconium ( 6 ) , rac- ( dimethylsilylene ) bis ( 1-e5-indenyl ) dichlorozirconium ( 7 ) , and ethylenebis(9-e5-fluorenyl)dichlorozirconium ( 8 ) . the last compound is a particularly poor terpolymerization catalyst ; it incorporates very little VCH or HD and no ENB at all . <nUm> / MAO is a better catalyst for e / P / VCH terpolymerization , while <nUm> / MAO is superior in e / P / HD terpolymerization . 
unbridged 2-arylindenylmetallocene complexes such as bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) are catalyst precursors for the synthesis of elastomeric polypropylenes . these catalysts are also active for the copolymerization of ethylene and propylene . addition of small amounts of ethylene to a polymerization system derived from the 2-arylindene metallocenes results in a large and nonlinear increase in the polymerization rate . this increase in rate can not be explained by the faster rate of ethylene insertion but is likely the result of the activation of dormant catalyst sites by ethylene . this " ethylene effect " is much larger for bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride / MAO ( (2PhInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO , <nUm> / MAO ) and bis[2-(3',5'-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)indenyl]-zirconium dichloride / MAO ((CF3)2PhInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO , <nUm> / MAO ) metallocene catalysts than for bridged racethylene-bis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride / MAO ( EBIZrCl2 / MAO , <nUm> / MAO ) metallocene . copolymerization parameters for 1-3 / MAO reveal that the unbridged 2-arylindene catalysts show a tendency toward random or slightly blocky incorporation of comonomers ( rerp = <nUm> - <nUm> ≥ <nUm> ) , whereas the ansa - metallocene <nUm> / MAO exhibits a tendency toward alternating comonomer distribution ( rerp = <nUm> < <nUm> ) . 
analysis of the published data on the interaction between the components of a zirconocene-poly(methylaluminoxane) system used as the catalyst of olefin polymerization indicates that the yield of the reaction product , methane , is virtually independent of the concentration of the components over a wide concentration range . it is assumed that methane is formed in the absence of the monomer on the catalytic site of polymerization formed by the interaction of the major components and the activating admixtures , including uncontrollable admixtures ( H2O , O ) . under specified conditions it is the admixtures that control the concentration of the catalytic centers and the methane yield . for this reason , the yield of methane is independent of the concentration of zirconocene and poly(methylaminoxane) . 
the kinetics of propene polymerization in the liquid monomer medium and the properties of the resulting iso-PP were studied in relation to the interannular bridge nature , (CH2)2Ind2ZrCl2 ( I ) , (CH3)2SiInd2ZrCl2 ( II ) , (CH3)2CInd2ZrCl2 ( III ) , and asymmetric (CH3)(cyclo-C3H5)CInd2ZrCl <nUm> ( IV ) , in MAO - activated 1,1'-bridged bisindenyl zirconocene dichlorides . data are also given for the non-bridged (2-Ph-C9H6)2ZrCl2 ( V ) system used under similar conditions . the systems based on zirconocene III are most active and that based on II is most stable . the replacement of one methyl group in the CH2 < bridge by a cyclopropyl group ( compounds III and IV ) results in the depressed initial activity and in the greater deactivation of the system during the process of polymerization . the stereoblock polymer was formed with the catalyst system based on metallocene V , used under similar experimental conditions . 
A procedure for supporting syndiospecific zirconocene on OSi <nUm> opens up a way of retaining the syndiospecificity of metallocene catalyst . the effects of supporting temperature , time and initial concentration of metallocene on the supported amount of metallocene were investigated . using these supported catalysts for propylene polymerization , it is possible to reduce the consumption of cocatalyst MAO ( methylaluminoxane ) and produce syndiotactic polypropylene in high syndiotacticity . if partial MAO was replaced by triisobutylaluminium , it would be shown that the catalytic activity of these catalysts increases greatly . 
the kinetics of propylene polymerization using homogeneous Cp2ZrCl2 / methylalumoxane ( MAO ) catalysts have been investigated at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> atm of propylene pressure . the effects of [Al] / [Zr] and [Zr] on the catalyst activity were studied . it was found that MAO plays a critical role in catalyst activation and deactivation . by assuming the coexistence of two dynamic equilibria between active species and inactive ones which are the products of zirconocene dimerization and zirconocene - MAO complexation , a kinetic model was proposed . the model could satisfactorily explain most of the experimental results . 
electroconductivities of zirconocene complex - derived catalytic system solutions were measured to identify the ionic particles generated by the catalyst activators and to follow the ionic species formed in the absence and presence of olefins . several organoaluminum compounds ( OAC ) and polymethylalumoxane ( MAO ) were studied as metallocene activators . the specific electroconductivity of the solution of each metallocene complex examined in solvents varying in polarity , activated both with OAC and MAO , was always higher than that of the starting reactants . the electroconductivity value and the olefin polymerization rate were found to vary concurrently . the data obtained show that it is possible to trace the ionic particles generated during the formation of active species and their changes in the course of polymerization reaction . 
the synthesis and activity as precatalysts for stereoregular a-olefin polymerization of the chiral C1 - symmetric zirconocene complexes (R)- and (S)-Me2Si(e5-C13H 16)(e-C5H3R*)ZrR2 ) , where C13H16 = octahydrofluorenyl , r = NMe2 , Cl , or me , and R* = (1R,2S,5R)-trans-5-methyl-cis-2-(2-propyl)cyclohexyl ( (-)-menthyl ) , are described . 
catalytic behavior was examined in the series of 2- and 1-substituted bisindenyl zirconium and hafnium complexes , (2-PhInd)2ZrCl2 , (2-PhInd)2HfCl2 , (2-p-TolInd)2ZrCl2 , (2-p-TolInd)2HfCl2 , (1-MeInd)2ZrCl2 , (1-i-PrInd)2HfCl2 , (1-cyclo-C6H11Ind)2ZrCl2 , (2-n-BuInd)2ZrCl2 , and (2-All-Ind)2ZrCl2 . 2-Ph - substituted zirconocene showed higher activity in ethylene polymerization than did the unsubstituted indenyl complex under similar conditions , and provided polyethylene of the higher molecular weight . these catalytic features suggest the increase in activity to be caused probably by an increase in chain propagation rate . the lower productivity of (2-p-Tol-Ind)2ZrCl2 complex compared to (2-PhInd)2ZrCl2 is attributed to the electron donating effect of the methyl substituent at the phenyl ring suppressing the effect of the aryl substituent . the two hafnium analogs showed considerably lower activity as compared with zirconium complexes , the feature commonly observed on replacement of zirconium by hafnium . the most pronounced effect of 1-substituents on the metallocene activity was observed for the 1-Me-and 1-i-Pr - substituted complexes . the activities of the complexes examined in ethylene polymerization were found to be linearly correlated with the electronic and steric substituent characteristics . 
the mechanisms of chain initiation ( reaction <nUm> ) and chain propagation leading to linear and methyl-branched polymers ( reactions <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ) as well as chain - transfer ( or chain - termination ) reactions including associative displacement ( reaction <nUm> ) b-H elimination ( reaction <nUm> ) , H exchange ( reaction <nUm> ) , and hydrogenolysis ( reaction <nUm> ) of transition - metal - catalyzed ethylene polymerization have been compared for different metal atoms in the diimine - M(II) complexes ( where m = Ni , Pd , and Pt ) on one hand , and between diimine - M(II) and zirconocene complexes on the other . the rate - determining step of reactions <nUm> and <nUm> is the migratory insertion of the olefin into a metal - alkyl bond for both diimine-M(II)- and zirconocene - based catalysts . under the same conditions , zirconocenes are slightly more active catalysts than the diimine - Ni (II) complex , with the catalytic activity of the diimine - M(II) complex decreasing as Ni > Pd > Pt . the resting stage of the process is a metal-olefin-alkyl complex , and the larger the stability of the complex , the higher the barrier height for migratory insertion . both chain - propagation reactions , <nUm> and <nUm> , start from the b-agostic intermediate . reaction <nUm> for linear chain growth begins with a barrierless bimolecular reaction of coordination of the next olefin , while reaction <nUm> for branched growth begins as a unimolecular b-hydride-elimination reaction with an activation barrier . higher temperatures should increase and higher ethylene pressures should decrease the branching . the barrier heights indicate that ( i ) the zirconocenes will produce a higher ratio of linear to methyl-branched polyethylene than the diimine - M(II) and ( ii ) the linear / branched ratio will be larger for the diimine - Ni (II) than its Pd analog . among the chain - termination mechanisms studied , the associative - displacement mechanism <nUm> where the coordinating olefin exchanges with ethylene from solution is likely to be a preferred one for diimine - M(II) - based processes . the C-H activation and H - exchange chain - termination mechanisms , which are favorable for zirconocenes , are inefficient for diimine - M(II) . hydrogenolysis is another favorable chain - termination process for both the diimine - M(II) and zirconocene in the presence of gaseous hydrogen . 
metallocene / tetramethylaluminoxane ( MAO ) catalysts control the tacticity and the molecular weight and its distribution in the polymer . zirconocene and hafnocene catalysts copolymerize ethene with cyclic olefins such as norbornene and dimethanooctahydronaphthalene ( DMON ) to yield copolymers with the double bond , rather than the ring , opened to extend the chain . these products are atactic and have interesting properties . syndiotactic polystyrene , mp as high as <nUm> ° C , is another class of tailor - made ( titanocene / MAO ) - catalyzed polymers . with the fluorinated ( CpTiF3 ) substituted for the chlorinated ( CpTiCl3 ) titanocenes , the activity rose by a factor of <nUm> - <nUm> . the two types of polymers were studied with numerous metallocenes used as catalysts . nine metallocenes were used to study their activity in the copolymerization of ethylene with cycloolefins . the reactivities of comonomers were established in the ethylene - DMON systems catalyzed by zircono- and hafnocenes . titanocenes proved to be much more active than the systems involving alkoxy-derivatives Ti(OR)4 [14] . 
highly active syndiotactic - specific catalyst for the polymerization of styrene are obtained by mixing cp* TiMe <nUm> with [ ph 3C ] + [ B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - in the mole ratio <nUm> : <nUm> , producing <nUm> % syndiotactic PS at an activity of <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> gPS / molTi · h . treatment of [ cp* TiMe <nUm> ] with [ ph 3C ] +[B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - results in the formation of [ cp* TiMe <nUm> ] + [ B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - complex , which is a good source in solution of the cationic species [ cp* TiMe <nUm> ] + . both activity and syndiospecificity of the " cationic " catalyst are no less than the cp* TiMe <nUm> / MAO and cp* Ti(OPh) <nUm> / MAO catalysts , but are much more active than cp* TiMe <nUm> / MAO as well as cp* ClTi <nUm> / MAO . the cationic catalyst is a very effective catalyst precursor for the ziegler - natta polymerization of styrene to syndiotactic polystyrene at temperatures ≥ - <nUm> ° C , while the " cationic " contributes to promoting the polymerization of styrene to atactic polystyrene at temperatures ≤ - <nUm> ° C . the molecular weight ( m W ) of sPS increases with the decrease of the temperature , suggesting that lower temperature contributes to reducing the chain transfer and increasing the life of the active species for chain propagation . the T m of the sPS polymerized at - <nUm> - <nUm> ° C is almost constant . the styrene polymerization behaviors were essentially insensitive to the dielectric constant of the polymerization medium . 
with mononuclear half - titanocenes such as CpTiCl3 , IndTiCl3 , Cp*TiCl3 and a siloxane - bridged dinuclear half - titanocene , Cl3Ti-CpSi(CH3)2-O-Si(CH3) 2-O-Si-(CH3)2Cp-TiCl3 cocatalyzed by modified methylaluminoxane , the copolymerization of styrene ( st ) with ethylene(E) , p-methylstyrene ( PMS ) and vinyl naphthalene ( VN ) was carried out , and copolymerization behavior as well as properties of the obtained polymer were examined for each catalyst . In copolymerization of st and e , the mixture of homopolymers , syndiotactic polystyrene and polyethylene , was obtained mainly with a less amount of copolymer , which intimated that these titanocenes are unsuitable for st / e copolymer preparation . by copolymerization of st with PMS , the copolymer was prepared with a enhanced catalyst activity . the melting temperature ( Tm ) and initial decomposition temperature ( tdi ) of copolymer decreased and the difference of Tm and tdi could be controlled with the amount of added PMS . for copolymerization of st and VN , the catalyst activity and Tm of copolymer decreased drastically even with a small amount of VN . 
polypropenes were prepared , both in and without the presence of molecular hydrogen , using the six ansa - zirconocene catalysts rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( I ) , rac-Et(IndH4)2ZrCl2 ( II ) , rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2(III) , rac-Me2Si(2-Me-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( IV ) , rac-Me2Si(Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2(V) , and rac-Me2Si(2-Me-Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2 ( VI ) and also Cp2ZrCl2 ( VII ) [ ind = indenyl ] , under standardized conditions ( <nUm> bar partial pressure of propene in toluene solution , at <nUm> ° C , zirconocenes activated by methylaluminoxane ) . the microstructures of the polymers were investigated in detail by using 1H and 13C NMR and GPC , and relationships between catalyst structures and polymer microstructural features are discussed . hydrogen was found to activate all of the catalysts to differing degrees . trends in hydrogen activation were compared with trends in ( a ) the overall numbers of n-butyl terminals ( resulting from chain transfer to hydrogen following secondary insertion ) , ( b ) the ratios , in the presence of hydrogen , of chain transfer to hydrogen to the other mechanisms which lead to renewed chain growth following secondary insertion , and ( c ) the ratios , in the presence of hydrogen , of sites following primary insertion to sites following secondary insertion . the absence of any clear correlations under these three headings leads to the conclusion that the release by chain transfer to hydrogen of resting states following secondary monomer insertion can not be the only mechanism giving rise to hydrogen activation with these catalysts . 
1-Phenyl-1,4-pentanedione ( 3 ) is selectively converted to the corresponding fulvene - ketone ( 4 ) by treatment with cyclopentadiene in the presence of pyrrolidine . treatment with lithium dimethylcuprate results in selective CH3 - addition at the fulvene carbon and subsequent ring - closure reaction to give <nUm> , which in the presence of lithium diisopropylamide is rapidly dehydrated to yield the bicyclic fulvene <nUm> . its treatment with amalgamated calcium metal leads to reductive fulvene coupling and formation of the calcocene complex ( 10 ) of the substituted 7,7'-bi(tetrahydroindenyl) ligand . only the respective rac - isomer is obtained . hydrolysis of <nUm> followed by double deprotonation with butyllithium yields the corresponding 7,7'-bi(tetrahydroindenyl) dianion equivalent <nUm> . In tetrahydrofuran , <nUm> is cleaved at the 7,7'-linkage with formation of the " monomeric " disproportionation products 11-Li and 12-Li , and treatment of <nUm> with zirconium tetrachloride in THF leads back to the formation of the fulvene <nUm> . transmetalation to zirconium is , however , cleanly achieved when <nUm> is treated with donor - ligand - free Cl4Zr suspended in toluene . the corresponding diastereomerically pure rac-ansa-zirconocene dichloride <nUm> containing the ansa - bridge as part of the a-fused bi(tetrahydroindenyl) ligand system is obtained under these specific conditions . complex <nUm> was characterized by x-ray diffraction , and the outcome of the preliminary propene polymerization experiments is reported . 
syndiospecific styrene polymerization promoted by mixtures of Cp*TiR3 ( r = CH3 , CH2Ph ) with MAO , BC18F15 , and CPh3B(C6F5)4 has been investigated by means of conventional kinetic methods . A first - order kinetics of the monomer in the propagation rate has been determined at <nUm> ° C . At polymerization temperatures higher than <nUm> ° C , the b-H migration from the growing polymer chain to the metal of the active species appears to be the main termination reaction . the average molecular weights of the polymer products depend on the type and coordinating behavior of the counterions ( [MAOX]- , [MeB(C6F5)3]- , [(PhCH2)B(C6F5)3]- ) . the trityl-activated catalysts produce sPS samples with the highest molecular weights . the comparison of the molar concentrations of the active species , determined by kinetic methods , with those of Cp*TiIIIR+ ( r = CH3 , CH2Ph ) evaluated in the polymerization conditions by ESR measurements , confirms the involvement of these complexes in syndioepecific styrene polymerization . 
the kinetics of propylene polymerization with Et(H4Ind)2ZrCl2 / methylalumoxane ( MAO ) catalysts have been investigated at 0-50 ° C and <nUm> atm of propylene pressure . the effects of polymerization temperature , catalyst concentration , and catalyst / cocatalyst mole ratio on the catalyst activity and on the properties of the polypropylene products were studied . by assuming the coexistence of two dynamic equilibria between catalytically active species and two inactive species , which are the products of zirconocene dimerization and excessive zirconocene - MAO complexation , a kinetic model has been developed . this model could satisfactorily explain most of experimental results . 
metallocene catalysts leave a well - characterized fingerprint in the polypropene structures . attempts to expand this catalyst - polymer correlation to ethylene-propene copolymers are presented . the 13C nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) are run on <nUm> % solutions of the copolymers in o-dichlorobenzene ( <nUm> % d2 ) at <nUm> ° C , with a <nUm> second pulse delay and <nUm> ° pulses . observations show that single ethylene monomers are added to regioregular propylene homopolymers , and a high level of ethylene insertion adjacent to a 2,1-propylene insertion . this means that high molecular weight C2C3 copolymers can be synthesized with the incorporation of ethylene for each regioregular insertion . 
the isoselective propene polymerization using the supported catalyst O2Si / MAO / Me2Si(2-Me-Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl <nUm> / AlR3 was investigated and compared with propene polymerization using the corresponding homogeneous catalyst system . the influence of propene concentration , polymerization medium , temperature , comonomer , and external aluminium alkyls on polymerization kinetics and polypropene properties such as molecular mass , stereo- and regioselectivity , morphology , and bulk density was studied . 
recently , the preparation of the first siloxy substituted bis(indenyl) ansa - zirconocene , [ethylenebis(2-(tert-butyldimethylsiloxy)indenyl)]zirconium dichloride and its preliminary application in polymerization of propylene and ethylene has been reported . currently , the structure / property relationships of siloxy substituted metallocenes are being investigated . the polymerization behavior of several complexes is being addressed . this article shows some selected results and summarizes the present status of research . 
this study develops scoping estimates of the required capital investment and manufacturing costs to make a zirconocene catalyst / cocatalyst system [(F6-acen)Zr(CH2C-Me3)(NMe2Ph)][B(C6F5) <nUm> ] immobilized on a specialized silica support . the costs for this fluorine - based system are compared with corresponding estimates for two other metallocene catalysts using methylaluminoxane (MAO)-based cocatalysts . including the weight of the support and cocatalyst , each of the production facilities for making the three zirconocene catalyst systems is sized in the range of <nUm> to <nUm> tonnes per year . the cost to make the F - based catalyst system is estimated to be $ <nUm> / kg , assuming a <nUm> % return on capital invested . by comparison , the costs for the two MAO - based catalyst systems fall in the range of $ <nUm> / kg to $ <nUm> / kg , assuming the same return . within the +/- <nUm> % accuracy of these estimates , these differences are not significant . given a catalyst productivity of <nUm> kg of resin per gram of zirconocene , the cost contribution in the finished ethylene-propylene copolymer resin is <nUm> cents / kg , excluding costs for selling , administration , and research . 
reaction of zirconocene dichloride Cp2ZrCl2 with aromatic polymers bearing a-diketone and a-hydroxyketone fragments was studied . using reactions of Cp2ZrCl2 with benzil and benzoin , which model a-diketone and a-hydroxyketone fragments , it was shown that zirconocene dichloride reacts only with hydroxyketone groups of the polymer through both reaction with OH group and coordination of Zn to the keto group . the prepared polymers are rather stable and can show promise as catalysts for a number of organic reactions . 
copolymerization of ethylene / propylene and ethylene / 1-butene with two zirconocene / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) catalyst systems were investigated . the influences of et bridge between two indenyl groups on the catalyst performances and the properties of copolymer obtained had been discussed . it was found that the activity of bridged et (Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst was higher than that of nonbridged (Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst . the copolymers ( e / P and e / <nUm> - B ) produced with et (Ind)2ZrCl2 had higher comonomer content , lower molecular weight , density and melting point compared with those produced with (Ind)2ZrG2 . 
an investigation has been undertaken by use of ESCA in the characterization of the central metal(Zr) of dichlorozirconocene / methylaluminoxane homogeneous olefin polymerization catalyst . the change of electron density shown by a shift in ESCA signals ( <nUm> <nUm> eV ) indicates that the catalytic species are " cation - like " . within the range of detecting sensitivity of ESCA spectrometer , only a part of the new catalytic derivative was formed . the influence of complexion time and Al : Zr ratio on the formation of the catalytic zirconocene cation has also been investigated . 
with a new trisiloxane - bridged dinuclear zirconocene , hexamethyltrisiloxanediylbis ( cyclopentadienylindenylzirconium dichloride ) ( TSDZ ) Cl2IndZr-CpSi(CH3)2-O-Si-(CH3) 2-O-Si(CH3)2 cp - ZrIndCl2 , the polymerizations of ethylene were carried out in the presence of modified MAO ( MMAO ) as a cocatalyst . the effects of MMAO amount and polymerization temperature ( tp ) on polymerization behaviours of TSDZ were examined and compared with those of mononuclear zirconocenes such as cyclopentadienylindenylzirconium dichloride , biscyclopentadienylzirconium dichloride and bisindenylzirconium dichloride . the catalytic activity of TSDZ was comparable to that of mononuclear zirconocenes , while the weight - average molecular weight ( mk ) and polydispersity index ( MJMk ) of polyethylene ( PE ) prepared with the former were much higher than those of PE with the latter . with increasing MMAO concentration , the catalytic activity increased but mk decreased for TSDZ , as well as mononuclear zirconocenes . with increasing tr the catalytic activity of TSDZ was a maximum at <nUm> ° C while that of mononuclear zirconocenes increased steadily . for increased tr the decrease of mk and MJMk for TSDZ was extraordinary compared to that for mononuclear zirconocenes . 
the copolymerization of propene and octene-1 using rac - Et(Ind) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> / MAO catalyst has been investigated . results show that with increasing the concentration of octene-1 in the system , the catalytic activity increased first and then decreased , the incorporation rate of octene-1 increased , and in consequence , m η , T m , crystallinity of copolymer decreased . the monomer composition and sequence distribution of the copolymers were determined by IR and <nUm> C - NMR . 
living ring - opening polymerization of the cyclic carbonate 1,3-dioxepan-2-one was achieved by using the cationic zirconocene complex [Cp2ZrMe]+[B(C6F5)4] - as catalyst at room temperature . A linear relation between conversion and molecular weight of the obtained polymer was observed . furthermore , block copolymerization of the cyclic carbonate and e-caprolactone was successfully performed . 
copolymers of ethylene and 1-octene , 1-tetradecene and 1-octadecene were synthetized in order to study the effect of the comonomer chain length and amount on density , melting temperature and heat of fusion . they were also compared with the properties of the copolymers obtained with the heterogeneous titanium catalyst . it could be seen that the density / melting -area of the copolymers obtained with the zirconocene catalyst was much broader than with the titanium catalyst . it could also be seen that with the same comonomer content 1-tetradecene gave lower density of the copolymers than 1-octene . however , no difference were seen between the densities of the copolymers obtained with 1-tetradecene and 1-octadecene . the melting temperature of the copolymers was seen to be the lower the longer the comonomer was . In the area of the high branching amount the linear correlation was not in work . it was also shown that the differences in the heat of fusions could only be seen at high amount of branches ( > <nUm> branches / 1000C ) : the longer the comonomer the lower amount of heat was needed to melt the copolymer . 
when polymerization of propene was conducted using the C2 - symmetrical zirconocenes racEt(2,4,7-Me3Ind)2ZrCl2 ( I ) and rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( II ) combined with Ph3CB(C6F5)4 , the isotacticity ( [mmmm] ) and the melting point ( Tm ) of the produced polymer markedly increased , along with a decrease of the polymerization temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C . thus , isotactic polypropene ( iPP ) with Tm = <nUm> ° C was obtained from the polymerization with catalyst I at <nUm> ° C , whereas the [mmmm] and Tm of iPP were almost unchanged in the same temperature range when the C1 - symmetrical zirconocene iPr(3-tBuCp)(3-tBuInd)ZrCl2 ( III or III' ) was employed . 
Me2Si - bridged ansa - zirconocenes of interest for a-olefin polymerization catalysis are prepared in good yield by amine elimination reactions . the reaction of Me2Si(1-C5H4-3-t-Bu)2 ( 3 ) and Zr(NMe2)4 affords Me2Si(1-C5H3-3-tBu) 2Zr(NMe2)2 ( 4 ) in <nUm> % NMR yield ( rac / meso = <nUm> / <nUm> ) and pure meso-4 in <nUm> % isolated yield . the reaction of Me2Si(1-C5H3-2-Me-4-tBu)2 ( 6 ) with Zr(NMe2)4 affords Me2Si(1-C5H2-2-Me-4-tBu) 2Zr(NMe2)2 ( 7 ) in <nUm> % NMR yield ( rac / meso = <nUm> / <nUm> ) and pure rac-7 in <nUm> % isolated yield . the <nUm> / <nUm> rac-4 / meso-4 and <nUm> / <nUm> rac-7 / meso-7 ratios are the thermodynamic ratios , and the rac / meso isomerizations are catalyzed by NMe2H via reversible Zr-Cp bond aminolysis . the thermodynamic bias for meso-4 is ascribed to the ease of distortion of the metallocene framework of this diastereomer by a lateral deformation which reduces steric crowding between the amide ligands and the cp substituents . the reaction of <nUm> and Zr(NEt2)4 proceeds only in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at <nUm> ° C , affording Me2Si(1-C5H2-2-Me-4-tBu) 2ZrCl2 ( rac-1 ) in <nUm> % NMR yield ( rac / meso = <nUm> / <nUm> ) . the reaction of <nUm> and the piperidide complex C20H40N4Zr ( m-xylene , <nUm> ° C , <nUm> h ) affords rac-Me2Si-(1-C5H2-2-Me-4-tBu) 2Zr(NC5H10)2 ( rac-9 ) in <nUm> % NMR yield ( no meso detected ) and pure rac-9 in <nUm> % isolated yield . the reaction of <nUm> and the pyrrolidide complex C16H32N4Zr ( m-xylene , <nUm> ° C , <nUm> h ) affords Me2Si(1-C5H2-2-Me-4-tBu) 2Zr(NC4H8)2 ( 10 ) in <nUm> % NMR yield ( rac / meso = <nUm> / <nUm> ) and pure rac-10 in <nUm> % isolated yield . the molecular structure of rac-10 was determined by x-ray crystallography and exhibits severe crowding between the amide ligands and the cp substituents . treatment of rac-7 or rac-10 with Me3SiCl results in clean conversion to rac-1 without isomerization . 
the bridging of C2 - symmetric 8,10-dimethyltricyclo[5.2.2.02,6]-2,5-undecadiene ( DMeB - COCpH ) by silicon , methylene , and ethylene was investigated . the dimethylsilyl-bridged bis(BCOCp) ligand was accessible but could not be converted to its titanium , zirconium , or niobium chloride complexes . 8,10-Dimethyl-4-(1-methylethylidene)tricyclo[5.2.2.0 2,6]-2,5-undecadiene ( DMeBCOCp-dimethylfulvene ) was formed , but did not react with cyclopentadienyl anions . A regioisomeric mixture of 1,2-bis[(1R,7R,8R,10R)-8,10-dimethyltricyclo-[5.2.2.0 2,6]-2,5-undecadienyl]ethane [en(DMeBCOCpH)] ligands could be formed and metalated to form (+)-[ethylene-1,2-bis[e 5-(1R,7R,8R,10R)-8,10-dimethyltricyclo[5.2.2.0 2,6]-2,5-undecadien-4-yl]]titanium dichloride [ (+)-b,b-en(DMeBCOCp)2TiCl2 , (+)-11 ] along with its a,a- and a,b-bridged regioisomeric titanocene dichlorides . (+)-11 is unique in that it is a chiral ethylene-bridged ansa - metallocene which contains only homotopic cyclopentadienyl faces . (+)-11 was characterized by x-ray crystallography and was applied as a catalyst for the enantioselective isomerization of alkenes . (+)-11 was less active and less enantioselective than a known chiral ansa - bis(indenyl)titanium catalyst for the enantioselective alkene isomerization . 
reaction of zirconocene dichloride Cp2ZrCl2 with aromatic polymers bearing a-diketone and a-hydroxyketone fragments was studied . using reactions of Cp2ZrCl2 with benzil and benzoin , which model a-diketone and a-hydroxyketone fragments , it was shown that zirconocene dichloride reacts only with hydroxyketone groups of the polymer through both reaction with OH group and coordination of Zr to the keto group . the prepared polymers are rather stable and show promise as catalysts for a number of organic reactions . 
ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization over the O2Si - supported zirconocene / MMAO catalysts was investigated . the silica support was modified by different batches of <nUm> and <nUm> wt % Ga . it was found that Ga was well - dispersed all over the silica granules which can not be detected by XRD . based on the EDX measurement , it was revealed that Ga - modification increased the adsorption ability of MMAO on the silica support after impregnation . thus , Ga - modification showed a promising way to enhance the rate of ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization . based on TGA study , lower interactions between MMAO and support caused by Ga - modification was another reason for increase in catalytic activity . moreover , the Ga - modification increased lewis acid centres or active species on the catalytic system . In addition , a comparative study of polymerization was also conducted with in situ and ex situ impregnation methods . it was found that the in situ impregnation method of the MMAO onto silica exhibited remarkable ( almost <nUm> times ) activity compared to ex situ method which is attributed to lower deactivation effect of the catalyst . 13C NMR analysis , however , indicated that only random copolymers were produced in all systems . these results could be related to the high degree of 1-octene insertion and thus amorphous copolymers were produced in all systems . 
complexes were prepared in which one of the 2-phenylindenyl ligand was substituted with cyclopentadienyl type ligands , (cyclopentadienyl)(2-phenyl-indenyl)zirconium dichloride , Cp(2PhInd)ZrCl2 and Cp*(2PhInd)ZrCl2 and studied their behavior in propylene polymerization . the substitution of one of the 2-phenylindenyl ligands with a cp ligand resulted in a fourfold increase in productivity . typical productivities observed for Cp2ZrCl2 type complexes were lower . the molecular weight of polypropylene prepared with complex <nUm> was higher . upon substitution of 2-phenylindene with cp , the ability of the catalyst to generate elastomeric polypropylene is lost . 
catalytic systems based on zirconocenes can produce polymers with an overall amount of regioirregular placements as high as 2-3 % . the higher regiospecifities of titanocene based , with respect to zirconocene based , catalytic systems has been accounted for by the large contributions of the non-bonded interactions , in favor of the monomer coordination suitable for the primary insertion when shorter Mt-C distances are involved . 
the preparation and crystal structure of the first group <nUm> ansa - metallocene with an oxygen atom directly bonded to the 2-position of an e5-indenyl moiety , rac-[ethylenebis(2-(tert-butyldimethylsiloxy)indenyl)]zirconium dichloride ( 3 ) , is reported . In combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , complex <nUm> polymerizes propylene to highly isotactic crystalline polypropylene ( Tm = <nUm> ° C ; mw = <nUm> <nUm> ; mw / Mn = <nUm> ) . under similar conditions , the propylene polymerization activity of <nUm> / MAO exceeds that of the conventional ansa - metallocene catalyst system (dimethylsilyl)bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 4 ) / MAO by a factor of <nUm> ( <nUm> vs <nUm> kg of PP / mol of Zr / h ; tp = <nUm> ° C ; C3H6P = <nUm> bar ; [Al] : [Zr] = <nUm> <nUm> : <nUm> ) . complex <nUm> crystallizes in the unusual indenyl-backward conformation . the molecular structure is consistent with the expected C2 symmetry . 
A quantum mechanical study on the feasibility of doubly bridged ansa - zirconocenes based on the norbornadiene skeleton is presented . the enantioselectivity for the propene polymerization by these zirconocenes both with C2 and Cs symmetry has been investigated by molecular mechanics analysis on models of catalytic intermediates corresponding to the monomer coordination step as well as on models of pseudotransition states relative to the possible monomer insertion reaction . according to our analyses , for suitable substitutions of the norbornadiene skeleton , the models are highly enantioselective . this suggests that both isotactic and syndiotactic polyolefins could be prepared by the corresponding catalytic systems . 
low molecular weight ( ca. <nUm> ) ethylene-1-butene copolymers were synthesized at <nUm> ° C using rac-(dimethylsilyl)bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( II ) catalyst and methyl-aluminoxane ( MAO ) cocatalyst . comonomer composition , triad sequence distribution , and end groups were analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR . the average polymer molecule contains about one double bond and one saturated end group . the unsaturated end groups were formed almost exclusively by transfer from propagating chains containing 1-butene as the terminal unit . At least <nUm> % of the unsaturated end groups are vinylidene and trisubstituted double bonds , which are present in the approximate ratio <nUm> : <nUm> . saturated end groups result from the initiation process . both ethylene and 1-butene are involved in initiation , but ethylene more than 1-butene . the product is a random copolymer with very short blocks ( no longer than 2-3 monomer units ) of both ethylene and 1-butene . the comonomer sequence distributions determined by 13C NMR were fitted to first - order markovian statistics , which allowed calculation of the monomer reactivity ratios . the results are discussed in terms of a reaction mechanism consisting of initiation , propagation , and chain transfer reactions . 
isotatic polymerizations of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) , t-buyl acrylate and 2-ethyl hexyl acrylate in both toluene and CH 2Cl <nUm> with an ansa-zirconocenedimethyl were investigated using bis(4-methyl-2,6-dibutyl phenoxyl ) methyl aluminum as the activator . the results indicate that polymers with high molecular weights were produced in high yields . 
copolymers of ethylene ( propylene ) and 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene ( ENB ) containing 5-65 mol % of the cyclic comonomer units ( ENB ) in the main chain were synthesized by using homogeneous ansa - zirconocene catalysts of C2 symmetry . they are rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) , rac-Et(H4Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 3 ) , Me2C(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 4 ) , rac-Me2C(t-BuInd)2ZrCl2 ( 5 ) , and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . it is shown that the ethylidene groups of ENB do not take part in the copolymerization and the very cyclic comonomer unit bears the pendent unsaturated group . according to the obtained kinetic data ( on copolymer output , the specific rate of ethylene consumption , and conversion of ENB ) , catalyst <nUm> shows the highest activity in the copolymerization of ethylene with ENB in comparison with the other catalysts used . the incorporation of ENB into copolymer chain proceeds with greater difficulty than with unsubstituted norbornene . the values of r1 are higher and the values of r2 are lower for ENB than those reported for the copolymerization of ethylene with norbornene . the introduction of t-Bu substituent into ind - ligand of ansa - zirconocene ( catalyst <nUm> ) considerably complicates the ENB insertion into the copolymer . the copolymers were characterized by FTIR , DSC , NMR , and x-ray spectroscopy as well as by the original technique of scattering with very cold neutrons having energies between <nUm> × 10-7 and <nUm> × 10-4 eV . with the growth of ENB content in the copolymer , its crystallinity , melting enthalpy , and melting temperature progressively decrease . embedding of ENB units into the polyethylene main chain leads to a considerable increase of the tg value and better optical transparency of the resulting material . the copolymer with <nUm> mol % of ENB , prepared by catalyst <nUm> , was optically transparent in the UV and visible parts of the spectrum and had the highest tg ( <nUm> ° C ) and density ( ρ > <nUm> kg / m3 ) . ozonolysis under the mild reaction conditions permits the conversion of the ethylidene groups of poly(ethylene-co-ENB)s into polar carbonyl , aliphatic carboxylic , and aldehydes side groups . 
the first high molecular weight polystannanes , H(SnR2)nH ( r = nBu , nHex , nOct ) , result from dehydropolymerization of secondary stannanes R2SnH2 by zirconocene catalysts . good catalysts include zirconocenes based on both CpCp*Zr ( cp* = e5-C5Me5 ) and Cp2Zr fragments , and the most active catalyst with respect to production of high molecular weight polystannanes was Me2C(e5-C5H4) 2Zr[Si(SiMe3)3]Me . the latter catalyst produced H(SnnBu2)nH chains ( mw / Mn = <nUm> <nUm> / <nUm> <nUm> ) that were contaminated by ca. <nUm> % ( by weight ) low molecular weight cyclic oligomers . lower molecular weights resulted from dehydropolymerizations of Me2SnH2 , PhMeSnH2 , and Ph2SnH2 . At room temperature , H(SnR2)nH ( r = alkyl group ) polystannanes have lmax values at ca. 380-400 nm , attributed to s-s* transitions . thermal gravimetric analyses on the polystannanes reveal that these polymers are as thermally stable as related poly(dialkylsilane)s and have onset temperatures for thermal decomposition in the range 200-270 ° C , under both nitrogen and air . the H(SnnBu2)nH polymer has been shown to be a good precursor to O2Sn , as shown by bulk pyrolysis in air ( ceramic yield : <nUm> % ) . preliminary results also indicate that these polymers may be useful as precursors to elemental tin . the polystannanes are photosensitive , and their photobleaching behavior has been characterized by UV - vis spectrometry and 119Sn NMR spectroscopy , which demonstrated that H(SnnBu2)nH is photochemically depolymerized to a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of cyclo-(SnnBu2)5 and cyclo-(SnnBu2)6 . the polymers H(SnnHex2)nH and H(SnnOct2)nH exhibit thermochromic behavior which is visibly evident as a discoloration from yellow to colorless upon warming above room temperature . this reversible behavior is associated with an abrupt change in lmax ( e.g. , from <nUm> to <nUm> nm for films of H(SnnOct2)nH ) and a phase change at ca. <nUm> ° C ( by differential scanning calorimetry ) . thin films of H(SnnBu2)nH and H(SnnOct2)nH on glass slides were doped by exposure to F5Sb vapor to conductivities of 10-2 and <nUm> S cm-1 , respectively . preliminary experiments suggest that the dehydropolymerization occurs by a s-bond metathesis mechanism involving four - center transition states . A previous report on production of high molecular weight poly(dibutylstannane) by the reductive coupling of nBu2SnCl2 by Na / 15-crown-5 was reinvestigated and found to produce only low molecular weight material with mw / Mn = <nUm> / <nUm> . 
ansa - zirconocene complexes , exemplified by Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 , activated by MAO ( zirconocene / MAO ) exhibit high activity ( A ) for polymerization of propylene . polyolefins exhibiting a range of physical and mechanical properties can be synthesized . the molecular structures have been determined by a combination of morphology , molecular and mechanical measurements . the NMR spectra is consistent with a stereochemical control model of consecutive e / e ' ( E,E ' = enantiomorphic sites ) . 
we have reported previously that the rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)methylzirconium ''cation'' ( 1 ) , which was produced from the reaction of rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)dimethylzirconium and triphenylcarbenium ( trityl ) tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate , was exceedingly active and stereoselective in propylene polymerization , and that its catalytic activity and stereospecificity increases with a decrease of tp . however , in the aluminum - free catalyst , a certain amount of <nUm> is consumed in the nonproductive function of scavenging inpurities . we report here an alternate and efficient method to produce alkylzirconocene - type ''cations'' polymerization catalysts . 
several examples are described where in situ generated ( e2-alkyne ) group <nUm> metallocene type substrates add to X-[M2] reagents ( M2 = main group metal ) to form dimetallabicyclic products Cp2M(m-e1:e2-RCCR)(m-X)[M <nUm> ] which contain a planar-tetracoordinate carbon center in the m-e1:e2-hydrocarbyl bridge . thus , (e2-cyclohexyne)(PMe3)ZrCp2 ( 4a ) reacts in this way with excess trimethylgallium to give Cp2Zr(m-e1:e2-C6H 8)(m-CH3)GaMe2 ( 6a ) . complex 6a is one of the rare examples of a gallium compound containing s-hydrocarbyl bridges to this heavy main group metal . complex 6a was characterized by x-ray diffraction . it crystallizes in space group P21 / c with cell parameters a = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and RW = <nUm> . complex 6a contains a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom C(2) with pertinent bond distances and angles of <nUm> ( 5 ) Å [Zr-C(2)] , <nUm> ( 5 ) Å [Ga-C(2)] , <nUm> ( 8 ) Å [C(2)-C(3)] , <nUm> ( 7 ) Å [C(1)-C(2)] , <nUm> ( 4 ) ° [C(3)-C(2)-C(1)] , <nUm> ( 3 ) ° [C(3)-C(2)-Ga] , <nUm> ( 1 ) ° [Ga-C(2)-Zr] , and <nUm> ( 3 ) ° [C(1)-C(2)-Zr] . both cp rings are disordered . zirconium and gallium seem to form a three - center two - electron bond with C(2) . the planar-tetracoordinate geometry at carbon atom C(2) is probably electronically stabilized by the s-donor properties of the attached metal centers and by a p-conjugative interaction of the C(2)-C(1)-Zr moiety normal to the s-plane . (e2-1,2-Didehydrobenzene)(PMe3)ZrCp2 ( 4b ) reacts analogously with trimethylgallium to give Cp2Zr(m-e1:e2-C6H 4)(m-CH3)GaMe2 ( 6b ) in almost quantitative yield . complex 6b crystallizes isomorphously to the corresponding Al compound in space group P21 / n with cell parameters a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and RW = <nUm> . it also contains a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom [C(2)] . the reaction of ph - CKsC - GaMe2 ( 7 ) with (hydrido)zirconocene chloride produces Cp2Zr(m-PhCCH)(m-Cl)GaMe2 ( 9 ) which is probably also a similarly structured " anti-va n't hoff / LeBel complex " . complexes 6a and 6b react with ethylene or norbornene at room temperature with liberation of Me3Ga and formation of five - membered metallacyclic products ( e.g. , bis(e-cyclopentadienyl)zirconaindane is obtained from 6b and ethylene ) . 
[ ( C13 H8)Si(CH3)2(C 5H3 ) ] was prepared with fluorenyl lithium , dimethyldichlorosilane and cyclopentadienylsodium with <nUm> % total yield . furthermore , a Si - bridged fluorenylidene cyclopen-tadienylidene zirconium complex [ (C13H8)Si(CH3)2(C 5H3)]ZrCl2 was synthesized by reaction of [ (C13H8)Si(CH3)2(C5H <nUm> ) ] and Cl4Zn with THF as a solvent under the schlenk system . the reaction gave the target compound in <nUm> % yield . the zirconium complex was characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR . after activated with methylaluminoxane , the metallocene complex showed a high catalytic activity for the ethylene and propylene polymerization reaction under atmosphere pressure . it was found that the title compound has a catalytic activity in the order of <nUm> g / h , and the molecular weight of ethylene-propylene copolymers is about <nUm> . 
effective catalytic systems on the basis of alkylzirconocene dichlorides and methyl - alunoxane for polymerization of ethylene and its copolymerization with other α - olefines have been studied . some physico - chemical characteristics of synthesized polymers ( ρ , Tm , MM , MMD ) were studied . IR - spectroscopy , 13C NMR and x - ray analysis methods were applied . 
In this paper we report on some preliminary results on ethylene polymerization with cp* 2ZrX2 ( cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl , x = Cl , OH , me ) - AlR3 ( r = me , et , i-Bu ) . furthermore , we carried out a study on propylene polymerization with cp* 2MCL2 ( m = Zr , Hf ) - MAO in comparison with Cp2MCL2-MAO : some data concerning the different chain - transfer mechanisms observed in the two systems are reported . 
we have studied reaction chemistry that appears to be relevant to the mechanism of the dehydrogenative polymerization of phenylsilane by zirconocene and hafnocene catalysts . these investigations suggest that the polymerization proceeds by a two - step mechanism involving sigma-bond metathesis . the active catalysts is therefore proposed to be a coordinatively unsaturated d0 metal hydride complex , which mediates a step ( condensation ) polymerization . 
kinetic studies were performed in short - time ethylene polymerization with biscyclopentadienyl zirconium dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) in conjunction with a methylaluminoxane catalyst system using two solvents , toluene and n-decane . the concentration of active centers ( [C*] ) and the polymerization rate constant ( kp ) were greatly dependent on the solvent , that is , <nUm> mol / mol Zr and <nUm> 1(mol*s)-1 in toluene , and <nUm> mol / mol Zr and <nUm> 1(mol*s)-1 in n-decane . moreover , the catalyst activity was increased significantly by introducing a small amount of 1-hexene or propylene as comonomer . from the observed results , the increase in the kp value caused by the comonomer was proposed . 
dimethyl zirconocene and its derivatives are effective catalysts for the dehydrogenative coupling of primary organosilaes to poly(organosilylenes) . the backbone Si-H functions of these polymers can be functionalised by catalytic hydrosilylation . since the zirconocene polymerization catalyst is also an active hydrosilylation catalyst , it is possible to perform one - pot syntheses of functionalised polysilylenes .
