the concept of molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) tailoring using metallocene catalysts is visualized as follows : catalysts which individually produce polymer of narrow MWD but of different average molecular weights can be selectively combined in varying amounts in order to achieve a high degree of control over the final polymer MWD . although widely lauded , this concept is seldom put to the test in the open literature . we have observed that soluble metallocene / methylalumoxane catalysts individually produce polymer of a very consistent and reproducible MWD , although the rate at which they produce polymer is subject to high variability . In semi-batch polymerizations , this causes difficulty in controlling both the reaction rate and the MWD of the final product . In this study we present the results of several polymerization experiments combining rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride with both biscyclopentadienylzirconium dichloride and bisdicyclopentadienyltitanium dichloride . we also present a model in an attempt to predict the final MWD of a polymerization combining two catalysts . by considering the variances of catalyst activity , it is possible to generate a confidence interval around the prediction for a future polymerization . these predictions are compared with the results of actual experiments . it is observed that precise control is hindered by an inability to predict the activity of the catalysts combined in a polymerization . some means of improving the predictions of MWD are given . 
the electron ionization mass spectrometric behaviour of a new series of hafnocene and zirconocene dialcoholates is discussed . deprotonized norborneol and 3-methyl-2-norbornanemethanol were used as lateral ligands . these data are also compared to those of mass - analysed ion kinetic energy spectrometry . fragmentation patterns of the complexes in question give relevant information on their gas - phase behaviour and on an influence of the ligand 's structure on decomposition pathways as well .

the electron ionisation mass spectrometric behaviour of a new series of hafnocene and zirconocene dialcoholates is discussed . deprotonated moieties of borneol and fenchyl alcohol were used as s-ligands . these data are also compared to those of mass - analysed ion kinetic energy spectroscopy of the molecular ions . fragmentation patterns of the complexes in question give relevant information on their gas - phase behaviour and also on the influence of the ligand structure on the decomposition pathways . the complexes in question appear to be promising metal - organic chemical vapour decomposition precursors . 
ethylene polymerization by zirconocene-B(C6F5)3 catalysts with various aluminum compounds has been investigated . it is found that the catalytic activity depended on zirconocenes used , and especially on the type of aluminum compounds . for Et(H4Ind)2ZrCl2 ( H4Ind : tetrahydroindenyl ) , the activity decreases in the following order : Me3Al > i-Bu3Al > Et3Al ≫ Et2AlCl . while for Cp2ZrCl2(Cp : cyclopentadienyl ) , it varies as follows : i-Bu3Al > Me3Al ≫ Et3Al . furthermore , the activity is significantly affected by the addition mode of the catalytic components , which may imply that the formation of active centers is associated with an existing concentration of catalytic components . results of thermal behavior of polyethylene ( PE ) studied by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) show that crystallinity of the polymer prepared with Et3Al is higher than that with Me3Al or i-Bu3Al . it is also found that the number - average molecular weight ( m ) of the polymers prepared with Me3Al or i-Bu3Al is much higher than that with Et3Al . 1H - NMR studies substantiate that i-Bu3Al is a more efficient alkylation agent of Cp2ZrCl2 in comparison with Me3Al . 
nonisothermal , uncontrolled polymerization , conducted in varying mixing regimes , offered a facile methodology to evaluate the influence of several important process development factors such as mixing , reaction exotherm , and thermal perturbations on the catalytic activity and kinetic stability , polymerization performance , and properties of the resulting polymers . ethylene was homo- and copolymerixed with hexene-1 under varying impeller speeds ( hence , thermal perturbations ) , using Ind2ZrCl2 and Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and the MAO cocatalyst . with respect to the effects of the above process development actors , the following was observed : the reaction exotherm profiles , tracing the polymerization history , qualitatively represented the kinetic profile and the catalytic stability . the unbridged Ind2ZrCl2 was shown to be more stable than the bridged Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 . with change in the level of stirring from a diffusion - controlled regime to a noodiffusion - controlled , external gas - liquid mass - transfer resistance - free one , the reaction exotherm and the run time - average catalytic activity increased . so far as the influence of the chiral versus the achiral zironocene structure is concerned , the copolymer composition distribution and soluble fraction generated by chiral Et(Ind)2ZiCl2 were more sensitive to the mixing conditions and thermal perturbations than were those produced by achiral Ind2ZrCl2 . Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 produced higher molecular weight backbones , incorporated more hexene-1 and chain branching , and introduced less crystallinity in the copolymers than did Ind2ZrCl2 . the influence of Ind2ZrCl2 on higher - weight homopolymer backbones was opposite to that of Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 . incorporation of hexene-1 significantly decreased the average molecular weights and density and increased the run - time - dependent average catalyst activity . A positive comonomer effect took place . the bulk polymer properties did not critically depend on the mixing state . thermal perturbations broadened the polydispersity index . 
copolymerizations of ethylene with endo-dicyclopentadiene ( DCP ) were performed by using Cp2ZrCl2 ( cp = cyclopentadienyl ) , Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( ind = indenyl ) , and Ph2C(Cp)(FIu)ZrCl2 ( flu = fluorenyl ) combined with MAO as cocatalyst . among these three metallocenes , Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 showed the highest catalyst performance for the copolymerization . from 1H - NMR analysis , it was found that DCP was copolymerized through enchainment of norbornene rings . the copolymer was then epoxidated by reacting with m-chloroperbenzoic acid . 13C - NMR spectrum of the resulting copolymer indicated the quantitative conversion of olefinic to epoxy groups . 
ethylene-propylene-diene monomer ( EPDM ) terpolymers were prepared using either vanadium ( Cl3OV / Al2Et3Cl3 ) or zirconocene ( Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO ) catalyst systems . residual metal contents in EPDM films were determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry . metallocene catalyst systems exhibited a higher activity , producing EPDM with lower molecular weight and narrower molecular weight distribution . the highest activity guaranteed lower residual metal content ( Zr / C = 10-5 ) than in the case of EPDM produced by Cl3OV / Al2Et3Cl3 ( V / C = 10-4 ) . subsequent steps of dissolution of the polymer and its reprecipitation were seen to reduce the metal contents in both metal systems . concerning the cocatalyst retention , despite initial use of a very high amount of methylaluminoxane / metallocene ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) in the reactor , only about <nUm> % of this initial concentration remained in the polymer . on the other hand , in the case of vanadium - based catalyst , almost all Al present in the initial conditions ( [?]8.3 ) remained in the polymer . In both cases , the residual Al / m ratio was close to the value generally proposed for the generation / stabilization of the active species . In the case of vanadium systems , a test in the synthesis of ethylene propylene rubbers indicated that the absence of diene in the polymer structure leads to a reduction in the residual vanadium content , indicating that the diene double bond might be responsible for partially vanadium coordination . 
the kinetics of propylene polymerization initiated by ansa - metallocene diamide compound rac - (EBI)Hf(NMe2)2 ( EBI = C2H4-(indenyl)2 , rac-1 ) were investigated . the rac-1 compound could be directly utilized for catalyst formations without converting to a dihalide or dialkyl complex in the presence or absence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the MAO - free system rac-1 / AlR3 / [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] ( 2 ) is much more effective than the rac - <nUm> / MAO catalyst . the activity of the rac - <nUm> / Al(iBu)3 / <nUm> system is much higher than that of the rac - (EBI)HfCl2 / MAO or rac - (EBI)ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst , and almost same as that of the rac - (EBI)Zr(NMe2)2 / Al(iBu)3 / <nUm> catalyst under similar conditions . the alkylation of rac-1 to rac - (EBI)HfR2 by using AiR3 needs more time than the corresponding zirconocene analogue . the activity increases by a factor of <nUm> by increasing the aging time from <nUm> min to more than <nUm> h . the activity of the rac - <nUm> / AlR3 / <nUm> catalyst is very sensitive to the type and concentration of AlR3 , and decreases in the order : Al(iBu)2H > Al(iBu)3 > AlEt3 > AlMe3 . the catalyst keeps high activity in a narrow range of the [Al] / [Hf] ratio . In addition , the activity is influenced by the concentration of <nUm> , and as a result , the maximum activity is observed when <nUm> / rac-1 = <nUm> . the activity of the rac - <nUm> / AlR3 / <nUm> catalyst is also sensitive to the polymerization temperature . the activation energies for the initiation and overall reactions are calculated as <nUm> and <nUm> kcal / mol , respectively . the properties of polymer such as isotacticity ( as [mmmm] ) , molecular weight ( MW ) , molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) , melting temperature ( Tm ) , and crystallinity are similar level with those obtained with the rac - (EBI)HfCl2 / MAO system . the MW and isotacticity of the polymer produced by MAO - free system decreases monotonically as tp increases , and MWD becomes narrow from <nUm> to <nUm> when tp increases from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C because of the compositional homogeneity of the polymer produced at high tp , which is demonstrated by fractionation of the polymer . both MW and [mmmm] values of polymers decrease as aging time and anion concentration increase . 
the process of partial hydrolysis reaction of TMA with water and the interaction of zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) with TMA , MAO , and the in situ partially hydrolyzed products of TMA were studied by in situ 1H- and 27Al - NMR spectroscopy . the 1H - NMR spectra of MAO samples and the in situ hydrolyzed products of TMA with water under different conditions are different . A new peak at δ = <nUm> ppm in 1H - NMR spectra is observed , and is supposed to be due to the methyl resonance of MAO with low molecular weight . alkylation reaction is observed between Cp2ZrCl2 and TMA , MAO , and the in situ hydrolyzed products of TMA , and TMA is supposed to be the actual alkylating agent . 27Al - NMR studies show that MAO is tetra-coordinated . 
the polymerization of ethylene was studied by using a series of polysiloxane - bridged dinuclear zirconocenes [ (SiMe2O)nSiMe2 C5H4 ] [(C9H7)ZrCl2]2 ( <nUm> , n = <nUm> ; <nUm> , n = <nUm> ; <nUm> , n = <nUm> ) , the corresponding mononuclear zirconocene C14Cl2H12Zr , <nUm> , and the pentamethylene-bridged dinuclear zirconocene [(CH2)5(C5H4)2][(C 9H7)-ZrCl2]2 , <nUm> . from the polymerization studies using these catalysts it was found that ( i ) activities of the polysiloxane dinuclear zirconocenes 7-9 were lower than that of the corresponding mononuclear zirconocene <nUm> , ( ii ) molecular weights of polyethylenes produced by the dinuclear metallocenes are greater than that of polyethylene produced by the mononuclear metallocene , ( iii ) the complex <nUm> holding the longest bridging ligand exhibited the highest activity but produced a polymer having the smallest molecular weight among the polysiloxane - bridged dinuclear zirconocenes , and ( iv ) the pentamethylene-bridged dinuclear metallocene <nUm> showed higher activity than the complexes 7-9 and the mononuclear zirconocene <nUm> . the formation of the lowest molecular weight of polyethylene by <nUm> was attributed to the influence of electron withdrawal caused by the lewis acid - base interaction between the acidic aluminum of the cocatalyst and the basic oxygen at the polysiloxane linkage as well as the lack of a steric problem . an increase in steric congestion around the metal center led to not only a decrease in catalytic activity due to preventing facile monomer access to the active site but also an increase in the molecular weight of polyethylenes due to supressing b-H elimination . 
poly(siloxane)s with bisindenyl , bisfluorenyl , bis(1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadienyl ) , bis(2,4,7-trimethylindenyl) and monoindenylmethyl side groups were synthesized by condensation of the corresponding dichlorosilanes and water . for reference , diphenylsilanediol or hydroquinone was also employed in place of water . A series of poly (siloxane)-supported zirconocene catalysts were then prepared from these precursors and applied to ethene and propene polymerizations as well as to the copolymerization of ethene with 1-octene in the presence of methylalumoxane . the polymerization activity of the new supported metallocenes depends drastically upon the substituents in the siloxane backbone . the zirconocene catalysts supported on poly(bisindenylsiloxane) and poly(bisfluorenylsiloxane) give the highest activities for ethene and propene polymerizations , respectively . the weight - average molecular weights of the polymers are also markedly dependent upon the substituents . on the other hand , the molecular mass distributions ( MMD ) are generally not so sharp , suggesting that the active species formed in these supported catalysts are not uniform . 
the PM3(tm) semiempirical method has been used to optimize the structures for the reactants and transition states of the first and second ethylene insertion processes into zirconocene catalytic systems . the results obtained for these reactions are compared with calculations published in the literature performed at different abinitio theoretical levels . the agreement between our calculations and those reported in the literature is satisfactory . taking advantage of the reduced computational effort required in semiempirical calculations two additional processes related with the socalled comonomer effect were also studied : ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization , and chain termination reaction , both in the homopolymerization and in copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene comonomer . the calculated activation energies support some experimental findings such as the higher polymerization activities in the presence of comonomers and also the molecular weight reduction of the copolymers due to the more favorable b-elimination reactions . 
both the rac- and meso-dinuclear ansa - zirconocene catalysts ( m-C12H8{[SiPh(Ind)2]ZrCl2} <nUm> ) were prepared by a coupling reaction between <nUm> equiv of diindenylphenylchlorosilane ( rac- and meso-isomers ) and <nUm> equiv of p-dilithiobiphenyl in diethyl ether at <nUm> ° C , followed by a successive reaction with Cl4Zr · 2THF in THF at <nUm> ° C . polymerizations of ethene and propene were conducted in a <nUm> dm high - pressure glass reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer at <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> ° C using methylalumoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst and toluene or decahydronaphthalene as the solvent . copolymerization of ethene and 1-octene was also checked in brief . for ethene polymerization , the meso-catalyst was found to be more active , which displayed an extremely high activity to give linear polyethene with a high molecular weight and a narrow molar mass distribution ( MMD ) . the apparent activity increased monotonously with rising polymerization temperature from <nUm> ° C up to <nUm> ° C , indicating that the active species are stable even at a high temperature . on the other hand , both the rac- and meso-catalysts showed very poor activities for propene polymerization . however , copolymerization of ethene and 1-octene proceeded at a high speed . 
the use of crosslinked poly(styrene-co-4-vinylpyridine) having functional groups as the support for zirconocene catalysts in ethylene polymerization was studied . several factors affecting the activity of the catalysts were examined . conditions like time , temperature , Al / N ( molar ratio ) , Al / Zr ( molar ratio ) , and the mode of feeding were found having no significant influence on the activity of the catalysts , while the state of the supports had a great effect on the catalytic behavior . the activity of the catalysts sharply increased with either the degree of crosslinking or the content of 4-vinylpyridine in the support . via aluminum compounds , AlR3 or methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , zirconocene was attached on the surface of the support . IR spectra showed an intensified and shifted absorption bands of C-N in the pyridine ring , and a new absorption band appeared at about <nUm> cm-1 indicating a stable bond Al-N formed in the polymer - supported catalysts . the formation of cationic active centers was hypothesized and the performance of the polymer - supported zirconocene was discussed as well . 
ansa - zirconocene diamide complex rac-Me2Si(CMB)2Zr(NMe2)2 ( rac-1 , CMB = l-C5H2-2-Me-4-'Bu ) reacts with AlR3 ( r = me , et , i-Bu ) and then with [CPh3] + [ B(C6F5)4l ~ ( 2 ) in toluene in order to in situ generate cationic alkylzirconium species . In the sequential NMR - scale reactions of rac-1 with various amount of AlMe3 and <nUm> , rac-1 transforms first to rac-Me2Si(CMB)2Zr(Me)(NMe2) ( rac-3 ) and racMe2Si(CMB)2ZrMe2 ( rac-4 ) by the reaction with AlMe2 , and then to [rac-Me2Si(CMB)2ZrMe]1 ( 51 ) cation by the reaction of the resulting mixtures with <nUm> . the activities of propylene polymerizations by rac - l / al( £ -Bu)3 / <nUm> system are dependent on the type and concentration of AlR3 , resulting in the order of activity : rac-l / Al(i-Bu)3 / <nUm> > rac - l / AlEt3 / <nUm> > rac - <nUm> / MAO > rac - l / AlMe3 / <nUm> system . the bulkier isobutyl substituents make inactive catalytic species sterically unfavorable and give rise to more separated ion pairs so that the monomers can easily access to the active sites . the dependence of the maximum rate CRp,max ) on polymerization temperature ( tp ) obtained by rac - l / al( £ -Bu)3 / <nUm> system follows arrhenius relation , and the overall activation energy corresponds to <nUm> kcal / mol . the molecular weight ( MW ) of the resulting isotactic polypropylene ( zPP ) is not sensitive to Al(i-Bu)3 concentration . the analysis of regiochemical errors of iPP shows that the chain transfer to Al(z-Bu)3 is a minor chain termination . the 1,3-addition of propylene monomer is the main source of regiochemical sequence and the [mr] sequence is negligible , as a result the mesa pentad ( [mmmm] ) values of iPPs are very high ( [mmmm] <nUm> % ) . these results can explain the fact that rac-l / Al(i-Bu)o / <nUm> system keeps high activity over a wide range of [Al(i-Bu)3] / [Zr] ratio between <nUm> and <nUm> . 
an on - line electron spin resonance ( ESR ) technique was applied to investigate the oxidation states of the metallocene catalysts CpTiCl3 , CpZrCl3 , Cp2TiCl2 , and Cp2ZrCl2 . these metallocene catalysts were activated by modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) . it was found that the titanocene catalysts ( CpTiCl3 and Cp2TiCl2 ) were readily reduced to the trivalent state while the zirconocene catalysts ( CpZrCl3 and Cp2ZrCl2 ) were quite stable with respect to reduction . the concentrations of the trivalent species Ti (III) and Zr (III) showed linear relationships with the concentrations of metallocene catalyst precursors . however , their slopes were always smaller than unity indicating the existence of bimetallic interactions of the active sites . the ESR detectable Ti (III) and Zr (III) concentrations initially increased with the MAO / catalyst ratio and then leveled off after an 800-1000 Al / catalyst molar ratio . the deactivation processes were followed as a function of aging time over a range of temperature ( 25-100 ° C ) . the decay curves strongly depended on aging temperature with higher temperature giving faster decay rates . 
ansa - zirconocene diamide complex rac - (EBI)Zr(NMe2)2 [ rac-1 , EBI = ethylene-1,2-bis(1-indenyl) ] reacted with AlR3 ( r = me , et , iBu ) or Al(iBu2)H and then with [CPh3][B(C6F5)4] ( 2 ) in toluene in order to perform propylene polymerization by cationic alkylzirconium species , which are in situ generated during polymerization . through the sequential NMR - scale reactions of rac-1 with AlR3 or Al(iBu2)H and then with <nUm> , rac-1 was demonstrated to be transformed to the active alkylzirconium cations via alkylated intermediates of rac-1 . the cationic species generated by using AlMe3 , AlEt3 , and Al(iBu2)H as alkylating reagents tend to become heterodinuclear complex ; however , those by using bulky Al(iBu)3 become base - free [rac-(EBI)Zr(iBu)]+ cations . the activity of propylene polymerization by rac - <nUm> / AlR3 / <nUm> catalyst was deeply influenced by various parameters such as the amount and the type of AlR3 , metallocene concentration , [Al] / [2] ratio , and polymerization temperature . generally the catalytic systems using bulky alkylaluminum like Al(iBu)3 and Al(iBu)2H show higher activity but lower stereoregularity than those using less bulky AlMe3 and AlEt3 . the alkylating reagent Al(iBu)3 is not a transfer agent as good as AlMe3 or AlEt3 . the polymerization activities show maximum around [Al] / [2] ratio of <nUm> and increase monotonously with polymerization temperature . the overall activation energy of both rac - <nUm> / Al(iBu)3 / <nUm> and rac-1 / Al(iBu)2H catalysts is <nUm> kcal / mol . As the polymerization temperature increases , the stereoregularity of the resulting polymer decreases markedly , which is demonstrated by the decrease of [mmmm] pentad value and by the increase of the amount of polymer soluble in low boiling solvent . the physical properties of polymers produced in this study were investigated by using 13C - NMR , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , viscometry , and gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) . 
the effects of polymerization conditions were evaluated on the production of polyethylene by silica - supported (n-BuCp)2ZrCl2 grafted under optimized conditions and cocatalyzed by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the Al : Zr molar ratio , reaction temperature , monomer pressure , and the age and concentration of the catalyst were systematically varied . most reactions were performed in toluene . hexane , with the addition of triisobutilaluminum ( TIBA ) to MAO , was also tested as a polymerization solvent for both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst systems . polymerization reactions in hexane showed their highest activities with MAO : TIBA ratios of <nUm> : <nUm> and <nUm> : <nUm> for the homogeneous and supported systems , respectively . catalyst activity increased continuously as Al : Zr molar ratios increased from <nUm> to <nUm> , and remained constant up to <nUm> . the highest activity was observed at <nUm> K . high monomer pressures ( ≈ <nUm> atm ) appeared to stabilize active species during polymerization , producing polyethylenes with high molecular weight ( ≈ <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 ) . catalyst concentration had no significant effect on polymerization activity or polymer properties . catalyst aging under inert atmosphere was evaluated over <nUm> months ; a pronounced reduction in catalyst activity [ from <nUm> to <nUm> × <nUm> g PE ( mol Zr h)-1 ] was observed only after the first two days following preparation . 
isotactic polypropylene ( i-PP ) and syndiotactic polypropylene ( s-PP ) obtained with single - site C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocenes , respectively , activated with triphenyl carbenium tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl)borate ( 3 ) are immiscible with one another . physical mixture of the two PPs is macrophase separated and crystallizes very slowly as is characteristic of s-PP . A solution of C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocenes with <nUm> also produces an incompatible mixture of i-PP and s-PP . however , in the presence of an excess of a crossover agent such as triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) , a new polymeric material is obtained that exhibits lower Tm and DHf than either of the two homosteric polymers and a much faster rate of crystallization than that of s-PP or its physical mixture with i-PP . thermal annealing of this product markedly reduces the relative amount of crystalline phase compared to the amorphous phase and atomic force microscopy finds only microphase separation but not macroscopic phase separation . fractionation and 13C - NMR showed the material to contain not only the homosteric i-PP and s-PP but also a stereoblock PP ( i-PP-b-s-PP ) . the stereoblock fraction acts as a compatibilizing agent ; it probably is produced by the exchange of propagating polymer chains between the syndiospecific and the isospecific sites assisted by the crossover agent . 
A new class of organometallic polymer having a backbone of conjugated poly-yne and Zr - metal atoms has been prepared . trichloroethylene ( TCE ) and hexachlorobutadiene ( HCB ) are quantitatively converted by n-butyllithium to dilithioacetylene ( LiCfeCLi ) and dilithiodiacetylene ( Li-C = C-C = C-Li ) respectively . quenching with Cp2*ZrCl2 affords high yields of the polymers |Zr(Cp2*)C = c}n and { Zr(Cp2*)C = C-CfeCln where cp* = C2H3 = pentamethyl cyclopentadienyl . the Cp2*ZrCl2 and the polymers were characterized by viscosity , molecular weight , elemen - tal analysis , FTIR , NMR spectra , and TGA . 
the PM3(tm) semiempirical method was used to show the effect of a second ethylene molecule in the backside position on the frontside ethylene insertion in the Cp2Zr-nPr+ g-agostic resting state . the same calculations without a companion second ethylene molecule were performed to compare geometrical parameters , energies , and electrostatic charges . the results obtained show that the geometrical parameters for both cases were identical , but differences in the electrostatic charges were observed . the energy profile presented two barriers , the first corresponding to the alkyl-chain rotation along the Zr-Ca bond and the second relating to the insertion process itself . the presence of a companion second ethylene molecule affected the energetic profile by lowering the energy barrier of the first stage with respect to the process without the companion second ethylene molecule . these results provide some theoretical support to the well - known trigger effect . 
the influence of metals , alkyne substituents , cp substitution and additional ligands on the stability of bridged and unbridged e2-alkyne - titanocene and - zirconocene complexes has been investigated . the reduction of the complex [ (e5-C5H4)-SiMe2-(e 5-C5H4)]TiCl2 with magnesium in the presence of tolan ( PhC2Ph ) does not give the expected alkyne - titanocene complex [ ( e5-C5H4 ) - SiMe2- (e5-C5H4)]Ti(e2-PhC 2Ph ) but by coupling of two tolan molecules the corresponding titanacyclopentadiene [ (e5-C5H4)-SiMe2-(e 5-C5H4)]TiC4Ph4 ( 1 ) was obtained . In the analogous reaction with Me3SiC2SiMe3 the stable e2-alkyne complex without additional ligands [ (e5-C5H4)-SiMe2-(e 5-C5H4)]Ti(e2-Me 3-SiC2SiMe3 ) ( 2 ) was formed , due to the sterical influence of the alkyne substituents . the compounds without additional ligands (thi)2Ti(e2-PhC2Ph) ( 3 ) and (thi)2Ti(e2- Me3SiC2-SiMe3 ) ( 5 ) were isolated from the unbridged titanocene complex (thi)2TiCl2 ( thi = tetrahydroindenyl ) . two equivalents of complex <nUm> reacted with one equivalent of water to yield the dimeric alkylidene-m-oxo complex [ (thi)2Ti(CPh = CHPh)]2(m-O) ( 6 ) . the reaction of the unbridged zirconocene compound (thi)2ZrCl2 gave the alkyne complex (thi)2Zr(THF)(e2-Me3-SiC 2SiMe3 ) ( 7 ) which is stabilized by THF . At higher temperature THF was eliminated from the orange complex <nUm> forming the green complex (thi)2Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) . this behaviour was investigated in detail using NMR spectroscopy and compared to similar complexes such as Cp2Zr(e2-Me3-SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ( not stable without THF ) , (ebthi)2Zr(e2-Me3SiC2-SiMe <nUm> ) ( ebthi = ethylenebistetrahydroindenyl ; stable without THF ) and Cp*2Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ( cp* = pentamethyl-Cp , stable without THF ) . all complexes were characterized by spectroscopic methods . x-ray structural determinations were conducted for the complexes <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> . compound <nUm> is the first example of a structurally characterized tolan - titanocenc complex without additional ligands . 
bis(alkynyl)zirconocene and -hafnocene complexes <nUm> react with (butadiene)zirconocene or -hafnocene , respectively , to yield the binuclear s,p-acetylide bridged complexes [ ( cp <nUm> m ) <nUm> ( m-C ≡ C-R ) <nUm> ] <nUm> ( m = Zr , Hf ; r = CH <nUm> , C <nUm> H <nUm> , or CH <nUm> ph ) . the complexes <nUm> are selectively protonated upon treatment with N,N-dimethylanilinium tetraphenylborate or tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate to yield the dinuclear metallocene cation complexes [ ( cp <nUm> m <nUm> )(m-RCC <nUm> -H)(m-C = C-R)M <nUm> cp <nUm> + ] <nUm> ( m <nUm> = m <nUm> = Zr , a-c ; m <nUm> = Zr , m <nUm> = Hf , h ; m <nUm> = m <nUm> = Hf , i ) that contain a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom ( C <nUm> -H ) bearing a hydrogen substituent . complex 13a was characterized by x-ray diffraction . it reveals an agostic interaction of the C <nUm> -H moiety with the m <nUm> cp <nUm> unit . the planar-tetracooidinate carbon unit C <nUm> -H of 13a exhibits <nUm> C / <nUm> H NMR chemical shifts of δ = <nUm> and <nUm> and a coupling constant of <nUm> J CH = <nUm> Hz . selective protonation of (m-alkynyl)bis(group <nUm> metallocene ) complexes containing other additional bridging ligands provides a rather general synthetic entry to planar-tetracoordinate carbon containing complexes of this type : [ cp <nUm> m <nUm> ( m-C ≡ C-CH <nUm> )(m-Cl)M <nUm> cp <nUm> ] ( 10a-c , m <nUm> , m <nUm> = Zr , Hf ) and [ cp <nUm> m <nUm> ( m-C ≡ C-CH <nUm> )(m-CH <nUm> )M <nUm> cp <nUm> ] ( 11a.b ) selectively add a proton from [ ( HNMe <nUm> ph ) + ( ArB <nUm> ) - ] at carbon atom C <nUm> of the acetylide ligand to yield the corresponding " anti-va n't hoff / LeBel complexes " [ cp <nUm> m <nUm> ( m-CH <nUm> CC <nUm> -H)(m-X)M <nUm> cp <nUm> + ] ( 13d-g and k , x = Cl , CH <nUm> ) , respectively . 
when a mixture of stereoisomers of rac- and meso-1,2-bis(phenylphosphanyl)-1,2-dicarba-doso-dodecaborane(12) ( 1a , b ; 1a / 1b = <nUm> : <nUm> ) is treated with [Cp2ZrMe2] in boiling toluene for <nUm> h , the formation of three phosphorus - containing products , namely meso-[Cp2Zr(PPh)3] ( 3 ) , (PPh)4 ( 4 ) and (PPh)5 ( 5 ) , ratio <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> , was observed by <nUm> P - NMR spectroscopy . In the <nUm> B - NMR spectrum of the reaction mixture , only signals for 1,2-dicarba-closo-dodecaborane(12) were observed . when zirconocene , prepared in situ from [Cp2ZrCl2] and BuLi , was treated with 1a , b at low temperature and then heated to reflux in toluene for <nUm> h , only formation of <nUm> and 1,2-dicarba-closo-dodeca-borane(12) was observed . the mixture of stereoisomers of 1a , b reacts with ClCu in THF to give me- and meso-[CuCl(THF){l,2-(PHPh)2C2B10H <nUm> } ] ( 7a , b ) , which is only stable in THF solution and loses THF in vacuo over several hours to yield the insoluble colorless complex [CuCl{1,2-(PHPh)2C2B10H10}]. , ( 8 ) . In THF solution , <nUm> reacts with PPh3 to give the stable isolable complex [ CuCl(PPh3){l,2-(PHPh)2C2B10H <nUm> } ] ( 9 ) . No reaction of 1a , b is observed with [Cp'Mo(CO)3]2 ( cp' = C5H4Me ) in boiling THF , while only decomposition occurs in boiling toluene . however , [(NBD)Mo(CO)4] ( NBD = norbornadiene ) reacts smoothly with 1a in toluene at room temperature to give cis-rac-[Mo(CO)4{1 ,2-(PHPh)2C2B10H10 } ] ( 10 ) . compounds <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were characterized spectroscopically ( 1H , 31P , 11B , 13C NMR , IR ) , and an x-ray structure determination was carried out on <nUm> . 
hydrozirconation of propyne followed by treatment with propynyllithium yields the (s-propenyl)(s-propynyl)zirconocene complex <nUm> . its treatment with the organometallic lewis acid BC18F15 results in transfer of the s-propynyl group from zirconium to boron followed by insertion of the alkynylborate triple bond into the zirconium carbon bond of the remaining metallaallyl cation to furnish the zirconocene-(m-hydrocarbyl)borate betaine complex <nUm> . this reacts with three molar equivalents of tert-butyl isocyanide to give <nUm> . complex <nUm> contains a five - membered carbocyclic ring , formed by carbon-carbon coupling of the former propenyl and propynyl groups with the C ≡ N-R reagent , to which a (e2-iminoacyl)(k-tert-butyl isocyanide)zirconocene moiety is attached . complex <nUm> was characterized by an x-ray crystal structure analysis . 
the reactions of cp <nUm> Zr(L)(e <nUm> -Me <nUm> CSi <nUm> SiMe <nUm> ) ( L = THF , pyridine ) with e-caprolactone , cyclohexanone and cycloheptanone result in an insertion of the carbonyl group into the zirconacyclopropene ring system of the alkyne complexes to yield the five - membered metallacyclic spirozirconadihydiofurane complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> . the product with e-caprolactone is not stable at room temperature and was identified only by NMR spectra and chemical reactions . starting from rac-(ebtru)Zr(e <nUm> -Me <nUm> CSi <nUm> SiMe <nUm> ) with e-caprolactone and ethylene carbonate under analogous conditions more stable complexes ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) were obtained . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by x-ray crystal - structure analysis . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> react with further e-caprolactone in a catalytic ring - opening polymerization . the polymerization reactions were monitored by NMR spectroscopy . 
treatment of the [ Cp2Zr(e2-acetaldehyde) / H(CH3)ZrCp2 ] adduct <nUm> with BC18F15 yields the dimetallabicyclic salt [ Cp2Zr(m-e1-O:e2-C,O- OCHMe)(m-H)(ZrCp2)]+[CH3B(C6F5)3]- 18b . similarly , hydride abstraction from the related neutral dimetallabicyclic [ Cp2Zr(OCHR) / H2ZrCp2 ] adducts <nUm> ( r = CH3 ) or <nUm> ( r = C2H5 ) with BC18F15 yields the systems [ Cp2Zr(m-e1-O:e2-C,O-OCHR)(m- H)(ZrCp2)]+[HB(C6F5)3]- ( 18a , c ) and the reaction of BC18F15 with [ Cp2Zr(OCHCH2Ph) / H(PhCH2)ZrCp2)]+ <nUm> gives [ Cp2Zr(m-e1-O:e2-C,O- (OCHCH2Ph)(m-H)ZrCp2]+[PhCH2B(C6F5)3]- 18d . A variety of nitriles R2-C ≡ N ( r = CH3 , CMe3 , p-tolyl , or ethyl ) cleanly reacts with the cations <nUm> by addition of the Zr2(m-H) moiety to the nitrile functionality to yield the respective aldiminium - bridged cations [ Cp2Zr(m-e1-O:e2-C,O- (OCHR1)(m-N = CHR2)ZrCp2]+ ( 21-24 ) . complex 24d ( R1 = PhCH2 , R2 = C2H5 ) was characterized by an x-ray crystal structure analysis . similarly , treatment of the systems 18a-d with isocyanates RN = C = O ( r = CMe3 , SiMe3 , p- tolyl , or adamantyl ) gave the related m-formamidato complexes 27-30 . 
6-Amino-6-methylfulvene has been coupled with benzoic acid by treatment with 7-azahydroxybenzotriazole and DCC . subsequent two-fold deprotonation , at the NH and 6-methyl groups , generated the vinylidene-bridged cp / benzoylamido ligand <nUm> . treatment of <nUm> with ZrCl4(THF)2 gave the spirometallocene complex 3a ( characterized by x-ray crystal structure analysis ) , while reaction of <nUm> with (Et2N)2ZrCl2(THF)2 yielded the bridged half - sandwich complex 3b . treatment of 3a with two molar equivalents of the strongly electrophilic borane BC12F10H resulted in hydroboration of the exocyclic C = C double bond with concomitant intramolecular N-B adduct formation to yield the azaboretidine - type systems <nUm> ( three diastereoisomers , one of which has been characterized by x-ray diffraction analysis ) . similarly , hydroboration of 3b with BC12F10H yielded the azaboretidine derivative <nUm> . activation of the complexes <nUm> and <nUm> with methylalumoxane led to active homogeneous ziegler - type propene polymerization catalysts . 
the first 1,2-azaphosphindoles 14a,b , 15a,b were obtained in a straightforward manner upon heating diphenylzirconocene in the presence of a cyanophosphane , which afforded azazir-conacyclopentenes 11a,b which can be reacted with various dichlorophosphanes . the use of the tetrachlorodiphosphane CCl2H2P instead of a dichlorophosphane allowed the preparation of the bis(1,2-azaphosphindoles) <nUm> , 19' . the monosulfur adduct of the azaphosphindole 14a , i.e. 16a , was characterized by x-ray structure analysis . alkylation of 14a or 16a with methyltrifluoromethane sulfonate occurred selectively on the intracyclic phosphorus atom or on the sulfur atom , giving the salts <nUm> or <nUm> , respectively . 
the acetylene exchange in [L2Ti(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3)] ( L = cp ( e5-C5H5 ) , cp* ( e5-C5Me5 ) , THI ( e5-tetrahydroindenyl ) , L2 = Me2Si(e5-C5H4)2 ) by corresponding alkynylsilanes RC ≡ CSiMe2H or , alternatively , the reduction of [L2TiCl2] with magnesium in THF in the presence of alkynylsilanes led to the formation of titanocene silylalkyne complexes [L2Ti-(RC2SiMe2H)] ; L = cp , r = tBu <nUm> , ph <nUm> , SiMe3 <nUm> , SiMe2H <nUm> ; L = cp* , r = tBu <nUm> , r = SiMe2H <nUm> ; L = THI , r = tBu <nUm> and L2 = Me2Si(e5-C5H4)2 , r = tBu <nUm> . the zirconocene alkyne complexes with additional ligands [Cp2Zr(thf)(e2-RC2SiMe2H)] ; r = tBu 9a , ph 10a , SiMe3 11a , and SiMe2H 12a were also prepared by an acetylene exchange reaction starting from [ Cp2Zr(thf)(e2-Me3 . SiC2SiMe3 ) ] and the corresponding alkynylsilanes r ≡ CSiMe2H . dynamic NMR investigations in [D8]THF show an equilibrium between [Cp2Zr(thf)(e2-RC2SiMe2H)] and the solvent - free derivative [Cp2Zr(RC2SiMe2H)] . upon dissolving in n-hexane a complete elimination of the THF ligand yields zirconocene alkyne complexes without additional ligands [Cp2Zr(RC2SiMe2H)] ; r = tBu 9b , ph 10b , SiMe3 11b , and SiMe2H 12b . IR spectra , x-ray structural , and NMR investigations indicate that the characteristic feature of the titanocene complexes 1-4 and <nUm> and the zirconocene complexes without THF ligands <nUm> b-12b is an agostic interaction between the Si-H bond and the metal center . the effect of this Si-H - metal interaction is considerably stronger at low temperatures and in the solid state . the L2M moieties showing this bond activation are active catalysts in hydrosilylation and dehydrogenative polysilane formation reactions . In the case of PhC ≡ CSiMe2H a coupling of two acetylenes to give titana- ( 13 ) and zirconacyclopentadienes ( 14 ) was observed ; the unsymmetrically substituted compounds 13a , 14a are kinetically favored and formed first . subsequent cycloreversion leads to the thermodynamically more stable symmetrical metallacyclopentadienes 13b and 14b . both compounds do not show any interaction of the Si-H groups with the metal . 
herein we describe different C-C coupling reactions of permethyltitanocene and -zirconocene with disubstituted 1,3-butadiynes . the outcomes of these reactions vary depending on the metals and the diyne substituents . the reduction of [Cp*2MCl2] ( cp* = C5Me5 ; m = Ti , Zr ) with Mg in the presence of disubstituted butadiynes RC ≡ C-C ≡ CR' is suitable for the synthesis of different C-C coupling products of the diyne and the permethylmetallocenes , and provides a new method for the generation of functionalized pentamethyl-cyclopentadienyl derivatives . for m = Zr and r = R' = tBu , the reaction gives , by a twofold activation of one pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand , the complex [ Cp*Zr{-C( = C = CHtBu)-CHtBu-CH2-e5-C 5Me3-CH2- } ] ( 3 ) , containing a fulvene ligand that is coupled to the modified substrate ( allenic subunit ) . when using the analogous permethyltitanocene fragment " Cp*2Ti " , the reaction depends strongly on the substituents r and R' . the coupling product of the butadiyne with two methyl groups of one of the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ring systems , [ Cp*Ti{e5-C5Me3-(CH 2-CHR-e2-C2-CHR'-CH2 ) } ] , is obtained with r = R' = tBu ( 4 ) and r = tBu , R' = SiMe3 ( 5 ) . In these complexes one pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand is annellated to an eight - membered ring with a C-C triple bond , which is coordinated to the titanium center . A different activation of both pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligands is observed for r = R' = me , resulting in the complex [ { e5-C5Me4(CH 2)-}Ti{-C( = CHMe)-C( = CHMe)-CH2-e5-C 5Me4 } ] ( 6 ) , which displays a fulvene as well as a butadienyl-substituted pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand . the influence exerted by the size of the metal is illustrated in the reaction of [Cp*2ZrCl2] with MeC ≡ C-C ≡ CMe . here the five - membered metallacyclocumulene complex [Cp*2Zr(e4-1,2,3,4-MeC4Me)] ( 7 ) is obtained . the reaction paths found for r = R' = me are identical to those formerly described for r = R' = ph . 
treatment of the BC12F11 OEt2 ( 3 ) complex with n-pyrrolyl lithium gives bis(pentafluorophenyl)(N-pyrrolyl)borane ( 2 ) , a strong organometallic lewis acid , which was characterized by x-ray diffraction ( B-N bond length : <nUm> Å ) . it exhibits a columnar superstructure in the crystal and contains p-stacks of pyrrolyl units . compound <nUm> readily abstracts alkyl anions from a variety of alkyl group <nUm> metallocene - type complexes and leads to the clean formation of the respective metallocene ions or ion pairs . for example , the treatment of Cp3ZrCH3 ( 9 ) with <nUm> transfers a methyl anion to yield the ion pair [Cp3Zr]+[(C4H4N)B(CH 3)(C6F5)2]- ( 12 ) . the x-ray crystal structure analysis of <nUm> shows a close contact between zirconium and the pyrrolyl-b-carbon ( <nUm> Å ) . the borane <nUm> adds to (butadiene)zirconocene ( 13 ) to yield the betaine system [Cp2Zr]+ [ (C4H6)B-(NC4H4)(C6F 5)2]- ( 15 ) . complex <nUm> contains a distorted e3-allyl moiety inside the metallacyclic framework and it features an internal zr+ ⋯ (pyrrolyl)B- ion pair interaction with a Zr ⋯ pyrrolyl-a-carbon separation of <nUm> Å ( determined by x-ray diffraction ) . from the dynamic NMR spectra of <nUm> the bond strength of the internal ion pair interaction was estimated to be DG[?]diss ( <nUm> K ) ≈ <nUm> kcal mol-1 . treatment of dimethylzirconocene ( 16 ) with <nUm> yields the metallocene borate salt [Cp2ZrCH3]+[(C4H 4N)B(CH3)(C6F5)2 ] - ( 17 ) , which is an active catalyst for the polymerization of ethene . 
polycyclic zwitterionic complexes that incorporate one or two phosphonium unit ( s ) as cationic center ( s ) and zirconocene - ate moiety(ies) as the anionic counterpart ( s ) can be easily prepared by either [1+3] or [1+3] and [2+3] cycloadditions which involve bi-or tricyclic a-zirconated phosphanes <nUm> or <nUm> and various azides . some of these species exhibit unprecedented phosphazide chelation with bonding between the zirconium and a nitrogen atom in the a position relative to phosphorus . when heated , the phosphazide complexes lose dinitrogen to form stable polycyclic zwitterionic phosphonium mono-or dinuclear complexes . the solid - state structure of the two zwitterionic complexes <nUm> and <nUm> was determined by x-ray crystallography . 
As homoenolate equivalents , zirconocene-1-aza-1,3-diene complexes were used for the first time in stereoselective synthesis . by insertion of an unsymmetrical ketone in the Zr-C σ bond , sterically demanding trisubstituted dihydro- and tetrahydrofuran derivatives were prepared in good overall yields and with high diastereoselectivities ( see below ) .

vinylsilanes and / or allylsilanes are formed upon silylation of terminal alkenes with R3SiCl in the presence of a grignard reagent and a catalytic amount of [Cp2ZrCl2] [ eq. ( a ) ] . the reaction also proceeds under mild conditions when silylsulfides ( x = SPh ) , silylselenides ( x = SePh ) , and silyltellurides ( x = TePh ) are used in place of chlorosilanes ( x = Cl ) . r ' = alkyl , aryl , alkylsilyl ; r ' = me , et , nPr ; r = CH2R , aryl , H . 
the systematic regulation of the molecular weight distribution in the MAO - activated polymerization of ethylene has been realized by using amino- functionalized ansa - zirconocene dichlorides as precatalysts ( one of the active species is shown ) . the formation of high- and low-molecular-weight polyethylene with a unimodal distribution as well as the formation of polyethylene with a bimodal distribution is possible by varying the polymerization temperature . 
the electronic structure and geometry of polymethylaluminoxane ( MAO ) [-Al(CH3)O-]n with different size ( n = 4-12 ) have been studied using quantum - chemical DFT ( density functional theory ) calculations . it has been found : <nUm> ) starting from n = <nUm> , the three - dimensional oxo-bridged ( cage ) structure of MAO is more stable than the cyclic structure . <nUm> ) both for cage structure and for cyclic structure the lewis acidity of Al atoms characterized by their net positive charge amplifies with increasing size of MAO ( n ) . <nUm> ) trimethylaluminium ( AlMe3 ) reacts with the cage structure of MAO with cleavage of an Al-O dative bond and formation of acidic tri-coordinated alv and basic di-coordinated ov atoms in the MAO molecule . two molecules AlMe3 are associated with acidic alv and basic ov centers . As the MAO increases in size , the acidity of alv centers amplifies and the distance alv - ( AlMe3 ) shortens ; on the contrary , interaction of AlMe3 with ov centers weakens and the distance ov - ( AlMe3 ) increases with increasing n value . the total heat of Al2Me6 interaction with MAO ( sum interaction of alv - ( AlMe3 ) and ov - ( AlMe3 ) ) noticeably decreases as the size of MAO increases ( from <nUm> kcal / mol for n = <nUm> to <nUm> kcal / mol for n = <nUm> ) . it is proposed that acidic alv and basic ov centers formed in the cage structure of MAO interact with zirconocene yielding ' cation - like ' zirconium active centers . 
the cationic alkyl zirconocene complex Cp2Zr+Me[CH3B-(C6F 5)3 ] is found to initiate the ring - opening polymerization of 1,5,7,11-tetraoxaspiro[5,5]undecane under mild condition to give poly(oxypropylenepropylenecarbonate) with low polydispersity . the rate of the polymerization is first - order with respect to monomer and catalyst concentration . At high monomer concentration , the initial rate of polymerization becomes zero - order with respect to monomer concentration . 
In this paper we report on a zirconocene dichloride / methylaluminoxane catalyst system supported on a crosslinked polystyrene in order to provide ethylene polymerization catalysts for gas phase or slurry processes . our novel approach uses the diels - alder reaction of cyclopentadiene functions as the final , crosslinking synthetic step . this provides polymer supported zirconocene catalysts with a homogeneous distribution of active sites . the catalysts were shown to be highly active and to form spherical beads as proven by scanning electron microscopy . 
nanocomposites of high density polyethylene ( HDPE ) , linear low density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) and highly branched polyethylene rubbers were prepared both by means of melt compounding and ethene homo- and copolymerization in the presence of layered silicates which were rendered organophilic via ion exchange with various quaternary alkyl ammonium cations . In comparison to melt compounding , in-situ ethene homo- and copolymerization , catalyzed with MAO - activated zirconocene ( MBI ) , nickel ( DMN ) and palladium ( DMPN ) catalysts , proved more effective in nanocomposite formation , as evidenced by larger interlayer spacings and formation of exfoliated anisotropic nanosilicates with high aspect ratio . 
four non-bridged dimethylzirconocene complexes , i.e. , bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)dimethylzirconium ( 1 ) , ( e5-cyclopentadienyl ) (e5-fluorenyl)dimethylzirconium ( 2 ) , bis(e5-indenyl)dimethylzirconium ( 3 ) and (e5-cyclopentadienyl)(e 5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)dimethylzirconium ( 4 ) were synthesized and used as a catalyst for the methyl methacrylate polymerization combined with triphenylmethyl tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate in the presence of ZnEt2 or Al(i-Bu)3 . the catalyst activity strongly depends on the zirconocene compound and decreases in the order <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> ≫ <nUm> . the polymerization proceeds in a living manner when <nUm> and <nUm> are used combined with ZnEt2 . on the other hand , stereoregularities of the resulting polymers are independent of the zirconocene compound , and syndiotactic - rich polymers are formed by a chain - end controlled mechanism . 
propene polymerizations were performed using the two ansa - zirconocene catalyst systems dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride / methylaluminoxane and dimethylsilylbis(2-methyl-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride / methylaluminoxane . the polymerization rate was observed by continuously monitoring the monomer consumption . reaction rate profiles were obtained in the temperature range from <nUm> ° C to <nUm> ° C at pressures between <nUm> and <nUm> bar and catalyst concentrations from 4.6*10-6 m to 4.2*10-5 m . isotacticity , as measured by NMR , melting point and molecular weight decreases markedly at higher temperatures . small amounts of 1,3-inserted monomer ( < <nUm> mol- % ) was observed at polymerization temperatures above <nUm> ° C . No 2,1-inserted monomer was detected . A kinetic model was developed that describes the polymerization rate for Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 as the catalyst over the entire observed temperature range , and the polymerization rate for Me2Si(2-Me-Ind)2ZrCl2 in a limited temperature range . the model includes an activation reaction , latent sites that may revert to active sites and a permanent deactivation that is second order with respect to the active sites . the activation energy for the propagation reaction was found to be <nUm> kJ / mol for Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 and <nUm> kJ / mol for Me2Si(2-Me-Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO . several kinetic models are compared and discussed . 
stereospecific polymerization and asymmetric oligomerization of allylsilanes were investigated by using C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocene catalysts . isotactic and syndiotactic poly(allylsilane)s were produced with rac-ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) and diphenylmethylene(e5-cyclopentadienyl)(e 5-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 6 ) , respectively . bulky allylsilanes afforded optically active oligomers in the reactions using optically active ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium and -hafnium complexes . 
A magnesium chloride supported zirconocene catalyst was synthesized using a soluble tetrahy-drofuran complex of magnesium chloride . the supported catalyst polymerizes ethylene with high activities in the presence of methylaluminoxane . the siginificant feature of the supported catalyst is that it polymerizes ethylene even at temperature as high as <nUm> ° C at low Al / Zr ratios . the polymer molecular weights obtained using supported catalyst are found to be higher compared to the unsupported catalyst . the molecular weight distribution index is in the range of <nUm> - <nUm> . the active site concentration of the supported catalyst was found to be five times lower than that of the unsupported catalyst . 
the olefin polymerization catalytic system iPr(CpFluo)ZrCl <nUm> / MAO was investigated by UV / visible absorption spectroscopy in solvents of various polarity at <nUm> ° C . it was shown that the UV / visible main absorption band of the zirconocene , which can be related to the ligand to metal charge transfer bands ( LMCT ) , varies greatly upon incremental addition of MAO or AlMe <nUm> . for low [ AlMe <nUm> ] / [Zr] or [MAO] / [Zr] ratios ( Al : Zr < <nUm> ) , a hypsochromic shift of the initial iPr(CpFluo)ZrCl <nUm> absorption band , corresponding to the monomethylation of the metallocene dichloride , is observed . on the contrary , for higher Al / Zr ratios ( with MAO uniquely ) , a bathochromic shift of the metallocene absorption band proceeding in two distinct steps is observed . these two steps are interpreted by the successive formation of associated ( or complexed ) and dissociated active zirconocenium species . the changes in the absorption spectra of iPr(CpFluo)ZrCl <nUm> / MAO are correlated with the initial activity observed for hex-1-ene polymerization in the various solvents examined . In the same way , the catalytic activity loss with polymerization time observed at elevated Al / Zr ratios ( > <nUm> ) with this system is attributed to a reduction of active species concentration , as indicated by the intensity decrease of their UV / visible absorption band . this reveals the low stability of active species formed from iPr(CpFluo)ZrCl <nUm> compared to those from rac - Et(Ind) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> . 
propylene / 1-hexene copolymers were prepared with the isospecific Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst by using a wide range of solvents . In the order of increasing dielectric constant ( ε ) they are : heptane ( 1.92 ) , methylcyclohexane ( 2.02 ) , toluene ( 2.38 ) , chlorobenzene ( CB ) ( 5.68 ) , methylene chloride ( 8.93 ) and o-dichlorobenzene ( o-DCB ) ( 10.12 ) . the effect of solvent structure and polarity on yield , composition , and microstructure of copolymers was investigated . the data show that solvent polarity , which has an enormous effect on the activity , has a negligible effect on the copolymer composition . very close 1-hexene contents are obtained with all the solvents used except for toluene , in which the comonomer content is remarkably lower than that in the other solvents for all compositions . detailed 13C NMR analysis of the copolymers obtained was performed : the reactivity ratios obtained by statistical elaboration of the experimental values of triad and tetrad comonomer compositions confirm the actual lower accessibility of the active site to 1-hexene in toluene than in the other solvents . this fact can be explained by the competition of the nucleophilic toluene with 1-hexene in the coordination to the active site . 
our work of the last two years concerning the use of zirconocene catalysts in the production of polyethylene ( PE ) is reviewed . In earlier studies , using Cp2ZrCl2 , the metal loading capacity of different commercial silicas , namely grace <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> was determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) . the adsorption isotherms of Al from methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) cocatalysts were determined using the 27Al(p , g)28Si nuclear reaction at <nUm> MeV . In the present work we could determine the Al / Si ratio with the simultaneous induction of nuclear reactions with 27Al and 28Si using protons of <nUm> MeV . after replacing Cp2ZrCl2 by (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 , an exhaustive search of activation , grafting and polymerization conditions ( monitored by RBS , infrared spectroscopy , differential scanning calorimetry , and gel permeation chromatography ) allowed us to set an optimized protocol that yielded polyethylene with thermal , molecular weight and composition characteristics typical of high - density PE . 
the ab initio hartree - fock theory has been demonstrated to give accurate geometry predictions for bridged zirconocene dichlorides . equilibrium geometries of crystallographically characterized bridged zirconocene dichlorides were optimized by hartree - fock , MP2 , BLYP , and B3LYP methods , with basis sets ranging from 3-21G* to 6-311G** . selected geometrical parameters were compared with experimental crystal structures . the least expensive HF / 3-21G* method proved to be notably accurate . the accuracy of HF / 3-21G* was verified by a comprehensive data set of <nUm> bridged zirconocene dichlorides . furthermore , experimental corrections were applied to the optimized geometry parameters to eliminate systematic deviations . corrections resulted in considerably improved accuracy for systematically overestimated metal - ligand distances , with maximum deviation falling from <nUm> to <nUm> Å , and absolute average deviations from <nUm> to <nUm> A. ligand - metal - ligand angles were predicted accurately with absolute average deviations of <nUm> - <nUm> ° . zirconium-chlorine distances and chlorine-zirconium-chlorine angles are relatively constant in the studied molecules . zirconium-cyclopentadienyl distances can be influenced mainly by modifying the ligand structure , whereas cyclopentadienyl-zirconium-cyclopentadienyl angles and cyclopentadienyl-cyclopentadienyl plane angles can be controlled by bridge modifications . the HF / 3-21G* method can be applied for the estimation of steric effects in zirconocene catalyzed polymerization reactions , therefore being suitable for the construction of structure - polymerization property correlations . 
[ Me2C(Cp) (Ind)]ZrCl2 metallocene catalyst has been prepared and employed in a study of ethene polymerization in the presence of the cocatalyst methylaluminoxane . C1 and C2 signals are detected in the 13C NMR spectra of the resultant polymers ; this reveals that the resultant polymer is a branched polyethene ( polyethylene ) . the influence of polymerization temperature , catalyst concentration and [Al] / [Zr] ratio on catalytic activities and polymerization kinetics is investigated . A plausible mechanism for forming branched polyethene is suggested . 
the electron ionisation mass spectrometric behaviour of a new series of hafnocene and zirconocene chioroalcoholates is discussed . these data are also compared with those of mass - analysed ion kinetic energy spectrometry . with respect to dialcoholato complexes previously studied by us , the monochloro-alcoholato species show rather high intensities in their molecular ion peaks , which reflects their higher volatility and sufficient stability in the vapour phase . fragmentation patterns of the complexes in question give relevant information on their gas - phase behaviour and also on the influence of the ligand structure on the decomposition pathways . the complexes in question appear to be promising precursors for metal - organic chemical vapour deposition ( MOCVD ) . 
zirconocene dichloride and bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride are used as catalyst precursors for the heterogeneous polymerization of ethene . A methyl-substituted microgel as support material for heterogeneous cocatalysts on the basis of MAO is compared with different commercially available silica - supported cocatalysts . the catalyst performances and the properties of the obtained polyethenes show considerable differences . 
poly-a - olefins ranging from poly-1-pentene to poly-1-octadecene with narrow polydispersities were synthesized with (CH3)2Si(2-methylbenze[e]indenyl)2ZrCl2 and methylaluminoxane at polymerization temperatures ( tp 's ) ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C and were characterized by gel permeation chromatography , NMR spectroscopy , and differential scanning calorimetry . the molar masses of the homopolymers obtained with (CH3)2Si(2-methylbenz[e]indenyl)2ZrCl2 were notably higher than those of poly-a - olefins synthesized with other zirconium - based metallocenes under similar conditions . the temperature dependence of the molar mass distribution of the poly-a - olefins can be described by a common exponential decay function regardless of the investigated monomer . At tp 's ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C , moderate isotacticity prevailed , but outside this temperature range , the polymers were less stereoregular . 
ethene homopolymerization and copolymerization with 1-hexene were catalyzed by methyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl ( cp ) zirconium dichlorides , (RnC5H5-n)2ZrCl2 ( Rn = H , me , 1,2-Me2 , 1,3-Me2 , 1,2,3-Me3 , 1,2,4-Me3 , me4 , or me5 ) , and methylaluminoxane . the polymers were characterized with fourier transform infrared , nuclear magnetic resonance , gel permeation chromatography , and differential scanning calorimetry techniques . generally , an increasing number of methyl substituents on the cp ligand results in lower 1-hexene incorporation in the copolymer . the two catalysts with split methyl substitution ( Rn = 1,3-Me2 and Rn = 1,2,4-Me3 ) show a higher comonomer response than their disubstituted and trisubstituted counterparts ( Rn = 1,2-Me2 and r = 1,2,3-Me3 ) . they even incorporate more 1-hexene than Rn = H and Rn = me . these findings are qualitatively in agreement with the results of a theoretical study based on density functional calculations . the presence of comonomer does not influence the termination reactions after the insertion of ethene . there is more frequent termination after each hexene insertion with increasing comonomer incorporation except for the two catalysts with split methyl substituents . the termination probability per inserted comonomer is highest for the less substituted catalysts . 
1-Hexene was polymerized by rac-(dimethylsilyl)bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride catalyst and methylaluminoxane cocatalyst over the temperature range 0-100 ° C . the polymerization rate , polymer molecular weight , and polymer microstructure ( stereospecificity and regiospecificity ) were studied as a function of the temperature and the concentrations of monomer , catalyst , and cocatalyst . 
the synthesis and characterization of rac-[ethylenebis(1-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-3-indenyl)] zirconium dichloride is reported . the silyl substituted <nUm> / MAO was compared to its siloxy substituted analogue in ethylene homo- and in ethylene-1-hexene copolymerizations to elucidate the effect of the heteroatom on polymerization performance . the influence of monomer and cocatalyst concentration and the polymerization temperature was investigated . the oxygen between the indenyl ligand and the bulky tert-butyldimethylsilyl group in the siloxy substituted <nUm> / MAO was found to have a positive influence on polymerization activity and copolymerization performance . 
treatment of the tris(cyclopentadienyl) cation ( 1+ ) with zirconocene dichloride <nUm> gave , in almost quantitative yield , the <nUm> : <nUm> adduct 7+ , which was isolated with [(CH3)B(C6F5)3]- as the counterion . reaction of 1+ with the organometallic ligand Cp3ZrCl afforded the <nUm> : <nUm> adduct 8+ , again isolated with [(CH3)B(C6F5)3]- . the x-ray analysis revealed that 7+ displays a strongly bent Zr-Cl-Zr coordination mode , in contrast to 8+ , which has a tendency to linear coordination . A theoretical analysis suggests that a subtle balance between steric and electronic factors determines the geometries in such organometallic adducts . 
treatment of bis(propynyl)zirconocene ( 5 ) with a stoichiometric quantity of BC18F15 leads to C-C coupling of the alkynyl ligands to form the zirconocene-(m-hexadiyne)-borate betaine complex <nUm> . this apparently is in an endothermic equilibrium with a methylenecyclopropene - type isomer <nUm> , formed by intramolecular alkyne insertion into the (sp2-carbon)-zirconium linkage , which is very effectively trapped by added scavenger reagents such as organic nitriles or isonitriles , to yield the stable unsaturated three- membered ring products <nUm> or <nUm> , respectively . subsequent hydrolysis removes the zirconocene moiety from the product , but the newly formed (sp2-carbon)- BC18F15 linkage remains intact . the resulting products <nUm> and <nUm> formally contain a central methylenecyclopropene framework , but their structural properties point to a substantial p-delocalization , that indicates a pronounced participation of an enamino-substituted cyclopropenylium-borate betaine resonance structure . the description of the neutral betaine compounds <nUm> and <nUm> as approaching cyclopropenylium cation - type compounds that have their counteranion covalently bonded to them , is further supported by the observation of low activation barriers of the rotation around the exocyclic C3-C4 bond [ DG(CCrot) / ( ≠ ) ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 for 17a ] and around the C5-N linkage [ DG(CNrot) / ( ≠ ) ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 for 16a ] . the neutral cyclopropenylium-betaine compound 17a shows a carbocation - like chemical reactivity , and inserts tert-butyl isocyanide to yield the ring - expanded four - membered carbocyclic product <nUm> . 
n-pyrrolyllithium ( 1 ) adds to BC18F15 to yield [(C4H4N)B(C6F5)3]Li ( 3 ) . the corresponding monoetherate ( 3*OEt2 ) was characterized by x-ray diffraction and shows an e5 coordination of the pyrrolyl moiety to the lithium cation . treatment of <nUm> with ClH in ether leads to H+ addition at a pyrrolyl a-position to yield the neutral dipolar bronsted acid system [(C4H5N)B(C6F5)3] ( 4 ) . the reagent <nUm> can be used to protonate Cp2Zr(CH3)3 to yield [ Cp2Zr(CH3)+(C4H 4N)B-(C6F5)3- ] ( 6 ) and methane . H+ transfer from <nUm> to (butadiene)-zirconocene results in the formation of the (p-allyl)metallocene salt [ (C4H7)ZrCp2+(C4H 4N)B(C6Fs)3- ] ( 8 ) . In analogous reactions , the neutral bronsted acid was employed as a protonating activator component for the generation of homogeneous ziegler catalysts derived from a variety of (butadiene)-or (dimethyl)ansa-metallocenes . the systems generated by treatment with <nUm> show comparable activities in ethene or propene polymerization reactions as conventionally generated group <nUm> metallocene ziegler catalysts . 
the new zirconocene [ ( e5-C5H4SiMe2N(SiMe 3)2]2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) has been prepared in a convenient three - step synthesis . A crystal structure determination of <nUm> shows two molecules in the unit cell , one in which the (Me3Si)2NSiMe2 groups are accommodated in a nearly synperiplanar conformation directly above and below the Cl2Zr group , and one in which these groups exhibit a synclinal conformation . the reaction of <nUm> with a mixture of Cl2OS / Cl2O2S leads to the formation of [(e5-C5H4SiMe2Cl] 2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) . 
the ab initio hartree - fock method has been utilized to rationalize the conformational preferences of racemic ethylene-bridged bis(indenyl) - type zirconocenes in dichloride and cationic methyl forms . this group of catalysts is characterized by conformational isomerism due to fluxionality of the ethylene bridge resulting in two distinct orientations of the indenyl ligands , indenyl-forward ( π ) and indenyl-backward ( υ ) . A systematic investigation of the influence of methyl and trialkylsiloxy substitution on the relative stabilities of π and υ conformations was performed . for the dichloride catalyst precursors the stabilities and orientations of the equilibrium structures are determined on the basis of repulsive interactions within the ligand framework . In the cationic methyl intermediates of the olefin polymerization catalytic cycle , the electron - rich indenyl ligand appears to reduce the electron deficiency of the cation by tilting towards the metal . 
the metallocene alkyne complexes [Cp2M(L)(e2-Me3SiC2R)] react with diisobutylaluminium hydride at room temp. by addition of HAl(iBu)2 to yield the heterobimetallic complexes [ {Cp2M}(m-e1:e2-RC C SiMe3)(m-H){Al(iBu)2} ] [ {Cp2M} : (e5C5H5)2Ti , r = ph <nUm> , r = SiMe3 <nUm> ; {Cp2M} : (e5-C5H5)2Zr , r = SiMe3 <nUm> ; {Cp2M} : (ebthi)Zr , r = SiMe3 <nUm> ] { ebthi : rac-[1,2ethylene-1,1'-bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl)] } . complexes 1-4 were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> investigated by x-ray crystal structure analysis . compounds 1-4 were tested as initiators in the ring - opening polymerization of lactones . the results are discussed in comparison to the corresponding monometallic titanocene and zirconocene alkyne complexes . 
the bridging functions Me2Si , [(CH2)3(CMe2)2N]B and CH2 have been used to connect two imidazoles in the 1,1'-position . the bisimidazolyl compounds were treated with BH3 or BEt3 , and the resulting N,N'-bisborane - protected products <nUm> , 3b , 4a , and 5b were characterized by x-ray structure analyses . reaction of 1,1'-bis(4,5-dimethylimidazolyl) methane with BBr3 yielded the macrocyclic dicationic tetraimidazolyl compound <nUm> . the behavior of the N - protected bisimidazoles <nUm> and 3-5 towards deprotonating agents was investigated and it was found that 1,1'-bis(3-borane-4,5-dimethylimidazolyl)methane ( 5b ) is deprotonated to give a dianionic dicarbene compound . its reaction with Cp2MCl2 allowed the formation of the corresponding titanocene and zirconocene complexes <nUm> and <nUm> , which were characterized by x-ray structure analyses . In <nUm> a 3c,2e B-H-Zr bond is present . 
the reactions of the mercaptocarboxylic acids HOOC(CH2)nSH ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) with H[AuCl4] followed by treatment with PMe2Ph led to the (phosphane)gold f [Au{S(CH2)nCOOH}(PMe2Ph)] [ n = <nUm> , ( 1 ) <nUm> ( 2 ) ] , which can act as metalloligands towards complex fragments of a second metal . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> react with [ cp ° 2ZrMe2 ] ( cp ° = C5EtMe4 ) to give the trinuclear Zr / Au complexes [ cp ° 2Zr{K1O-OOC(CH2)n SAu(PMe2Ph)}{K2O , O'-OOC(CH2)n-SAu(PMe2Ph) } ] [ n = <nUm> ( 3 ) , n = <nUm> ( 4 ) ] . complexes 1-4 were characterized by 1H , 13C , 31P NMR and IR spectroscopy . the crystal structure of <nUm> shows mono- and bidentate coordination of two metalloligands to one zirconocene fragment . In solution at room temperature <nUm> and <nUm> are dynamic , and the carboxylato groups alternate between the mono- and bidentate bonding modes . complex <nUm> shows catalytic activity in the oxidation of PPh3 with O . 
this paper describes the synthesis of a series of titanium and zirconium metallocenes bearing one or two first - generation silane dendritic wedges as bulky substituents at their cyclopentadienyl rings . wedges (R2R'SiCH2CH2)3SiCl [ r = R' = et ( 1 ) ; r = ph , R' = me ( 2 ) ] were prepared by hydrosilylation of chlorotrivinylsilane with R2R'SiH . they were reacted with K(C5H5 and , subsequently , with KH to give K[(R2R'SiCH2 CH2)3Si(C5H4) ] [ r = R' = et ( 3 ) ; r = ph , R' = me ( 4 ) ] . the dendronized cyclopentadienides <nUm> and <nUm> were the starting materials for preparation of the mixed - ring titanocenes [ { ( R2R'SiCH2 CH2)3SiC5H4 } (C5R''5)TiCl2 ] [ r = R' = et , R'' = H ( 5 ) , R'' = me ( 6 ) ; r = ph , R' = me , R'' = H ( 7 ) , R'' = me ( 8 ) ] or the symmetrically substituted metallocenes [ { ( Ph2MeSiCH2 CH2)3SiC5 H4}2MCl2 ] [ m = Ti ( 9 ) , Zr ( 10 ) ] . cyclic voltammograms and catalytic behavior of all the new metallocenes in ethylene polymerization , using MAO as a co-catalyst , have been studied and compared to that of related non-dendritic complexes . polyethylene polydispersities increase with the number of dendritic wedges in the catalyst , while activities decrease . bimodal molecular weight distributions were clearly observed for the bis-dendritic titanocene <nUm> . 
the 4-fulvenyl[2.2]paracyclophane ( 1 ) was transformed , by treatment with lithium aluminium hydride and methyllithium in tetrahydrofuran , to the corresponding cyclopentadienyl anions <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . the iron complex <nUm> was prepared from <nUm> , while <nUm> was converted into the metal complexes <nUm> ( Fe complex ) , <nUm> ( Ti ) , <nUm> ( Zr ) , <nUm> ( Ti ) , and <nUm> ( Zr ) . all new metallocene complexes were characterized by their spectroscopic data . In addition , a single crystal x-ray crystallographic analysis was performed for complex <nUm> . the metallacyclic zirconocene complex <nUm> was synthesized by the reaction of the dichloride derivative <nUm> with two equivalents of n-butyllithium . after activation of complexes 10-13 and <nUm> with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) they were used for the catalytic polymerization of ethene and propene . 
bis[(5-hexenyl)cyclopentadienyl]zirconium dichloride ( 3 ) underwent ring - closure olefin metathesis with loss of ethylene when treated with <nUm> mol % of the [ Cl2(PCy3)2Ru = CHPh ] catalyst in refluxing dichloromethane , to yield the large ansa - zirconocene complex [dec-5-ene-1,10-diylbis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)]ZrCl2 ( trans-4 ) . characterization by NMR and by x-ray diffraction revealed that the isolated complex contained a trans-C = C double bond inside the ansa bridge . similarly , bis[(allyl)cyclopentadienyl]ZrCl2 ( 7 ) gave the ansametallocene [but-2-ene-1,4-diylbis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)]zirconium dichloride ( cis-8 ) when treated with the same ruthenium metathesis catalysts ( <nUm> mol % ) under similar conditions , except that a cis-C = C double bond was now found to be present ( shown by NMR and x-ray diffraction ) . the cis-8 complex was used as a homogeneous ziegler - natta catalyst for ethylene polymerization [ after activation of the metallocene dichloride <nUm> with MAO ( methylalumoxane ) or treatment of the corresponding dimethylmetallocene complex <nUm> with BC18F15 ] . complex <nUm> was also converted into a mixture of ( scis- and s-trans-e4-butadiene)-ansa-metallocene complexes ( s-cis-15 / s-trans-15 = <nUm> : <nUm> ) by treatment with (butadiene)-magnesium . the C = C double bond of cis-8 could be hydroborated with 9-BBN or with the H-B(C6F5)2 reagent . Li+[B(C6F5)4-] added to cis-8 to yield an interesting solid - state chain structure in which the [Zr]Cl2 unit and the o- / mF pairs of two -C6F5 groups were found to be in contact with the central lithium cation in a distorted octahedral coordination environment ( as shown by x-ray diffraction ) . 
(Butadiene)zirconocene ( s-trans- / s-cis-1 equilibrium mixture ) reacts with the imine MeN = CHPh ( 7a ) to form the <nUm> : <nUm> carbon-coupling product [ kN-MeN-CHPh-CH2-e3- (CHCHCH2)]ZrCp2 ( 8a ) . the x-ray crystal structure analysis of 8a revealed a metallacyclic structure featuring a distorted p-allyl moiety and a planar - tricoordinate nitrogen atom . only one of the two possible diastereoisomers is found in the crystal ( cis-8a ) as well as in solution . treatment of <nUm> with the more bulky aldimine PhCH2N = CHPh ( 7b ) selectively gave the corresponding <nUm> : <nUm> addition product trans-8b . ketimines PhCH2N = C5H8 ( 7c ) , HN = CPh2 ( 7d ) , or d1-2-methylpyrroline ( 7e ) also reacted selectively with (butadiene)zirconocene to yield the analogous metallacyclic C-C coupling products 8c-e . treatment of 8e with BC18F15 proceeded cleanly by abstraction of a hydride anion from the carbon atom α to the nitrogen atom to form the intramolecularly coordinated imine product 10a { with the [HB(C6F5)3-] anion } . similarly , Ph3C+ abstracts a hydride ion from 8e to yield 10b { isolated with the [B(C6H5)4-] anion } . proton addition from HNR3+ reagents takes place selectively at the Zr - amido nitrogen atom of the complexes 8a or 8d to yield the substituted (p-allyl)zirconocene cation complexes <nUm> or <nUm> , respectively . the cationic complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> polymerize ethene at room temperature / <nUm> bar of ethene with moderate catalytic activities . ( 
the cross-conjugated 1,1-diethynylethylene derivatives 8b-10b were prepared from the corresponding bromides <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> by sonogashira coupling with trimethylsilylethyne and hydrolysis of the TMS-protected intermediates thus formed . coupling of the tetrabromide <nUm> with (trimethylsilylethynyl)magnesium bromide in the presence of 1,3-[bis(diphenylphosphanyl)propane] nickel (II) chloride yielded the protected tetraalkyne <nUm> , from which the 7,7,8,8-tetraethynyl-tetrahydro-p-quinodimethane <nUm> was liberated by fluoride treatment . although <nUm> is a highly unstable cross-conjugated hydrocarbon , it could be converted into its tetraphenyl derivative by sonogashira coupling with phenyl iodide . both <nUm> and the corresponding tetraphenyl derivative were oxidized to the 7,7,8,8-tetraethynyl-dihydro-p-quinodimethane derivatives <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively , on treatment with DDQ in dioxane . further dehydrogenation of <nUm> to <nUm> failed , however . alkylation of 9b with trimethylaluminium in the presence of zirconocene dichloride as catalyst yielded the semicyclic dendralene <nUm> , which on irradiation isomerized to the tricyclic diene <nUm> , presumably via the bicyclobutane <nUm> and a vinylcyclopropane rearrangement . hydration of 9b furnished <nUm> and <nUm> , the primary hydration product <nUm> either undergoing ketene elimination ( formation of <nUm> ) or a 1,5-hydrogen shift reaction ( to <nUm> ) from its tautomer <nUm> . analogously , the still more highly unsaturated derivative <nUm> was alkylated to give the [5]dendralene derivative <nUm> and hydrated to give a mixture of the b-diketones <nUm> and <nUm> , the latter being produced from <nUm> by 1,2-methyl migration . the thermal cyclization of 10b to the homoacepentalene derivative <nUm> failed . 
A direct preparation of a-amino ketone derivatives through treatment of acylzirconocene chlorides with n-benzylideneaniline derivatives , in which acylzirconocene chlorides react as " unmasked " acyl anion donors , was carried out under Yb(OTf)3 / TMSOTf - catalyzed conditions . the same reactions were also carried out with the use of bronsted acids as catalyst in place of Yb(OTf)3 / TMSOTf . the operationally simple three - component reaction with aldehydes , anilines , and acylzirconocene chlorides affords a-amino ketone derivatives essentially in the absence of a catalyst . 
[Cp'2ZrCl(PHTipp)] ( 1 ) ( cp' = e5-C5MeH4 , tipp = 2,4,6-Pr3iC6H2 ) reacts with methyl formate with insertion and substitution to give [Cp'2ZrCl{OCH(PHTipp)2}] ( 2 ) . <nUm> was characterized spectroscopically ( 1H , 31P NMR , IR , MS ) and by x-ray structure determination . only the meso-trans isomer is present in the solid state . 
the reactions of [e5-Cp2ZrCl2] ( cp = e5-C5H5 ) with [K(THF)n][N(PPh2)2] ( n = <nUm> - <nUm> ) and K[CH(PPh2NSiMe3)2] are reported the first reaction led to the monoamido complex [e5-Cp2Zr(Cl)N(PPh2)2] in which the { (Ph2P)2 N}- ligand - via a phosphorous and the nitrogen atom - is coordinated to the zirconium atom in a chelating ( e2 ) fashion . reaction of the potassium methanide compound , K{CH(PPh2NSiMe3)2} with zirconocene dichloride yield the carbene - like mono cyclopentadienyl complex [ e5-CpZr(Cl){C(PPh2NSiMe3) <nUm> } ] . the complex is formed by a salt metathesis and concomitant a cyclopentadiene extrusion . 
cyclopentadiene and metallocenes , typically zirconocene dichloride , are suitable substrates for multiple arylations with aryl bromides in palladium - catalyzed reactions . thus , various aryl bromides bearing either an electron - donating or an electron - withdrawing substituent can react with these substrates to afford the corresponding 1,2,3,4,5-pentaaryl-1,3-cyclopentadienes in a single preparative step . derivatives of cyclopentadiene , including di-and trisubstituted cyclopentadienes , and indene are arylated in a similar fashion . 
the bridged , C1 - symmetric , single - component zirconocene [Zr{(Cp)-(Ind)CMe2}(Me)(thf)](BPh4) ( ind = indenyl , cp = cyclopentadienyl ) polymerises methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) selectively to isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) without further cocatalysts or activators . to elucidate the stereoselective steps of the polymerisation of MMA by using this catalyst we studied the propagation steps occurring with the derivative [ Zr{(Cp)(Ind)CH2}-{-O-C(OMe) = C(Me)(Et)}(MMA)]+ by ab initio calculations at the hartree - Fock(HF) level of theory . after the initiation step , which consumes the first two MMA molecules , each new catalytic cycle begins with the stereoselective addition of a new MMA molecule at the indenyl side of the zirconocene fragment . At the same time the enolate ring undergoes a stereoselective inplane ring shift to the side opposite to the indenyl ring . these findings are used to postulate a mechanism for the polymerisation that explains the stereoselective synthesis of isotactic PMMA . 
A series of silyl-terminated diynes of varying lengths and substitution patterns have been prepared . these diynes undergo zirconocene coupling with selective formation of trimeric macrocycles from linear alkynes , while nonlinear diynes give cyclodimeric products . the length of the linear diynes can be increased for the preparation of macrocycles with large nanoscale cavities . reaction of the zirconium - containing macrocycles with acid results in the synthesis of metal - free cyclophanes . all of these macrocycles were prepared in multigram quantities , in the absence of high - dilution conditions , to give products in > <nUm> % yield that are easily purified as crystalline solids . 
alkenyl zirconocene complexes are readily obtained by diverse processes including hydrozirconation , carbozirconation , and cyclozirconation of alkynes , transmetalations , and bond insertions . In combination with other metals , novel reaction manifolds can emerge and provide access to useful synthetic building blocks . both catalytic asymmetric processes and highly diastereoselective multicomponent transformations that involve the formation of three or more new carbon-carbon bonds are feasible . this concept paper summarizes the current state of the art and opportunities for future reaction discovery in this field of research , with particular emphasis on synergistic effects of bimetallic combinations of zirconocenes and zinc . 
one - pot procedures for the preparation of highly substituted indenes , tetrahydroindenes , and cyclopentadienes have been developed by using a combination of zirconocene - mediated C-C - bond - forming reactions with lewis acid mediated activation of carbonyl groups . the carbonyl groups of aldehydes were deoxygenated in the reaction and behaved formally as a one-carbon unit . A variety of lewis acids were checked and showed different reactivities in this reaction . 
conversion of a racemic mixture of a chiral allene into a single enantiomer requires selective inversion of the absolute configuration of one species . this can be accomplished as shown in equation ( 1 ) : the enantiopure imido complex <nUm> reacts more rapidly with one enantiomer of chiral 1,3-disubstituted allenes , and more slowly with the other , so a deficiency of <nUm> gives an efficient kinetic resolution . for equimolar amounts of <nUm> and a 1,3-disubstituted allene , both allene enantiomers are transformed into the same metallacycle . the enantioenriched allene , which now has the same configuration as the fast reacting enantiomer , is released in high yield and high ee recovery upon treatment of the metallacycle with 1,2-propadiene . 
narrow band gaps and high electron affinities are associated with the new oligomers containing thiophene-1-oxide and thiophene-dioxide that have been prepared by zirconocene coupling methods . A series of oligomers with 3-11 rings ( x = 2H , S , and S( = 0)2 ; see picture ) allow the electronic properties of conjugated chains to be investigated . of particular note is that the less electronic - withdrawing sulfoxide group results in the narrowest band gap . 
cleavage of the aldehyde C = O bond takes place in the zirconocene- and AlCl3 - mediated cyclization of two molecules of an alkyne with an aldehyde to afford cyclopentadiene derivatives [ eq. ( 1 ) ] . only one of the possible double - bonds isomers is formed . the same method can also be used to couple two different alkynes with an aldehyde . 
In a single experiment , several supported zirconocene catalysts for a-olefin polymerization can be evaluated by a combinatorial concept . polyethylene particles produced by fluorescent dye tagged catalysts can be easily identified by their emission color , separated , and characterized ( see fluorescence microscope image ) .

the template - controlled synthesis of π ligands offers new methods for synthesizing endohedral metallocenophanes . this strategy allows the assembly of previously inaccessible bridged metallocenes , for example , the doubly bridged cobaltocenes <nUm> , prepared from <nUm> , n = <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> . 
multiply metalated oligosilanes : treatment of bridged bis[tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl] compounds with two equivalents of potassium tert-butoxide leads to the formation of 1,3- and 1,4-dipotassium silanes [ eq. ( 1 ) ] . reaction of the latter with zirconocene dichloride and hafnocene dichloride , respectively , gives the corresponding metallacyclopentasilanes . 
how do alumoxane activators activate ? reaction ( 1 ) may help to answer this question . the product of this reaction is a zirconocene alkyl cation ( cp* = C5Me5 ) with its methylated boralumoxane anion . the structure of this compound is in accord with barron 's " latent lewis acidity " concept for alumoxane activators . 
the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) in toluene with Cp2ZrMe2 ( 1 ) - Ph3C+B(C6 F5)4- ( 4 ) as initiating system was kinetically investigated . this system can be regarded as a combination of the systems described by collins and soga . only if the ratio of <nUm> / <nUm> was larger than <nUm> , monomer conversions of more than <nUm> % and polymers with number - average molecular weights higher than <nUm> <nUm> and polydispersities <nUm> - <nUm> were obtained . from a kinetic analysis of time - conversion curves using the software package predici , it can be deduced that the mechanism is consistent with that proposed by collins et al. however , the mechanism has to be extended by incorporating a first - order termination reaction of the active species . rate coefficients of all elementary reactions were determined from time - conversion curves . the kinetic investigations were accompanied by ab initio calculations , which support the assumed kinetic model . 
combined systems including diphenylzinc , Ph2Zn , a metallocene , and methylaluminoxane , MAO , have been employed to initiate styrene polymerization . these initiator systems have been also used to initiate the copolymerization of styrene with p-alkylsubstituted styrenes and with a-olefins . both polymerization and copolymerization processes depend on the nature of the metallocene included in the initiator system , the presence of Ph2Zn , the temperature and the solvent used . titanocenes produced syndiotactic polystyrene , s-PS , while zirconocenes gave atactic polystyrene , a-PS , with a certain content , less the <nUm> % of s-PS . for copolymerizations the conversion to polymer was also influenced by the comonomer nature and its molar proportion in the initial feed , as well as the sort of metallocene , titanocene or zirconocene included . 
sterically hindered olefins like norbornene , dimethanooctahydronaphthalene ( DMON ) , 4-methylpentene , and 3-methylbutene can be copolymerised with ethene by metallocene / MAO catalysts . different C2- , cs- and C1 - symmetric and meso-zirconocenes were used . only isolated and alternating norbornene sequences but no norbornene blocks are formed by substituted [Me2C(Cp-R)(Flu)]ZrCl2 catalysts . the alternating microstructure leads to melting points up to <nUm> ° C for ethene - norbornene copolymers and up to <nUm> ° C for the semi ycrystalline alternating copolymer of ethene and DMON . other sterically hindered olefins such as 3-methylpentene build more blocky structures with high glass transition temperatures . the mechanism for the insertion reaction of the different catalysts is discussed . 
the combination of the copolymerisation ability and vinyl end group selectivity of siloxy substitution of ethylene-bridged bis(indenyl) zirconium dichlorides suggest these catalyst as potential ones for the production of polyethylene containing small amounts of long chain branching . the role of the polymerisation conditions with these highly active catalysts can clearly be seen . furthermore low contents of multiple branches may occur , even though the probability of attaching several macromonomers into one chain is low . the effect on melt rheological behaviour depends on both the amount of long chain branching and the length of the branch . moreover the position of the siloxy group is very important . polymers synthesized with catalysts , where the siloxy group is in position <nUm> , give peculiar rheological behaviour resembling cross-linked networks although the polymers are completely soluble . 
the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) with the neutral enolate cp 2ZrMe[OC(OMe) = CMe <nUm> ] in the absence and in the presence of zirconocene cations cp 2ZrMe + to bypass the rate- limited initiation of the system was investigated . only by itself the enolate is not active in polymerization , but as soon as the reaction system contains the cation MMA is quantitatively converted into syndiotactic - rich PMMA with high molecular weight ( m n > <nUm> <nUm> g mol <nUm> ) and very narrow molecular weight distribution ( m w / m n < <nUm> ) . the rate of polymerization was found to be first order reffering to the neutral enolate and also reffering to the cation . rate coefficents of all elementary reactions were determined and compared to those received by the kinetic investigation of the polymerization using the initiator system cp 2ZrMe <nUm> / ph 3CB ( C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> . the agreement of both sets of calculated coefficients is satisfying . these results confirm that the mechanism of collins et al. is suitable to describe the properties of the polymerization process . 
the copolymerization of propene with small amounts of ethene , catalyzed by tetrahydroindenyl zirconocenes such as [En(H4Ind)2]ZrCl22 or [Me2Si(H4Ind)2]ZrCl2 and MAO in liquid propene produces polymers with much higher activities and molecular weights than the homopolymerization of propene . the normal bisindenyl complexes does n't present such differences . the investigation of the microstructure shows for the tetrahydroindenyl catalyst that after a 2,1-insertion of a propene unit the system is in a sleeping state and can be activated when an ethene unit is inserted . In this case these catalysts become faster than the ansa bis-indenyl catalysts . an active catalyst for the copolymerization of ethene and norbornene is the more temperature stable [Me3PhPen(Flu)]ZrCl2 . this catalyst produces atactic copolymers with high molecular weights of ' over <nUm> <nUm> g / mol at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> mol % of norbornene content . 
A series of asymmetric ansa - zirconocene dichlorides were investigated in propene polymerization reactions with respect to monomer concentration and polymerization temperature . the two different coordination sides of these " dual - side " catalysts allow a precise control of the total amount of randomly distributed isolated stereoerrors along the isotactic polymer chains leading to bulk properties which can be adjusted from flexible , semicrystalline to excellent thermoplastic elastic . the obtained homopolypropenes have a great potential to come into competition with commercialized copolymers for possible industrial applications . 
In this paper , we investigate different routes to lower drastically the amount of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) required to activate racEt(Ind)2ZrX2 catalysts towards olefin polymerization . A first approach consists in replacing Cl ligands by more easily extractable x groups such as me , CH2Ph or NMe2 groups . A second method focuses on the preparation of TMA - depleted MAO either by pumping off TMA from commercial MAO or by exploring new synthetic source to MAO via non-hydrolytic processes such as the reaction of TMA with benzophenone . both methods allowed us to produce polyolefins with a maximal catalytic activity for AI / Zr ratios not exceeding <nUm> , i.e. ratio <nUm> times lower than those required in the presence of commercial MAO . 
Meso-[Me2Si(2-Me-4,6-iPr2Ind)2 Cl2Zr was synthesized in a pure form and used as catalyst for the copolymerization of ethene and a-olefins . the results are compared with polymers obtained by C1 - symmetric metallocenes and constrained geometry catalysts . the activity of the meso form is remarkable high and reaches more than <nUm> <nUm> kg polymer / mol zr*h . the ligand structure has large influence on the incorporation of 1-octene forming thermoplastics ( LLDPE ) and thermoplastic elastomers ( POE ) . 
this work examines a polymerisation catalyst based on zirconocene with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as a cocatalyst on silica surfaces . calculations were carried out using the atom superposition and electron delocalisation method ( ASED-MO ) considering the ( 111 ) and ( 100 ) silica planes , both completely and partially hydrated . our results suggest the production of a cationic zirconocene as a final step for the active site formation for ( 111 ) silica plane , occurring preferentially on partially hydrated silica . on the contrary this may not be possible for the ( 100 ) plane resulting in this case in the formation of a MAO - zirconocene complex as a final and most stable state . 
this work presents a proposal for a mechanism of olefin polymerization using metallocenes , taking into account the effect of the counter ion , solvent , and olefin . the ystenes mechanism is also evaluated for the different symmetries of zirconocenes and for soluble and supported catalysts . the mechanism is related to experimental evidence and analyzed taking into account publisbed results about polymer characterization , kinetic evidence , and other experimental facts . the model tries to give a reasonable explanation for the different dependencies of the kinetics on the monomer : between <nUm> and <nUm> for Cs and C2 catalysts and <nUm> for c2v . 
bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconocene dimethyl ( Cp2ZrMe2 ) combined with triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] ) was brought into contact with a suspension of <nUm> % cross-linked poly(4-vinylpyridine) to give a new type of polymer - supported cationic zirconocene catalyst . the resulting polymer - supported catalyst system combined with Al(i-Bu3) showed markedly high activity for ethylene polymerization in even a non-polar solvent like hexane at 25-60 ° C and [Al] / [Zr] molar ratio 40-200 . by the analysis of Zr content of the hexane solution , it was found that no Zr was detected in the solution , i.e. no leaching of the cationic catalyst into the hexane medium . the catalytic activity was found to increase with an increase of polymerization temperature and showed the highest at [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> . the molecular weight , crystalline melting temperature , crystallinity , and bulk density of polyethylene formed were higher than those of the polymer obtained from the homogeneous system . 
the cationic bridged zirconocene complex [iPr(Cp)(Ind)Zr(Me)(THF)][BPh4] ( 1-BPh4 ) was synthesized . polymerization of methyl methacrylate with 1-BPh4 in CCl2H2 at temperatures between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C led to the formation of isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate ) . the low polydispersity index of the polymer obtained and a successful two step polymerization of methyl methacrylate with 1-BPh4 are hints towards a living polymerization mechanism . 1H and 13C NMR analysis revealed an enantiomorphic site - controlled mechanism for the formation of isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate ) . 
communication : using two different zirconocene / MAO catalyst systems , propene was copolymerized with the comonomers 2-(9-decene-1-yl)-1,3-oxazoline and 2-(4-(10-undecene-1-oxo)phenyl)-1,3-oxazoline , respectively . the catalysts used were rac-Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 and rac-Me2:Si[2-Me-4 , 5-BenzInd]2ZrCl2 . up to <nUm> mol- % oxazoline could be incorporated into polypropene . oxazoline content , molecular weight , degree of isotacticity and melting behavior were dependent on the catalyst system , comonomer structure and comonomer concentration in the feed . 
ethylene was polymerized with cycloalkylidene-bridged cyclopentadienyl metallocene catalysts 1-9 in the presence of methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) as the cocatalyst . unlike the normal titanocene catalysts , the cycloalkylidene-bridged cyclopentadienyl titanocene catalysts show much higher activities than the corresponding zirconocene and hafnocene catalysts and show the highest activities at higher temperature . this indicates that the cycloalkylidene-bridged cyclopentadienyl titanocene system is very thermally stable and maybe a very promising catalyst system for industrial application . 
C2 - symmetric zirconocenes activated by methylaluminoxane were utilized as catalysts in the polymerization of 1,3-diolefins . the results indicate that the most crowded catalytic precursor rac[CH2(3-tertbutyl-1-indenyl)2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) is also the most active one , giving 1,4-polymerization of 1,3-butadiene and (Z)-1,3-pentadiene and 1,2-polymerization of (E)-1,3-pentadiene and 4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene . probably , the different behavior of <nUm> with respect to other C2 - symmetric zirconocenes utilized is due to the different stability of the bond between the last inserted monomer unit and the metal , as well as to the coordination of incoming monomer . 
In this review , various synthetic and structural aspects of methylaluminoxane and the elementary processes involved in olefin polymerization , as identified by various spectroscopic techniques , are detailed . various boron - based counterions and their interactions with metal - locenium cations are discussed . A comparison between MAO and boron - based activators in terms of catalytic activity and polymer characteristics is made . finally , the use of the above system in the polymerization of cationically polymerizable monomers and acrylates is discussed . 
we report the first successful block copolymerization of ethylene and methyl methacrylate using a zirconocene - based catalyst system . the catalyst is generated in situ from Me2C(Cp)(Ind)ZrMe2 and BC18F15 in toluene . block copolymerization is achieved via the sequential addition of the monomers , starting with ethylene . the composition of the block copolymer is shown to be dependent on the time allowed for ethylene polymerization . the solubility of the resulting polymers , NMR data and GPC measurements are discussed , and a polymerization mechanism is proposed . 
the kinetics of the ethylene-norbornene copolymerization , catalyzed by rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO , <nUm> % rac / <nUm> % meso-Et(4,7-Me2Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO and rac-H2C(3-tert-BuInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO was followed by sampling from the reaction mixture at fixed time intervals . catalyst activity , copolymer composition and molar mass were studied as a function of time . the polymers showed an unusually low polydispersity and a significant increase in their molar mass with time , suggesting a quasi-living polymerization . 
this work presents a theoretical and experimental study of the active sites formation in the system EtInd2ZrCl2 / MAO . results about the effect of additives as a lewis acid ( AlCl3 ) or a lewis base ( EB ) are also anaylzed . the theoretical study takes into account all the known steps in the active site formation : alkylation of zirconocene , formation of a polarized complex metallocene : MAO , formation of a contact ion pair and finally a solvent separated ion pair . other reactions of the zirconocene with other aluminum alkyls ( AlCl3 and AlMe3 ) are also presented and studied . UV - vis experimental results of the additive effects are reported and explained taking into account the theoretical results . A short review of our results and others is presented to complete and discuss the ideas . the most probable sites are loosened contact ion pairs , not the solvent separated ion pairs . 
the central purpose of this work is to develop an to attach the metallocene to a support without diminishing its catalytic activity . this article describes several methods to prepare supported EtInd2ZrCl2 ( EBI ) on MAO / O2Si , varying the washing step durations and washing step temperatures . the best method is the one that supports <nUm> % Zr on MAO / O2Si with a final content of Al near <nUm> % . it seems that this method combines high efficiency in MAO usage at the preparation step and high activity in propylene polymerization . the activity of the supported catalysts EBI / MAO / O2Si decreases to the third of the soluble catalysts EBI / MAO with the same Al / Zr molar ratio . Zr con tents higher than <nUm> % produce catalysts with lower productivities . probably , a MAO coverage in O2Si that is higher than a monolayer is not useful in order to stabilize the zirconocene on the MASO / O2Si support . this paper reports the kinetics of the supported catalysts and a discussion about the shape of the curves and the stability of the catalysts is appended . the molecular weight of the poly(propylene) obtained with supported catalyst increases , especially for the best preparation , comparing it with material obtained with the soluble one . the regioregularity of poly(propylene) increases when a lewis base ( ethyl benzoate-E.B . ) is added as external additive to the system EBI / MAO / O2Si and the activity of the supported catalyst is improved . 
this paper reports the effect of co- and non-copolymerizable lewis bases in propylene polymerization with the soluble system EtInd2ZrCl2 / MAO . with non-copolymerizable lewis bases , the activity and the molar mass of poly(propylene) are diminished . this result is unusual because there is agreement about the cationic nature of the active site in zirconocene / MAO systems and the effect of a lewis base must be to decrease the termination constant versus the propagation constant , considering the diminished electrophilicity of Zr . In the case of copolymerizable lewis bases , the negative effect on activity is higher . an explanation of the data is given , with a new model of lewis bases / cationic Zr interaction , taking account of recent reports about the structure of active sites . 
ethylene was polymerized using a combination of Ni(a-diimine)Cl2 ( 1 ) ( a-diimine = 1,4-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)acenaphthenediimine ) and rac-ethylene bis(IndH4)ZrCl2 ( 2 ) ( IndH4 = 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-ns-indenyl ) compounds , activated with methylaluminoxane in toluene . the polymerization were performed at three different temperatures ( <nUm> . 30. and <nUm> ° C ) , and the effect of varying the zirconium loading molar fraction ( xZr ) was monitored . the polymerization runs carried out of <nUm> and <nUm> ° C show that the productivity increases linearly with xZr . on the other hand , at <nUm> ° C the productivity reaches a maximum of <nUm> × <nUm> kg of PE / mol[M]*h for xZr = <nUm> , indicating a non-linear correlation between the productivity and xZr . the polyethylene characteristics have been evaluated by means of differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) , and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . the PE produced at <nUm> and <nUm> ° C showed monomodal molecular weight distributions with narrow polydispersities . At higher temperature ( <nUm> ° C ) , using xZr = <nUm> , two different polyethylenes were produced ; an amorphous rubbery PE with mw of <nUm> × <nUm> g*mol-1 and a linear high density PE with mw of <nUm> × <nUm> g*mol-1 . DSC thermograms of the PE obtained at <nUm> ° C ( xZr = <nUm> - <nUm> ) showed the presence of two melting points corresponding to branched and linear PE , indicating a low compatibility between the phases . by SEM it was observed that the branched polyethylene obtained at <nUm> ° C forms very small aggregates dispersed in the linear polyethylene matrix , but the polymer obtained at <nUm> ° C forms larger particles which show low compatibility with the linear polyethylene . 
phenol - functionalized polyethylenes were prepared by copolymerization of ethylene with 4-allylanisole in the presence of metallocene / MAO catalysis , followed by demethylation . anisole groups incorporated in polyethylene main chains were quantitatively converted to phenol functional groups by treating the copolymers with AlCl3 . the copolymerization of ethylene with 4-allylanisole revealed that the bridged metallocene catalyst seemed to favor the incorporation of the polar comonomer compared to the hindered metallocene catalyst . increase of the MAO concentration markedly enhanced the activity of the catalysts , but it diminished the incorporation of the polar comonomer . the end group analysis of the copolymers showed that chain transfer to aluminium occured more frequently than other chain transfer reactions . 
details of the preparation and polymerization behavior of two chiral zirconocene catalysts are presented . the results of experimental and molecular - mechanics evaluation of their stereoselectivity with respect to liquid - propene polymerization are compared with those of a related catalyst system . the elastic properties of the obtained amorphous poly(propylene) , due to the presence of small g-form crystallites , are compared with those of a highmolecular weight atactic poly(propylene) obtained in the presence of a c2v catalyst . 
propylene polymerization was conducted with the Cp2ZrHCl / BC18F15 / [tBuNSiMe2Flu]TiMe2 catalyst system with AlOct3 as a scavenger at <nUm> ° C . the polymer obtained displayed a bimodal molar mass distribution . it could be confirmed that the polymer with higher mn was produced from Zr active sites and the polymer with lower mn resulted from Ti active sites . In both fractions , mn was increased linearly with increasing polymerization time . the MWD ( mw / mn ) values of each fraction were around <nUm> . thus , it could be said that propylene polymerization proceeded in a living manner even with zirconocene active species by using the mixed metallocene system . the living like polymerization of propylene with Cp2ZrMe2 / BC18F15 / Cp*TiCl3 was also demonstrated at <nUm> ° C . under the reaction between carbon monoxide ( CO ) and this living polypropylene ( PP ) at <nUm> ° C , it could be found that CO was quantitatively incorporated into living PP . 
propylene polymerization was conducted with CS symmetric (Ph2C)CpFluZrCl2 / B(C6 F5)3 / cp* TiMe3 system using AlOct3 as a scavenger at <nUm> ° C . the polymer produced was consisted by two kinds of fractions ; i.e. , hexane soluble ( atactic ) fraction and hexane insoluble fraction . the insoluble polymer had highly syndiotactic structure , indicating that the polymer was produced from CS symmetric zirconocene . mu 's increased linearly with increasing polymer yield , although the activity was low . thus , it could be said that syndiospecific polymerization of propylene proceeded in a living like manner with CS symmetric zirconocene active species by using the mixed metallocene system . and by the reaction of the syndiotactic poly(propylene) chain end with carbon monoxide ( CO ) , it could be found that CO was quantitatively incorporated into the syndioPP-Zr chain end . 
the polymerization of 1-hexene with the catalyst systems Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO and Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 / MAO is investigated in order to elucidate the nature of the active species in zirconocene / MAO catalyzed polymerizations . varying monomer concentration and monomer conversion does not result in any unexpected behavior . however , changing catalyst and cocatalyst concentration leads to broadened , or even bimodal , molecular weight distributions under certain reaction conditions . these results may be interpreted in terms of a coexistence of two active species with different rates of propagation and of termination . 
the effect of polymerization temperature on the polymerization of 1-hexene with the catalyst systems Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO , Me2SiCp2ZrCl2 / MAO , EtInd2ZrCl2 / MAO , Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 / MAO and 1PrCpFluZrCl2 / MAO is investigated in this paper . the molecular weight and the molecular weight distribution of poly(1-hexene) provide experimental evidence for a deviation from single - site behavior at certain polymerization temperatures , depending on the catalyst system . experimental results are interpreted in terms of different active species prevailing at different polymerization temperatures , and coexisting under certain reaction conditions . 
A series of Cp'(C5H5)ZrCl2 and Cp2'ZrCl2 precatalysts ( cp' = C5HMe4 , C4Me4P , C5Me5 , C5H4tBu , C5H3-1,3-tBu2 , C5H2-1,2,4tBu3 ) together with C10Cl2H10Zr was used for the directed oligomerization of propene and 1-hexene in comparative experiments . oligomer characterization was carried out by 1H NMR , SEC ( GPC ) , MALDI - TOF , MS , cryoscopy and raman spectroscopy . from 1H NMR the nature and relative ratio of the double - bond end group is determined together with Mn if every oligomer molecule contains such a double bonds ( from b-hydrogen elimination ) are found . from 1H NMR and MALDI - TOF MS also vinyl end groups ( from b-methyl elimination ) are observed in the case of oligopropenes with (C4Me4P)-(C5H5)ZrCl2 and with the symmetrical methyl containing Cp2'ZrCl2 pre-catalyst . the vinylidene / vinyl ratio depends on the ligand and increases from C5HMe4 ( <nUm> / <nUm> ) over C4Me4P ( <nUm> / <nUm> ) to C5Me5 ( <nUm> / <nUm> ) . A comparison of Mn from 1H NMR and SEC together with MALDI - TOF MS shows that the phospholyl-zirconocenes and (C5HMe4)2ZrCl2 also exhibit chain transfer to aluminium , thereby giving saturated oligomers . 
copolymerization of ethylene and cyclopentene ( CPE ) was carried out with various non-bridge and bridged zirconocene catalysts using methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst . non-bridged metallocene catalysts effected ethylene homopolymerization without copolymerization . on the other hand , bridged zirconocene catalysts produced copolymers containing cis-1,2-cyclopentane units . among the used catalysts , rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride [Et(Ind)2ZrCl2] gave copolymers containing the highest amount of CPE units by 1,2-insertion of 1,3-insertion . temperature - rising elution fractionation of the copolymers using 1,2-dichlorobenzene as a solvent showed a broad distribution of copolymer composition in copolymers obtained by specific zirconocene catalysts . 
A series of sila - bridged dinuclear zirconocenes [ E(C5H4)2[Cp'ZrCl2]2 ( Cp'C5H5 , e = Me2Si ( 1 ) Me2SiSiMe2 ( 2 ) , Me2SiOSiMe2 ( 3 ) , Me2SiOSiMe2OSiMe2 ( 4 ) Cp'C5HME4 , e = Me2SiOSiMe2 ( 5 ) , Me2SiOSiMe2OSiMe2 ( 6 ) ) have been synthesized . these complexes have been studied as catalysts for ethylene polymerizationin the presence of MAO . polymerization results indicated that the polymerization activity of the zirconocenes increased as the bridging ligand became longer for the same type of bridging ligands . complex <nUm> , holding trisiloxane bridging , exhibited greater activity than the mononuclear zirconocene [Cp2ZrCl2] . all the siloxane - bridged dinuclear zirconocenes showed the highest activity than at higher temperature ( <nUm> or <nUm> ° C ) in contrast to the corresponding siloxane - bridged dinuclear cyclopentadienyl and indenyl zirconocenes which showed a maximum activity at <nUm> ° C . the molecular weight of polyethylene with <nUm> was very high at low temperature ( <nUm> × <nUm> g · mol at <nUm> ° C ) but decreased significantly with increasing temperature . the molecular weight distributions obtained for polyethylene were similar with the mononuclear metallocene catalysts at low temperature . the tetramethylcyclopentadienyl complexes <nUm> and <nUm> showed lower polymerization activities than the corresponding cyclopentadienyl complexes <nUm> and <nUm> as a result of steric effects . the relationship between structure and catalytic properties of catalysts has been discussed . 
the solvent effect observed in propene / 1-hexene copolymerizations performed with the isospecific catalyst rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO is studied . A range of solvents with increasing donor character and steric hindrance has been tested , and their effect on copolymer yield , composition , and microstructure has been thoroughly analyzed . our results demonstrate that the solvent can have a significant influence on the comonomer reactivities , even though the solvent polarity is not the relevant factor . At the same comonomer compositions in solution , polymerization carried out in coordinating solvents ( e. g. , aromatic solvents ) , lead to the formation of products with considerably decreased content of 1-hexene . the reuced incorporation of the higher a-olifen is explained in terms of competition between the nucleophilic medium and the olefin monomer for coordination to the active polymerization site . these results give us valuable information regarding the mechanism of polymerization at the active centers . 
copolymerization of ethylene and 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) was carried out with non-bridged or bridged zirconocene catalysts using methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as a cocatalyst . the resulting copolymers were extracted with boiling o-dichlorobenzene ( ODCB ) to fractionate into soluble and insoluble parts . the ligand structure of zirconocenes , the feed ratio of HD , and the catalyst concentration strongly affected the copolymer composition . In the copolymerization with non-bridged zirconocene catalysts , the amount of boiling ODCB - soluble part decreased with increasing HD content in the copolymer . on the other hand , with bridged zirconocene catalysts , it increased with increasing HD content in the copolymer . the bridged zirconocene catalysts were apt to take in more HD than non-bridged catalysts . effect of catalyst concentration was investigated in relation to crosslinking reaction . temperature - rising elution fractionation ( TREF ) of the boiling ODCB - soluble part was conducted to show the occurrence of heterogenous composition in copolymers obtained with some specific zirconocene catalysts . 
three series of novel unbridged bicyclic cyclopentadienyl zirconium complexes , containing six- , seven- and eight - membered saturated rings fused to the cyclopentadienyl unit and bearing different substituents ( -H , -CH3 , -Ph ) in position <nUm> , were used in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) for the polymerization of propene at different temperatures . all the catalysts have been shown to be active , the lowest activity being observed with the eight - membered ring systems . with most catalysts the polymers obtained are fully atactic when the polymerizations are conducted at <nUm> ° C , and become partially isotactic at lower temperatures . the 13C NMR analysis shows that in one case , that is , when the seven - membered ring is associated with the phenyl substituent in position <nUm> , a preponderance of the isotactic heptad in the methyl region of 13C NMR spectrum is observed , which allows us to hypothesize the formation of stereoblocks . 
the copolymerization of propene with ethene in feed concentrations up to <nUm> mol- % ethene was investigated in dependence on catalyst substitution , activation and process conditions . polymerization reactions were performed using rac-[ethylene-bis(e5-1-indenyl)]ZrCl2 ( 1a ) , [bis(e5-1-indenyl)dimethylsilane]ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , and [bis(e5-1-(2-methylindenyl))dimethylsilane]ZrCl2 ( 3a ) after MAO- and rac-[ethylene-bis(e5-1-indenyl)]Zr(CH3)2 ( 1b ) as well as [bis-(e5-1-(2-methylindenyl))dimethylsilane]Zr CH3 ( 3b ) after borate - activation . A detailed study of the polymerization kinetics of the different metallocene catalysts was performed by using an autoclave system that allowed to follow the changes in concentration of propene and ethene in the gas and in the liquid phase , even for the first minutes of the polymerization experiments . it is known that 2-methyl substitution retards the rate of chain transfer to propene monomer , leading to increased molecular weights of the resulting homopolypropenes . however , the catalyst system 3a / MAO , bearing a CH3 - substituent in 2,2'-position of the indenyl moieties , shows a significant decline of the molecular mass of propene - ethene copolymers by rising the ethene concentration , while catalysts 1a and <nUm> , having no methyl substitution , give a distinct increase of molecular weight . our investigations show that the observed molecular weight decline is independent of the process conditions , but it depends clearly on the catalyst substitution and , in some cases , on the activation process . b-Hydride elimination to the Zr(IV) - center is the dominating chain termination process for metallocene catalysts bearing methyl groups in the 2,2'-position . chain termination via transfer to monomer and to aluminum are the preferred termination mechanisms for complexes lacking the CH3 substituents . 
copolymerizations of ethylene and 1,7-octadiene ( OD ) and 1,9-decadiene ( DD ) were investigated with various non-bridged and bridged zirconocene catalysts using methylisobutylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst . the resulting copolymers were extracted with boiling o-dichlorobenzene ( ODCB ) , and the structure of the boiling ODCB - soluble part was studied by 1H , 13C NMR and DEPT ( distortionless enhancement of polarization transfer ) spectroscopy . In the case of ethylene / OD copolymerization , the ligand structure of the zirconocene catalysts strongly affected the propagation mode of OD . the zirconocene catalysts having cyclopentadienyl or pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligands gave copolymers having 1-hexenyl and 1,3-disubstituted cycloheptane units , derived from 1,2-addition propagation and addition - cyclization propagation of OD , respectively . on the other hand , the zirconocene catalysts with indenyl ligand produced the copolymers having exclusively 1,3-disubstituted cycloheptane units . furthermore , the copolymer prepared by diphenylmethylene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride was crosslinked . the diastereostructure of the 1,3-disubstituted cycloheptane units in the copolymers was not influenced by the stereospecificity of the catalysts used , and a cis-structure was preferentially formed . In the case of the copolymerization of ethylene and DD , the c2v- symmetric zirconocene catalysts produced the copolymers with 1-octenyl branches derived from 1,2-addition propagation of DD . other C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocene catalysts with bulky ligands yielded copolymers with crosslinking structures derived form addition propagation of sidechain unsaturated bond of 1,2-added DD units .

treatment of z-vinyl carbamates with dicyclopentadienyl(diethyl)zirconium [Et2ZrCp2] leads to cyclobutyl-zirconocene derivatives in good yields and as a unique diastereoisomer . the reaction proceeds through a carbometalative ring - expansion followed by an intramolecular migratory insertion . 
polyethylene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PE-b-PMMA ) diblock copolymer has important interfacial applications . hence , a PE-b-isotactic PMMA diblock copolymer was synthesized using SiMe2(Ind)2ZrMe2 and MAO cocatalyst . the polymerization mechanism and the origin of PMMA isotacticity were duly explained . an appropriate nonisothermal avrami - erofeev crystallization model was developed to compare the crystallization kinetics of the above copolymer with that of a PE homopolymer . for both polymers , the model well matched the entire differential scanning calorimeter crystallinity profile , notably for a single avrami - erofeev index , and predicted cylindrical crystal growth . this model particularly overcomes the limitations of the published nonisothermal crystallization models , and provides interesting insight into PE crystallization . the PMMA block significantly decreased the heats of crystallization and fusion , % crystallinity , and the relative crystallization function ; increased the nonisothermal crystallization rate constant ; and introduced minimal dilution effect whereas the PE block formed a continuous or percolated phase . this study correlates catalyst structure , copolymer block tacticity , and PE nonisothermal crystallization and melting behavior .

the structure and creativity spectrum of transition-metal carbene complexes has been widened significantly by the bent metallocenes of titanium , zirconium , and hafnium . proceeding from metal carbonyls and reactive (butadiene)- , (aryne)- , or ( olefin ) MCp2 complexes , many new fischer-type metaloxycarbene complexes of Zr , Hf , V , Nb , Cr , Mo , W , Mn , Re , Fe , Ru , Os , Co , Ni , and Rh have been synthesized . the incorporation of titanocene , zirconocene , or hafnocene fragments allows new types of carbene complexes to be prepared . for the (alkylidenamido)metallocene complexes ( formula presented . ) , metallocene ylides ( formula presented . ) , and binuclear (m-alkynyl)metallocene compounds , some metalligand π bonding is indicated . metallocene complexes with metallaoxirane units , ( formula presented . ) , show similar chemical behavior to that of binuclear (m-methylene)complexes ( formula presented . ) . the methylene groups of zirconaoxirane complexes , which are derived from carbon monoxide , may be expelled as ethylene by thermally induced CC coupling . with metal hydrides , CH2 transfer with insertion into the metal – hydride bond occurs . In one case , methylene insertion into a metal – carbon bond can even be observed . these reactions of ti-group metallaoxiranes could be models for postulated intermediates in the fischer – tropsch synthesis . 
approximately <nUm> % stereoselectivity in the creation of the second chiral center is observed during olefin oligomerization when chiral zirconocene complex (S)-1 together with methylalumoxane is used as catalyst . the oligomerization product mixture can be largely restricted to dimers through pentamers by appropriate choice of catalyst-to-monomer concentration . relatively straight forward access is thereby provided to alkyl-substituted 1-alkenes such as <nUm> and <nUm> , which could be of interest in the synthesis of pheromones and other modestly functionalized chiral compounds . [Zr(CH2-indenyl)2{O2CCH(OAc)Ph}2] ( figure presented . ) 
clear structure-activity relationships were observed in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene with the novel , easily preparable catalysts <nUm> and <nUm> : In the presence of methylaluminoxane , <nUm> polymerizes propylene with high activity to a polypropylene having a high average molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution ; <nUm> is inactive in this reaction , but nevertheless polymerizes ethylene . the angle subtended by the indenyl ligand system appears to be decisive .

the development of catalytic processes that effect enantioselective bond formation under mild conditions is an important and challenging task in modern chemical synthesis . In this connection , chiral C2 - symmetric ansa - metallocenes ( bridged metallocenes ) have found notable applications as catalysts . this article discusses the chemistry of this class of chiral metallocene complexes with regard to their utility in catalytic and enantioselective C-C and C-H bond formation reactions . In addition , where applicable , a brief comparison with other related catalytic enantioselective processes is offered . many of the reactions effected with high levels of enantioselectivity by catalytic amounts of these complexes are of great significance to the preparation of new materials and in the synthesis of therapeutic agents . for example , zirconocene complexes readily catalyze the enantioselective addition of alkylmagnesium halides to alkenes , and cationic zirconocene complexes may promote the highly stereoregulated copolymerization of terminal alkenes . furthermore , the related chiral titanocenes are involved in an impressive range of useful asymmetric catalytic reactions , including the enantioselective hydrogenation of olefins and reduction of imines or ketones . this review attempts to bring together the practical aspects of the use of [(ebthi)M] complexes of group <nUm> transition metals ( catalyst synthesis and resolution ) , outline the manner in which the C2 - symmetric chiral ligands are believed to initiate stereoselective bond formation , and highlight the aspects of this chemistry that are less well understood and require further research .

after more than <nUm> years , the friedel - crafts alkylation is still one of the most studied and most utilized reactions in organic synthesis . what is the secret of this astonishing success ? perhaps the great versatility in scope and applicability continues to justify its crucial role in the synthesis of more and more complex molecules . however , it has taken more than a century for asymmetric catalytic versions of this reaction to be developed and subsequently extended to a range of aromatic compounds and alkylating agents . herein we review recent developments in the design and use of catalytic and stereoselective strategies for the alkylation of aromatic systems and synthesis of a wide range of polyfunctionalized enantiomerically enriched compounds . 
terminal alkenes act as dual nucleophiles in a zirconocene - mediated , highly 1,4-diastereoselective , tandem reduction - allylation reaction of 1,4-diketones .

structural limitations in small cyclic hydrocarbons are a longstanding challenge to chemistry , leading to molecules with unusual geometric parameters and reactivity . for example , incorporation of C = C = C = C or C-C ≡ C-C arrangements , which are normally linear in open - chain compounds , into small carbocyclic rings results in enormous ring strain as a result of the angle deformation . nevertheless , such uncommon structures have been realized by complexation of zirconocene fragments with butadiynes and butatrienes , giving five - membered metallacyclocumulenes and metallacyclopentynes . the metal atom is essential for these molecules but complicates the simplified description because of internal interactions of the metals with the multiple bonds . 
unexpected results are obtained on treatment of alkene - zirconocene complexes with cyclic enol ethers . the ring size of the enol ether makes the reaction proceed through different mechanisms allowing zalkenols to be prepared from furan derivatives and cyclobutanes from pyran derivatives ( see scheme ) .

both amido-(cyclopentadienyl)boranes and bis(cyclopentadienyl)boranes of the types R2NB(CxHy) ( NR' ) and R2NB(CxHy)2 ( r = alkyl , trimethylsilyl ; R' = ph ; CxHy = CH ( cyclopentadienyl ) , C9H7 ( indenyl ) , C13H9 ( fluorenyl ) ) were recently shown to form corresponding boron - bridged group <nUm> metallocenes that exhibit high activities in ziegler - natta - type catalysed olefin polymerization . here , the same boranes were utilized in the formation of metallocenes of ytterbium and zirconium , where the ligands selectively bind in a non-chelate fashion . the resulting complexes [ yb{e5- (C5H4)B(NiPr2)NHt Bu}2{N(SiMe3)2} ] ( 2 ) and [ Zr{e5-(C9H6)B(N (SiMe3)2)(C9H7)}Cl2 ] ( 4 ) allow studies on these ligands in a metal - bonded , though unstrained , environment . furthermore , these complexes might find use as precursors in the formation of organometallic polymers , since they exhibit a readily available moiety for the coordination of further transition metal centres . both complexes were fully characterized by multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and x-ray structure determination . 
the para-substituted diphenylzirconocenes [ (t-BuCp)2Zr(p-C6H4R)2 ; r = Br , NMe2 ] ( A ) were easily obtained from the reaction of the appropriate organolithium reagent with bis(t-butylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride . elimination of bromobenzene or N,N-dimethylaminobenzene from A by slight heating led to arynezirconocenes into which were inserted two equivalents of elementary chalcogens . As a result dichalcogenated zirconacycles [ (t-BuCp)2ZrY2C6H3R ; Y = S , Se ] ( B ) were obtained . complexes B constitute useful potential synthons in organic synthesis and a large family of new functionalized dichalcogenated benzenic compounds was prepared by reacting electrophiles . the structure of complexes B as well as related benzenic derivatives has been confirmed by microanalysis , 1H NMR and mass spectrometry . 
soluble metallocene catalysts can be easily metered into high pressure polymerization reactors . the performance of a homogeneous zirconocene catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene under high pressures was tested at <nUm> bar and temperatures between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C in the presence of methyl aluminoxane as cocatalyst . besides the productivity of the catalyst and the overall rate of polymerization , the most important properties of the prepared polymers were determined . the results were compared with those found earlier with a heterogeneous titanium catalyst supported on magnesium dichloride . 
A quantitative study was carried out on the homogeneous zirconocene dichloride / methylalumoxane / trimethylaluminum ( Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO / TMA ) catalyst system in ethylene polymerization . the effects of variation of the AlMAO / Zr ratio , absolute Zr concentration , and addition of TMA on ethylene polymerization activity and polymer properties were investigated . the polymerization profiles for small AlMAO / Zr ratios and the changes with the Zr concentration are explained with a complexation equilibrium for the active homogeneous complex and with the change to a heterogeneous catalyst upon polymer precipitation . good polymer productivities can be achieved at AlMAO / Zr < <nUm> when working at Zr concentrations between <nUm> − <nUm> and <nUm> − <nUm> mol / l with addition of TMA ( AlMAO / AlTMA ≈ <nUm> ) . 
the system zirconocene dichloride / methylalumoxane was supported on silica in order to provide ethylene polymerization catalysts for suspension or gas phase processes . highest activity was found for a sandwich-like , three layer anchoring of the zirconium centers on the support surface . the new catalyst systems show a decrease of activity compared to polymerization experiments in homogeneous phase . however , the molecular weights are increased and the weight distributions remain narrow by immobilization of the active catalyst sites . those supported metallocene catalysts could find application for the synthesis of polyethylene materials with controlled rheology . 
ethylene / propylene copolymers ( EPM ) have been prepared by a liquid propylene suspension process , using homogeneous catalysts based on nonbridged zirconocenes and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . when bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) , bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl) dimethyl zirconium ( Cp2ZrMe2 ) and bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl) , dibenzyl zirconium ( Cp2ZrBz2 ) were used as catalyst components , EPM having low average molecular weight ( MW ) were in general obtained in low yield . on the contrary , a very large improvement of productivity and MW was observed when bis(e5-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( Ind2ZrCl2 ) and bis(e5-indenyl) dimethyl zirconium ( Ind2ZrMe2 ) as well as bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride [(IndH4)2ZrCI2] were employed in combination with MAO . In particular , this last catalytic system allowed one to obtain EPM with a narrower distribution of MW in addition to the above characteristics . better performances , in terms of rheological and elastomeric properties , were also found for the crude and vulcanized samples prepared by (IndH4)2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst . 
mesoporous molecular sieves , with pore diameters of 2.6-25 nm , were impregnated with methylaluminoxane and bis(butylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride and tested as catalysts for the gas - phase homopolymerization of ethylene at ethylene pressures of <nUm> psi and temperatures of 50-100 ° C and for 1-hexene / ethylene copolymerization at <nUm> ° C . the activities and activity profiles , at constant Zr and Al contents , depended on the pore size of the supports and the polymerization temperature . maximum activities for both the homopolymerizations and copolymerizations were observed for catalysts made with supports having pore diameters of <nUm> and <nUm> nm . homopolymerization activities were highest at temperatures of 70-80 ° C ; average homopolymerization and copolymerization activities up to <nUm> kg of polyethylene / ( mol of Zr h ) were obtained . the weight - average molecular weights ( mw 's ) were not a function of the support pore size but decreased with increasing reaction temperatures , from about <nUm> at <nUm> ° C to about <nUm> at <nUm> ° C . the polydispersities were essentially constant at <nUm> ± <nUm> for the homopolymers . mw 's for the 1-hexene / ethylene copolymers had an average value of <nUm> with an average polydispersity of <nUm> . the amount of triisobutyl aluminum added to the reactor significantly affected the activity and activity profiles . 
the activity of metallocene catalysts in ethylene polymerization can be increased by a factor of up to <nUm> when the corresponding metallocene catalyst precursors possess one or two bulky alkyl ligands such as benzyl groups instead of the conventional chloro ligands . we assume that in the activation process with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) these bulky alkyl groups are transferred from the metal to the MAO cocatalyst . the actual cocatalyst is supposed to be a cage with one or more monomeric AlMe3 molecules inside . the bulky alkyl group is transferred to such an AlMe3 unit and can act as a spacer separating the catalytically active metallocenium cation from the MAO anion . this effect is supposed to be responsible for the increase in activity . 
blends of polyethylene ( PE ) were produced in a single reactor using a combination of { [ ( 2-ArN = C(Me))2C5H3N]FeCl2 } [ Ar = 2,6-2CH3(C6H4) ] and rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 . the experimental results showed that the EsP obtained have a broad molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) and both the molecular weight and the MWD can be regulated through changing the mole ratio of the two active sites . In addition , the polymerization activities decreased with the increase of the Fe / Zr mole ratio whereas the crystallinity of the PE obtained exhibited a contrary trend , decreasing as the Fe / Zr mole ratio went up . the morphology of the blends also directly relates to the Fe / Zr mole ratio , and more iron content in the bimetallic catalysts system gives rise to compact EsP of high crystallinity . this reflects that the reactor blends are morphology controllable as well and can be easily applied to present processing techniques because of adjustable molecular weights and their distribution . differential scanning calorimetry , thermogravimetric analysis , gel permeation chromatography , and scanning electron microscopy were employed to characterize the properties of the reactor blends of EsP . 
A series of hybrid supported catalysts were prepared by combining (iBuCp)2ZrCl2 and ( TpMs*(TiCl <nUm> complex ( TpMs* = HB(3-mesityl-pyrazolyl) 2(5-mesityl-pyrazolyl)- ) sequentially grafted onto MAO (methylaluminoxane)-modified silica according to a plackett burmann <nUm> <nUm> design . supported catalysts were prepared taking into account the immobilization order , silica pretreatment temperature , and grafting temperature . grafted metal content was comparatively determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) , x-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy ( XPS ) , and inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectroscopy ( ICP - OES ) . the resulting catalysts were evaluated in terms of catalyst activity and polymer properties . according to RBS measurements , grafted metal content remained comprised between <nUm> and <nUm> wt % Zr / O2Si and <nUm> and <nUm> wt % Ti / O2Si depending on the immobilization order and on silica pretreatment temperature . all the systems were shown to be active in ethylene polymerization having external MAO as cocatalyst . catalyst activity seemed to be governed by the zirconocene species , influenced slightly by Ti ones . resulting polymers were characterized by DSC and GPC . the polyethylenes mostly presented higher molecular weight than those produced by homogeneous catalysts or by zirconocene grafted on bare or on MAO - modified silica . 
new approaches have been identified for the immobilization , on a ClMg 2-based support , of borate activators for metallocene - catalyzed olefin polymerization . immobilization of [HNEt3][B(C 6F5)3(C6H4-4-OH) ] was carried out by reaction with a support of type Cl2Mg / AlR n(OEt)3-n , obtained by reaction of AlEt3 with an adduct of magnesium chloride and ethanol . use of the resulting immobilized borate in combination with zirconocene catalysts in ethylene and propylene polymerization resulted in significantly higher polymerization activities than were obtained using the same borate immobilized on a silica support . the Cl2Mg - based support also gave the better polymer particle morphology , cross-sectional imaging indicating uniform support fragmentation , as opposed to incomplete fragmentation using the silica support . high catalyst activities were obtained using a Cl2Mg / AlRn(OEt)3-n support impregnated with [Ph3C][B(C6F5) <nUm> ] . In this case , a highly porous polyethylene particle morphology was obtained . 
In the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , ethylene polymerization was successfully performed with homobinuclear zirconocene complexes { [ ( C 5H5)ZrCl2](C5H4CH <nUm> C12H7 4)[(C5H5)ZrCl2] ; 3o , <nUm> m , and 5p } , which were prepared conveniently by the reaction of disodium(phenylenedimethylene)dicyclopentadienide[C6H 4(CH2C5H4Na)2 ] with <nUm> equiv of (N5-Cyclopentadienyl)trichlorozirconium dimethoxyethane ( CpZrCl3(DME) ) in tetrahydrofuran and characterized by 1NMR and elemental analysis . the effects of the polymerization parameters , such as the temperature , time , concentration of the catalyst , MAO / catalyst molar ratio , and isomeric difference of the homobinuclear metallocene complexes 3o , <nUm> m , and 5p were studied in detail . the results showed that all three catalytic systems had moderate activities in ethylene polymerization and afforded polyethylene with relatively broad polydispersities . the catalytic activity of <nUm> m was somewhat higher than that of 3o and 5p but lower than that of 4,4'-bis(methylene)biphenylene-bridged zirconocene catalysts ; this indicated that the distance between the two metal centers was too short in comparison with a 4,4'-bis(methylene)biphenylene bridge to increase the catalytic activity . 
the leaching of the catalyst zirconocene dichloride ( cp 2ZrCl2 ) from an SBA-15 silica support during ethylene polymerization was studied ; severe leaching was observed when commercial methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) was used as the cocatalyst . however , the removal of free trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) from an MAO solution with a sterically hindered phenol reduced the catalyst leaching by 97-100 % . the results obtained from the leaching experiments with TMA - free MAO suggested that the major reason for catalyst leaching was the free TMA in the commercial MAO solution , not the pure MAO itself . 
A supported metallocene catalyst was synthesized by sequentially loading methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) ( <nUm> wt % in toluene ) and ( nBuCp ) 2ZrCl2 on partially dehydroxylated silica ES <nUm> modified by nBuSnCl3 . its shock load hydrogen responsiveness was evaluated by polymerizing ethylene for <nUm> h at <nUm> bar ( g ) and <nUm> ° C without separately feeding the MAP cocatalyst . the shock load hydrogen feeding increased the ethylene consumption ( at a fairly constant rate ) , catalyst productivity , as well as the resin bulk density and average particle size at DP ( of hydrogen ) ≥ ∼ <nUm> psi . the bulk density increased from <nUm> to <nUm> g / cm3 . this shows a procedure for overcoming the inherent drop in catalyst productivity caused by heterogenization of metallocenes ( that is a method for catalyst activation ) and improving the resulting resin bulk density . the volume - weighted mean particle diameter of the resulting polyethylenes was found to be 5.80-11.12-fold that of the catalyst corresponding to DP = <nUm> - <nUm> psi , respectively . the resulting kinetic profiles showed to be fairly stable . however , mw and polydispersity index were not affected . the particle size distribution , average particle size , and the scanning electron microscope photographs of the resulting resin particles confirmed the occurrence of the replication phenomenon . on the basis of the above findings , the mechanism of ethylene polymerization under the present experimental conditions has been revisited . 
tert-Butyl vinyl ether ( tBVE ) was polymerized with the catalyst dimethyl[rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)] zirconium ( ansa - zirconocene ) with tri(pentafluorophenyl) borane [B(C6F5)3] as a cocatalyst . the effects of various polymerization conditions , such as the polymerization time , type of polymerization solvent , polymerization temperature , and catalyst concentration , on the conversion of tBVE into poly(tBVE) , its molecular weight and molecular weight distribution , and its stereoregularity were investigated . the maximum conversion of tBVE into poly(tBVE) was over <nUm> % at a polymerization temperature of <nUm> ° C with an ansa - zirconocene and BC18F15 concentration of <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> mol / mol of tBVE , respectively . the number - average molecular weights of poly(tBVE) ranged from approximately <nUm> to <nUm> , with a lower polydispersity index ( weightaverage molecular weight / number - average molecular weight ) ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> , at all polymerization temperatures . the number - average molecular weight of poly(tBVE) increased with decreases in the polymerization temperature and catalyst concentration . the mm triad sequence fraction of poly(tBVE) polymerized with ansa - zirconocene / B(C6F 5)3 at <nUm> ° C was much higher than that of poly(tBVE) polymerized with the BC18F15 catalyst at <nUm> ° C , and this indicated that the ansa - zirconocene / B(C6F 5)3 catalyst system affected the isospecific polymerization of tBVE . 
ethylene was copolymerized with 10-undecen-1-ol and 5-hexen-l-ol using stereorigid [rac-ethylene(Ind)2ZrCl2] , [rac-ethylene(H4Ind)2ZrCl2] , and the new catalyst systems [rac-norbornane(Ind)2TiCl2] and [mesonorbornane(Ind)2TiCl2] , activated with methylaluminoxane . the characterization of the copolymers by 13C NMR spectroscopy revealed that the polymerization products were copolymers and that the conversion of the polar comonomer was strongly favored in the case of the zirconocene precursors . very high catalytic activity values , nearly independent on the amount of comonomer in the feed , and comonomer incorporations up to <nUm> % weight have been found for 10-undencen-1-ol comonomer . 
catalytic activity during the formation of polyethylene ( PE ) / clay nanocomposites by in situ polymerization with metallocenes was studied . ethylene polymerization was carried out with the homogeneous metallocene in the presence of the clay particles and using the clay - supported metallocene catalyst . it was found that the catalytic activity of the homogeneous metallocene does not decrease in the presence of the clay particles and only a slight decrease of activity occurs using the clay - supported catalyst . the modification of the clay with MAO cocatalyst as well as its intercalation with ODA surfactant were found to play an important role during the in situ formation of the PE / clay nanocomposite . ODA - intercalated clay apparently facilitates the activation and monomer insertion processes on zirconocene centers located in internal sites of the clay structure . although metallocene supported on MAO- treated clay exhibited somewhat lower catalytic activity than that supported directly on the ODA - intercalated clay , both systems favored the production of PE nanocomposites containing highly exfoliated clay particles . 
nano-sized and micro-sized silica particles were used to support a zirconocene catalyst [ racemic-dimethylsilbis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ] , with methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst . the resulting catalyst was used to catalyze the polymerization of ethylene in the temperature range of 40-70 ° C . polyethylene samples produced were characterized with scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , x-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , and gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) . nano-sized catalyst exhibited better ethylene polymerization activity than micro-sized catalyst . At the optimum temperature of <nUm> ° C , nano-sized catalyst 's activity was two times the micro-sized catalyst 's activity . polymers obtained with nano-sized catalyst had higher molecular weight ( based on GPC measurements ) and higher crystallinity ( based on XRD and DSC measurements ) than those obtained with micro-sized catalyst . the better performances of nano-sized catalyst were attributed to its large external surface area and its absence of internal diffusion resistance . SEM indicated that polymer morphology contained discrete tiny particles with thin long fiberous interlamellar links . 
separation into narrow MWD fractions ( liquid - liquid fractionation ) and preparative TREF ( temperature rising elution fractionation ) with subsequent analysis of fractions by GPC , FTIR , and 13C NMR spectroscopy were used to study the comonomer distribution of ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers produced over highly active supported titanium- and vanadium - magnesium catalysts ( TMC and VMC ) and a supported zirconocene catalyst . these catalysts produce PE with different MWD : m w / m n values vary from <nUm> for zirconocene catalyst , <nUm> for TMC , and <nUm> for VMC . 1-Hexene increases polydispersity to <nUm> for copolymer produced over VMC and hardly affects MWD of the copolymer produced over TMC and zirconocene catalysts . the most broad short chain branching distribution ( SCBD ) was found for ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers produced over TMC . VMC and supported zirconocene catalyst produce copolymers with uniform profile of SCB content vs. molecular weight in spite of great differences in m w / m n values ( <nUm> and <nUm> respectively ) . TREF data showed that majority of copolymer produced over supported zirconocene catalyst was eluted at 70-90 ° C ( about <nUm> wt % ) . In the case of VMC copolymer 's fractions were eluted in the broad temperature interval ( 40-100 ° C ) . accordingly , TREF data indicate a more homogeneous SCBD in copolymer , produced over supported zirconocene catalyst . 


A series of ortho or meta lewis base functionalized unbridged zirconocenes , [ {1-(En-Ph)-3,4-Me2C5H2} 2ZrCl2](E = NMe2 , OMe ; n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) , and a half - functionalized zirconocene , [ { 1-(p-Me2NC6H 4)-3,4-Me2C5H2 } { 1-(p-tolyl)-3,4- Me2C5H2}ZrCl2 ] , were prepared . the crystal structures of these compounds determined by x-ray diffraction revealed the presence of only C2 - symmetric rac - like isomers in the asymmetric units . In combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) cocatalyst , the meta-functionalized complexes afforded mixtures of polymers that exhibit multimelting transition temperatures and broad molecular - weight distributions ( MWDs ) in propylene polymerization at atmospheric monomer pressure , whereas the ortho-functionalized complexes did not give rise to polymerization . stepwise solvent extraction of the polymer mixtures showed that the polymers consist of amorphous , moderately isotactic , and highly isotactic portions , the weight ratio of which is dependent on the reaction temperature . 13C NMR spectral analysis indicated that the [mmmm] methyl pentad value of the isotactic portion reached around <nUm> % . among the meta-functionalized zirconocenes , the di-OMe - substituted one afforded the largest amount of the isotactic portion at all temperatures , and the portion comprised <nUm> wt % of the crude polymer obtained at <nUm> ° C . In contrast , propylene polymerization with the half - functionalized unbridged zirconocene resulted in the formation of nearly atactic polypropylene with a narrow MWD of around <nUm> . these results corroborate the proposition that the rigid rac - like cation - anion ion pair of type [rac-L2ZrP] +[Me-MAO]- generated in situ , through lewis acid - base interactions between the functional groups and [Me-MAO]- , is responsible for the isospecific propylene polymerization with the given class of functionalized unbridged zirconocenes and further indicate that the formation of such ion pairs can be favored by difunctionalization at the meta position of the phenyl ring with OMe groups . 
the zirconocene complex [ { (C6F5)2B- (CH2)3-Cp}(Cp-PtBu2)ZrCl2 ] ( <nUm> ; cp = cyclo-C5H4 ) was prepared by hydroboration of [(allyl-Cp)ACHTUNGTRENUNG(Cp-PtBu2)ZrCl2] ( 5 ) with BC12F10H ( " piers ' borane " ) . it represents a frustrated lewis pair ( FLP ) in which both the lewis acid and the lewis base were attached at the metallocene framework . its reaction with 1-pentyne did not result in the 1,2-addition of or deprotonation reaction by the FLP , but rather in the 1,1-carboboration of the triple bond , thereby obtaining a z / e mixture ( <nUm> : <nUm> ) of the respective organometallic substituted alkenes <nUm> . the analogous reaction of 1-pentyne with the phosphorous - free system [ { ( C 6F5)2B-(CH2)3-Cp ) } CpZrCl2 ] ( 9 ) gave the respective 1,1-carboboration products ( (Z)-10 / (E)-10 ≈ <nUm> : <nUm> ) . 

some zirconocene complexes containing ferrocenylcarboxylate ligands , [(RC5H4)2ZrCl]nY , r = H or CH3 ; n = <nUm> , Y = ferrocenylcarbonyloxy , 2-ferrocenylacetoxy , 4-ferrocenylbutanoyloxy , 4-ferrocenyl-4-oxobutanoyloxy , and 3-(ferrocenylcarbony)lbicyclo[2,2,1]hept-5-ene-2-carbonyloxy ; n = <nUm> , y = bis[(3-carboxypropionyl)cyclopentadienyl]iron , have been prepared . their IR , -1H NMR , UV , and other determinations show that the carboxyl groups are bidentate ligands in these complexes . 
the electronic structure and geometry of bent sandwich phosphinomethyl complexes of IVZr and ZrIII have been investigated by means of molecular orbital calculations . A fragment MO approach and perturbation arguments are utilized to explain the unusual experimental structure of Cp2ZrCl(CH2PPh2) ( 1 ) . various factors influencing monodentate ( e1 ) vs. bidentate ( e2 ) ligand coordination of a phosphinomethyl ligand in zirconocene derivatives are analyzed , allowing to extrapolate to other Cp2M(X)() systems ( : potentially mono- or bidentate ligand ) in general . structural and chemical consequences of one electron reduction of <nUm> are interpreted on the basis of the MO calculations . is shown to possess an e1-phosphinomethyl ligand and to be unstable towards heterolytic loss of cl- or CH2PPh 2- . the ground state structure of d1-Cp2Zr(CH2PPh2) is calculated to contain an e2-phosphinomethyl group , consistent with the observed ESR spectrum of the reduction product of <nUm> . 
synthesis of a Heteroatom-Stabilized rhodiumcarbene complex by reaction of CpRh(CO)2 with (Butadiene)zirconocene (e4-Butadiene)zirconocene reacts at room temperature in toluene with CpRh(CO)2 to give the metallacyclic [(p-allyl)zirconoxy]rhodium carbene complex Cp2Zr(C4H6)(OC)Rh(CO)Cp <nUm> . the structure of <nUm> was determined by x-ray analysis . the rh-carbene unit Cp(CO)RhC(R)OM is almost planar , featuring the O[Zr] and cp groups in a z orientation at the RhC moiety [ dRhC(carbene) = <nUm> Å ] . 
die reaktion des zirconocendichlorids mit zwei aquivalenten n-Butyllithium und trimethylphosphan liefert (1-Buten)(trimethylphosphan)zirconocen ( 1 ) in <nUm> proz . ausbeute . komplex <nUm> ist ein ausgezeichnetes ausgansmaterial zur darstellung weiterer (Alken)- oder (Alkin)zirconocen-Komplexe ; so erhalt man durch verdrangung des 1-Butens mit ethylen , styrol oder tolan die Zirconocen-Komplexe <nUm> , <nUm> oder <nUm> in hohen ausbeuten . eine weitere darstellungsmethode fur (1-Alken)(trimethylphosphan)zirconocen-Komplexe ist die umsetzung von zirconocendichlorid mit 1-Alkylmagnesiumhalogeniden in gegenwart von trimethylphosphan bei raumtemperatur ; z . B. sind so der 1-Propen-Komplex <nUm> und der 1-Penten-Komplex <nUm> gut zuganglich . spektroskopische untersuchungen ( 1H- , 13C- und 31P-NMR ) zeigen , dass alle dargestellten (1-Alken)(trimethylphosphan)zirconocen-Komplexe in losung bei <nUm> ° C als getrennt beobachtbare rotamerenpaare 1a , b , 3a , b , 9a , b und 10a , b im verhaltnis ca. <nUm> : <nUm> vorliegen . die strukturen des Ethylen-Komplexes <nUm> und des Styrol-Komplexes 3a wurden zusatzlich durch kristallstrukturanalysen ermittelt . 
reaction of the b-CH agostic alkenylzirconocene complex Cp2ZrCl[C(SiMe3)  CHPh ] ( 1 ) with benzyl isonitrile yields the (e2-iminoacyl)zirconocene complex ( 2 ) . complex <nUm> crystallizes in space group P21 / a with cell parameters a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> . carbon monoxide analogously inserts only into the ZrC bond of <nUm> . No evidence has been found for insertion reactions involving the alkenyl b-carbon-to-hydrogen bond “ activated ” by the agostic Zr … HC interaction in this system . 
molecular orbital calculations together with an isotope crossover study provide insight into mechanistic details of enediolate-forming early transition metal promoted reductive CO coupling reactions . it is shown by deuterium labeling , that bercaw 's carbonylation of cp 2*Zr(CH3)2 ( 1 ) , which directly leads to the enediolate complex <nUm> , is an exclusively intramolecular process . both methyl groups and the two CO molecules of <nUm> assemble at a single Zr center . MO investigations for Cp2Zr(CH3)2 as a model of <nUm> reveal that such group <nUm> metallocene-promoted enediolate-producing reactions do not involve the proposed intramolecular coupling of two acyl ligands of a bis(acyl) complex generated by double CO insertion , as found for actinide derivatives . based upon related available experimental evidence and the electronic structure of the monoinsertion product Cp2Zr(COCH3)(CH3) , an alternative mechanism for enediolate formation is suggested and tested by extensive MO calculations . the postulated keystep consists of a methyl to acetyl migration in Cp2Zr(COCH3)(CH3) leading to an e2-acetone intermediate Cp2Zr(e2-acetone) ( 30 ) . interestingly , the methyl-acetyl bond formation in model calculations requires a prohibitively high energy , unless it is assisted by an additional electron donor at the metal during the transfer of the CH3 group to the acetyl carbon . using a CO molecule as an incoming model nucleophile , a low energy pathway is found , which can lead from Cp2Zr(COCH3)(CH3) to a zirconaoxirane intermediate <nUm> ( an e2-acetone complex ) , carrying an additional stabilizing CO ligand . subsequent CO insertion in <nUm> and further rearrangement opens a reaction channel towards the enediolate monomer . the overall mechanistic picture emerging from this experimental / theoretical study is consistent with recent results of the bercaw group , which has actually isolated the postulated intermediates of type <nUm> . the electronic differences between the systems treated here and corresponding actinide or bis(aryloxy) analogs are briefly discussed . 
stereochemical aspects with metallacyclic Nine-Membered zirconoxycarbene complexes from coupling (Butadiene)-zirconocene , hexacarbonyltungsten , and ketones or aldehydes reaction of (butadiene)zirconocene complexes with M(CO)6 ( m = Cr , W ) and subsequently with ketones or aldehydes O = CR1R2 ( R1 , R2 = H , alkyl , alkenyl , or aryl ) produces the metallacyclic nine-membered zirconoxycarbene complexes ( 7a-r . the complexes trans-7 contain chiral metallacyclic ring systems . starting from many ketones two diastereomeric compounds trans-7 and trans-7' are obtained . from the dynamic 1H-NMR spectra an activation barrier of DG(317K) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal / mol has been estimated fro the trans-7k [(2R*)(4,5,6-pS*)] → trans-7k' [(2R*)(4,5,6-pR*)] rearrangement . for the tert-alkyl-substituted nine-membered metalacycles trans-7f-h only the respective (2R*)(4,5,6-pS*) isomers have been found starting from aldehydes with less sterically demanding alkyl groups mixtures of the trans-7 [(2R*)(4,5,6-pS*)] compounds and their cis-7 isomers are obtained . using the more bulky bis(tert-butylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium moiety for coupling butadiene and C6O6W with simple aldehydes leads to a large excess of the trans-isomers ( e. g . R1 = H , R2 = i-C3H7 : trans-7q : cis7q = <nUm> : <nUm> ) . 
while (e4-butadiene)zirconocene and -hafnocene do not react with Pt(PPh3)2(CO)2 ( 2 ) in toluene solution at room temperature , cp2Zr(e4-C4H6) ( 1a : cp = e5-C5H5 ; 1b : cp = e5-C5H4CH3 ) reacts with cis-Pt(C6F5)2L(CO) ( <nUm> : L = CO ; <nUm> : L = PiPr3 ) under similar conditions to give the metallacyclic fischer-type carbene complexes ( <nUm> : L = CO ; <nUm> : L = PiPr3 ) . when L = CO , isomerization takes place by UV irradiation ( cis-4=trans-4 ) presumably as the result of a dissociative CO scrambling process . this is not observed when L = PiPr3 .

the first five-membered titanacyclic cumulene ( 5 ) was prepared by treatment of the titanocene generator cp <nUm> Ti(Me <nUm> CSi <nUm> SiMe <nUm> ) with the di-tert-butylbutadiyne in a molecular one-to-one ratio . the reaction of <nUm> with “ cp <nUm> Zr ” or of the analogous complex with “ cp <nUm> Ti ” leads to cleavage of the central C-C bond in the metallacyclocumulene complexes to afford the same product , the heterodimetallic ρ , p,-alkynyl-bridged titanocene-zirconocene complex cp <nUm> zr(m-e <nUm> η <nUm> -C ≡ CtBu)Cp <nUm> ti(m-e <nUm> η <nUm> -C ≡ CtBu ) ( 6 ) , in which each alkynyl group is p-bonded to one and p-bonded to the other metal as shown by x-ray diffraction studies . In solution the two alkynyl groups become equivalent . the coupling reaction of “ cp <nUm> Ti ” with bis(trimethylsilyl)butadiyne in a one-to-two molecular ratio leads to the unsymmetrically substituted titanacyclopentadiene ( 7 ) . 
the planar-tetracoordinate carbon compound <nUm> exchanges the bridging m-(e1-C:e2-C,C)-2-butyne ligand for p-tolunitrile in dichloromethane at <nUm> ° C to yield the [ m-(e1-N:e2-C,N)-aryl cyanide]dizirconium cation complex 2a . x-ray diffraction revealed an aza-allenyl-type character of the RCNZr moiety in this thermodynamically favored (m-nitrile)zirconium cation complex .

the methylzirconocene cation , employed as the [Cp2ZrCH3(THF)]+BPh4- reagent la reacts with ( R'C = C)2SiR2 substrates ( 6a-d ) by means of carbometallation of an alkynyi group to yield the mixed metal ring systems 8a-d , containing both a 1,1-disubstituted ,u - alkenyl and an alkynyi bridge between zirconium and silicon ( e.g. shown by x-ray crystal structure analyses of complexes 8a and 8c ) . A similar addition reaction takes place upon treatment of the (butadiene)zirconocene / tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane <nUm> : <nUm> addition product <nUm> with ( CH3-C = C)2Si(CH3)2 ( 6c ) to give <nUm> . here the incipient alky ] zirconocene cation character of the metallocene / borate betaine complex <nUm> shows up in the alkynyl silane carbometallation reaction . 
zirconocene alkyne complexes Cp2Zr(L)(Me3SiC2R) ( L = py , THF ; r = SiMe3 , ( bu ) react with heterocyclic compounds like benzoxazole and related thiazoles to yield ring - expanded adducts Cp2Zr-C(SiMe3) = C(R)-CH = N-o-C6H4:-X ( 1-3 ) and Cp2Zr-C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe 3)-CH = N-C(R') = C(R')-X ( R' = me , H ) ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) by formal C-X ( x = O , S ) bond cleavage and coupling with the coordinated alkyne . In the case of benzisoxazole , the alkyne is not coupled but eliminated , and with ring - enlargement of the benzisoxazole a N - bridged dinier [ Cp2Zr-N = CH-o-C6H4-O]2 ( 6 ) is formed . the obtained complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were characterized by NMR spectra and crystal structure analysis . 
the reduction of the complex [ (e5-C5H4)-ansa-(e5C 5H4)]TiCl2 with magnesium in the presence of Me3SiC2-SiMe3 in THF at room temperature gives the ansa - titanocene alkyne complex [ (e5-C5H4)-ansa-(e5-C 5H4)]Ti(e2-Me3SiC 2-SiMe3 ) ( ansa = Me2Si-O-SiMe2 , <nUm> ) . the similar pyridinestabilized zirconium complexes could be obtained by analogous reactions and addition of pyridine : [ (e5-C5H4)-ansa-(e5-C 5H4)]Zr(L)(e2-Me3SiC 2SiMe3 ) ) ( ansa = Me2Si-O-SiMe2 , L = pyridine : <nUm> ; ansa = SiMe2 , L = pyridine : <nUm> ) . all complexes were characterized by spectroscopic methods . an x-ray structure determination of complex <nUm> was conducted , and the data were compared to those of the complexes rac-(EB-HI)Zr(L)(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) [ L = (S)-(-i-nicotine : <nUm> , EBHI = ethyleriebisftetrahydroindenyl ) ] and Cp2Zr(py)(Me3SiC2SiMe3) . 
depending on the nature of the metal and the ring size , lactams react with titanocene and zircocene complexes of bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene Cp2Ti(Me3SiC2SiMe3) and Cp2Zr-(L)(Me3SiC2SiMe3) ( L = py , THF ) to yield different products . In the reaction of Cp2Zr(Py)(Me3SiC2SiMe3) with n-methyl- e-caprolactam a simple ligand exchange reaction occurs and the complex Cp2Zr(Me3SiC2SiMe 3)[O = C-N(Me)-(CH2)5 ] ( 1 ) was isolated . with b-propiolactam the alkenyl-amido complex Cp2Zr[-C(SiMe3) = N(H) ( SiMe3 ) ] [-rN-CO-CH2-CH2] ( 2 ) was obtained , which indicates that an agostic rnetal-hydrogen interaction has taken place . the reaction of Cp2Ti(Me3-SiC2SiMe3) with e-caprolactam gives after elimination of the alkyne and molecular hydrogen the first early transition metal complex with a deprotonated coordinated e-caprolactam in a e2-amidate bonding fashion Cp2Ti-OCN-(CH2)5 ( 3 ) . the obtained complexes were characterized by KMR spectra ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) and crystal structure analysis ( 1-3 ) and discussed as elemental steps in anionic ring - opening polymerization of lactams catalyzed by metallocene - alkyne complexes . 
the ethene polymerization activities of a series of Cp'(C5H5}ZrCl2 and Cp2ZrCl2 pre-catalysts ( cp' = C5HMe4 , C4Me4P , C5Me5 , C5H4tBu , C5H3-1,3-tBu2 , C5H2-1,2,4-tBu3 ) together with C10Cl2H10Zr have been correlated with the coordination gap aperture . In the case of the mixed substituted C5R5-nR'n ligands , the coordination gap aperture has been determined with the help of the cyclopentadienyl cone angle and the bending angle at zirconium . A hindered rotatability of the ( erf - butyl substituted systems has been evaluated by molecular modeling calculations and was included in the gap aperture estimation . deviations from the activity - gap aperture correlation in the case of the phospholyl ( C4Me4P ) systems could be accounted for in terms of adduct formation between aluminum species and the phosphorus donors . these lewis acid / base adducts form in an equili - brium reaction at high Al / Zr ratios , as shown by 31P NMR . ab initio calculations on model L2TiMe+ complexes ( L = CH , C5H4N and C5H4P ) for the insertion of ethene in the Ti-Me bond suggest a high electronic similarity for phospholyl and cyclopentadienyl . the 91Zr - NMR data ( chemical shift and line width ) for the above zirconocene series are reported . the 91Zr chemical shift values increase with a good linear correlation to the number of methyl or ( erf - butyl groups , which is traced to the additive electron donating effect of the alkyl groups . the hyperconjugative donor effect of a tert-butyl group is found here to be <nUm> times that of a methyl group . the x-ray structure of (C5H3-1,3-ffiu2)(C5H 5)ZrCl2 has been determined ( monoclinic , P21 / n , a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> ) . 
A variety of bent metallocene dichloride / methylalumoxane catalysts , derived from the zirconocene complexes <nUm> , 12-18 , have been employed in intramolecular olefin - coupling reactions yielding monomeric or dimeric products . this was achieved by using optimized reaction conditions employing low substrate concentrations ( <nUm> - <nUm> m ) and rather long reaction times . under these particular conditions , 1,5-hexadiene was cyclodimerized to give l-methylene-3-(cyclopentylmethyl)cyclopentane ( 11 ) . 1,6-Heptadiene was cleanly converted to methylenecyclohexane , and cis-1,2-divinylcyclopentane ( 19 ) and cis-1,2-divinylcyclohexane ( 22 ) were cyclized to yield 2-methylenebicyclo[3.3.0]octane ( 20 ) and 7-methylenebicyclo[4.3.0]nonane ( 23 ) , respectively . In many cases , the cyclization products were accompanied by isomers originating from double - bond shift reactions that often occur rapidly at these catalyst systems under the specific reaction conditions chosen to keep the products in the monomeric regime . 
bis(propynyl)zirconocene was treated with BC18F3S3 and then with two equivalents of ferf - butyl isocyanide to yield the organometallic three - membered ring product <nUm> . subsequent hydrolysis gives the substituted (2-iminioethylidene)cyclopropeneborate betaine system <nUm> that exhibits a pronounced cyclopropenylioborate betaine character . this follows from its characteristic structural features ( x-ray crystal - structure analysis of the isomer ci's-9 ) and its chemical features . complex <nUm> undergoes a very facile cis / trans isomerization by formal rotation around the exocyclic partial CC - double bond ( AGr arr = <nUm> kcal mol " <nUm> ) . compound <nUm> reacts cleanly in methanol solution with / erf - butyl isocyanide by insertion and ring enlargement to form the four - membered ring system <nUm> . compound <nUm> was also characterized by x-ray diffraction . 
(Butadiene)zirconocene adds to BC18F15 to form the metallacyclic metal- locene - boron betaine system <nUm> , which contains a C-F → Zr interaction . addition of tert-butylisocyanide or tert-butylcyanide leads to cleavage of the zirconium - fluorine linkage and formation of the adducts <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . with additional tert-butylisocyanide , <nUm> reacts further to yield the corresponding e2-imino- acyl betaines <nUm> and <nUm> ( <nUm> stereoisomers ) , whereas <nUm> inserts additional tert-butylcyanide into the Zr-C bond to give a chiral metallacyclic n-zirconaketimine complex that is probably stabilized by an internal borate → Zr interaction . ethene and propene insertion reactions into the Zr-C bond of <nUm> follow a similar course : the mono-insertion products <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively , generated in situ and characterized by NMR spectroscopy at - <nUm> ° C in [D8]toluene solution , are chiral and are also stabilized by internal borate → Zr co-ordination . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> are likely to be intermediates in the formation of active homogeneous ziegler polymerization catalysts . 
the development of a new method for the intramolecular coupling of terminal alkynes and for the synthesis of seven- and eight - membered benzoheterocyeles is reported . the key steps involve the generation of zirconocene - alkyne complexes from 2-bromoalkenes and the subsequent intramolecular carbometalation of olefins or acetylides . the 8-unsubstituted zirconabicyclopentenes were carbonylated to afford unexpected products and allow access to polyfunctionalized molecules from simple starting materials . 
the organometallic cation [Cp2ZrCH3(thf)]+ , employed as the tetraphenylborate salt ( 1 ) , reacts cleanly in <nUm> : <nUm> stoichiometry with the isocyanates <nUm> derived from valine methyl ester or valylvaline methyl ester , respectively . In each case addition of the Zr - CH3 group to the isocyanate sp-carbon center is observed with formation of a functionalized zirconocene cation derivative containing a chelating n-metallated n-acetylvaline methyl ester ( 3a ) or n-acetylvalylvaline methyl ester ( 3b ) moiety , respectively , coordinated in the bent metallocene s-ligand plane . the spectroscopic data of <nUm> , supported by an x-ray crystal structure analysis of the zirconated dipeptide derivative 3b , have revealed the presence of chelating ( e1 -O : e1-N)-coordination of the terminal n-acetyl groups in addition to a Zr-O = C interaction with the adjacent valyl amido group . 
the titanium complex (C5H4-allyl)TiCl3 ] ( 2 ) undergoes olefin metathesis coupling when treated with <nUm> mol % of [ Cl 2(L1)(L2)Ru = CHPh ] ( L1 = L <nUm> = PCy3 , 4a ; L1 = PCy3 , L <nUm> = ( H2IMes ) , 4b ) to yield the dimetallic complex [ Cl 3Ti(C5H4)-CH2CH = CHCH 2-(C5H4)TiCl3 ] ( 5 ) . the allyl-substituted titanocene complex [ Cp(C5H 4-allyl)TiCl2 ] ( 3 ) analogously yields the dimetallic system <nUm> when treated with <nUm> . the ansa - zirconocene complex [ me 2Si(C5H4)(C5H 3-allyl)ZrCl2 ] ( 7 ) cleanly yields the analogous dimetallic coupling product <nUm> ( > <nUm> % isomerically pure ) , when treated with catalytic amounts of 4b in toluene . complex <nUm> gives an active homogeneous ethene or propene polymerization catalyst , especially at elevated temperatures , when treated with excess methylalumoxane . 
A diastereoselective synthesis of 1,3-butadiene or cyclobutene derivatives by a zirconium - mediated reaction of alkenyllithium compounds and vinyl bromides is reported . the key steps involve the generation of zirconocene - alkyne complexes from haloalkenes and subsequent coupling with alkenyl bromides . thus , formally the process supposes the cross-coupling reaction between a terminal alkyne and an alkenyl bromide . moreover , the use of butyl vinyl ether instead of vinyl bromide as the unsaturated system allows an alternative access to different 1,3-butadiene regioisomers . 
bis(alkynyl)silanes react with low valent zirconocene species to afford zirconacyclobutene intermediates . these in situ generated reactive organometallic intermediates can react with alkynes , ketones , aldehydes , and isocyanates by means of a novel skeletal rearrangement . when a zirconacyclobutene intermediate was treated with an alkyne , an a-alkynylsilyl zirconacyclopentadiene was formed . addition of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate ( DMAD ) and ClCu resulted in one - pot formation of an alkynylsilyl-benzene derivative from three different alkynes . At a higher temperature , the a-alkynyl-silylzirconacyclopentadiene was transformed by means of an intramolecular skeletal rearrangement to a zirconacyclohexadiene- silacyclobutene fused - ring compound , which reacted with DMAD in the presence of ClCu affording the same alkynylsilyl-benzene derivative . when treated with a ketone , an aldehdye , or an isocyanate , the zirconocyclobutene intermediate also underwent the above-mentioned skeletal rearrangement , generating zirconocene - mediated cross-coupling products . 
A series of cycloalkylidene-bridged cyclopentadienyl metallocene complexes , [ (CH2)nC(C5H4)2MCl <nUm> ] ( m = Ti , n = <nUm> ( 4 ) , <nUm> ( 5 ) , <nUm> ( 6 ) ; m = Zr . n = <nUm> ( 7 ) , <nUm> ( 8 ) , <nUm> ( 9 ) ; m = Hf , n = <nUm> ( 10 ) , <nUm> ( 11 ) , <nUm> ( 12 ) ) , have been synthesized and applied to ethylene polymerization after activation with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) . the cycloalkylidene-bridged titanocene catalysts exhibit much higher activities than the corresponding zirconocene and hafnocene analogues , and have the highest activities at higher temperatures . In comparison , the silacyclopentylidene- bridged metallocene complexes [ (CH2)4Si(C 5H4)2MCl2 ] ( m = Ti ( 13 ) , Zr ( 14 ) ) and isopropylene-bridged metallocene complexes [ Me2C(C 5H4)2MCl2 ] ( m = Ti ( 15 ) , Zr ( 16 ) ) have also been synthesized and applied to ethylene polymerization . In both cases , the titanocene complexes show much higher activities than the corresponding zirconocene analogues , especially at a lower temperature . the molecular structures of complexes 4-9 have been determined by x-ray diffraction . the structure - activity relationships , especially the effects of the bridges of ansa - metallocene complexes , are discussed . 
catalytic dehydrocoupling of phosphines was investigated using the anionic zirconocene trihydride salts [ Cp*2Zr(m-H) 3Li]3 ( 1a ) or [ Cp*2Zr(m H ) 3K(thf)4 ] ( 1b ) , and the metallocycles [ CpTi(NPtBu 3)(CH2)4 ] ( 6 ) and [ Cp*M(NPtBu 3)(CH2)4 ] ( m = Ti <nUm> , Zr <nUm> ) as catalyst precursors . dehydrocoupling of primary phosphines RPH2 ( r = ph , C6H2Me3 , cy , C10H7 ) gave both dehydrocoupled dimers RP(H)P(H)R or cyclic oligophosphines (RP)n ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) while reaction of tBu3C6H2PH <nUm> gave the phosphaindoline fBu2(Me2C-CH 2)C6H2PH ( 9 ) . stoichiometric reactions of these catalyst precursors withprimary phosphines afforded [ cp* 2Zr((PR)2)H][K(thf)4] ( r = ph <nUm> , cy <nUm> , C 6H2Me3 <nUm> ) , [ Cp*2Zr((PPh) 3)H ] [K(thf)4] ( 5 ) , [ CpTi(NPtBu3)(PPh) <nUm> ] ( 7 ) and [CpTi(NPfBu3)(nrPHPh)]2 ( 8 ) , while reaction of <nUm> with (C6H2tBu3)PH2 in the presence of PMe3 afforded [ CpTi(NPtBu3)(PMe 3)(P(C6H2tBu3) ] ( 10 ) . the secondary phosphines Ph2PH and (PhHPCH2)2CH2 also undergo dehydrocoupling affording (Ph2P)2 and (PhPCH2)2CH2 . the bisphosphines ( CH 2PH2)2 and C6H4(PH 2)2 are dehydrocoupled to give ( C2H3P 2PH)v ( 12 ) and ( C6H5P2 ) <nUm> ( 13 ) while prolonged reaction of <nUm> gave ( C6H 4P2)8 ( 14 ) . the analogous bisphosphine me 2C6H4(PH)2 ( 17 ) was prepared and dehydrocoupling catalysis afforded ( Me2C6H 2P(PH))2 ( 18 ) and subsequently [ ( Me2C 6H2P2)2(m-Me2C 6H2P2)]2 ( 19 ) . stoichiometric reactions with these bi-sphosphines gave [ Cp*2Zr(H)(PH)2C 6H4][Li(thf)4] ( 22 ) , [ CpTi(NPtBu 3)(PH)2C6H4]2 ( 23 ) and [Cp*Ti(NPfBu3)(PH)2C6H4] ( 24 ) . mechanistic implications are discussed . 
the complete catalytic cycle for the intramolecular hydroamination / cyclisation ( IHC ) of 4,5-hexadien-1-yl-amine ( 1 ) by a prototypical [ ZrCp 2Me2 ] precatalyst ( 2 ) has been scrutinized by employing a reliable DFT method . the present study conducted by means of a detailed computational characterisation of structural and energetic aspects of alternative pathways for all of the relevant elementary steps complements the mechanistic insights revealed from experimental results . the operative mechanism entails an initial transformation of precatalyst <nUm> into the thermodynamically prevalent , but dormant , bis(amido)-Zr compound in the presence of aminoallene <nUm> . this complex undergoes a reversible , rate - determining a-elimination of <nUm> to form the imidoallene-Zr complex . the substrate - free form , which contains a chelating imidoallene functionality , is the catalytically active species and is rapidly transformed into azazirconacyclobutane intermediates through a [2+2] cycloaddition reaction . this highly facile process does not proceed regioselectively because the alternative pathways for the formation of five- and six - membered azacycles have comparable probabilities . degradation of cyclobutane intermediates by following the most feasible pathway occurs through protonolysis of the metallacycle moiety and subsequent proton transfer from the Zr - NHR moiety onto the azacycle . the five - membered allylamine is generated through protonation at carbon atom C6 followed by a-hydrogen elimination , whereas protonolysis of the cyclobutane moiety at the Zr-N bond followed by proton transfer onto carbon atom C5 is the dominant route for the six - membered product . of the two consecutive proton transfer steps , the second one determines the overall kinetics of the entire protonation sequence . this process is predicted to be substantially slower than the cycloaddition reaction . the factors that regulate the composition of the cycloamine products have been elucidated . 
when triisobutylaluminum ( AliBu3 ) is added to solutions containing methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and rac-[Me2Si(ind) 2ZrCl2 ] ( ind : indenyl ) in C6D6 , NMR spectra show that methyl-bridged mixed - alkylaluminum dimers Al(m-Me) 2Me4-xiBux predominate . these dimers react with MAO under partial transfer of isobutyl groups and induce a conversion of the initially prevailing cationic trimethylaluminum adduct rac - [ me 2Si(ind)2Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2 + ] to rac-[Me2Si(ind)2Zr(m-Me) 2AlMeiBu+ ] and rac-[Me2Si-(ind) 2Zr(m-Me)2AliBu2+ ] . these species are unstable and release isobutene under formation of zirconocene hydrides . 
this study examines alternative reaction channels for intramolecular hydroamination / cyclisation ( IHC ) of primary 4,5-hexadien-l-ylamine aminoallene ( 1 ) by a neutral [Cp2ZrMe2] zirconocene precatalyst ( 2 ) by using the density functional theory ( DFT ) method . the first channel proceeds through a [Cp2Zr(NHR)2] complex as the reactive species and relevant steps including the insertion of an allenic C = C linkage into the Zr - NHR s-bond and ensuing protonolysis . this is contrasted to the [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition mechanism involving a [ Cp2Zr = NR ] transient species . the salient features of the rival mechanisms are disclosed . the cycloaddition route entails the first transformation of the dormant [ Cp2Zr-(NHR) <nUm> ] complex <nUm> B into the transient [ Cp2Zr = NR ] intermediate 3A' , which is turnover limiting . this route features a highly facile ring closure together with a substantially slower protonolysis ( kcycloadd ≫ kprotonolysis ) and can display inhibition by high substrate concentration . In contrast , protonolysis is the more facile step for the channel proceeding through the [Cp2Zr(NHR)2] complex as the catalytically active species . here , C = C insertion into the Zr-C s-bond of 3B , which represents the catalyst resting state , is turnover limiting and substrate concentration is unlikely to influence the rate . the regulation of the selectivity is elucidated for the two channels . DFT predicts that five - ring allylamine and six - ring imine are generated upon traversing the cycloaddition route , thereby comparing favourably with experiment , whereas the cycloimine should be formed solely along the s-bond insertion route . the mechanistic analysis is indicative of an operating [2+2] cycloaddition mechanism . the Zr - NHR s-bond insertion route , although appearing not to be employed for the reactants studied herein , is clearly suggested as being viable for hydroamination by charge neutral organozirconium compounds . 
A zirconocene - mediated one - pot multicomponent synthesis process leading to the synthesis of pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridine ( 5-azaindoles ) and pyrrole derivatives has been developed starting from a silicon - tethered diyne and three or two different or identical organonitriles . pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridine and pyrrole derivatives with diverse structures and substitution patterns have been highly selectively prepared by this protocol . A wide variety of organonitriles and silicon - tethered diynes , either aliphatic or aromatic with both electron - withdrawing and - donating groups , have been used to afford 5-azaindoles and / or pyrroles in good - to - excellent isolated yields . A key intermediate formed in the Cp2ZrIImediated reaction of one ( PhC = C ) 2SiMe2 , two molecules of iPrCN and one p-tolylCN was characterised by xray single - crystal structural analysis , which has allowed us to gain a good understanding of the reaction process . 
an efficient multicomponent synthesis of 5-azaindoles and dihydropyrrolo[3,2-c]azepines was achieved by zirconocene - mediated coupling of silicon - tethered diynes , nitriles , and isocyanides . the synthesis , structures , and intramolecular cyclization of mono- and bis(iminoacyl)-Zr intermediates were investigated to elucidate the reaction process . upon hydrolysis , the isolated mono(iminoacyl)-Zr intermediates underwent intramolecular cyclization to afford tetrasubstituted 5azaindoles , whereas intramolecular cyclization of bis(iminoacyl)-Zr intermediates led to the formation of dihydropyrrolo[3,2-c] azepines . the structure of a bis(iminoacyl)-Zr intermediate , formed through insertion of two molecules of CyNC into the Zr-C bond , and structures of two dihydropyrrolo[3,2-c]azepines were characterized by single - crystal x-ray structural analysis . 
tandem insertion of 1,1-dihalo-1-lithio species ( halocarbenoids ) and lithium alkynides into zirconacyclopentenes and zirconcyclopentanes affords carbocyclic products in high yields via an unusual rearrangement that probably involves addition of an organolithium species to the b-position of a zirconium - alkyne complex to give an alkenylidene-zirconate species . A wide variety of cyclopentanoid organic structures are rapidly assembled in good yield using this multicomponent coupling . the main side reaction , which becomes exclusive in some cases , is b-hydride elimination of an intermediate cyclopentyl- or cyclopentenyl zirconocene . zirconocene ' ate ' complexes play several roles in a versatile three - component one - pot assembly of bicyclic organic structures from a 1,6- or 1,7-enyne or -diene , an in situ generated halocarbenoid RCX2Li and a lithium acetylide . the most likely reaction pathway involves the unprecedented b-addition of an organolithium species to an alkynyl zirconocene to give a zirconium alkenylidenate complex . 
5-Azaindoles either with three different substituents at their 2- , 4- , and 6-positions or with two identical substituents at their 2-and 6-positions and a different one at the 4-position , were obtained in good to excellent isolated yields by a zirconocene - mediated multicomponent process . each reaction involved four organic partners , comprising a Si - tethered diyne , one tBuCN component , and two ( either different or identical ) nitriles . all these four components were combined through the action of a Cp2ZrII species into a three - ring fused Zr / Si - containing organometallic complex in a perfectly chemo - and regioselective manner . this multicomponent reaction process consisted of three reaction steps , all of which were made clear through the isolation and characterization of their corresponding organometallic intermediates : the zirconacyclopropene-azasilacyclopentadienes <nUm> , the allenyl-aza-zirconacycles <nUm> , and the three - ring fused complexes <nUm> . x-ray single - crystal structural analyses of two three - ring fused Zr / Si - containing intermediates and two 5-azaindoles unambiguously showed the positions of the different substituents and the regioselectivity . iminopyrrole derivatives could be also highly selectively prepared from a Si - tethered diyne and two different nitriles . 
treatment of me 2S*B(C 6F <nUm> ) nH 3-n ( n = <nUm> or <nUm> ) with ammonia yields the corresponding adducts . H 3N*B(C 6F 5)H <nUm> dimerises in the solid state through N-H ⋯ H-B dihydrogen interactions . the adducts can be deprotonated to give lithium amidoboranes Li[NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) nH 3-n ] . reaction of the n = <nUm> reagent with [ cp 2ZrCl <nUm> ] leads to disubstitution , but [ cp 2Zr{NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) 2H } <nUm> ] is in equilibrium with the product of b-hydride elimination [ cp 2Zr(H){NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) 2H } ] , which proves to be the major isolated solid . the analogous reaction with [ cp 2HfCl <nUm> ] gives a mixture of [ cp 2Hf{NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) 2H } <nUm> ] and the N-H activation product [ cp 2Hf{NHB(C 6F <nUm> ) 2H } ] . [ cp 2Zr{NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) 2H } 2]*PhMe and [ cp 2Hf{NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) 2H } 2]*4(thf) exhibit b-B-agostic chelate bonding of one of the two amidoborane ligands in the solid state . the agostic hydride is invariably coordinated to the outside of the metallocene wedge . exceptionally , [ cp 2Hf{NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) 2H } 2]*PhMe has a structure in which the two amidoborane ligands adopt an intermediate coordination mode , in which neither is definitively agostic . [ cp 2Hf{NHB(C 6F <nUm> ) 2H } ] has a formally dianionic imidoborane ligand chelating through an agostic interaction , but the bond - length distribution suggests a contribution from a zwitterionic amidoborane resonance structure . treatment of the zwitterions [ cp 2MMe(m-Me) B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( m = Zr , Hf ) with Li[NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) nH 3-n ] ( n = <nUm> ) results in [ cp 2MMe{NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) 2H } ] complexes , for which the spectroscopic data , particularly 1J(B,H) , again suggest b-B-agostic interactions . the reactions proceed similarly for the structurally encumbered [ cp " 2ZrMe(m -Me)B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] precursor ( cp " = 1,3-C 5H <nUm> ( SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> , n = <nUm> or <nUm> ) to give [ cp " 2ZrMe{NH 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) nH 3-n } ] , both of which have been structurally characterised and show chelating , agostic amidoborane coordination . In contrast , the analogous hafnium chemistry leads to the recovery of [ cp " 2HfMe <nUm> ] and the formation of Li[HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] through hydride abstraction . 
A study regarding coordination chemistry of the bis(diphenylphosphino)amide ligand Ph2P-N-PPh2 at group <nUm> metallocenes is presented herein . coordination of N,N-bis(diphenylphosphino)amine ( 1 ) to [ ( cp 2TiCl)2 ] ( cp = i*5-cyclopentadienyl ) generated [Cp2Ti(Cl)P(Ph2)N(H)PPh2] ( 2 ) . the heterometallacyclic complex [ Cp2Ti(k2-P,P-Ph 2P-N-PPh2 ) ] ( <nUm> Ti ) can be prepared by reaction of <nUm> with n-butyllithium as well as from the reaction of the known titanocene - alkyne complex [ Cp2Ti(I*2-Me3SiC 2SiMe3 ) ] with the amine <nUm> . reactions of the lithium amide [(thf)3Li{N(PPh2)2}] with [ cp 2MCl2 ] ( m = Zr , Hf ) yielded the corresponding zirconocene and hafnocene complexes [ Cp2M(Cl){k2-N,P-N(PPh 2)2 } ] ( <nUm> Zr and <nUm> Hf ) . reduction of <nUm> Zr with magnesium gave the highly strained heterometallacycle [ Cp2Zr(k 2-P,P-Ph2P-N-PPh2 ) ] ( <nUm> Zr ) . complexes <nUm> , <nUm> Ti , <nUm> Hf , and <nUm> Zr were characterized by x-ray crystallography . the structures and bondings of all complexes were investigated by DFT calculations . all roads lead to rome : heterometallacyclic complexes of the type [ Cp2M(k 2-P,P-Ph2P-N-PPh2 ) ] ( cp = i*5-cyclopentadienyl ; m = Ti , Zr ) can be prepared by using four different synthetic pathways ( see scheme ) . all routes yielded the corresponding metallacycles in very high yields . analysis of the structure and bonding of these complexes revealed that in-plane aromaticity plays an important role for the stabilization of these species . 
the reaction of different metallocene fragments [Cp2M] ( cp = i*5-cyclopentadienyl , m = Ti , Zr ) with diferrocenylacetylene and 1,4-diferrocenylbuta-1,3-diyne is described . the titanocene complexes form the highly strained three- and five - membered ring systems [Cp2Ti(I*2-FcC2Fc)] ( 1 ) and [Cp2Ti(I*4-FcC4Fc)] ( 2 ) ( fc = [ Fe(I*5-C5H4) ( I*5-C5H5 ) ] ) by addition of the appropriate alkyne or diyne to Cp2Ti . zirconocene precursors react with diferrocenyl- and ferrocenylphenylacetylene under C-C bond coupling to yield the metallacyclopentadienes [ Cp2Zr(C4Fc <nUm> ) ] ( 3 ) and [ Cp2Zr(C4Fc2Ph <nUm> ) ] ( 5 ) , respectively . the exchange of the zirconocene unit in <nUm> by hydrogen atoms opens the route to the super-crowded ferrocenyl-substituted compound tetraferrocenylbutadiene ( 4 ) . on the other hand , the reaction of 1,4-diferrocenylbuta-1,3-diyne with zirconocene complexes afforded a cleavage of the central C-C bond , and thus , dinuclear [ { Cp2Zr(m- I*1 : I*2-C ≡ CFc ) } <nUm> ] ( 6 ) that consists of two zirconocene acetylide groups was formed . most of the complexes were characterized by single - crystal x-ray crystallography , showing attractive multinuclear molecules . the redox properties of <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were studied by cyclic voltammetry . upon oxidation to <nUm> n+ , 5n+ , and 6n+ ( n = 1-3 ) , decomposition occured with in situ formation of new species . the follow-up products from <nUm> and <nUm> possess two or four reversible redox events pointing to butadiene - based molecules . however , the dinuclear complex <nUm> afforded ethynylferrocene under the measurement conditions . super-crowded metallocenes : the reaction of diferrocenylacetylene and 1,4-diferrocenylbuta-1,3-diyne with group <nUm> metallocene compounds yields attractive multiferrocenyl complexes . depending on the metal , different products were obtained by complexation , coupling , or C-C bond cleavage of the ligand ( see scheme ) . their electrochemical properties were studied in detail . the oxidation of the metallacycle induces decomposition of the complexes . 
1,2,3,4-Tetrasubstituted cyclopentadienes and indene derivatives with identical or different substituents were obtained in good to excellent isolated yields through a zirconocene- and ClCu - mediated intermolecular coupling process . this synthetic procedure involved three organic partners , including one CH 2I2 , and two different or identical alkynes . two alkynes or one diyne undergo Cp2ZrII - mediated ( cp = e5-C5H5 ) pair - selective reductive coupling to afford the corresponding zirconacyclopentadiene derivatives , which react , in the presence of ClCu and 1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(1 H ) - pyrimidinone ( DMPU ) , with CH2I2 through intermolecular followed by intramolecular coupling to afford the cyclopentadiene derivatives . an application of the prepared tetrasubstituted cyclopentadiene derivatives was demonstrated by the facile synthesis of the corresponding zirconocene complexes [(4RCp)2ZrCl2] and [ ( 4RCp ) 2ZrR'2 ] ( R' = me , et , or nBu ) . the unique 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted cyclopentadiene ligands and the corresponding metallocenes are expected to have further applications in organometallic chemistry and organic synthesis . ringing in the changes : A one - pot synthesis of 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted cyclopentadienes by zirconocene- and ClCu - mediated intermolecular coupling of two alkynes and diiodomethane ( see scheme ; cp = e5-C5H5 ; DMPU = 1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6- tetrahydro-2(1 H ) - pyrimidinone ) gave products that were successfully applied for the synthesis of the corresponding zirconocene derivatives . 
A study of the coordination chemistry of different amidato ligands [(R)N-C(Ph)O] ( r = ph , 2,6-diisopropylphenyl ( dipp ) ) at group <nUm> metallocenes is presented . the heterometallacyclic complexes [ Cp2M(Cl) {k2-N,O-(R)N-C(Ph)O} ] m = Zr , r = dipp ( <nUm> a ) , ph ( <nUm> b ) ; m = Hf , r = ph ( 2 ) ) were synthesized by reaction of [Cp2MCl2] with the corresponding deprotonated amides . complex <nUm> a was also prepared by direct deprotonation of the amide with schwartz reagent [Cp2Zr(H)Cl] . salt metathesis reaction of [Cp2Zr(H)Cl] with deprotonated amide [(Dipp)N-C(Ph)O] gave the zirconocene hydrido complex [ Cp2M(H) {k2-N,O-(Dipp)N-C(Ph)O} ] ( 3 ) . reaction of <nUm> a with Mg did not result in the desired Zr (III) complex but in formation of Mg complex [ ( py ) 3Mg(Cl) {k2-N,O-(Dipp)N-C(Ph)O} ] ( <nUm> ; py = pyridine ) . the paramagnetic complexes [ Cp'2Ti{k2-N,O-(R)N-C(Ph) O } ] ( cp ' = cp , r = ph ( <nUm> a ) ; cp ' = cp , r = dipp ( <nUm> b ) ; cp ' = cp , r = ph ( 8 ) ) were prepared by the reaction of the known titanocene alkyne complexes [ cp 2'Ti(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ] ( cp ' = cp ( 5 ) , cp ' = cp* ( 6 ) ) with the corresponding amides . complexes <nUm> a , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> a , <nUm> b , and <nUm> were characterized by x-ray crystallography . the structure and bonding of complexes <nUm> a and <nUm> were also characterized by EPR spectroscopy . coordination chemistry : heterometallacyclic complexes of the type [ Cp2M(L){k2-N,O-(Dipp)N-C(Ph) O } ] ( m = Ti , no L ; m = Zr , L = Cl ; dipp = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl ; see scheme ) can be prepared by a hydrogen-evolution reaction from either [ Cp2Ti(e 2-Me3SiC2SiMe3 ) ] or schwartz reagent [Cp2Zr(H)Cl] , giving the corresponding metallacycles in very high yields . EPR measurements revealed the stabilizing effect of the amidate ligand for paramagnetic d1 TiIII complexes . 









unusual nonlinear asymmetric amplification and chiral ligand loading effects were discovered for the use of catalytic quantities of chiral aminoalcohols in the in situ hydrozirconation - transmetalation - aldehyde addition processes . while the stereochemically most efficient aminothiol ligands demonstrated mechanistically conventional reaction parameters in excellent agreement with kagan 's ML2 system , the asymmetric induction in the presence of a chiral aminoalcohol was found to vary greatly with loading and % ee of the ligand . aminothiols remain the ligands of choice for the highly enantioselective formation of allylic alcohols and provide experimentally more predictable reaction variables . however , new , optimized conditions lead to a synthetically useful product % ee using the readily available and scalable aminoalcohol 2a . 
evaporative light - scattering detection ( ELSD ) is widely applied in the HPLC analysis of organic compounds lacking a UY chromophore . however , this detection method is generally unsuitable for determination of enantiomeric ratios ( er ) . the er calculated from a UV trace and an ELS trace of the same compound differs significantly . because of the nonlinear concentration response of the ELS detector , a compound with an er of <nUm> : <nUm> appears to be enantiomerically pure by ELS detection . it is possible to obtain a calibration curve and to calculate a correction factor , but this procedure is time consuming and therefore not very practical for routine analyses . In contrast , a charged aerosol detector allows a very accurate determination of the enantiomeric ratios . like the ELS detection , the CA detection is independent of the chromophore properties of the substrate . therefore , we recommend the use of CA instead of ELS detection for determination of the enantiomeric ratios of non-UV active compounds . 

A series of (Z,Z)-tetraaryl-1,3-butadiene has been synthesized stereospecifically and regioselectively by acidolysis of five-membered Ti , Zr metallocycles formed from asymmetrically substituted alkynes . the structures of these products have been proved by physical and chemical methods . 
free car - parrinello molecular dynamics ( CPMD ) simulations of four diastereomers of the zirconium - propene complexes [ {iPr(3-iPr-CpFlu)}ZriBu(C 3H6)]+ ( cp = cyclopentadienyl ; flu = fluorenyl ) provide valuable insight into the mechanism and stereocontrol of propene polymerization with stereorigid metallocenes . spontaneous insertion of propene into the zirconium - isobutyl bond is not observed , and propene is found to be weakly bound and to rotate relatively freely around the C-C bond to be formed . large - amplitude rotation of the isopropyl substituent around the cp - iPr bond may play a role in triggering dissociation of propene . three of the four diastereomers eliminate propene during the course of the simulations , which makes dissociation the dominating event on a 20-ps timescale . the CPMD simulations thus support the validity of the assumption , fundamental to statistical propagation models , that each insertion is independent of the preceding insertions . using insertion barriers from static density functional calculations , the statistical model predicts the polypropene microstructure in good agreement with experiment at low polymerization temperatures for the catalysts {iPr(3-R-CpFlu)}ZrCl2 ( r = H , iPr , tBu ) . the predictions become less accurate at higher temperatures , probably due to the onset of the competing back - skip reaction , which is not included in the model . 


some new volatile bis-cyclopentadienyl zirconium alkoxides of the type cp 2Zr(OR)(O tBu ) ( r = iPr , et , me ) is synthesized by the reaction of the corresponding KOR with the intermediate cp 2ZrCl(O tBu ) . moreover , an alternative and convenient synthesis of cp 2Zr(O tBu ) <nUm> , based on the reaction of cp 2ZrCl <nUm> with an excess of tert-butanol and triethylamine , is reported . the obtained compounds are identified by chemical analyses , thermogravimetric measurements , infrared ( IR ) , nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy , and mass spectrometry ( MS ) . furthermore , a crystallographic study of cp 2ZrCl(O tBu ) is also reported . cp 2Zr(O tBu ) <nUm> and cp 2Zr(O iPr)(O tBu ) are then used for depositing zirconia thin films of high quality and purity on Si(100) and stainless steel AISI <nUm> substrates by metal - organic (MO)CVD . the microstructure and composition of the deposits are investigated by x-ray diffraction ( XRD ) and secondary ion mass spectrometry ( SIMS ) , while their hardness and elastic recovery on the AISI <nUm> substrate are measured using load - depth nano-indentation tests . the outcomes are consistent with a significant increase in the berkovich hardness of the coated samples compared to that of bulk AISI <nUm> . 
the allyl-substituted ansa - zirconocene dichloride [ Me2Si(C 5H4)(C5H3CH2CH = CH 2)ZrCl2 ] ( 1 ) cleanly adds the borane 9-BBN to the allyl C = C double bond to yield the corresponding hydroboration product <nUm> . the borane BC12F10H ( 3 ) is also added regioselectively to <nUm> to yield [ Me2Si(C5H4){C5H 3(CH2)3B(C6F5) 2}ZrCl2 ] ( 4 ) . the strongly electrophilic boron lewis acid in <nUm> adds 2-methyl-4,5-dihydrooxazole to yield <nUm> . treatment of <nUm> with pyrrole results in the formation of the respective borane adduct <nUm> of the pyrrole tautomer 2H-pyrrole . the 2H-pyrrole ligand in <nUm> is deprotonated at C-2 upon treatment with pyridine , followed by proton transfer and replacement of pyrrole with formation of the corresponding pyridine adduct <nUm> . the complexes <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by x-ray diffraction . 
the monoalkyl complexes [ Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4) (e5-C5H3R)}(R')Cl ] [ r = me , R' = CH2Ph ( 1 ) ; r = me , R' = CH2SiMe3 ( 2 ) ; r = iPr , R' = CH2Ph ( 3 ) ; r = iPr , R' = CH2SiMe3 ( 4 ) ; r = SiMe3 , R' = CH2Ph ( 5 ) ; r = SiMe3 , R' = CH2SiMe3 ( <nUm> ] have been synthesized by the reaction of the corresponding ansa - metallocene dichloride complex and <nUm> equiv of the alkyl grignard reagent . dialkyl complexes with large alkyl groups only formed for the zirconocene complex containing the ansa ligand Me2Si(e5-C5Me4) ( e5-C5H4 ) and with the benzyl substituent giving [ Zr(Me2Si(e5-C5Me4) (e5-C5H4)}(CH2Ph) <nUm> ] ( 7 ) . when the alkyl substituent is CH2SiMe3 only the monoalkyl derivative , [ Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4) (e5-C5H4)}(CH2 SiMe3)Cl ] ( 8 ) , was formed . the insertion reaction of the isocyanide reagent CNC6H3Me2-2,6 into the zirconium-carbon s-bond of complexes 1-8 gave the corresponding e2-iminoacyl compound [ Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4) (e5-C5H3R)}{e2-R 'C = NC6H3Me2-2,6}Cl ] [ r = me , R' = CH2Ph ( 9 ) ; r = me , R' = CH2SiMe3 ( 10 ) ; r = iPr , R' = CH2Ph ( 11 ) ; r = iPr , R' = CH2SiMe3 ( 12 ) ; r = SiMe3 , R' = CH2Ph ( 13 ) ; r = SiMe3 , R' = CH2SiMe3 ( 14 ) ; r = H , R' = CH2SiMe3 ( 16 ) ] and [ Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4) (e5-C5H4)}{e2- PhCH2C = NC6H3Me2-2,6 } ( CH2Ph ) ] ( 15 ) . the molecular structure of <nUm> has been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies . 
methylenetriphenylphosphorane was coordinated to the boron of phenylborylidene-bridged bis(cyclopentadienyl)-and bis(2-Me,4-Ph-indenyl) zirconium dichloride to form zwitterionic ansa - zirconocene complexes . the cyclopentadienyl complex <nUm> , when activated with MAO , exhibits remarkable polymerization activity that is more than an order of magnitude greater than that of a related amidoborylidene-bridged complex as well as the commercially important pre-catalyst [Cp'-SiMe2-N-tBu]TiCl2 ( cp' ; C5Me4 ) . the zwitterionic bis(2-Me,4-Ph- indenyl)zirconium dichloride species is isolated as a mixture of rac and meso isomers 4-6 . the propylene polymerization efficiency of the isomer mixture activated by MAO is greater than that of a related silylene bridged system at <nUm> and <nUm> ° C ; however , the activity of the zwitterionic system decreased with further increase in temperature . the high level of isotactic triads ( <nUm> % ) and pentads ( <nUm> % ) in the polypropylene formed by 4-6 indicates that the rac isomer is the most active precatalyst of the mixture . the molecular structures of <nUm> and the rac bis-indenylzirconium isomer <nUm> and one of the meso isomers <nUm> are described . 
In this paper we report the synthesis of several unbridged zirconocenes , 1a-c , <nUm> and <nUm> , each bearing a phenyl substituent in the 2-position of the cyclopentadienyl ring . we also report their photochemical behaviour and we compare the results with those obtained with the corresponding unsubstituted metallocenes 3a-c and <nUm> . study of their electronic spectra and EPR / spin trapping experiments showed photogeneration of ligand- and zirconium - centred radicals , thus making these complexes suitable as photoinitiators for radical polymerisation processes . the substitution of the hydrogen atom in the 2-position with a phenyl group had positive effects both on the absorption coefficients , improving the light absorption efficiency , and on the reaction yields of tert-butyl acrylate polymerisation . these results can be explained in terms of the combined effects of greater persistence of the radical in solution and / or increased efficiency of the radical in initiating the polymerisation process . 
treatment of the substituted (diarylphosphanyl)methyl group-4 metallocene complexes [ ( C5H4-CR1R2- PAr2)2ZrCl2 ] ( <nUm> : R1 / R2 = CH3 / CH3 , H / CH3 , H / aryl ) with Li[B(C6F5)4] in dichloromethane solution results in chloride ligand abstraction ( with ClLi precipitation ) to yield the complexes [ ( C5H4-CR1R2- PAr2)2Zr-Cl+ ] ( 5 ) , with both phosphanyl groups internally coordinated to the metal centre . three possible diastereoisomers are observed in the case of 5c ( R1 = H ; R2 = CH3 ) , while bulkier R2 substituents give higher selectivities . the thermally induced ( reversible ) cleavage of the Zr - phosphane linkage results in dynamic NMR behaviour . gibbs activation energies of DG[?](298 K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> and <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal / mol were obtained for these intramolecular equilibration processes in the complexes trans-5d ( R1 = H ; R2 = ph ) and trans-5e ( R1 = H ; R2 = ferrocenyl ) , respectively . treatment of the substituted (dimethylamino)methyl metallocene complexes [ ( C5H4-CR1R2- NMe2)2ZrCl2 ] ( 6a , 6b ) with Li[B(C6F5)4] proceeds analogously to yield the cation systems [ { C5H4-C(CH3)2- NMe2}2ZrCl+ ] ( 12a ) and [ { C5H4-CH(CH3)- NMe2}2ZrCl+ ] ( 12b , three possible diastereoisomers ) . both complexes have their pairs of amino groups coordinated to the metal centre . the complexes exhibit dynamic NMR spectra . selective equilibration of the diastereotopic N(CH3)A(CH3)B resonances of complex 12a is observed [ DG[?](233 K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal / mol ] , whereas the adjacent C(CH3)A(CH3)B methyl groups remain diastereotopic . the dynamic equilibration of the latter was observed at a markedly higher temperature [ DG[?](333 K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal / mol ] . treatment of [ { C5H4-C(CH3)2- NMe2}CpZrCl2 ] ( 10 ) with Li[B(C6F5)4] resulted in the formation of complex [ { C5H4-C(CH3)2- NMe2}CpZr - cl+ ] ( 11 ) , which shows the internal -N(CH3)A(CH)B equilibration proceeding with a markedly higher activation barrier [ DG[?](333 K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal / mol ] than in 12a , and a stereochemical memory effect indicative of solvent coordination to the metal centre of the resulting highly electrophilic chlorozirconocene cation intermediate . complex <nUm> was characterised by an x-ray crystal structure analysis , which shows the internal zr-amine coordination . ( 
alkylation of ansa - zirconocene [ Zr{(e5-C5H 5)SiMe2 - (MBI)}Cl2 ] ( MBI = e5-Me- C13H7 ) with MgRCl gave the dimethyl complex [ Zr{(e5-C5H5)SiMe2(MBI)}Me <nUm> ] , but unresolvable mixtures containing mono-alkylated compounds were obtained when bulkier alkyls were used . however pure dialkyl complexes [ Zr{(e5-C5H5)SiMe2(MBI)}R <nUm> ] ( r = CH2Ph , CH2SiMe3 ) were easily obtained using K(CH2Ph) and Li(CH-2SiMe3) as alkylating agents . diastereoselective insertion into the MBI - unprotected Zr-R bond was observed when all of these dialkyl complexes were treated with 2,6-xylyl isocyanide to give the iminoacyl compounds [ zr{(e5- C5H5)SiMe2(MBI)}R{CR[e2-N-(2,6- xylyl ) ] } ] ( r = me , CH2Ph , CH2SiMe3 ) . all of the new complexes were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and the x-ray molecular structures of the dibenzyl and the imino-benzyl compounds were determined . the catalytic activity for ethene polymerization and ethene / 1-hexene copolymerization of the dichloro zirconocenes [ Zr{(e5-C 5H5)EMe2(MBI)}Cl2 ] ( e = C , Si ) , activated with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , was measured . 
the dimethyltitanocene / BC18F15 system reacts with the 4-unprotected methyl a-D-glucopyranoside derivative <nUm> ( " HO-carb . " ) to yield the ionic complex [ Cp2Ti(O-carb . ) ] +[MeB(C6F5)3]- ( 10a ) . spectroscopic studies have led us to believe that 10a is characterized by an internal ether - chelate structure in solution that involves coordination of the 6-OCH2Ph oxygen atom . treatment of 10a with trimethylphosphane gives the open , non-chelated complex 11a , in which the phosphane coordinates to the metal center . reaction of the THF - stabilized salt [ Cp2TiCH 3(THF)]+[BPh4]- ( 12a ) with <nUm> gave complex 13a , with coordinated THF . experiments with bis(methylcyclopentadienyl) titanium systems gave analogous results ( complexes 10b , 11b and 13b ) . zirconocenes react differently . addition of dimethylzirconocene ( 14a ) or dimethylbis(methylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium ( 14b ) to <nUm> gave the neutral complexes 15a , 15b and methane . treatment of 15a ( 15b ) with B(C 6F5)3 again resulted in the formation of an ionic chelate complex 16a ( 16b ) . A non-chelated complex <nUm> was formed by treating the THF - stabilized salt [Cp2ZrCH3(THF)] +[BPh4]- ( 17 ) with <nUm> . 
the chemistry of the metallocene bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complexes ( Cp2M(L)(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ] [ m = Ti , without L ( 1 ) ; m = Zr , L = THF ( 2a ) ; m = Zr , L = pyridine ( 2b ) ] , the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl complexes [ cp . 2M(e2-Me3Si-C2SiMe3) ] [ m = Ti ( 3 ) , Zr ( 4 ) ] , and the ethylenebis(tetrahydroindenyl) ( ebthi ) complexes rac-[(ebthi)M(e2-Me3SiC2-SiMe3)] [ m = Ti ( 5 ) , Zr ( 6 ) ] has been described in several reviews . A fine - tuning of the reactions is possible by varying the cp ligands ( cp , cp. , ebthi ) , additional the co-ligands ( THF , pyridine ) , and / or metals ( Ti , Zr ) , and it has been pointed out that these complexes offer a number of compelling advantages over other , similar , widely used metallocene reagents . In this microreview recent ( 2000-2004 ) examples of the chemistry of complexes 1-6 are summarized , and some special interactions with lewis acids are described . In these reactions the metallocene cores " Cp'2Ti " and " Cp'2Zr " ( cp' = substituted cp ligands ) are mostly formed after dissociation of the alkyne . As examples of this , a new selective zirconocene coupling route to large , functionalized macrocycles has been established from 2b and polyynes , complex <nUm> catalyses the first anti-Markovnikov hydroarnination of terminal alkynes , complexes <nUm> and <nUm> selectively form polynuclear titanium complexes by C-C coupling of N - containing heterocycles , and complexes <nUm> , 2b , <nUm> , and <nUm> promote selective C-H and C-F bond - cleavage reactions of fluorinated N - containing heterocycles . beside this recent chemistry , this microreview also focuses on the reactions of the above-mentioned complexes with the lewis acids diisobutylaluminum hydride and tris-(pentafluorophenyl)borane . for example , complexes <nUm> , 2b , and <nUm> react with iBu2AlH to give heterodimetallic complexes containing tetracoordinate planar carbon atoms . the titanium complex <nUm> reacts with B(C6F 5)3 with elimination of the alkyne and gaseous hydrogen to give an electrophilic substitution of the cp or cp . ligand in which zwitterionic TiIII complexes are formed . the zirconium complexes <nUm> and <nUm> do not liberate hydrogen in the reaction with B(C6F 5)3 , although , after C-H activation of one methyl group of the cp . or cp part of the ebthi ligand and a B-C bond formation , zwitterionic complexes containing alkylidene groups with agostic interactions with the metal center are obtained . complex <nUm> reacts with B(C6F 5)3 with Si-C bond cleavage of the alkyne and formation of an alkynylboranate [ Me3SiC = BC19F15 ] - , which is complexed by the " rac - (ebthi)Ti " fragment to give a zwitterionic complex . some of the formed heterodinuclear complexes and the zwitterionic complexes are active catalysts in the ring - opening polymerization of lactones , cyclic carbonates , and epoxides , as well as the polymerization of ethylene . 
the syntheses and structures of the new zirconium(+3) silylphosphanido complexes {[Cp2ZrP(H)R]2} 1a { cp = e5- CH ; r = SiMe2C(iPr)Me2 } , 1b ( r = SiiPr3 ) , and 1c ( r = SiF(tBu) ( 2,4,6-iPr3C 6H2 ) are reported . the latter are easily accessible by the reaction of the lithium salts of the corresponding primary silylphosphanes with the schwartz reagent [ Cp2Zr(H) Cl ] in THF at <nUm> ° C . they can be isolated in the form of diamagnetic red - black crystals in 68-85 % yield . the central structural motif of the complexes consists of planar ( 1a , 1b ) and slightly puckered PZr rings ( 1c ) , and contains two d1-Zr(+3) centers , which are antiferromagnetically coupled ( super exchange , through - bond interaction ) although the transannular Zr-Zr separation is around 360pm . thus , the compounds have a biradicaloid electronic structure , heating of solutions of 1a-c in toluene in the presence of Pd / C or [ ( ph 3P ) 2Pt(C2H4) ] results in catalytic dehydrogenation of the P-H bonds , affording the first neutral zirconocene - phosphinidene dimers [Cp2ZrPR]2Sa-C in the form of deep red crystals in 72-88 % yield . the composition of the products is proven by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy , mass spectrometry and correct C,H - combustion analyses . the molecular structures of 3a and 3c were additionally confirmed by x-ray crystal structure analyses , showing that they consist of PZr rings with significantly shorter Zr-P distances than those observed in 1a and 1c , interestingly , the dehydrogenation of the mostly sterically crowded derivative 1c occurs also in boiling toluene solutions without using a catalyst , but the process is prevented in a H atmosphere . this suggests that the zr(+3) centers in 1c can serve as active sites for the P-H bonding activation , which , however , are deactivated in the presence of H . 
the synthesis and characterization of chiral bis(indenyl)zirconium dichlorides containing b-pinenyl-derived ligand substituents is reported . unbridged metallocene complexes having the [?](1S , 2S , 5S)-6,6- dimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]hept-2-yl]methyl)dimethylsilyl substituent in both 1- and 2-positions of the indenyl moiety were prepared and isolated in moderate to low yields by reaction of the corresponding indenyllithium salts with ClZr <nUm> followed by work-up and crystallization procedures . the corresponding tetrahydroindenyl complexes were obtained in excellent yields by catalytic hydrogenation of the indenyl six - membered rings . In a complementary approach , a synthetic route to a-pinenyl-substituted indenyl ligand analogues was briefly evaluated , which however , suffered from low yields . selected ss-pinenyl-substituted indenyl complexes were scanned as catalysts for the dehydropolymerization of phenylsilane upon activation with nBuLi , for polymerization of ethylene and propylene upon activation with methylalumlnoxane ( MAO ) as well as for enantioselective carboalumination of 1-octene with triethyland trimethylaluminum . the bis(indenyl) complexes catalyzed the carboalumination reaction , albeit only low yields ( 8-16 % ) and low enantioselectivities ( ee = 0.5-10 % ) were obtained . the 2-substituted bis(indenyl)zirconocene / MAO catalyst system produced atactic low - molecular weight polypropylene with low polymerization activity whereas both 1-and 2-substituted complexes showed high activities in ethylene polymerization producing polyethylenes with high molecular weights ( mw > <nUm> ) . 
the systematic synthesis of 1,3-dialkyl-substituted 2-silylindenes and their suitability as zirconocene ligands is discussed . unexpected reactivities rendered a number of substitution patterns unfeasible , especially for alkyl groups other than methyl in 2-(trimethylsilyl)indene derivatives , and essentially for all derivatives of 2-(dimethylsilyl)indene . the syntheses of rac / meso-bis[1-methyl-2-(trimethylsilyl)indenyljzirconium(IV) dichloride ( 12 ) and bis[1,3-dimethyl-2-(trimethylsilyl)indenyl]zirconium(IV) dichloride ( 13b ) are de scribed . the solid - state structure of the latter displays strong deformations within the ligand framework and an unusually large C PcentroidZr - CPcentroid angle . both , <nUm> / MAO and 13b / MAO , displayed ethene and ethene-co-1-hexene polymerization activity . curiously , 13b / MAO shows an extraordinary monomer selectivity , which can be rationalized by means of DFT calculations on the active site . 
the zirconocene complexes Cp2Zr(L) ( e2-Me 3SiC2SiMe3 ) ( 1a : L = THF ; 1b : L = pyridine ) and the ethylene bis(tetrahydroindenyl) complex rac-(ebthi)Zr(e2- Me3SiC2SiMe3 ) ( 2 ) react with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoropyridine with C-H bond activation to produce the 4-substituted pyridyl complexes with agostic alkenyl groups cp' 2Zr(4-C5NF4)[-C(SiMe3) = CH(SiMe <nUm> ) ] ( cp'2 = cp2 ) ( 3 ) and ( cp'2 = ebthi ) ( 4 ) . with 2,3,4,6-tetrafluoropyridine , after C-H bond activation , complex <nUm> yields two isomers of the 5-substituted pyridyl complex rac-(ebthi)Zr(3-C5NF4)[-C(SiMe3) = CH(SiMe3) ] with agostic alkenyl groups , 5a and 5b . with pentafluoropyridine complex 1b gives , after dissociation of the bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene ( btmsa ) , C-F bond activation at the 4-position and formation of Cp2Zr(4-C5NF4)F ( 6 ) . complex 1b reacts with 3-chloro-2,4,5,6-tetrafluoropyridine by means of a preferred C-Cl activation to give Cp2Zr(3-C5NF4)Cl ( 7 ) . these results are in contrast to the reactions of the titanium complex cp 2Ti(e2-Me3-SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) which , with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoropyridine , gave C-F activation in preference to C-H activation . with pentafluoropyridine , C-F bond activation at the 2-position was found rather than at the 4-position . 
the heterometallic dinuclear complex [ Cp*2Zr(Me){(m- OOCC6H4S)Rh(PEt3)3 } ] ( 3 ) is readily obtained by methane elimination in the reaction of [ Rh(SC6H 4COOH)(PEt3)3 ] with [ cp* 2ZrMe2 ] in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio . complex <nUm> reacts with <nUm> equiv. of water to give [ Cp*2Zr(OH){(m-OOCC6H 4S)Rh(PEt3)3 } ] ( 4 ) , a rare example of a terminal hydroxo complex of a zirconocene . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> are isotypic . the influence of the zirconocene group on the properties of the rhodium complex was evaluated with 31P NMR spectroscopy , cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations . [Cp*2ZrMe2] reacts with [ {Rh(m-SC6H4COOH)(PPh3)2} <nUm> ] ( even in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio at room temperature ) or with [ Rh(SC 6H4COOH)(PEt3)3 ] ( in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio at elevated temperature ) to give 32-membered metallamacrocycles containing four rhodium and two zirconium atoms , in which each zirconocene group bridges two {Rh(SC6H4COO)(PR3)2}2 units [ r = ph ( 5 ) , et ( 6 ) ] . the only significant structural difference in <nUm> and <nUm> is the presence of two different isomers , in which the bridging thiolato ligands occupy either the exo or the endo position of the Rh2S <nUm> ring . however , this small difference has a significant influence on the size of the macrocyclic cavity . 
dinuclear group <nUm> metallocene catalysts linked by a biphenylene or 1,2-diphenylethylene bridge , namely [ 4,4'-(C5Me 4)2-(C6H4)2][CpZrCl 2]2 ( 2a ) , [ p-(C5Me4)C 6H4CH2]2[CpZrCl2] <nUm> ( 2b ) , [ p-(3,4-Me2C5H2)C 6H4CH2]2[CpZrCl2] <nUm> ( 2c ) , [ (C5Me4)2-(C 6H4)2][TiCl3]2 ( 3a ) , [p-(C5Me4)C6H4CH2] 2[TiCl3]2 ( 3b ) , and [ p-(3,4-Me 2C5H2)C6H4CH 2]2[TiCl3]2 ( 3c ) , have been prepared and the crystal structures of 2b and 3b determined by x-ray diffraction methods . the crystal structures reveal that these complexes consist of two equivalent metal units inverted with respect to the center of the bridge . all the complexes were tested for the polymerization of ethylene and styrene in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , and direct comparisons of their catalytic properties with those of the corresponding mononuclear analogues [ ( PhC 5Me4)-CpZrCl2 ] ( 4a ) , [ ( p-TolC 5Me4)CpZrCl2 ] ( 4b ) , [ ( 1-p-Tol-3,4-Me 2C5H2)CpZrCl2 ] ( 4c ) , [ ( PhC 5Me4)TiCl3 ] ( 5a ) , [ ( p-TolC5Me 4)TiCl3 ] ( 5b ) , and [ ( 1-p-Tol-3,4-Me2C 5H2)TiCl3 ] ( 5c ) were performed . the dinuclear zirconocenes show a high activity in ethylene polymerization comparable with those of the corresponding mononuclear catalysts and give an increased molecular weight of polyethylene . the dinuclear half - sandwich titanocenes exhibit similar or slightly lower activity and molecular weight in styrene polymerization compared with their mononuclear analogues . 
the reaction of [ e5-C5H5- ( e5-C5H4CMe2C6H 4Me)Zr(CH2Ph)2 ] ( 1 ) with the cation generating agent BC18F15 was studied by means of multinuclear NMR and density functional theory ( DFT ) methods . the clean reaction in CD2Cl2 at <nUm> ° C yielded the cationic compound [ e5-C5H5-(e5 : e1-C5H4-CR2C6H 4R)Zr(e2-CH2Ph) ] ( r = me : <nUm> , r = H : <nUm> ) , with a tolyl moiety coordinated to the cationic zirconium centre , in addition to the expected e2-coordination of the benzyl moiety . both coordinations were unambiguously assigned by multi-nuclear one- and two - dimensional NMR spectroscopy . detailed DFT calculations of congener <nUm> at the B3LYP level of theory explain the unusual chemical shift of the coordinated atom of the tolyl moiety . furthermore , detailed electronic analysis ( bader and NBO analysis ) were undertaken to ascertain the type of coordination ( agostic versus electrostatic ) that the tolyl moiety adopts . 
the zirconocene complexes [ zr(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ){e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> -(CMe <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH = CH <nUm> )}Cl <nUm> ] ( 4 ) and [ zr{e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ( CMe <nUm> -CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH = CH <nUm> ) } <nUm> Cl <nUm> ] ( 5 ) were synthesised from the reaction of the lithium derivative [ Li{C <nUm> H <nUm> ( CMe <nUm> CH <nUm> -CH <nUm> CH = CH <nUm> ) } ] ( 1 ) with [ zr(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )Cl <nUm> ] or ClZr <nUm> , respectively . the ansa - zirconocene complex [ Zr{Me <nUm> si(e <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> )-(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> { CMe <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH = CH <nUm> })}Cl <nUm> ] ( 6 ) was obtained from the reaction of the lithium precursor [ Li <nUm> { me <nUm> si(e <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> )(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> { CMe <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH = CH <nUm> } ) } ] ( 3 ) with zirconium tetrachloride . catalytic hydrogenation of 4-6 gave the zirconocene complexes [ zr(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ) { η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ( CMe <nUm> CH <nUm> -CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> )}Cl <nUm> ] ( 7 ) , [ zr(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ( CMe <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> -CH <nUm> ) } <nUm> Cl <nUm> ] ( 8 ) and [ Zr{Me <nUm> si(e <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> )(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> { CMe2CH2-CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> })}Cl <nUm> ] ( 9 ) , respectively . hydroboration of 4-6 with 9-BBN ( 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ) yielded [ zr(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ){e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ( CMe <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> BC <nUm> H <nUm> )}Cl <nUm> ] ( 10 ) , [ zr{e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ( CMe <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> BC <nUm> H <nUm> ) } <nUm> Cl <nUm> ] ( 11 ) and [ Zr{Me <nUm> si(e <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> )(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> { CMe <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> BC <nUm> -H <nUm> })}Cl <nUm> ] ( 12 ) , respectively , and the catalytic hydrosilylation of 4-6 with SiHMe <nUm> Cl gave [ zr(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ){e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ( CMe <nUm> -CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> SiMe <nUm> Cl)}Cl <nUm> ] ( 13 ) , [ zr{e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ( CMe <nUm> -CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> SiMe <nUm> Cl ) } <nUm> Cl <nUm> ] ( 14 ) and [ Zr{Me <nUm> si(e <nUm> - C <nUm> me <nUm> )(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> { CMe <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> SiMe <nUm> Cl})}Cl <nUm> ] ( 15 ) , respectively . the dinuclear complex [ Cl <nUm> Zr{Me <nUm> si(e <nUm> -C <nUm> -Me <nUm> )(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> { CMe <nUm> ( CH <nUm> ) <nUm> SiMe <nUm> OSiMe <nUm> ( CH <nUm> ) <nUm> me <nUm> C } η <nUm> -C <nUm> -H <nUm> )(e <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> )SiMe <nUm> }ZrCl <nUm> ] ( 16 ) was obtained upon controlled hydrolysis of <nUm> . the zirconocene compounds were tested as catalysts in the polymerisation of ethylene and propylene . isotactic polypropylene with [mmmrn] pentads of the order of <nUm> % were obtained with the ansa - zirconocene catalysts , whereas the unbridged metallocene catalysts produced atactic polypropylene . the molecular structures of <nUm> and <nUm> were determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies . 
the nickel - catalyzed cross-coupling of 2-bromoindene with propynyl- or (phenylethynyl)magnesium bromide gives the corresponding 2-alkynyl-substituted indenyl ligands . subsequent deprotonation and transmetallation with the bis-(tetrahydrofuran)zirconium tetrachloride adduct yields the corresponding bis(2-alkynylindenyl)dichloridozirconium complexes 4a and 4b , which cleanly add a C3CoO3 unit to their pairs of alkynyl substituents to give the dimetallic complexes 5a and 5b . complex 5b was characterized by an x-ray crystal structure analysis . complex 4a adds HB(C6F 5)2 to the alkynyl substituents to yield a mixture of a- and b-(boryl-alkenyl)metallocenes . activation of these complexes with MAO gives active ethene polymerization catalysts , and the 4a,4b,6a / MAO systems are also active in propene polymerization . 
the indene ligands {1-C9H7R} [ r = C2H 4(C4H7O2) ( 1 ) , C2H 4(C3H5O2) ( 2 ) , CH2(C 5H9O ) ( 3 ) ] were prepared by alkylation of indene and used to prepare the SiMe2 - bridged indenylcyclopentadiene ligands { me 2Si(3-C9H6R)(C5Me4H) } [ r = C6H11O2 ( 4 ) , C6H11O ( 5 ) ] . bis(indenyl) - and ansa-indenylcyclopentadienyl zirconocenes [ Zr{1-e5-C 9H6R}2Cl2 ] { r = C2H 4(C4H7O2) ( 6 ) , C2H 4(C3H5O2) ( 7 ) , CH2(C 5H9O ) ( 8 ) } and [ Zr{Me2Si(3-e5- C9H5R ) ( e5-C5Me 4)}Cl2 ] { r = C2H4(C 4H7O2 ) ( 9 ) , CH2(C5H 9O ) ( 10 ) } were prepared by the reaction of Cl4Zr with the appropriate mono- or dilithium salts of 1-5 . the molecular structure of [ Zr{Me2Si(3-e5-C9H5C 2H4(C4H7O2) ) (e5-C5Me4)}Cl2 ] ( 9 ) was determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies . indenylzirconium complexes 6-10 were immobilized on thf - modified Cl2Mg , and these supported systems were used to polymerize ethylene in the presence of methylaluminoxane . the catalytic activity of these complexes in both homogeneous and supported polymerization reactions is discussed . 
reaction of Et2NSi(SiMe3)3 with potassium tert-butoxide gives the silylenoid Et2N(Me3Si) 2SiK . structural characterisation and reactivity of this compound was studied . it was found that while Et2N(Me3Si) 2SiK exhibits the typical NMR spectroscopic properties for a silylenoid species it does not undergo self - condensation under ambient conditions . its reaction with zirconocene and hafnocene dichlorides gave the expected silyl metallocene chloride . however , there seems to be no strong interaction between the amino nitrogen atom and the group-4 metal . besides the synthesis of Et2N(Me3Si)2-SiK also the preparation of the related silylenoid compound ( Et2N ) 2(Me3Si)SiK and was accomplished . 
the 4-isoprenyl- and 1-isoprenylcyclopentadienides 6a and 6b were prepared by means of a fulvene route involving a subsequent deprotonation reaction using potassium hexamethyldisilylamide . transmetallation to zirconium or hafnium gave the respective bis(4-isoprenyl-Cp)MCl2 and bis(1-isoprenyl-Cp) MCl2 complexes 7a,b and 8a,b , respectively . upon photolysis , the (4-isoprenyl-Cp)2ZrCl2 and -HfCl2 complexes 7a , 8a underwent rapid intramolecular [4+4] cycloaddition reactions to yield the cyclooctadienylene-bridged ansa - metallocenes 9a , 10a in high yields . the (4-isoprenyl-Cp)2MCl2 complexes A ( m = Zr , Hf ) undergo rapid photochemical [4+4] cycloaddition to give the cyclooctadienylene-bridged ansa - metallocenes B in high yield . 
the synthesis , structures , and ring - opening polymerization ( ROP ) activity of new dimethyl-ansa- and -non-ansa-zirconocene complexes are reported . the substituted indene precursors 1-C9H7R [ r = CH3 ( 1 ) , CH2Ph ( 2 ) and C2H4(C4H 7O2 ) ( 3 ) ] were synthesised by treating RBr [ r = CH 2Ph and C2H4(C4H7O <nUm> ) ] or MeI with indenyllithium . likewise , bridged indenyl / cyclopentadiene compounds [ Me2Si(3-C9H 6R)(C5Me4H) ] [ r = H ( 4 ) , CH3 ( 5 ) , CH2Ph ( 6 ) and C2H4(C4H 7O2 ) ( 7 ) ] were obtained by treating the lithium salt of the appropriately substituted indene with ClSiMe2(C 5Me4H ) . ansa-Indenyl-cyclopentadienylmetallocenes [ Zr{Me2Si(3-e5-C9H5R) (e5-C5Me4)}Cl2 ] [ r = H ( 8 ) , CH3 ( 9 ) , CH2Ph ( 10 ) , C2H4(C 4H7O2 ) ( 11 ) ] were subsequently obtained by treating the dilithium salts of the corresponding ligands with Cl4Zr in toluene . the dimethyl derivatives [ Zr{Me2Si(3-e5- C9H5R)(e5-C5Me 4)}Me2 ] [ r = H ( 12 ) , CH3 ( 13 ) , CH2Ph ( 14 ) , C6H11O2 ( 15 ) ] were prepared by treating the corresponding ansa - zirconocene dichloride complex with MgMeBr . dialkyl derivative [ Zr{Me2Si{3-e5-C 9H5(CH2Ph)}(e5-C 5Me4)}(CH2SiMe3)2 ] ( 16 ) was prepared by adding <nUm> equiv. of LiCH2SiMe3 to complex <nUm> . mixed indenyl / cyclopentadienylzirconocene complexes [ zr(e5- C9H6R)(e5-C5H 5)Cl2 ] [ r = H ( 17 ) , C2H4(C 4H7O2 ) ( 18 ) ] were prepared by treating the lithium salt of the appropriately substituted indene with [ zr(e5- C5H5)Cl3 ] . likewise , dimethyl derivatives [ Zr(e5-C9H6R)(e5-C 5H5)Me2 ] [ r = H ( 19 ) , C2H 4(C4H7O2) ( 20 ) ] were prepared by treating the corresponding mixed indenyl / cyclopentadienyl dichloride complex with <nUm> equiv. of MgMeBr . the x-ray crystal structures of <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were also established . finally , comparative catalytic studies of zirconium complexes 12-16 , <nUm> and <nUm> in ROP reactions of e-caprolactone are described . synthesis , characterization , and catalytic studies of new dimethyl-ansa- and -non-ansa-zirconocene complexes for ring - opening polymerization of e-caprolactone are described . 
seven - membered metallacycloalkyne compounds were synthesized . the reaction of the zirconocene-ethylene complex and (Z)-1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)buta-1,2,3- triene gave a mixture of 1-zirconacyclopent-3-yne and 1-zirconacyclohept-3-yne . In contrast , zirconocene - alkyne complexes , such as those of 1-(trimethylsilyl) prop-1-yne and diphenylacetylene , gave 1-zirconacyclohept-2-en-5-yne in good yields . consideration of structural parameters suggests that both a seven - membered cyclic alkyne and a five - membered structure contribute to generation of this complex . coupling of benzyne and [3]cumulenes on a metal was also found to afford the corresponding metallacycles . seven - membered metallacycloalkyne compounds were synthesized and structurally characterized . zirconocene - alkyne complexes , such as those of 1-(trimethylsilyl)prop-1-yne and diphenylacetylene reacted with [3]cumulene to give 1-zirconacyclohept-2-en-5-yne in good yields . coupling of benzyne and [3]cumulenes on the metal also gave the corresponding metallacycles . 
borylation of hafno - and zirconocene complexes [ ( e5-C 5H2- 1,2,4-Me3)2M ] <nUm> ( m2,e2,e2-N <nUm> ) , containing strongly activated dinitrogen ligands , with pinacolborane ( HBPin ) resulted in N-B and M-H bond formation . treatment of the borylated products with carbon monoxide triggered N-N bond scission with concomitant N-C bond formation to produce m-borylimido and m-formamidido fragments . conversely , addition of tBuNC resulted in insertion of the isocyanide ligand into the M-H bonds and furnished the corresponding e2- iminoacylhafnocene complexes . 
the reactions of the metallocene generators Cp'2M(L) ( e2-Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) [ 1a-Ti : cp' = cp = e5-cyclopentadienyl , m = Ti , L = none ; 1b-Ti : cp' = cp* = e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl , m = Ti , L = none ; 1c-Ti : cp'2 = rac - ( ebthi ) = rac-ethylenebistetrahydroindenyl , m = Ti , L = none ; 1a-Zr : cp' = cp , m = Zr , L = pyridine ; 1b-Zr : cp' = cp* , m = Zr , L = none ; 1c-Zr : cp'2 = rac - ( ebthi ) , m = Zr , L = none ] with 1,2-bis(4',4',5',5'- tetramethyl[1',3',2']dioxaborolan-2'-yl)acetylene ( bPinBA , <nUm> ) as a di-heteroatom - substituted alkyne were investigated . A slightly special reaction of 1a-Ti with <nUm> produced no titanacyclopropene or titanacyclopentadiene , but instead complex <nUm> was produced by the coupling of two alkyne units with one of the cp ligands to form a six - membered ring annelated to a five - membered one . the titanocene complexes 1b-Ti and 1c-Ti reacted with <nUm> to form the titanacylopropenes <nUm> and <nUm> . the complex 1a-Zr reacts with <nUm> to the corresponding zirconacyclopropene <nUm> as a byproduct , in which the pyridine ligand remains coordinated . if the pyridine ligand dissociates , a coupling with a second alkyne yields the zirconacyclopentadiene <nUm> as the main product . the reaction of the sterically more demanding zirconocene precursor 1c-Zr also yielded the zirconacyclopentadiene <nUm> , whereas 1b-Zr did not react with <nUm> . the complex rac-(ebthi)Ti(e2-bPinBA) ( 5 ) reacts with gaseous dry CO2 directly to form the titanafuranone <nUm> . the molecular structures of complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were characterised by single - crystal x-ray crystallography . group <nUm> metallocenes and bis(tetramethyldioxaborolanyl)acetylene gave different products : " Cp2Ti " afforded a dihydroindenyl complex . " rac - (ebthi)Ti " , " Cp*2Ti " and " cp 2Zr(py) " led to metallacyclopropenes , whereas " cp 2Zr " and " rac - (ebthi)Zr " yielded metallacyclopentadienes . one of the titanacyclopropenes reacts with CO <nUm> to a titanacyclofuranone . 







novel seco - analogs of CC - <nUm> <nUm> were synthesized from comercially available nitroaniline by reduction , bromination , bisulfonation and bisallylation followed by reaction with tert-butyllithium , zirconocene and iodine . the obtained quinoline <nUm> was then transformed into <nUm> and <nUm> , which , upon treatment with pd0 , led to <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . 
reaction of schwartz 's reagent [Cp2ZrHCl]n ( 1 ) ( one or two equivalents ) with gem - dinitrile compounds of the type X(CN)2 [ x = CMe2 , CBenz2 , Ni2PPr4 ] gives the corresponding mono- and di-N-zirconated imino complexes selectively . substitution reactions of the zirconocene metal fragment with electrophiles such as , for example , chlorophosphanes of the type R2PCl , acid chlorides RC(O)Cl or the iminium salt [CH2NMe2]Cl allowed the preparation of a large variety of stable N - functionalized mono- and b-diimine derivatives . the nature of the x group is of particular importance for the success of the substitution reaction step . the x-ray crystal structures obtained for the N - functionalized gem - aldiminonitrile compounds <nUm> , 10b , the N - phosphorylated b-diimine <nUm> , and the gem - formyl nitrile derivative 12b are presented . ( 
during the last <nUm> years , group-IV metal complexes have been used extensively as catalysts in organic chemistry . however , a new and rapidly growing field for group-IV metal catalysis evolved in the 1990s when the groups of bergman , livinghouse and doye found that zirconium and titanium complexes catalyze the inter- and intramolecular hydroamination of alkynes and allenes . starting from early results obtained with zirconocene bis(amides) , this review deals mostly with hydroamination reactions based on titanium catalysts . In this context , studies directed towards catalyst development are presented as well as applications of corresponding processes for the synthesis of biologically interesting compounds . however , the microreview covers group-IV metal complex catalyzed hydroamination reactions of alkynes and allenes that appeared in the literature before july <nUm> , <nUm> . ( 
the tandem zirconocene - mediated or - catalyzed cross-coupling-elimination reaction provides an efficient and versatile procedure for the construction of scaffolds that in many cases are difficult to access by traditional organic chemistry . In general , this process supposes the reaction of two unsaturated molecules . one of them is coordinated to the zirconocene and the other one contains a heteroatom at an appropriate position for the subsequent elimination process . In this microreview we discuss the concept of this useful approach focussing on the reactivity of alkyne- , aryne- , alkene - and iminezirconocene complexes towards alkenes containing a heteroatom functionality at the allylic or vinylic position . some examples of heteroatom - substituted alkynes are also covered . 
selective reductions of semicyclic imides either to hemiaminals ( endo carbonyl reduction ) or to aldehydes and amines ( exo carbonyl reduction ) in high yields by schwartz 's reagent ( Cp2ZrHCl ) are reported . mechanistic aspects of these reactions have been investigated at the DFT ab initio level with consideration of implicit solvent effects and thermal and pressure corrections to <nUm> K / <nUm> atm . the reactions proceed from the reagents to very stable final zr-oxo intermediates through the formation of σ complexes and subsequent four - center transition state structures ( 1,2-migratory insertion ) . the energetic barriers for the insertion steps depend strongly on the natures of the ancillary groups at the reducing carbonyl groups . N-Carbamoyl groups are reduced to hemiaminals whereas n-acyl groups react at the exo carbonyl groups . the absence of the second carbonyl group in the simple n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone ( less oxidized system ) strongly reduces the thermodynamic drive for the formation of the metallocene oxo intermediate and allows an explanation of the remarkable chemoselectivity of the hydrozirconation . the zirconocene-oxo intermediates hydrolyze quickly throughout an ionic mechanism in which water molecules strongly assist the process by stabilizing ion pair separation . the computational results are consistent with a large set of experimental data on reduction of g-lactam and isoxazolidinone derivatives under mild conditions . they provide a way to explain and predict the relative importance of the two competitive endo / exo reduction channels of semicyclic imides by considering the electronic and steric features of substituents . semicyclic imides such as g-lactam and isoxazolidinone derivatives are efficiently and selectivity reduced by the Cp2ZrHCl agent . the energetic reaction pathways for endo and exo attack , computed at the DFT level including thermal effects , allow an exhaustive interpretation of current and previously reported experimental data . 


two approaches for the conversion of d-glucose to (-)-neplanocin A ( 2 ) , both based on the zirconocene - promoted ring contraction of a vinyl-substituted pyranoside , are herein evaluated ( scheme <nUm> ) . In the first pathway ( scheme <nUm> ) , the substrate possesses the a-D-allo configuration ( see <nUm> ) such that ultimate introduction of the nucleobase would require only an inversion of configuration . however , this precursor proved unresponsive to Cp2Zr ( = [ZrCl2(Cp)2] ) , an end result believed to be a consequence of substantive nonbonded steric effects operating in a key intermediate ( scheme <nUm> ) . In contrast , the C(2) epimer ( see <nUm> ) experienced the desired metal - promoted conversion to an enantiomerically pure polyfunctional cyclopentane ( see <nUm> in scheme <nUm> ) . the substituents in this product are arrayed in a manner such that conversion to the target nucleoside can be conveniently achieved by a double - inversion sequence ( scheme <nUm> ) . recourse to palladium(0) - catalyzed allylic alkylation did not provide an alternate means of generating <nUm> . 
the acid - catalyzed reaction between formaldehyde and 1H-indene , 3-alkyl- and 3-aryl-1H-indenes , and six - membered - ring substituted 1H-indenes , with the 1H-indene / CH2O ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> , at temperatures above <nUm> ° in hydrocarbon solvents , yields 2,2'-methylenebis[1H-indenes] 1-8 in 50-100 % yield . these 2,2'-methylenebis[1H-indenes] are easily deprotonated by <nUm> equiv. of BuLi or MeLi to yield the corresponding dilithium salts , which are efficiently converted into ansa - metallocenes of Zr and Hf . the unsubstituted dichloro{(1,1',2,2',3,3',3a,3'a,7a,7'a-e)-2 , 2'-methylenebis[1H-inden-1-yl]}zirconium ( [ZrCl2(1')] ) is the least soluble in organic solvents . substitution of the 1H-indenyl moieties by hydrocarbyl substituents increases the hydrocarbon solubility of the complexes , and the presence of a substituent larger than a me group at the 1,1' positions of the ligand imparts a high diastereoselectivity to the metallation step , since only the racemic isomers are obtained . methylene-bridged ' ansa - zirconocenes ' show a noticeable open arrangement of the bis[1H-inden-1-yl] moiety , as measured by the angle between the planes defined by the two p-ligands ( the ' bite angle ' ) . In particular , of the ' zirconocenes ' structurally characterized so far , the dichloro{(1,1',2,2',3 , 3',3a,3'a,7a,7'a-e)-2,2'-methylenebis[4 , 7-dimethyl-1H-inden-1-yl]}zirconium ( [ZrCl2(5')] is the most open . the mixture [ZrCl2(1')] / methylalumoxane ( MAO ) is inactive in the polymerization of both ethylene and propylene , while the metallocenes with substituted indenyl ligands polymerize propylene to atactic polypropylene of a molecular mass that depends on the size of the alkyl or aryl groups at the 1,1' positions of the ligand . ethene is polymerized by rac-dichloro-{(1,1',2,2',3,3',3a,3'a,7a,7'a-e) -2,2'-methylenebis[1-methyl-1H-inden-1-yl]}zirconium ( [ ClZr 2(2') ] ) / MAO to polyethylene waxes ( average degree of polymerization ca. <nUm> ) , which are terminated almost exclusively by ethenyl end groups . polyethylene with a high molecular mass could be obtained by increasing the size of the 1-alkyl substituent . 
coordinations of conjugated 1,3-dienes to a transition metal had been considered to occur only in a s-cis geometry , until the recent discovery of cp <nUm> zr(s-trans-diene) , diene = butadiene and trans , trans-1,4-diphenylbutadiene . A molecular orbital analysis of metal-butadiene interactions is carried out , for the specific cases of CFeO <nUm> ( butadiene ) and cp <nUm> zr(butadiene) , to discern the electronic origin of the novel transoid geometry . stability of the s-cis and s-trans structures of cp <nUm> zr(butadiene) is found to be well balanced and we show how the geometrical choice is affected by substitution on butadiene .

A novel 11C-C bond formation based on the palladium - mediated cross-coupling reaction of alkenylzirconocenes with [11C]methyl iodide is described . the conversion of internal alkynes into the corresponding alkenylzirconocenes followed by transmetalation with Pd(PPh3) <nUm> and subsequent cross-coupling with [11C]methyl iodide gave several 11C - labelled a,a'-dimethyl-substituted alkenes . the palladium complex Pd(PPh3)4 proved to be superior to Pt(PPh3)4 or Ni(PPh3)4 as transition metal complex . the scope and limitations of the novel palladium - mediated cross-coupling reaction of alkenylzirconocenes with [ 11C]methyl iodide were tested with various internal alkynes . after heating at <nUm> ° C for <nUm> min radiochemical yields of up to <nUm> % ( based upon [11C]methyl iodide ) could be achieved . 
[14C]Formaldehyde was synthesized by reducing 14CO2 at ambient temperature with schwartz 's reagent . the [14C]formaldehyde was then used in the radiosynthesis of high specific activity ( <nUm> GBq / mmol ) [14C]hydrochlorothiazide via cyclization of 4-amino-5-chloro-1,3-benzenedisulfonamide . A synthesis of [ 14C]formaldehyde by reducing 14CO2 at ambient temperature with schwartz 's reagent is described . the [14C] formaldehyde has been applied in the radiosynthesis of high specific activity ( <nUm> GBq / mmol ) [14C]hydrochlorothiazide via cyclization of 4-amino-5-chloro-1,3-benzenedisulfonamide . 
several types of SiO2-supported metallocene catalysts were prepared using chemically modified silica gel . polymerization of propene was conducted with these catalysts combined with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or ordinary alkylaluminiums . highly isotactic poly(propylene) with high molecular weight was obtained by the catalysts whose zirconocene ligands were chemically immobilized on O2Si . the preparative methods of these catalysts and the results of propene polymerization , together with the analytical data of produced polymers , are reported in some detail . 
methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) was polymerized with Cp2ZrCl2 / methylalyminoxane or Cp2M(CH3)2 ( m : Zr , Hf ; cp = cyclopentadienyl ) combined with BC18F15 ( 1 ) or Ph3CB(C6F5)4 ( 2 ) , ( ph = phenyl ) . in the presence of a lewis acid like C4H10Zn with slow inititation , which gave syndiotactic-rich poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) with high molecular weight . the polymer yield increases with polymerization time , which indicates that the propagation rate is zero order in concentration of monomer . the polymer yield increases also with concentration of Cp2Zr(CH3)2.2 , which indicates the zirconocene to be the real catalyst . the polymer yield and the initiation efficiency ( N / [Zr] ) increase with the concentration of C4H10Zn , which indicates C4H10Zn , to be involved in the initiation . it is also shown that the propagation reaction is independent of the concentration of C4H10Zn . 
methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) was reacted with a small quantity of p-hydroquinone to obtain a modified MAO insoluble in toluene . ethylene and propylene homo- and copolymerization were conducted with zirconocene using the modified MAO as cocatalyst both in the presence and absence of triisobutylaluminium . it was found that the modified MAO alone can not activate the zirconocene catalyst , whereas polymers with high molecular weights are obtained when combined with triisobutylaluminium . the catalytic activity is markedly dependent on the mole ratio of p-hydroquinone to MAO as well as the amount of triisobutylaluminium . 
olefin polymerizations were conducted with novel multimetallic zirconocene catalyst systems : R-CpCpZrCl2 ( 1 ) ( r = dimethylsilylferrocene ; cp = cyclopentadienyl ) and (R-Cp)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) in combination with methylaluminoxane or tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borates . In ethylene polymerization , the maximum catalyst activity was observed at a lower temperature ( 30-45 ° C ) when using complex <nUm> or <nUm> , compared with Cp2ZrCl2 . it was also revealed that complex <nUm> is a more effective catalyst than Cp2ZrCl2 for copolymerization of ethylene and propene . 
polysiloxanes with bisindenyl , bisfluorenyl , and bis(1,2,3,4-tetramethyl)cyclopentadienyl side groups were synthesized by condensation of the corresponding dichlorosilane compounds and water to obtain supported zirconocene catalysts . the polymerization of ethene was conducted over these catalysts combined with methylalumoxane . the polymerization activity depends markedly upon the substituents and decreases in the order : bisindenyl ≫ bisfluorenyl ≫ bis(1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadienyl) . all the supported catalysts give linear polyethene with fairly high molecular weights . the catalyst with bisindenyl groups was found to be composed of a toluene - soluble and a toluene - insoluble fraction . the polymerization profile ( activity versus time curve ) was analyzed with the toluene - soluble and -insoluble fraction as well as the corresponding homogeneous system . the homogeneous system , which exerts the highest activity in the initial phase , was completely deactivated after several hours whereas the activity of the supported catalyst , especially of the toluene - insoluble fraction , was unchanged during <nUm> h even at <nUm> ° C . polysiloxanes with different content of bisindenyl groups were also synthesized via the co-condensation with dimethyldichlorosilane and applied as the carrier . however , the activity per Zr atom decreases remarkably with an increase in dimethylsilane units . 
1-Butene polyinsertion promoted by two typical C2 - symmetric zirconocene catalysts ( i.e. rac-ethylenebis(1-indenyl)ZrCl2 ( 1 ) and rac-dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl)ZrCl2 ) ( 2 ) was investigated under both hydrooligomerization and polymerization conditions and compared with that of propene . it was found that , in spite of a similar regiospecificity for the two monomers , the fraction of " dormant " sites is higher in 1-butene polymerization , as a result of a ( much ) lower reactivity of a <nUm> last - inserted unit . accordingly , in the investigated cases , <nUm> units of 1-butene were not incorporated in the growing chains but either isomerized to <nUm> units or remained at the chain end until they underwent chain transfer via b-hydrogen elimination . experimental evidence is also presented of an epimerization reaction of the growing poly(1-butene) chain with a <nUm> last - inserted unit , leading to a decrease of polymer stereoregularity with decreasing monomer concentration . 
living cationic ring - opening polymerization of e-caprolactone ( CL ) , d-valerolactone ( VL ) and 1,3-dioxepane-2-one ( 6 ) was achieved at room temperature by using zirconocene borate complex catalysts . respective block copolymerization of CL with VL or with cyclic carbonate <nUm> was also successfully performed . the mechanism of the present cationic living polymerization is discussed . 
A supported version of zirconocene catalysts on siloxane copolymers having 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp'')-fluorenyl ( flu ) ( I ) or cyclopentadienyl (Cp)-fluorenyl ( II ) groups as substituents was prepared and applied to propene polymerization using methylalumoxane ( MAO ) or [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] as cocatalyst . catalyst ( I ) , which was soluble in toluene , exhibited very low activity , whereas catalyst ( II ) , which was composed of a toluene soluble ( Cat-A ) and an insoluble fraction ( Cat-B ) , displayed a fairly high activity . both catalysts ( A and B ) give a mixture of syndiotactic , atactic and a small quantity of isotactic polypropene , with a fraction of syndiotactic pentads ranging from about 50-75 % . In contrast , the corresponding non-supported catalyst gives almost completely atactic polypropene . 
the interaction of supported metallocene catalysts with methylaluminoxane leads to the desorption of the metallocene compound from the surface of the support and the formation of highly active homogeneous complexes . the catalytic properties of the system and characteristics of polyethylene formed are determined by these species . 
the Zr surface loading from Cp2ZrCl2 toluene solutions on different kinds of commercial silicas ( grace <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> ) was determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry . In all silicas , a saturation trend was observed with increasing amount of metal in the initial solution , the largest Zr loading value ( <nUm> wt.- % ) being observed for silica grace <nUm> . solid surface areas were determined by the BET method before and after metallocene immobilization , revealing that the values do not change after zirconocene impregnation . two different kinds of cocatalyst were used , methylaluminoxane and trimethylaluminium . the aluminium loading on silica grace <nUm> was determined using the 27Al(p,g)28Si nuclear reaction and titrometry , both showing that methylaluminoxane leads to an ' Al grafting ' four times more efficient than does trimethylaluminium . finally , the catalytic activity of these systems was tested in the polymerization of ethylene . the supported catalysts were shown to be active , specially using the low cost trimethylaluminium as a cocatalyst . the polymers obtained with the supported systems exhibited a higher molecular weight than those obtained with the homogeneous system . 
the influence of perfluoroborate anions on catalyst activity and stereospecificity has been determined for propone polymerisations at 20-60 ° C . for C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes , activities were strongly ligand - dependent , with systems activated by TIBA / Ph3C +X- , where TIBA = AliBu3 , x = {Z[B(C6F5)3]2} , and z = CN or H2N , giving significantly higher activities than methylaluminoxane under comparable conditions . for high - activity catalysts at <nUm> ° C , { H 2N[B(C6F5)3]2 } - proved superior to { CN[B-(C6F5) 3]2}- , presumably due to the higher thermal stability of the amidoborate . the influence of counteranions on PP stereospecificity for these catalysts is negligible . on the other hand , the conformationally flexible catalyst , (2-PhIHd)2Zr-Cl <nUm> / TIBA / Ph3C+X- , shows not only a strong anion dependence of its activity , but also significant variation in poly(propylene) isotacticity , mainly due to the formation of small fractions of highly isotactic ( mmmm > <nUm> % ) PP . this effect was particularly pronounced for {CN[B(C6F5)3]2}- and the dianion , {Ni[CNB(C6F5)3]4} 2- . 
the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) in the presence of the neutral chloro zirconocene enolates , Cp2ZrCl[OC(OMe) = CMe2 ] ( 1 ) , Me4C2(Cp)2 ZrCl[OC(OMe) = CMe2 ] ( 2 ) , and Me2C(Cp)2ZrCl[OC ( OMe ) = CMe2 ] ( 3 ) , was investigated . none of these compounds is catalytically active on its own . they could be activated by adding Ph3CB(C6F5) <nUm> ( 4 ) ; however , only if the initial concentration of enolate is higher than that of the perfluorated phenyl borate . polymers were produced with a number average molar mass of up to <nUm> <nUm> g / mol and a dispersion index of <nUm> - <nUm> with mixtures comprising <nUm> and <nUm> or <nUm> and <nUm> . the degree of polymerization depends only on the quantity of excess enolate and not on the absolute concentration of the initiator components . In contrast , a mixture of <nUm> and <nUm> was not very active . kinetic modeling of the systems as well as NMR spectroscopic investigations indicate that a bimetallic mechanism can describe chain growth . the activity of these catalytic systems depends on the structure of the ligand . the two zirconocenes with bridged cyclopentadienyl ligands , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , convert MMA considerably slower . In addition to the methyl zirconocene enolates with unbridged cyclopentadienyl ligands , the corresponding chloro zirconocene enolates are also suitable for the polymerization of MMA . the latter compounds offer the advantage that preparations for the production of the initiators are comparatively simple . 
propene polymerisation was conducted with three ansa - zirconocene complexed : Me2Si(2-Me-4-PhInd)2-ZrCl2 ( A ) , me 2Si(2-Me-4-PhInd)2ZrClNMe2 ( B ) and me 2Si-(2-Me-4-PhInd)2ZrClNEt2 ( C ) . methylalumoxane ( MAO ) or [HNPhMe2][B(C6F5) <nUm> ] was used as cocatalyst . the influence of cocatalysts and trisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) on polymerisation activity , molecular weight and polymer microstructure was studied . furthermore , the alkylation and activation of the complexes were examined using UV / VIS spectroscopy . complex A was the most active in polymerisation , but polymers produced by B and C had in general higher molecular weights . replacing MAO partially by TIBA increased the molecular weight and prevented catalyst deactivation . according to the UV / VIS measurements , all complexes have low reactivity towards TMA and TIBA . similar cationic species were formed of all three studied zirconocenes in the reaction with MAO . additional TIBA did not affect the type of active species formed in the reaction of zirconocene and MAO , but increased the activity of B and C . 
coplymers of propene and higher 1-olefins ( 1-butene , 1-pentene , 1-hexene , 1-heptene , 1-octene , and 4-methyl-1-pentene ( 4M1P ) ) , prepared with rac-Et(Ind)2-ZrCl2 ( EI ) and rac-Me 2Si(2-MeBenz-[e]Ind)2ZrCl2 ( MBI ) , were comprehensively analyzed by 13C NMR spectroscopy . these catalysts known to produce isotactic polypropene lead to two vastly different families of copolymers produced with EI possessed comparable isotacticities as well as similar stereosequences . furthermore , these copolymers did not significantly differ from those of the reference propene homopolymer . however , the copolymers produced with MBI significantly differed both from the reference propene homopolymer and among themselves . In fact , in contrast to the corresponding highly isotactic homopolymer , the whole series of copolymers was characterized by rather low isotacticities . the degree of tacticity was strongly influenced by the comonomer type . A detailed 13C NMR analysis revealed that these copolymers are constituted by highly isotactic sequences and by atactic sequencies of various lengths . it is proposed that the formation of atactic sequences is triggered by the insertion of a comonomer . it seems likely that MBI can shift from a stereoselective to a non-stereoselective state due to an interaction with higher linear or branched comonomer . 
copolymers of ethylene ( e ) with norbornene ( N ) were synthesized using the catalysts rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO ( 1 ) , <nUm> % rac / <nUm> % meso-Et(4,7-Me2Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO ( 2 ) , and rac-H2C(3-t-BuInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO ( 3 ) . catalyst activity , molar mass ( MM ) , and copolymer composition were studied as a function of time . the polymers showed an unusually narrow molar mass distribution ( MMD ) and a significant increase of their MM with time for up to one hour , suggesting a " quasi-living " polymerization at <nUm> ° C . the experimental data were fitted to kinetic equations and the propagation and transfer reactions were described in quantitative terms . norbornene greatly depressed the propagation rate , along with the chain transfer rate . the more sterically hindered catalysts of the series showed lower propagation and chain transfer turnover frequency than <nUm> and yielded polymers with a low ( 2 ) to very low ( 3 ) norbornene content . the presence of norbornene in solution seemed to be one of the main factors responsible for the observed " quasi-living " character of the copolymerization , probably due to coordination of norbornene to the active site . time - resolved kinetic studies also allowed for the calculation of the fraction of active metal centers , ranging from <nUm> % ( 3 ) and 66-68 % ( 1 ) to <nUm> % ( 2 ) of the total zirconium present , depending on catalyst structure . 
UV - vis spectroscopic study revealed that vinyl-cyclohexane interaction with zirconocene catalyst is enhanced on light exposure . if oxygen is present it interacts with the catalyst , hindering vinylcyclohexane interaction and consequently lowering the catalyst activity . the catalyst activity can be recovered with light exposure if low O concentrations are used since in light the zirconocene-vinylcyclohexane interaction is favoured over the zirconocene-O2 interaction . moreover , 1H NMR studies of the reaction products showed that the structures of the vinylcyclohexane - based species produced with light irradiation were identical to the species produced in dark . this indicates that light exposure of the catalytic system does not change the reaction mechanism . 
the origin of the syndiotactic selectivity in propene polymerization of a typical bridged fluorenyl-amido catalyst , namely [Me2Si(3,6-di-tert-butyl-9-fluorenyl)(Ntert-buty]) ] Cl2Ti ( 1 ) , activated with methylaluminoxane or [HMe2N(C6H5)][B(C6 F5)4 ] / al(i-butyl)3 , was investigated by means of <nUm> MHz 13C NMR spectroscopic microstructural polymer analysis . the asymmetric induction was traced unambiguously to enantiotopic - sites control . compared with the better - known cyclopentadienyl-fluorenyl ansa - zirconocenes , <nUm> turned out to be almost identically enantioselective ( in agreement with computer modeling ) , but less stereoselective because of a higher propensity to undergo site epimerization . this results in a chain microstructure with large predominance of m over mm stereodefects , deceptively similar to that of syndiotactic poly(propylene) produced under chain - end control . 
the synthesis of C1 - symmetric zirconocene complexes bearing the 2,5-dimethyl-7H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:4,3-b']dithiophene ligand ( S 2-3 ) linked to substituted cyclopentadienes is described . different syntheses of S2-3 , the common intermediate for the preparation of these complexes , are discussed . many of these complexes have been found to be highly active in propylene polymerization , to require very low amounts of methylalumoxane to be activated , and to produce poly(propylene)s of low isotacticity and melting points . 13C NMR analysis shows that the poly(propylene)s are fully regioregular and that the stereoerrors are randomly distributed , as shown by the enantiomorphic - site triad test e ≈ <nUm> . the experimental pentad distribution was fitted using a two - site model with different probability parameters for each site . the probability of chain back - skip was also taken into account . the molecular weight and crystallinity of the poly(propylene)s are dependent upon the type of substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ring , and the correlation between mmmm content and melting point of the PP confirms the random distribution of stereoerrors . 
sixteen C1 - symmetric zirconocene and one hafnocene complexes bearing the 2,5-R2-7H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:4,3-b']dithiophene ligand ( r = H , me , et , ph ) linked to a substituted indenyl ligand have been synthesized and tested in propylene polymerization . most of the C 1-symmetric zirconocenes of this type are highly active in propylene polymerization at low MAO / Zr ratios and produce poly(propylene)s ( PP ) in a broad range of isotacticity and melting points . the molecular weight and crystallinity of the PPs are strongly dependent upon the type of substituents on the indenyl moiety : PPs with Tm between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C and viscosity average molecular weights between <nUm> <nUm> and <nUm> <nUm> have been obtained at 50-70 ° C in liquid propylene . 
copolymerizations of ethylene and disubstituted diallylsilanes ( CH <nUm> = CH-CH2)2R2Si ( r = CH3 , C6H5 ) have been investigated with various zirconocene catalysts using methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst . the bridged stereospecific catalysts showed a higher reactivity for disubstituted diallylsilanes than the non-bridged aspecific catalysts , disubstituted diallylsilanes were incorporated into the polymer chain via cyclization insertion preferentially , and formed 3,5-disubstituted silacyclohexane units in the polyethylene main chain . A zirconocene catalyst , dimethylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride , produced a copolymer containing pendant ullyl groups derived from the 1,2-insertion of diallyldiphenylsilane without cyclization . 
we have confirmed that water- and pentafluorophenol - modified isobutylmethylaluminoxane ( W / PM - MMAO ) enhances the productivity and stereoregularity of the yielded polymer and increases its molecular weight when propylene is polymerized using C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes . 13C NMR analysis shows that when W / PM - MMAO is used as a cocatalyst with C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes , although the pentad peaks of the stereoerrors derived from enantiofacial misinsertion have still existed ; those derived from the epimerization of the growing chain end that occurred with b-hydride elimination disappear . therefore , we propose that W / PM - MMAO interacts more strongly to the cationic metal center of metallocene than does MMAO owing to steric and electronic effect , and W / PM - MMAO suppresses b-hydride elimination , resulting in the production of polypropylene with higher molecular weight and isotacticity . to the contrary , there was no significant difference in the structure of the yielded polymer when W / PM - MMAO was used with Cs - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes . In the case of C s-symmetric ansa - zirconocene , the stereoerror is mostly the result of monomer insertion error , and small amount of stereoerror caused by " skipped " insertion , not from the epimerization of the polymer chain end that occurs after b-hydride elimination ; therefore , there might not be any difference of the microstructure of yielded polymers between MMAO and W / PM - MMAO . it can be concluded that the both cases of C2- and C s-symmetric ansa - zirconocenes are used as a catalyst , and water and phenol modification of MMAO does not affect the monomer misinsertion which is one of the mechanisms of the stereoerrors . 
propylene was polymerised at varying trimethyl-aluminium ( TMA ) concentration with two metallocenes activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) in an attempt to better understand the effect of TMA on the activation process , catalyst activity and termination reactions . A chemical treatment of MAO solution with 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol was used to obtain TMA - free polymerisation conditions . the metallocene precursors under investigation were diphenyl-methyl(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) and rac-dimethylsilylbis(4-tert-butyl-2-methyl-cyclo-pentadienyl)zirconium dichloride ( 2 ) . chain transfer to aluminium was the dominating termination route for <nUm> / MAO accompanied with b-H / b-CH3 transfer to Zr and b-H transfer to monomer . it was found that b-H / b-CH3 transfer to Zr was favoured over the b-H transfer to monomer at elevated temperatures , and that polymerisation and b-H transfer to monomer depended on the same critical reaction . for <nUm> / MAO the detected termination routes were b-H transfer to Zr and chain transfer to aluminium . A strong activity dependency on TMA concentration was observed . with <nUm> / MAO high TMA concentration decreased and stabilised the activity , whereas TMA free polymerisation conditions at <nUm> ° C increased markedly the activity , indicating that TMA coordinated to the active site of <nUm> / MAO . surprisingly , with more sterically hindered <nUm> / MAO , high TMA concentration increased the activity and nearly complete activity loss occurred at TMA - free polymerisation conditions at <nUm> ° C . 
Rac-[CH2(2,4-di-tert-butyl-cyclopentadienyl)2]- Cl2Zr ( 1 ) , rac-[CH2(3-tert-butyl-4,5,6,7- tetrahydroindenyl)2]-ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , rac - [ CH 2(3-isopropyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)2]-ZrCl <nUm> ( 3 ) , and rac-[CH2(3-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl) 2]ZrCl2 ( 4 ) were synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR analysis . these C2 symmetric ansa - zirconocenes , activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , were able to promote copolymerization of ethene and 1,3-butadiene . the structures of the copolymers are strongly influenced by zirconocene utilized as catalytic precursor . depending on the reaction conditions polyethenes containing cyclopropane and cyclopentane rings , or 1,1- 1,3-butadiene inserted constitutional units , were obtained . 
reactions of <nUm> and <nUm> with MAO and MMAO were monitored by EPR . it was found that MMAO is a stronger reducing agent than MAO . <nUm> is more prone to reduction than <nUm> . the reduction of IVZr to ZrIII seems to be the essential pathway of some zirconocene catalysts ' deactivation . ZrIII species with the following proposed structures can be identified in the <nUm> / MMAO system : (2-PhInd)2ZrIII(iBu) , ( 2-PhInd ) 2ZrIII(m-Cl)2AliBu2 , (2-PhInd)2ZrIII(m-Cl)(iBu)Al iBu2 , and [(2-PhInd)2ZrIII] +[Me-MAO]- . the degree of reduction of IVZr species determined by EPR in the catalytic system <nUm> / MMAO can be masked by the formation of diamagnetic ZrIIIVZrIII dimers . addition of monomers to the <nUm> / MAO system promotes reduction ot the zirconium species . 
reactive species in O2Si - supported , zirconocene - based olefin - polymerization catalysts have been characterized by comparison of their UV - vis spectra with those of related , NMR - spectroscopically identified catalyst species in homogeneous solution . neutral zirconocene dihydride complexes are found to arise in hydrocarbon solutions as well as on O2Si supports when catalyst systems that contain rac-Me2Si(ind) 2ZrCl2 and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) are modified by addition of diisobutylaluminum hydride or triisobutylaluminum . these complexes , tentatively formulated as adducts with lewis-acidic alkylaluminum species AlR2X , racMe2Si(ind)2ZrH2 *{nAlR2X} , are reconverted into the initial reactive zirconocene cations upon addition of isobutene to these reaction systems . 

nano-polyethylene fibers and floccules were prepared under atmospheric pressure via ethylene extrusion polymerization in suit , using the SBA-15 - supported Cp2ZrCl2 catalytic system . the major morphology units in the samples were fibers and floccules . the diameter of the single nano-fibers was 120-200 nm . the single nano-fibers could aggregate to form fiber aggregates and bundles . the number of PE floccules increased with extension of polymerization time , while the melting point of PE with nano-fibers was little higher than that of common polyethylene .

the use of ultraviolet / visible spectroscopy ( UV-Vis ) for the prediction of metallocene catalyst potential for the polymerisation of olefins is described . upon addition of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) to rac-[C2H4(1-indenyl)2ZrCl2] ( [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> ) the ligand-to-metal charge transfer band shows a hypsochromic shift while a bathochromic shift is observed when more MAO is added ( [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> ) . these shifts can be explained by assuming that methylation of the zirconocene by MAO occurs in the case of [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> while a cationic complex , the active catalytic system , is formed upon addition of more MAO , e.g. , [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> . 
A series of tert-butyl substituted zirconocene / methylaluminoxane catalysts illustrates the potential for the tailoring of olefin oligomers with extremely narrow molar mass distributions , which are explained on the basis of a chain-length dependent propagation rate . comparative oligomerization experiments provide a means to estimate the relative rates for chain propagation versus chain transfer as well as a correlation with the metallocene structure . 
three kinds of zirconocene catalysts , supported on polysiloxanes substituted with methylindenyl , methyl-fluorenyl and two indenyl groups , respectively , were prepared and applied to propene and ethylene polymerizations using methylaluminoxane as cocatalyst . both the activity and stereospecificity of these catalysts were found to lie between those of corresponding homogeneous and SiO2-supported catalysts . surprisingly , all the catalysts gave a mixture of atactic and isotactic poly(propylene) , plausible reasons for which are briefly discussed . 
ethylene was polymerized in toluene using methylalumoxane ( MAO ) activated rac-(Me2SiOSiMe2)[Ind]2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) and rac-(Me2SiOSiMe2)[IndH4]2MtCl <nUm> ( Mt = Zr ( 2 ) ; Mt = Ti ( 3 ) ) . all three catalyst systems polymerize ethylene with high activity . the molecular weight of polymer produced with zirconocene ( 1 ) was up to a weight - average molecular weight mw = <nUm> × <nUm> at low polymerization temperature ( < <nUm> ° C ) under atmospheric pressure . the titanocene catalyst <nUm> shows lower activity and produced lower molecular weight polyethylene than zirconocenes <nUm> and <nUm> . replacement of aromatic rings in <nUm> by cyclohexane rings , leading to <nUm> , increases activity and reduces molecular weight . the catalyst systems show a dependency of the activity on temperature . 
the disiloxane - bridged zirconocene complexes , tetramethyldisiloxanediylbis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride and tetramethyldisiloxanediylbis(cyclopentadienyl)dimethylzirconium initiate the homopolymerization of ethene as well as the copolymerization of ethene and a-olefin with a modified methylaluminoxane as cocatalyst . the catalyst systems give resonable activity but the molecular weight of polyethene decreases drastically with increasing polymerization temperature . 
In the polymerization of ethene cocatalyzed with modified methylaluminoxane , the catalyst activities of the siloxane - bridged dinuclear zirconocenes , tetramethyldisiloxanediylbis(cyclopentadienylindenylzirconium dichloride ) ( 3 ) and hexamethyltrisiloxanediylbis(cyclopentadienylindenylzirconium dichloride ) ( 4 ) were lower than that obtained with the siloxane - bridged mononuclear zirconocene , tetramethyldisiloxanediyldicyclopentadienyldimethylzirconium ( 1 ) . on the other hand , weight - average molecular weight mw and ratio of weight- to number - average molecular weights mw / mn of polyethene ( PE ) obtained with <nUm> or <nUm> were higher than those of PE obtained with <nUm> . for a binary mixture of <nUm> / <nUm> or <nUm> / <nUm> , it was found that the obtained PE exhibits a bimodal molecular weight distribution for an appropriate composition of the mixed zirconocenes . mw / mn of PE could be adjusted by changing the relative concentrations of the two zirconocenes . 
new supported catalysts on the basis of cyclopentadienylindenylzirconium dichloride ( CpIndZrCl2 ) anchored on silica with a trisiloxane spacer ( ZATS ) and a pentamethylene spacer ( ZAPM ) were prepared and used for ethylene polymerization with modified methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst . ZATS and ZAPM produce polyethylene with lower molecular weight but show higher activity than silica - supported CpIndZrCl2 which was prepared by reacting zirconocene directly with silica , i.e. , the activity of silica - supported CpIndZrCl2 is enhanced by introducing a spacer between silica surface and metallocene species . 
ethylene-propene copolymerization was carried out with Cp2MCl2 ( cp = cyclopentadienyl ) , rac-Et(Ind)2MCl2 , rac-Me2Si(Ind)2MCl2 ( et = ethylene , Me2Si = dimethylsilyl , ind = indenyl , m = Zr or Hf ) / methylaluminoxane . In the case of using ansa - hafnocenes , the minimum molecular size ( extended chain length ) of ethylene-propene copolymer was obtained at about <nUm> mol- % of propene content in the copolymer . the polymerization activity decreased with increase of propene feed ratio in non-bridged non-specific metallocenes . higher polymerization activities were observed for the copolymerization compared to ethylene and propene homo-polymerization with ansa - isospecific metallocenes . the factor of molecular size lowering was studied by the chain propagation and chain transfer reaction . 
copolymerizations of propene and buta-1,3-diene performed in the presence of rac-[CH2(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2] Cl2Zr and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) have been investigated . buta-1,3-diene gives prevailingly primary coordination to the metal , producing overall <nUm> units . cyclopropane and cyclopentane rings , although in low amounts , are also obtained . the presence of butadiene would be responsible for some regioirregular 2,1-inserted propene units , which at high temperatures give rearrangement to <nUm> units . 
propylene was copolymerized with 1,4-divinylbenzene ( 1,4-DVB ) using rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2ZrCl2 and MAO in the presence of hydrogen . 1H NMR spectra of the obtained copolymer confirmed the successful incorporation of 1,4-DVB . 13C NMR analysis revealed a unique copolymer structure with the incorporated 1,4-DVB units predominantly forming 1,4-substituted phenyl repeating units in the polymer main chain . A plausible mechanism involving spontaneous insertion of terminal styryl into Zr-H species was proposed to rationalize the unique incorporation of 1,4-DVB . 
norbomene ( NB ) was oligomerized at <nUm> ° C using AlEt2Cl- Cl4Ti at a monomer / titanium molar ratio of about <nUm> . the oligomerization product consists of a fraction soluble in diethyl ether , amorphous by x-ray examination , and of a crystalline fraction , insoluble in diethyl ether . the crystalline fraction was shown by powder x-ray diffraction to consist of a NB heptamer . single - crystal x-ray analysis indicated that the heptamer had a stereoregular 2,3-exo-disyndiotactic structure . the heptamer , adopts a strained , highly irregular , folded conformation in the crystalline state . structural differences with respect in NB oligomers obtained with zirconocene catalysts are discussed . 
the ability of a Cl2Mg support to activate a transition metal catalyst has been found to depend both on the crystallographic structure of the support and on the nature of the catalyst . A high degree of crystallographic disorder can be very effective for the immobilization and activation of titanium and vanadium complexes , but is not necessarily effective for zirconocene activation . A highly disordered support prepared by the reaction of MgBu <nUm> with ClH gave high activity with Cl4Ti but low activity with (n-PrCp)2ZrCl2 . high polymerization activities with the zirconocene were only obtained with supports of type ClMg <nUm> / AlRn(OEt)3-n prepared from the reaction of AlR3 with Cl2Mg · 1.1EtOH . these supports are characterized by additional peaks in the x-ray diffraction pattern , indicating the presence of a crystalline structure which is absent in the other supports and contains highly lewis acidic sites able to generate the active metallocenium species . 
catalytic natures of organometallic catalysts are modulated by coordinating organic ligands with proper steric and electronic properties to metal centers . carbon - based nanomaterials such as graphene nanoplatelets are used with and without N - doping and multiwalled carbon nanotube as a ligand for ethylene polymerizations . zirconocenes or titanocenes are immobilized on such nanomaterials . polyethylenes ( EsP ) produced by such hybrids show a great increase in molecular weight relative to those produced by free catalysts . specially , ultra-high-molecular-weight EsP are produced from the polymerizations at low temperature using the hybrid with N - doped graphene nanoplatelets . this result shows that such nanomaterials act a crucial role to tune the catalytic natures of metallocenes . 
hydrozirconation on vinyl-terminated substrates ( silicon wafer and nanosilica sphere ) is employed as an efficient way for immobilization of zirconocene catalyst through Zr-C bonds , which is applied in surface coordination ethylene polymerization producing surface - tethered polyethylene ( PE ) . the formation of Zr-C σ bond induced by hydrozirconation provides an initiator precursor for growing a layer of PE covalently linked onto substrates . the results from SEM , AFM , and TEM show that the surface polymerization is controlled by hydrozirconation . surface pattern or core - shell structure with crystalline PE coating can be formed , when silicon wafer is selectively functionalized with vinyl-groups or vinyl-modified nanosilica is applied . it is believed that hydrozirconation for the synthesis of zirconocene initiator can be a versatile route to prepare polyolefin hybrid materials . 

the homogeneous Ziegler-Natta – catalysts , consisting of a zirconocene compound and methyl-aluminoxane , lead to extremely high polymerization activities . with bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride pure atactic polypropylene and polyethylene with activities up to <nUm> g PE / g zr*h are formed . the higher the degree of oligomerization of the aluminoxane the more active are the catalysts . the density of polyethylene ( LLDPE ) can be lowered by using 1-butene or 1-hexene as comonomers . incorporation of dienes gives EPDM-elastomers . highly isotactic polypropylene can be prepared by using chiral rac-ethylene bis – ( tetrahydroindenyl ) zirconium dichloride together with methylaluminoxane as cocatalyst . the toluene soluble part here consists of less than <nUm> weight percent . after resolution of this racemate it is also possible to produce optically active polypropylene and polybutene . 
with homogenous catalysts on the basis of chiral metallocenes and methylaluminoxane it has become possible to polymerize cyclic olefins like cyclobutene , cyclopentene or norbornene . No ring opening reaction occurs . the crystalline polycycloalkenes show extremly high melting points between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C . copolymers of cyclopentene with propene are amorphous . they have a low molecular weight and glass transition point . on the other hand the glass transition temperature of norbornene / ethene copolymers exceeds <nUm> ° C . these copolymers could be used as materials for optical discs and fibers . 
zirconocene complexes carrying substituents at various positions of their ring-bridged ligand frameworks were studied as catalysts for methylalumoxane-activated propene polymerization . effects of different substitution patterns on catalyst activities and on chain lengths and stereo- and regio-regularities of the polymers produced are correlated with geometrical features of the complexes , e.g. with parameters describing their structural rigidity or the aperture and obliquity of their coordination gaps . 
rac-Ethylenebis(1-e5-indenyl)dimethylzirconium ( 1 ) was reacted with triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( 2 ) to produce in situ the rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)methylzirconium cation ( 3 ) . this aluminium-free catalyst showed propene polymerization activity ( A ) and stereoselectivity which both increase with the decrease of polymerization temperature ( tp ) . At very low tp , <nUm> behaved as a “ single-site ” catalyst . an efficient way to produce such cation is to react ansa-zirconocene dichloride with <nUm> in the presence of TEA ( = triethylaluminium ) . A superior cationic catalyst was obtained from rac-dimethylsilylenebis(1-e5-indenyl)dichlorozirconium , <nUm> , and TEA , which polymerizes propene at − <nUm> ° C(-55 ° C ) with activity of <nUm> × <nUm> ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) g polypropene per ( mol Zr η mol CH2 η h ) to polypropenes which are <nUm> % ( <nUm> % ) isotactic with melting temperature Tm = <nUm> ° C ( <nUm> ° C ) and viscosity-average molecular weight mv = <nUm> × <nUm> ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) . the addition of methylaluminoxane lowers the A of the cationic catalyst especially at low tp . rigorously speaking , the cation derived from <nUm> or <nUm> behaves as a “ single site ” catalyst only at very low tp . the use of TEA significantly and unexpectedly enhances the efficiency of the zirconocenium catalyst system . 
through polymerizing propene by means of the catalyst system iPr[3-MeCpFlu]ZrCl2 / MAO it was possible for the first time to generate hemiisotactic poly(propylene) ; the microstructure of this polymer is characterized by an alternating sequence of monomer units with equal and statistical configuration . iPr[3-MeCpFlu]ZrCl2 is one of the new developed stereorigid ansa-metallocene catalysts which by means of the structure of the bridged e-ligand system are considered to give access to the description and calculation of the behaviour of the stereospecifity . In the present paper the a-olefin polymerization was investigated with the iPr[3-MeCpFlu]ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst system by means of kinetics and product analytics ; parameter were the [Al] : [Zr] ratio , the monomer concentration , the polymerization temperature , the polarity of the solvent as well as the chain length of the starting a-olefin . the order of the polymerization reaction concerning the propene concentration was found to be <nUm> ; this broken order indicates a complex reaction . concerning the dependency of the polymerization rate on the [Al] : [Zr] ratio a bell-shaped curve was found ; obviously , at very high [Al] : [Zr] ratios the complex MAO compound inhibits the active zirconocene centre . the microstructure of the poly(propylene)s generated in toluene at <nUm> ° C corresponds with the expected hemiisotactic structure . on the contrary , the microstructure of the poly(propylene)s generated in toluene at higher polymerization temperatures and in the polar solvents o-dichlorobenzene and methylene chloride at <nUm> ° C shows considerable deviations from a hemiisotactic structure . under these polymerization conditions the stereospecifity of the iPr[3-MeCpFlu]ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst can only be satisfyingly explained with isomerization reactions of the active zirconocene species between two insertion steps . these isomerization reactions without monomer coordination occur preferably starting from the unstereospecific state of the catalyst . this interpretation is confirmed by 1-butene and 1-hexene polymerization experiments . 
the polymerization kinetics of propene polymerization using metallocene / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) homogeneous catalysts have been investigated to explore the role of donor / acceptor interactions and to enhance the catalyst productivities . In the case of the non-stereospecific Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO model system it has been demonstrated that , in addition to the well known irreversible deactivation , reversible deactivations , which are second order relative to the zirconium active site concentration , account for the decay of the polymerization rate . while MAO injection during polymerization enhances the polymerization rate , zirconocene addition deactivates the catalyst which can be reactivated by injecting additional MAO . A sequence of dynamic equilibria involving the formation of active cationic metallocene intermediates as well as inactive zirconocene species , e.g. , zirconocene dimers , is proposed . lewis base and lewis acid additives have been added as probes to examine the role of such equilibria in the case of metallocene-based catalyst systems such as MAO-activated Cp2ZrCl2 , racemic ethylenebisindenyl zirconium dichloride ( EBIZrCl2 ) , and racemic ethylenebis ( 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl ) zirconium dichloride ( EBTHIZrCl2 ) . while the conventional donors such as 2,6-ditert.butyl-4-methylphenol ( BHT ) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine ( TMP ) reduce catalyst productivities , even at very low donor / Al molar ratios , increasing propene concentration and addition of trimethylboroxine ( TMB ) substantially enhance catalyst productivities and affect molecular weights of the polypropylene produced with metallocene / MAO catalysts . 
Me2C[1-Cp-9-Flu]ZrCl2 derivatives with H- , CH3-and (CH3)3C- substituents β to the cp bridgehead carbon atom as well as complexes having mono- or di-substituted fluorenyl ligands ( r = CH3- , (CH3)3C- , CH3O- , CH3OCH2- , C5H9 ≡ C- , (CH3)2N- , F- , and cl- ) have been investigated as propylene polymerization pro-catalysts . steric effects from the b-Cp substituents determine the iso- , hemi-iso- , and syndio-specificities of the catalysts . the relative stereospecificities of Me2Si[1-Cp-3t-Bu-9-Flu]ZrCl2 and rac-Me2Si[1-Ind-3-t-Bu]2ZrCl2 are in accord with molecular models . the more un-symmetrical the catalysts are the more m and mm stereosequences there are in s-PP . the m dyads also increase with the concentration of Me2C[1-Cp-9-Flu-2-OMe]ZrCl2 . 
structure-performance relationships in the propene polymerization behaviour of a number of silicon bridged bisindenyl zirconocenes show a rational pattern . prognosis of the polymerization behaviour of different type structures , however , often fails , which is demonstrated by three examples of new zirconocenes . these include two bisindenyl complexes with two-membered silicon bridges and one isospecific bridged fluorenyl cyclopentadienyl species . it is thus demonstrated that the scope of a “ rational catalyst design ” in the field of metallocene catalysts is still limited . 
most of the supported metallocene catalysts reported so far have been devised to immobilize metallocenes on the solid surface utilizing the ionic interactions between metallocenes and surface active sites . whereas , we have been challenging to prepare more rigidly immobilized catalysts by using the chemically modified O2Si . the SiO2-supported zirconocene catalysts thus prepared could be activated by ordinary trialkylaluminiums like Al(i-C4H9)3 to give highly isotactic polypropene ( PP ) with high melting temperature ( Tm ) and number-average molecular weight ( Mn ) . this paper summarizes the results obtained so far . 
ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations on ethylene insertion in a bridged di(cyclopentadienyl) methylzirconocene have revealed that the entire reaction path starting from the p-coordinated ethylene-zirconocene complex up to and including propyl formation takes place in about <nUm> femtoseconds , which is unexpectedly fast , and suggesting the absence of any significant barrier of activation . starting from a reactant structure without a-H agostic interaction , at T = <nUm> K such an interaction evolves during the course of the insertion reaction and before the propyl is formed . the product state exhibits g-H agostic interaction . 
the isolation of non-fluxional alumoxane compounds , [(tBu)2Al{OAl(tBu)2}]2 and [(tBu)AlO]n ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) , has allowed for an investigation of the mode of activity observed for alumoxanes as co-catalysts for the zirconocene polymerization of olefins . [(tBu)2Al{OAl(tBu)2}]2 , which contains two three-coordinate aluminum centers , shows no reaction with Cp2ZrMe2 , and no catalytic activity towards ethylene polymerization . In contrast , the closed cage compound [(tBu)AlO]6 reacts reversibly to give the ion pair complex , [Cp2ZrMe][(rBu)6Al6O6Me] , which is active as a catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene . polymerization is also observed for mixtures of Cp2ZrMe2 with [(tBu)AlO]n ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) . A new concept , “ latent lewis acidity ” , is proposed to account for the reactivity of the cage alumoxanes , [(tBu)AlO]n . 
metallocene / MAO catalysts are useful for the production of syndiotactic polystyrene - a new class of high performance polymers . the melting point of the obtained syndiotactic polystyrene depends on the metallocene used and can reach up to <nUm> ° C . In the past , the most active catalysts in polymerization have been half - sandwich titanocenes such as CpTiCl3 and Cp*TiCl3 . if the chlorinated compounds are changed into the fluorinated compounds as CpTiF3 and Cp*TiF3 , the activity increases by a factor of <nUm> to <nUm> . the fluorinated titanocenes are more stable at higher temperatures and need a lower MAO excess in order to obtain optimal activities . polymers obtained with the unsubstituted CpTiF3 show melting points which are <nUm> ° C lower than those synthesized by pentamethylcyclopentadienyltitaniumtrifluoride . especially Cp*TiF3 shows a much higher activity and , compared with the chlorinated compound , gives polymers with a higher molecular weight . substituted cyclopentadienyltitanocenes have even higher activities . ethene / styrene copolymers can be obtained by catalysis with zirconocene compounds . 
combined systems including diphenylzinc ( Ph2Zn ) , a metallocene , and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , have been employed to initiate the copolymerization of styrene ( S ) with p-alkylsubstituted styrenes and with a-olefins . the copolymerization processes depend largely on the comonomer , the nature of the metallocene included in the initiator system , the presence of Ph2Zn , the polymerization temperature and the solvent used . titanocenes produced true copolymers for S / p - substituted styrene , but not in S / a-olefin copolymerization . on the other hand zirconocenes either did not copolymerize S / p - substituted styrene or produced very low conversions , while they succeeded in copolymerizing S / a-olefin , depending on the particular zirconocene employed . A low p-methylstyrene ( p-MeS ) content in the S / p-MeS copolymer and a low p-tertbutylstyrene ( p-ButS ) content in the S / p-ButS copolymer decreased Tm , making them easier to process material than s-PS . 
metallocenes are highly active catalysts for the production of precisely designed polyolefins and engineering plastics . especially zirconocene / methylalumoxane ( MAO ) catalysts and half - sandwich titanium complexes have opened a frontier in the area of new polymer synthesis and processing . the materials obtained show different microstructures , tacticities and properties compared with conventional polymers . alternating ethene / propene polymers show lower glass transition temperatures than random copolymers . constrained geometry catalysts are useful for the synthesis of norbornene / ethene copolymers . 
In the present paper the effects of the solvent , a lewis base and of non-polymerizable olefin on copolymerization of propene with higher a-olefins performed with isospecific ansa - zirconocene catalysts are investigated . A wide range of solvents with increasing polarity , donor character and steric hindrance has been tested , and their effects on copolymer yield , composition and microstructure thoroughly analyzed . our results demonstrate that the solvent can have a significant influence on the copolymer composition , even though the solvent polarity is not the relevant factor . polymerizations carried out in coordinating solvents , e.g. aromatic solvents , lead to the formation of products with considerably decreased higher a-olefin content . the reduced incorporation of the higher a-olefin is explained in terms of competition between the nucleophilic medium and the olefin monomer for coordination to the active polymerisation site . the dependence of polymer microstructure on the solvent nucleophilicity is further elucidated by copolymerization studies performed in the presence of diisopropyldimethoxysilane as a lewis base . the addition of the non-polymerizable olefin , 2-methyl-1-pentene , which does not significantly affect comonomer composition , seems to slightly modify comonomer distribution . the sum of the results obtained give us valuable information regarding the mechanism of polymerisation at the active centers . 
copolymerization of ethylene and 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) by zirconocene catalysts proceeded via cyclization - addition mechanism to form 1,3-didsubstituted cyclopentane structure in the polyethylene chain . the 1,3-cyclopentane structure was found to be taken in the crystalline structure of polyethylene ( isomorphism ) by partially chainging the trans zigzag chain into gauche conformation , thereby , inducing a transformation of orthorhombic crystal to pseudohexagonal crystal . copolymerization of ethylene and cyclopentene ( CPE ) by zirconocene catalysts yielded copolymers having 1,2-disubstituted cyclopentane structure in the polyethylene chain . the 1,2-cyclopentane structure was not taken into the crystalline structure of polyethylene . the melting point ( Tm ) and the crystallinity ( xc ) of polyethylene decreased by copolymerization of HD or CPE , and the tm- and xc - decreasing effect of CPE was stronger than HD . for copolymers of propylene and HD or CPE obtained with isospecific zirconocene catalyst , the isomorphism was not ovserved . 
combined systems including diphenylzinc , Ph2Zn , a metallocene , and methylaluminoxane , MAO , have been employed to initiate styrene polymerization and the copolymerization of styrene with p-alkylsubstituted styrenes and a-olefins . both polymerization and copolymerization processes depend on the nature of the metallocene included in the initiator system , the presence of Ph2Zn , the temperature , and the solvent used . S / 1-alkene copolymers were obtained when the initiator systems included a zirconocene , but not when a titanocene participated . 
copolymers of propene and several higher a-olefins , 1-butene , 1-pentene , 1-hexene , 1-heptene , 1-octene , and 4-methyl-1-pentene ( 4M1P ) , have been prepared with two different metallocene catalysts , rac - Et(Ind) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( EI ) and rac-Me <nUm> Si(2-MeBenz-[e]Ind) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( MBI ) , and comprehensively characterized by <nUm> C NMR spectroscopy . all copolymers produced with EI have comparable isotacticities as well as similar stereosequences . the copolymers produced with MBI significantly differ both from the reference propene homopolymer and among themselves : in fact , they are characterized by rather low isotacticities and the degree of tacticity is strongly influenced by comonomer type and concentration . A detailed <nUm> C NMR analysis revealed that these copolymers are constituted by highly isotactic and atactic sequences of various lengths . the similar thermal behavior , in terms of transition temperatures , for the homologues of the series obtained with the two different catalysts show that the capability of crystallization of these systems is not directly connected to the overall microstructural properties ( e.g. the isotacticity index ) but can be accounted for by the details of the microstructure . 
dual - site ethene / 1-hexene copolymerizations with MAO - activated (1,2,4-Me3Cp)2ZrCl2 and ( Me5Cp ) 2ZrCl2 catalysts were performed . copolymers with narrow molecular weight distributions and bimodal short chain branching distributions could be produced . the combined catalyst system demonstrates a number of discrepancies from an expected average behavior of the individual sites . dual - site (1,2,4-Me3Cp)2ZrCl2 / ( me 5Cp)2ZrCl2 systems produce copolymers with lower incorporation than expected . clear evidences for relative activity enhancement of the (Me5Cp)2ZrCl2 catalyst in the mixture were observed in melting endotherms and crystaf profiles . molecular weights obtained by the mixture were higher than for any of the individual catalysts . A similar effect is observed for a dual - site system of the (1,2,4-Me3Cp)2ZrCl2 catalyst together with the Me4Si2(Me4Cp)2ZrCl2 catalyst as an alternative to (Me5Cp)2ZrCl2 . 
A set of different 1- and 2-silyl-substituted zirconocene dichloride / MAO catalyst systems was investigated with respect to their performance in ethene / 1-hexene copolymerisations . in-depth studies of bis(2- dimethylsilylindenyl ) zirconium(IV) dichloride ( 1 ) revealed a multi-site behaviour , illustrating sensitivity to the reaction temperature and the comonomer mole fraction . surprisingly , an upper limit is observed for the latter , leading to complete catalyst inhibition . analysis of the chain termination processes implies the possibility of a predominant , although in general less favourable , b-hydride elimination route under certain polymerisation conditions . 
to increase the thermal stability of metallocene-methylaluminoxane catalysts , pentalene bridged zirconocenes and a constrained geometry catalyst were used for the copolymerisation of ethene and norbornene . the constrained geometry catalyst is stable in solution up to <nUm> ° C . surprisingly the molecular weight of the copolymers increases with higher incorporation rates of norbornene . glass transition temperatures of <nUm> ° C are reached . the microstructure of the cyclic olefin copolymers material is more alternating . 
results of our studies on polymerization kinetics and tests of copolymerization statistical models of ethylene-norbornene ( E-N ) copolymers obtained on the basis of microstructures determined by 13C NMR analysis are reported , ethylene-norbornene ( E-N ) copolymers were synthesized by catalytic systems composed of racemic isospecific metallocenes , i-Pr[(3Pr i-Cp)(Flu)]ZrCl2 or a constrained geometry catalyst ( CGC ) and methylaluminoxane . polymerization kinetics revealed that E-N copolymerization is quasi living under standard polymerization conditions . calculations of the number of active sites and of chain propagation and chain transfer turnover frequencies indicate that the metal is mainly in the Mt-N* state , while the Mt-E* state contributes more to transfer and propagation rates . the first - order and the second - order markov statistics have been tested by using the complete tetrad distribution obtained from 13C NMR analysis of copolymer microstructures . the root-mean-square deviations between experimental and calculated tetrads demonstrate that penultimate ( second - order markov ) effects play a decisive role in E-N copolymerizations . results show clues for more complex effects depending on the catalyst geometry in copolymers obtained at high N / e feed ratios . comonomer concentration was shown to have a strong influence on copolymer microstructure and copolymer properties . the copolymer microstructure of alternating isotactic copolymers obtained with i-Pr[(3Pri-Cp)(Flu)]ZrCl2 have been described at pentad level . second - order markov statistics better describes also the microstrucure of these copolymers . 
the olefin polymerisation activity of metallocene catalysts strongly depends on the counteranion provided by the activator system . the relative activities of a number of new diborate anions [ Z(BAr3) 2]- have been quantified ( z = CN , H2N , C2N3 ; Ar = C6F5 or o-C6F 4C6F5 ) . the kinetic parameters for the initiation , propagation and termination steps of propene polymerisations catalysed by BCl2ISZr have been determined using quenched - flow kinetic and batch techniques [ SBI = rac-Me2Si(1-Ind)2 ] . comparison of two activator systems , ( i ) CPh3[B(C6F 5)4 ] / triisobutylaluminium ( TIBA ) and ( ii ) methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) shows , surprisingly , that the concentration of species actively involved in chain growth at any one time is comparable for both systems , although the MAO - activated catalyst is about <nUm> times less active than the borate system . it is concluded that the counteranion remains sufficiently strongly bound to the metal centre throughout the chain growth sequence to modulate the energetics of monomer insertion . A model suggesting that the monomer binding follows an associative interchange ( ia ) mechanism is proposed . 
Diphenylzinc-metallocene-MAO initiator systems have proven to be effective initiator systems for styrene and for substituted styrenes as well as for their styrene / ( styrene - derivative ) copolymerization . titanocene produced almost pure syndiotactic polymers while zirconocenes gave atactic polystyrene together with a low content , less than <nUm> % , of syndiotactic polystyrene . systems including a zirconocene , particularly ethenyl(bisindenyl)zirconium dichloride were effective initiators of 1-alkene polymerization and of styrene / 1-alkene copolymerization . conversion to polymer increases with the molecular size of 1-alkene . styrene derivative and styrene / ( styrene derivative ) polymerization was greatly influenced by the inductive effect of substituent and by steric hindrance due to the monomer . 
series of propene - norbornene ( P-N ) copolymers were synthesized in the presence of two C2 symmetric zirconocenes , rac - Et(Indenyl) 2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) and rac-Me2Si(Indenyl) 2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , and of the Cs symmetric zirconocene Me2C(Cp)(Fluorenyl)ZrCl2 ( 3 ) with MAO as cocatalyst . P-N copolymers were characterized by 13C NMR spectroscopy , SEC , and DSC . A first assignment of the main 13C NMR signals of P-N copolymers obtained with <nUm> and <nUm> containing isolated N units was obtained on the basis of DEPT experiments and by comparison with isotactic polypropene ( i-PP ) and E-N copolymer spectra . ab initio theoretical 13C NMR chemical shifts , combined with R.I.S . statistics of the P-N chain , gave important detailed indications for the assignment of the complex 13C spectra of these copolymers . such assignments were used to estimate the N copolymer content . the comparison of N content values obtained from the areas of different regions of the spectra reveals that <nUm> propene misinsertions are formed in greater amount as the [N] / [P] ratio of the feed increases . this may be due to the steric hindrance of the Mt - tertiary carbon bond when N is the last inserted unit , which makes difficult the next propene insertion and causes the low polymerization activities , molecular masses and tg . the spectra of P-N copolymers obtained with <nUm> revealed to be even more complex . A limited assignment of the spectrum has been achieved . this allowed us to evaluate the N content in the copolymers and to evidence the low tendency of the Cs symmetric <nUm> to give <nUm> propene misinsertions in P-N copolymers . this is in agreement with the results observed with this catalyst in propene homopolymerization . 
olefin-diene copolymerizations in the presence of C2 symmetric zirconocene rac-[CH2(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 / MAO catalytic system have been reported and rationalized by experimental and molecular modeling studies . ethene gives 1,2-cyclopropane and 1,2-cyclopentane , 1,3-cydobutane , and 1,3- cyclopentane units in copolymerization with 1,3-butadiene , 1,4-pentadiene , and 1,5- hexadiene , respectively . propene-1,3-butadiene copolymerizations lead to <nUm> and <nUm> butadiene units and to a low amount of 1,2-cyclopropane units . 
concomitant immobilization of zirconocene ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) into a silica matrix was performed during the O2Si synthesis through non-hydrolytic sol - gel method . two different routes , varying the ClSi <nUm> : Si(OEt)4 ratio were evaluated in terms of zirconocene content and catalyst activity in ethylene polymerization , using methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst . the catalysts were characterized by rutherford backscattering spectrometry , fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , diffuse reflectance spectroscopy , scanning electron microscopy and x-ray dispersive spectroscopy . the zirconocene content laid between <nUm> and <nUm> wt. % Zr / O2Si , depending upon the components ratio employed in the sol - gel synthesis . catalyst grains presented of irregular shape ( 20-100 mm size ) and zirconocene distribution was not uniform . both routes led to supported catalysts active in ethylene polymerization . catalyst activity was intermediate between that exhibited by the homogeneous and the grafted zirconocene on silica . resulting polyethylenes presented narrow molecular weight distribution and molecular weight slightly higher than that observed in the case of polymer produced with the homogeneous system . 
the recently described reaction products of zirconacyclopropenes cp 2Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) and five - membered zirconacyclocumulenes ( zirconacyclopenta-2,3,4-trienes ) Cp*2Zr(e4-1,2,3,4-RC4R) , cp* = e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl , r = me , Me3Si and ph , with i-Bu2AlH are active catalysts in the polymerization of ethylene and in the ring opening polymerization of e-caprolactone . here we describe the different activity of these complexes after thermal activation or if additional i-Bu2AlH together with water are added . these results are compared to those which were obtained with the complexes Cp2Zr(e 4-1,2,3,4-H2C4H2 ) , rac - (EBTHl)ZrF2 , roc(EBTHI)ZrCl2 , [ rac-(EBTHI)Zr(H)(m- H)]2 and roc (EBTHI)Zr(F)CH2 - CH2( 2-Py ) after activation with i-Bu2AlH together with water . 
reaction of Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 with excess methylalumoxane ( MAO ) gives rise to ion pairs containing zirconocenium cations of the type [Me2Si(Ind)2ZrMe]+ in contact with two types of anions , MeMAOA- and MeMAOB - , which differ in their coordinative strengths : more strongly coherent contact - ion pairs [ Me2Si(Ind)2 ZrMe +MeMAOB- ] are converted by a sufficiently high excess of MAO to more easily separable contact - ion pairs [ Me2Si(Ind) 2ZrMe+MeMAOA- ] , which react with AlMe3 to form the outer - sphere ion pairs [ Me2Si(Ind) 2Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2]+ MeMAO A- , and are likely to be required also for the formation of the olefin - containing reaction complexes responsible for catalytic activity . 
exceptionally strong materials could be synthesized by filled polyolefins with nanosized , regid particles or fibers . metallocene catalysts are excellent tools in the production of tailored microstructures as well as tacticitles of polypropylenes . they are soluble in hydrocarbons and therefore can cover perfectly the surface of nano particles . here multi-walled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNT ) ( diameter 15-25 nm , length up to <nUm> mm ) were used as fillers . before polymerization , the fillers were separated by ultra sound and then treated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . MAO reacts partially with defects and functional groups of oxidized MWCNT . catalytically active centers are formed after adding the zirconocenes or other transition metal complexes directly on the CNT surface . the thickness of the polymer layer can be controlled by the monomer pressure and polymerization time . we obtained coatings of <nUm> to <nUm> nm . by this method carbon nanotubes can be covered also with isotactic or syndiotactic polypropylene , but also with polyethylene with any molecular mass . the nanocomposltes obtained were especially investigated In regard to their crystallization behavior , which depended significantly on the matrix used . 
the aluminohydride of zirconocene me 3SiCp 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> was supported on pre-treated OSi <nUm> , and its catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization and ethylene-1-hexene copolymerization was evaluated in order to compare with the corresponding activity of the complex in solution . As expected for systems based on metallocenes , the aluminohydride of zirconocene complex showed higher activity in solution than in suspension , however its thermal and kinetic stability was significantly increased . the effect of the co-catalyst concentration ( MAO ) on the activity and the molecular weight of the polymers are also reported in this study , finding that in heterogeneous phase low concentrations of MAO were used to activate the pre-catalyst . the MW of the polymers and copolymers synthesized with the supported me 3SiCp 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> / OSi <nUm> could be controlled by adding molecular hydrogen ( H <nUm> ) as chain transfer agent in the polymerization and copolymerization reactions . 
copolymerizations of ethylene and a-olefins ( 1-hexene and 1-octene ) using a supported catalyst derived from the activation of a zirconocene aluminohydride complex with PMAO and MMAO are reported . the supported ( nBu-Cp 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> ) / OSi <nUm> / MAO system was evaluated by high - throughput techniques , in order to find approaches to the optimal copolymerization conditions . the polymerization reactions were carried out in a parallel polymerization reactors system ( PPR ) by symyx technologies , inc . the screening of the activity of the supported system and the molecular weight ( MW ) of the polymers and copolymers obtained in the PPR , allowed us to optimize copolymerization conditions , like hydrogen ( H <nUm> ) addition to control MW and molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) , polymerization temperature , cocatalyst ratio , and solvent type . the copolymerization reactions were scaled-up in order to validate the performance of the catalytic system at higher polymerization scales , according to the results obtained in the combinatorial phase . the scaled-up copolymerizations of ethylene with 1-hexene and 1-octene , showed high activities and MW , and low comonomer incorporation ( from <nUm> to <nUm> mol- % , determined by 13C NMR ) . however , the crystallinity ( x c ) , thermal properties ( T c and T m ) and densities of the polyethylenes obtained with the supported ( nBu-Cp 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> ) / OSi <nUm> / MAO system , were significantly modified , approaching those of metallocene linear lowdensity polyethylenes ( mLLDPE ) . 
binary metallocene - MAO and ternary diphenylzinc-metallocene-MAO initiator systems have been tested as initiators in the homopolymerization of styrene and also in its copolymerization with several diverse comonomers including substituted styrenes , styrene derivatives , a-olefins and dienes . various titanocenes and zirconocenes and some exploratory experiment with hafnocene were carried out . the results indicate that titanocenes were more effective than zirconocenes in the homopolymerization of styrene while zirconocenes did better in a-olefin polymerization . it was found that titanocenes generated mainly syndiotactic polystyrene , s-PS , while zirconocenes yielded atactic polystyrene or , depending on the zirconocene , a low percentage of s-PS . for these types of initiators the polymerization process depends largely on the inductive effect of the substituents linked to the benzene ring of styrene and on its position ( ortho , meta or para ) . substituent multiplicity reduced markedly the effectiveness of these initiator systems . styrene / isoprene polymerization was also studied using binary zirconocene - MAO initiator systems that yielded low conversions and also low molecular weight polymers . 
In this work we studied the copolymerization of ethylene and different alpha-olefins ( propylene , 1-butene , 1-hexene , and 1-octene ) using aluminohydride zirconocene systems supported on modified silica . the copolymerization reactions were carried out in hexanes , at different Al / Zr ratios , using two different comonomer concentrations . the effect of comonomer type on catalyst activity and polymer molecular weight and chemical composition distributions ( MWD and CCD ) was compared . average comonomer incorporation was determined by 13C NMR and the CCD by crystallization elution fractionation ( CEF ) . most of the copolymerizations showed very high catalytic activity ( up to <nUm> kg PE / mol Zr ) , and the molecular weight was higher for the copolymers containing 1-octene , demonstrating that aluminohydride zirconocene systems can copolymerize ethylene and alpha-olefins effectively . 


an opal - supported zirconocene complex ( OC ) was prepared and employed to prepare functional polyethylene composite for the first time through in situ polymerization of ethylene . the formation mechanism of anion relating to opal was explained and the values of anions released from pristine opal and that contained in the asfabricated polyethylene composites were detected . the OC exhibited high catalytic activities in ethylene polymerization with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) the cocatalyst . In addition to higher viscosity - average molecular weights ( me ) , experimental results also showed that the resulting polyethylene composites possessed improved anion - releasing capacity in comparison with pristine opal in addition to increased tensile strength , young 's modulus , and onset decomposition temperature ( tonset ) relative to neat polyethylene due to highly uniform dispersion of opal in polyethylene matrix . 
supported zirconocene catalysts on a new support , MgO , were prepared and tested in ethylene polymerization . three types of impregnation methods were employed to find an optimum supporting method for MgO . the direct impregnation of Cp2ZrCl2 on MgO showed low metal loading and polymerization activity , while the catalyst had a higher metal loading and polymerization activity when MgO was treated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) before supporting . treatment of MgO with MAO during the supporting step invoked two types of catalytic sites , which was evidenced by the bimodal molecular weight distribution of the polymer products . MgO is considered to have potential as a support for metallocenes . 
the use of biomass as support for zirconocene catalysts in ethylene polymerization was studied . cellulose , starch and chitosan were conveniently characterized . many factors affecting the activity of the catalysts were examined . parameters such as surface area were found to have no significant influence on the activity of the catalysts . the activity of the catalysts sharply increased with the degree of deacetylation in the chitosan supports . using this support the highest activity in ethylene polymerization was obtained . the polymers obtained with the zirconocene supported on chitosan or cellulose pretreated with methylaluminoxane exhibited a higher obtained weight than those obtained with a homogeneous system . polymer particles obtained with these supported metallocene catalysts showed a good replication of the original support particles . 
polyethylene nano-composites , with different loading of silicon nitride ( NSi ) ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> wt % ) as filler were prepared by polymerization of ethylene , using zirconocene as catalyst . experimental results showed that activity of zirconocene catalyst activity was higher for the composites having filler loading of <nUm> wt % . the thermal studies using differential scanning calorimeter ( DSC ) and thermo - gravimetric analysis ( TGA ) indicated that crystallinity & thermal stability was also influenced with the variation of filler loading . combustibility studies using micro-calorimeter showed that increase in the filler loading will decrease the combustibility of polyethylene nano-composites . wide angle x-ray diffraction ( WAXD ) results indicated a decrease in the percentage of crystallinity with increase in filler wt % . scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) images revealed that morphology of the composites having <nUm> and <nUm> wt % of NSi are more fibrous when compared to control and composites having <nUm> wt % filler loading .

A combination of diphenylzinc , a metallocene and methylaluminoxane ( Ph2Zn-metallocene-MAO ) is a suitable initiator system for the polymerization of styrene and for its copolymerization with para-alkyl substituted styrenes . this paper reports new experimental results which reinforce our previous findings indicating that polymerization processes are initiated by monomer coordination to active species resulting from these particular combined systems . polymerization propagates by a cationic pathway . further to our previous observation that the I+ inductive effect of para-substituents in styrene improves conversion to polymer , we now find that methyl substitution on the vinyl double bond of styrene , in spite of the I+ inductive effect and as a result of increased steric hindrance , makes the polymerization process difficult . on the other hand , the replacement of titanocenes by zirconocenes or hafnocenes generates Ph2Zn-metallocene-MAO initiator systems which are also able to induce homo- and copolymerization , but with lower yields and producing practically amorphous polymers . the efficiency of our Ph2Zn-metallocene-MAO initiator systems follows the order titanocene > zirconocene > hafnocene , at least for the studied metallocenes . 
the commercial interest of metallocene complexes for olefin polymerization has led to additional efforts to prepare suitable metallocene complexes efficiently and economically . ethylene polymerization was carried out with a series of heterogeneous catalysts which were prepared in various Zr / silica ratios by immobilization of Ind2ZrCl2 preactivated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) on silica . this method to form the catalyst system resulted in a polymerization catalyst with reduced fouling tendencies and improved reactor operability . polymerization of ethylene was conducted in buchi reactors in a slurry phase under mild pressure . some of the physical properties of the obtained polymers were also determined . 
background : much of the current research related to the development of in situ nanocomposites of olefins by polymerizing them with metallocenes in the presence of surface - treated fillers is carried out in the slurry phase . In slurry - phase methods a large amount of solvent is required and there is always a need of purification of the final product due to the possibility of traces of solvents present in the product . to overcome these drawbacks , to perform solvent - free metallocene - catalysed polymerizations with in situ incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles , we have used a gas - phase polymerization technique as this does not require solvents and also utilizes monomer feed stocks efficiently . results : the catalyst used for the synthesis of in situ polyethylene nanocomposites by gas - phase polymerization was nanosilica - supported zirconocene . the fillers used were Cloisite-20A , kaolin and nanosilica . three different in situ polyethylene nanocomposites , i.e. Cloisite-20A-filled polyethylene ( CFPE ) , kaolin - filled polyethylene ( KFPE ) and nanosilica - filled polyethylene ( SFPE ) , were prepared by gas - phase polymerization . the nanocomposites were obtained in the form of fine powder . the polyethylene content in the developed nanocomposites is in the orthorhombic crystalline phase . using our approach , it is observed that the nanofillers are completely encapsulated by a thin layer of polyethylene . significantly higher molecular weight polyethylene was formed in the case of KFPE in comparison to CFPE and SFPE . the thermal decomposition temperature , melting temperature and enthalpy are also observed to be higher for KFPE . conclusions : the gas - phase polymerization technique has been successfully carried out for the synthesis of in situ polyethylene nanocomposites . 
themanufacture of linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) is of great significance in academia and industry . the employment of a single monomer , i.e. ethylene , to produce LLDPE by introducing two catalysts into one reactor to conduct ethylene copolymerization with in situ - generated a-olefins has proved to be an effective way in this case . moreover , immobilization of catalysts affords LLDPE with bettermorphology and improved physical properties.An iron - based diimine complex immobilized on methylaluminoxane (MAO)-treated mesoporous molecular sieves was used to oligomerize ethylene to a-olefins with improved selectivity to lower molar mass fractions . based on this , zirconocene compound was also supported on mesoporous molecular sieves to comprise a two - catalyst system to produce LLDPE from a single ethylene monomer . copolymerization performed at both atmospheric and high pressure produced LLDPE of high molecular weight and broad molecular weight distribution without using MAO during the polymerization processes . physical and mechanical measurements evidenced significant increases in tensile strength , tensile modulus and izod impact strength . A marked shear - thinning phenomenon and improved storagemodulus of LLDPE produced using catalysts supported on MCM-41 and SBA-15mesoporousmolecular sieves indicated a stronger interfacial interaction between themolecular sieve support and the polymeric matrix . 
spherical and well - dispersed silica / poly[styrene-co-(acrylic acid ) ] ( O2Si / PSA ) core - shell particles have been synthesized using an improved phase - inversion process . the resulting particles were successfully used as supports for polyolefin catalysts in the production of polyethylene with broad molecular weight distribution . through the vapor phase , instead of the liquid phase in the traditional process , a non-solvent was introduced into a mixture of micrometer - sized O2Si and PSA solution . the core - shell structure of the resulting O2Si / PSA microspheres was confirmed using optical microscopy , scanning electron microscopy , fourier transfer infrared spectrometry , thermogravimetric analysis and measurement of nitrogen adsorption / desorption isotherms . In order to avoid agglomeration of particles and to obtain a good dispersion of the O2Si / PSA core - shell microspheres , the non-solvent was added slowly . As the concentration of PSA solution increased , the surface morphology of the core - shell particles became looser and more irregular . however , the surface area and the pore volume remained the same under varying PSA concentrations . the O2Si / PSA core - shell microspheres obtained were used as a catalyst carrier system in which the core supported (n-BuCp)2ZrCl2 and the shell supported Cl4Ti . ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization results indicated that the zirconocene and titanium - based ziegler - natta catalysts were compatible in the hybrid catalyst , showing high activities . the resulting polyethylene had high molecular weight and broad molecular weight distribution . 
the different elementary steps in the activation process of racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 by commercial methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) have been studied by UV / visible spectroscopy and correlated with hexene polymerization kinetics . after monomethylation of the zirconocene dichloride ( λ = <nUm> nm ) , abstraction of Cl ligand by MAO at low Al / Zr ratios ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) yields tight ion pairs , with an absorption band centred at λ = <nUm> nm , which are inactive towards hexene polymerization . addition of MAO in large excess ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) is required to form the active species . the latter , characterized by an absorption at λ = <nUm> nm , were identified as trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) separated ion pairs . the activation by commercial MAO of racEt(Ind)2ZrX2 , with x being methyl , benzyl or dimethylamino as extractable group , instead of chloride , reveals much easier and complete activation at low Al / Zr ratios ( Al : Zr = 50-150 ) . for these systems , formation of active ion pairs of different catalytic activities and absorbing in the range λ = 430-440 nm is observed . the use of TMA - depleted MAO instead of commercial MAO , as cocacalyst for racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 activation also allows the formation of active tight ion pairs absorbing at λ = <nUm> nm at low Al / Zr ratio . these results underline the negative role of chloride ligands when associated with TMA ( contained in MAO ) in the activation process of zirconocene for olefin polymerization , and also suggest interesting alternatives to reduce the amount of MAO necessary for metallocene activation . 
treatment of 2-(5-methyl-2-furyl)tetrahydroindenyllithium with Cl4Zr gave bis[2-(5-methyl-2-furyl)tetrahydroindenyl]zirconium dichloride ( 8 ) . dynamic 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed a cp - furyl rotational barrier of DGArrot[?] ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 . the x-ray crystal structure analysis of <nUm> showed the presence of a rac - like metallocene conformation in which the furyl rings are oriented coplanar with the cp moiety of the tetrahydroindenyl ligand systems , but the two furyl rings are oriented differently : one has the oxygen atom oriented toward the open front side , whereas the other has the furyl oxygen pointing toward the narrow back side of the bent metallocene wedge . the 8-MAO ziegler - natta catalyst system produces an atactic polypropylene oil . 
ethene was polymerized with the catalytic systems L2ZrCl2 / MAO / TMA ( where L = cp , Me5Cp , or Me4Cp ; cp = e5-cyclopentadienyl ; MAO = methylaluminoxane ; and TMA = trimethylaluminum ) at <nUm> ° C , <nUm> bar , and AlTMA / Zr ratios of 0-2700 . the polymerization activity was reduced with the addition of TMA for L = cp but was almost unaffected for the methyl-substituted catalysts . increasing the TMA concentration resulted in a lower molecular weight of the polymer , with the largest effect for L = Me5Cp . A gel permeation chromatography analysis of the polymers revealed a high molecular weight shoulder and a nearly bimodal distribution for L = Me5Cp at high TMA concentrations . A possible explanation of such a shoulder in terms of long - chain branching was ruled out by dynamic viscosity measurements . the origin of this effect more likely stemmed from competition between chain transfer to aluminum and b-hydrogen transfer reactions at two different sites , one TMA - sensitive and one TMA - insensitive . polymerizations at various pressures and temperatures substantiated this assumption . A clue to the underlying mechanism came from investigations of chain transfer to TMA studied with density functional calculations . complexation of Me3Al to Zr was much stronger for L = cp than for L = Me5Cp . however , the overall chain - transfer barrier was much higher for L = cp . these results agreed both with the reduced activity for L = cp and with the strongly reduced molecular weight for L = Me5Cp observed with the addition of TMA . 
cyclopentadienyl magnesium chloride ( MgClCp ) and its functionalized derivatives represent original and interesting supporting materials to heterogenize metallocene catalysts for olefin polymerizations . the synthesis of MgClCp , its functionalization , and the preparation of a catalytic system in which the ZrCl2(Flu)+ moiety is joined on the support through a cyclopentadienyl ligand are reported . this catalyst was tested in ethene polymerization , and both the catalytic activity and properties of the produced polymer were measured . its performance was compared with that shown by the catalyst ZrCl2CpFlu employed under the same conditions for both unsupported and conventional supports , such as Cl2Mg . the results showed a remarkable improvement in terms of the activity and polymer properties with these heterogenized catalysts . moreover , this system showed stability toward leaching processes and was characterized by good morphological control of the growing polymer . finally , catalysts in which [HB(3,5-Me2pyrazolyl)3]ZrCl2+ and [HB(3,5-Me2pyrazolyl)3]ZrClOtBu+ moieties were bonded to a functionalized MgClCp- support were also synthesized and tested . the results showed that the proposed supports could be usefully used to heterogenize tailored metallocene homogeneous catalysts . In fact , new catalysts were prepared that combined the peculiar advantages of both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts and overcame the disadvantages of the latter , such as a lack of morphology and reactor fouling . 
the copolymerization of propene with 7-methyl-1,6-octadiene ( MOD ) catalyzed by Cp*TiMe3 / BC18F15 ( A ) and rac-C2H4(Ind)2ZrCl2 / methylaluminoxan e ( B ) in toluene under <nUm> bar propene gave copolymers with unsaturated side chains . under these conditions , catalyst A produced copolymers with an atactic backbone structure of type <nUm> , with <nUm> - <nUm> mol % MOD incorporation and weight - average molecular weight = <nUm> - <nUm> × <nUm> . using catalyst B , copolymers <nUm> with <nUm> - <nUm> mol % MOD incorporation were prepared . the comonomer incorporation was a linear function of the feed ratio . the titanium catalyst A had a significantly higher affinity for MOD than the sterically more hindered zirconocene B . postpolymerization modification of the side - chain C = C bond allowed the facile introduction of a wide variety of functional groups . epoxidation and especially ozonolysis of the C = C bond , to give -CHO and -COOH functionalized copolymers , proved to be very facile routes to functionalized polypropenes . according to monitoring by NMR , most of these transformations proceed in an essentially quantitative conversion . As an example of potential applications of such polymers , polypropenes with covalently attached dyes were prepared that are suitable for blending . 
ethylene polymerization was carried out with zirconocene catalysts supported on montmorillonite ( or functionalized montmorillonite ) . the functionalized montmorillonite was from simple ion exchange of [CH3O2CCH2NH3]+ ( MeGlyH+ ) ions with interlamellar cations of layered montmorillonites . the functionalized montmorillonites [ high - purity montmorillonite (MMT)-MeGlyH+ ] had larger interlayer spacing ( <nUm> Å ) than montmorillonites without treatment ( <nUm> Å ) . the zirconocene catalyst system [ Cp2ZrCl2 / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) / MMT - MeGlyH+ ] had much higher Zr loading and higher activities than those of other zirconocene catalyst systems ( Cp2ZrCl2 / MMT , Cp2ZrCl2 / MMT - MeGlyH+ , Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO / MMT , [Cp2ZrCl]+ [BF4] / MMT , [Cp2ZrCl]+ [BF4]- / MMT - MeGlyH+ , [Cp2ZrCl]+ [BF4]- / MAO / MMT - MeGlyH+ , and [Cp2ZrCl]+[BF4]- / MAO / MMT ) . the polyethylenes with good bulk density were obtained from the catalyst systems , particularly ( Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO / MMT - MeGlyH+ ) . MeGlyH+ and MAO seemed to play important roles for preparation of the supported zirconocenes and polymerization of ethylene . the difference in Zr loading and catalytic activity among the supported zirconocene catalysts is discussed . 
heterogenization of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] on a silica support stabilized with chlorotriphenylmethane ( CICPh3 ) and N,N-dimethylaniline ( HNMe2Ph ) creates the following supported borane cocatalysts : [HNMe2Ph]+[B(C6 F5)3-SiO2]- and [CPh3]+[B(C6F5)3- SiO2]- . these supported catalysts were reacted with Cp2ZrCl2 TIBA in situ to generate active metallocene species in the reactor . triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) was a good coactivator for dichloro-zirconocene , acting as the prealkylating agent to generate cationic zirconocene ( Cp2ZrC4H9+ ) . the catalytic performances were determined from the kinetics of ethylene-consumption profiles that were independent of the time dedicated to the activation of the catalysts . the scanning electron microscopy - energy dispersive x-ray measurements showed that BC18F15 dispersed uniformly on the silica support . under our reaction conditions , the [CPh3]+[B(C6F5)3- SiO2]- system had higher productivity and weight - average molecular weight than the [HNMe2Ph]+[B(C6 F5)3-SiO2]- system . for the [CPh3]+[B(C6F5)3- SiO2]- system , the productivity increased with the amount catalyst ; however , the polydispersity index of polyethylene synthesized did not change . the final shape of polymer particles was a larger - diameter version of the original support particle . the polymer particles synthesized with supported [CPh3]+[B(C6F5)3- SiO2]- catalysts had larger diameters . 
ethene - propene copolymerizations were performed in the presence of Cs symmetric group <nUm> metallocenes . the reactivity ratios were strongly influenced by both the transition metal and the ancillary ligands . substantially alternate , almost random , and blocky copolymers were obtained with titanocene , zirconocene , and hafnocene , respectively , with the bis(dimethylsilyl)-1,1'-2,2'-diyl-(3',5'-diisopropyl)(4- isopropyl)-(cyclopentadienyl) ligand , and a blocky copolymer was obtained with ( diphenyl methylidene)(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)TiCl2 . 
copolymerization of ethylene or propylene and norbornene ( NB ) was carried out with stereospecific zirconocene catalysts rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride , rac-dimethylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 2 ) , rac-dimethyl-silylenebis(2-methylindenyl)zirconium dichloride , and diphenylmethylene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride combined with cocatalysts at <nUm> ° C . temperature - rising elution fractional of the copolymers was carried out with cross-fractionation chromatography with o-dichlorobenzene as a solvent , and a broad distribution of the copolymer composition was detected . the fraction eluted at lower temperature contained higher NB . the effect of the polymerization time was examined in the ethylene-NB copolymerization with catalyst <nUm> , and the higher - temperature elution fraction increased with increasing polymerization time . 
macroporous functionalized polymer beads of poly(4-vinylpyridine-co-l,4-divinylbenzene) [P(VPy-co-DVB)] were prepared by a multistep polymerization , including a polystyrene ( PS ) shape template by emulsifier - free emulsion polymerization , linear PS seeds by staged template suspension polymerization , and macroporous functionalized polymer beads of P(VPy-co-DVB) by multistep seeded polymerization . the polymer beads , having a cellular texture , were made of many small , spherical particles . the bead size was 10-50 mm , and the pore size was <nUm> - <nUm> mm . the polymer beads were used as supports for zirconocene catalysts in ethylene polymerization . they were very different from traditional polymer supports . the polymer beads could be exfoliated to yield many spherical particles dispersed in the resulting polyethylene particles during ethylene polymerization . the influence of the polymer beads on the catalytic behavior of the supported catalyst and morphology of the resulting polyethylene was investigated . 
this article reports the use of a binary single - site catalyst system for synthesizing comb - branched polypropylene samples having isotactic polypropylene ( iPP ) backbones and atactic polypropylene ( aPP ) side chains from propylene feedstock . this catalyst system consisted of the bisiminepyridine iron catalyst { [ 2-ArN = C(Me)]2C5H3N}FeCl2 [ Ar = 2,6-C6H3(Me)2 ] ( 1 ) and the zirconocene catalyst rac-Me2Si(2-MeBenz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) . the former in situ generated 1-propenyl-ended aPP macromonomer , whereas the latter incorporated the macromonomer into the copolymer . the effects of reaction conditions , such as the catalyst addition procedure and the ratio of <nUm> / <nUm> on the branching frequency , were examined . copolymer samples having a branching density up to <nUm> aPP side chains per <nUm> iPP monomer units were obtained . the branched copolymers were characterized by 13C NMR and differential scanning calorimetry . 
because of the great economic interest in propylene-based polymers and the possibility of designing materials with desired properties with metallocene catalyst mixtures , we investigated the characteristics of polypropylenes produced by mixtures of SiMe2Ind2ZrCl2 : dimethylsilane-bis(indenyl) zirconocene ( 1 ) and Et(Flu)(Cp)ZrCl2 : ethylidene ( fluorenyl cyclopentadienyl ) zirconocene ( 2 ) in different proportions . the polymers were fractionated with solvents , and the fractions were characterized . we observed that the polymers produced by the different mixed systems showed lower weight - average molecular weights and only slightly broader molecular weight distributions than polypropylenes synthesized by the individual catalysts . we concluded that catalyst <nUm> acted independently of catalyst <nUm> , producing polymers with the same isotacticity . 
ethene homopolymerization and copolymerization with 1-hexene were performed with three new tetramethyldisilylene-bridged zirconocene catalysts with 2-indenyl ligand ( A ) , 2-tetrahydroindenyl ligand ( B ) , and tetramethyl-cyclopentadienyl ligand ( C ) and with methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst . catalysts A and B showed substantial comonomer incorporation , resulting in a copolymer melting temperature more than <nUm> ° lower than that of the corresponding homopolymer . In contrast , catalyst C produced a copolymer with a low 1-hexene content and a high melting temperature . the reduction in the molecular weight with 1-hexene addition also correlated well with the comonomer incorporation . for all three catalysts , the homopolymer and copolymer unsaturations indicated frequent chain termination after 1-hexene insertion and a high degree of chain - end isomerization during the homopolymerization of ethene . the chain transfer to Al in the cocatalyst also appeared to be important . the comonomer response could be correlated with the structural properties of the catalyst , as derived from quantum chemical calculations . A linear model , calibrated against recent experiments with unbridged (MenC5H5-n)2ZrCl2 catalysts , suggested that the low comonomer incorporation obtained with catalyst C was caused partly by a narrow opening angle between the aromatic ligands and partly by steric hindrance in the transition state of comonomer insertion . 
ethylene homopolymerizations and copolymerizations were catalyzed by zirconocene catalysts entrapped inside functionalized montmorillonites that had been rendered organophilic via the ion exchange of the interlamellar cations of layered montmorillonite with hydrochlorides of l-amino acids ( AAH+Cl- ) or their methyl esters ( MeAAH+Cl- ) , with or without the further addition of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ( C16H33N+Me3Br- ; R4N+Br- ) . In contrast to the homogeneous Cp2ZrCl2 / methylaluminoxane catalyst for ethylene homopolymerizations and copolymerizations with 1-octene , the intercalated Cp2ZrCl2 activated by methylaluminoxane for ethylene homopolymerizations and copolymerizations with 1-octene proved to be more effective in the synthesis of polyethylenes with controlled molecular weights , chemical compositions and structures , and properties , including the bulk density . the effects of the properties of the organic guests on the preparation and catalytic performance of the intercalated zirconocene catalysts were studied . 
the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) was investigated with tris(pentafluorophenyl)alane [ Al(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] and four metallocene imido complexes that varied in the complex symmetry / chirality , metal , and r group in the = NR moiety , as well as a zirconocene enolate preformed from the imido zirconocene and MMA . this study examined four aspects of MMA polymerization : the effects of the metallocene imido complex structure on the polymerization activity and polymer tacticity , the degree of polymerization control , the elementary reactions of the imido complex with Al(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> and MMA , and the polymerization kinetics and mechanism . there was no effect of the imido complex symmetry / chirality on the polymerization stereochemistry ; the polymerization followed bernoullian statistics , producing syndiotactic poly(methyl methacrylate)s with moderate ( ∼ <nUm> % [rr] ) to high ( ∼ <nUm> % [rr] ) syndiotacticity , depending on the polymerization temperature . polymerization control was demonstrated by the number - average molecular weight , which increased linearly with an increase in the monomer conversion to <nUm> % , and the relatively small and insensitive polydispersity indices ( from <nUm> to <nUm> ) to conversion . the reactions of the zirconocene imido complex with Al(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> and MMA produced the parent base - free imido complex and the [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition product ( i.e. , zirconocene enolate ) , respectively ; the latter product reacted with Al(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> to generate the active zirconocenium enolaluminate . the MMA polymerization with the metallocene imido complex and the alane proceeded via intermolecular michael addition of the enolaluminate to the alane - activated MMA involved in the propagation step . 
copolymerization of olefins ( ethylene and propylene ) and 5-hexen-1-ol pretreated with alkylaluminum was performed using [dimethysilylbis(9-fluorenyl)]zirconium dichloride / methylaluminoxane as the catalyst . the copolymerization required extra addition of alkylaluminum to prevent deactivation of the catalyst when 5-hexen-1-ol was pretreated with trimethylaluminum , whereas the triisobutylaluminum - treated system did not require any addition of alkylaluminum . the molecular weight of the copolymer depended on the kind of alkylaluminum compound ( masking reagent , additive , and cocatalyst ) . 13C NMR analysis proved that poly(ethylene-co-5-hexen-1-ol) containing <nUm> mol % of 5-hexen-1-ol acted as an alternating copolymer , whereas the poly(propylene-co-5-hexen-1-ol) acted as a random copolymer . the surface property of the copolymers was simply evaluated by means of water drop contact angle measurement . it was found that the copolymers containing large amounts of 5-hexen-1-ol units showed good hydrophilic properties . 
A novel approach to the preparation of polyethylene ( PE ) nanocomposites , with montmorillonite / silica hybrid ( MT-Si ) supported catalyst , was developed . MT-Si was prepared by depositing silica nanoparticles between galleries of the MT . A common zirconocene catalyst [ bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride / methylaluminoxane ] was fixed on the MT-Si surface by a simple method . after ethylene polymerization , two classes of nanofillers ( clay layers and silica nanoparticles ) were dispersed concurrently in the PE matrix and PE / clay - silica nanocomposites were obtained . exfoliation of the clay layers and dispersion of the silica nanoparticles were examined with transmission electron microscopy . physical properties of the nanocomposites were characterized by tensile tests , dynamic mechanical analysis , and DSC . the nanocomposites with a low nanofiller loading ( < <nUm> wt % ) exhibited good mechanical properties . the nanocomposite powder produced with the supported catalyst had a granular morphology and a high bulk density , typical of a heterogeneous catalyst system . 
ethylene polymerizations with catalytic systems Me2SiCp*NtBuZrX2 ( 1 ) [ cp* = C3H4 ; x = Cl ( 1Cl ) , me ( 1Me ) ] , triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) , perfluorophenylborate CatB(C6F5)4 [ cat = CPh3 ( 3 ) , Me2NHPh ( 4 ) ] , or Me2SiCp2ZrX2 [ x = Cl ( 2Cl ) , me ( 2Me ) ] / TIBA / <nUm> ( 4 ) were performed within a wide range of ethylene pressures of different Al / Zr ratios , and Zr / B = <nUm> . catalytic systems 1Cl(2Cl) / TIBA / <nUm> led to the formation of very high linear molecular weight polyethylene ( PE ) of me ∼ ; <nUm> with low activity . the replacement of both chlorine ligands in the precatalyst for the methyl ones led to the formation of active species producing low molecular weight PE with high activity . chain transfer to ethylene was shown to be the main reaction controlling PE chain propagation : kp / ktr ∼ 20-30 for 1Me / TIBA / <nUm> and kp / ktr ∼ 350-500 for 2Me / TIBA / <nUm> . it was suggested that TIBA was present in the active center first in the form of a neutral heterobimetallic Zr-Al bridged complex followed by the formation of a partially polarized Zr - Al(Cl)R2 ( r = iBu ) or an unreactive Zr - AlR3 cationic complex by abstraction of the alkyl ligand under the action of borate . it was concluded that AlR3 from the latter cationic complex may be easily reversibly replaced under the specific coordination of ethylene or accumulated a-olefin , giving rise to highly labile and sterically accessible cationic species . experiments on ethylene polymerization with the catalytic systems 1Cl(1Me) / TIBA / <nUm> / Ph2NH , 1Cl(1Me) / TIBA / <nUm> , 2Cl(2Me) / TIBA / <nUm> / Ph2NH , and 2Cl(2Me) / TIBA / <nUm> were performed to confirm the suggestion . catalytic systems derived from dichloride complexes in the presence of a s-donor substrate also produced low molecular weight EsP with molecular weight characteristics similar to those of products obtained with the dimethylated precatalysts . the specific feature of active species derived from 2Me complexes to isomerize coordinated a-olefin into trans-vinylene polymer chains was also revealed . the catalytic behavior of the ternary catalytic system based on 2Me relative to 2Me or 2Cl precatalysts activated with polymethylaluminoxane at different Al / Zr ratios was compared . 
an investigation of the catalytic behavior of the dimethylated zirconocenes Me2SiCp* NtBuZrMe2 [ cp* = C3H4 ; 1Me ] , Me2SiCp2ZrMe2 ( 2Me ) , Cp2ZrMe2 ( 3Me ) , Ind2ZrMe2 ( 4Me ) , Me2SiInd2ZrMe2 ( 5Me ) , Et(2-MeInd)2ZrMe2 ( 6Me ) , and Me2Si(2-MeInd)2ZrMe2 ( 7Me ) with the combined activator triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) / CPh3B(C6F5)4 ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ; B / Zr = <nUm> ) in ethylene polymerizations at increased monomer pressures ( 5-11 bar , <nUm> ° C ) was carried out . sterically opened zirconocenes in ternary catalysts gave rise to active species effective in the formation of low molecular weight polyethylenes ( EsP ) . these active species tended to increase the PE molecular weight [ 1Me ( 2100 ) < 2Me ( 20,000 ) < 5Me ( 89,000 ) < 3Me ( 94,500 ) ] under similar conditions . PE obtained with 4Me showed a bimodal gel permeation chromatography curve with a <nUm> % peak area [ weight - average molecular weight ( mw ) = <nUm> ] and a <nUm> % peak area ( mw = <nUm> ) . the increase in sterical demands from the zirconocenes was also demonstrated by the reduction of the chain transfer to monomer , the reinsertion of vinyl-ended PE chains , and their ability for isomerization . these reactions were most pronounced for the zirconocenes 1Me and 2Me . the active species responsible for the formation of low molecular weight EsP deactivated quickly . the zirconocenes 6Me , 7Me , and (2-PhInd)2ZrMe2 ( 8Me ) bearing substituent at the 2-position of the indenyl ring was activated with TIBA alone , yielding active species effective in ethylene and propylene polymerizations . EsP formed with 6Me-8Me complexes activated with TIBA had high molecular weights . an increase in the Al / Zr ratio in the catalytic system 8Me / TIBA from <nUm> to <nUm> led to an enhancement of the molecular weight of polypropylene ( PP ) samples from oligomeric products to an viscosity - average molecular weight of <nUm> . the increase in the molecular weights of PPs with an increase in the propylene concentration was also observed . an analysis of the catalytic performance of the 8Me / TIBA system showed first - order dependency of the initial polymerization rates on the TIBA concentration and close to second - order dependency on propylene . the second - order dependency on the monomer concentration is explained in terms of the monomer participation in the initiation step of the polymerization reaction . 
the use of functional groups bearing silica / poly(styrene-co-4-vinylpyridine) core - shell particles as a support for a zirconocene catalyst in ethylene polymerization was studied . several factors affecting the behavior of the supported catalyst and the properties of the resulting polymer , such as time , temperature , Al / N ( molar ratio ) , and Al / Zr ( molar ratio ) , were examined . the conditions of the supported catalyst preparation were more important than those of the ethylene polymerization . the state of the supported catalyst itself played a decisive role in both the catalytic behavior of the supported catalyst and the properties of polyethylene ( PE ) . IR and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to follow the formation of the supports . the formation of cationic active species is hypothesized , and the performance of the core-shell-particle - supported zirconocene catalyst is discussed as well . the bulk density of the PE formed was higher than that of the polymer obtained from homogeneous and polymer - supported Cp2ZrCl2 / methylaluminoxane catalyst systems . 
the copolymerization of propylene with 1-hexene , 1-octene , 1-decene , and 1-dodecene was carried out with silica - supported rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 as a catalyst . the copolymerization activities of the homogeneous and supported catalysts and the microstructures of the resulting copolymers were compared . the activity of the supported catalyst was only one - half to one - eighth of that of the homogeneous catalyst , depending on the comonomer type . the supported catalyst copolymerized more comonomer into the polymer chain than the homogeneous catalyst at the same monomer feed ratio . data of reactivity ratios showed that the depression in the activity of propylene instead of an enhancement in the activity of olefinic comonomer was responsible for this phenomenon . we also found that copolymerization with a-olefins and supporting the metallocene on a carrier improved the stereoregularity and regioregularity of the copolymers . the melting temperature of all the copolymers decreased linearly with growing comonomer content , regardless of the comonomer type and catalyst system . low mobility of the propagation chain in the supported catalyst was suggested as the reason for the different polymerization behaviors of the supported catalyst with the homogeneous system . 
the ethylene polymerization by Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO ( cp = e5 : cyclopentadienyl ; MAO = methyl aluminoxane ) and CpZrCl3 / MAO have been studied . the MW and PD ( = mw / mw ) of polymers obtained after 2.5-60 min are the same , which indicate short chain lifetime . the values of rate constants for Cp2ZrCl2 at <nUm> ° C are : kp = <nUm> − <nUm> ( m s)-1 and ktrA1 = 0.012-0.81 s-1 depending upon [Zr] and [MAO,] ktrb = <nUm> s-1 , and ktrH = <nUm> M-1 torr-1 / <nUm> s-1 . these chain transfer rate constant values are two to three orders of magnitude greater than the corresponding values found for Cl2Mg supported titanium catalysts . one significant difference between the heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts is that the former decays according to an apparent second order kinetics , whereas the latter decay is simple first order at <nUm> ° C and biphasic first order at higher temperatures . the productivity of the catalysts depends weekly on temperature while the MW decreases strongly with increase of temperature above <nUm> ° C . all the active species were formed upon mixing Cp2ZrCl2 with MAO while it took up to <nUm> min for the CpZnCl3 / MAO system . the productivity of the former increase more strongly with the decrease of [Zr] than the latter . otherwise , the two catalyst systems have all their kinetic parameters differing less than a factor of two . 
the kinetic parameters have been measured for octene-1 solution polymerization at <nUm> ° C catalyzed by zirconocene with the cocatalyst methylaluminoxane . the polymerizations were performed in an attenuated total reflectance ( ATR ) reaction cell . the progress of the reactions were followed by observing the disappearance of octene-1 using the <nUm> cm-1 band measured by FT-IR spectroscopy . the dependence of the reaction rate , rp , on catalyst concentration and cocatalyst / catalyst ratio was examined . the catalyst deactivation mechanism was studied by fitting the experimental data to mathematical models involving second-order propagation and either first or second order catalyst deactivation . second-order catalyst deactivation provided a much better fit . the calculated deactivation rate constant , kd , is <nUm> (Ms)-1 . this model is used to determine the propagation rate constant for Al / Zr = <nUm> × <nUm> as kp = <nUm> ( m s)-1 . A decrease in Al / Zr = <nUm> × <nUm> lowered the propagation rate constant , kp , to <nUm> ( m s)-1 indicating that less than <nUm> % of the initial Zr is active at this Al / Zr ratio . 
MgCl2-supported Cl3Ti catalysts , with and / or without electron donor modifier ( internal Bi or external Be ) , were compared with rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) activated with either MAO or the cation forming agent , triphenyl carbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( 2 ) , with triethylalumium ( TEA ) . the activities of the heterogeneous catalysts depend on the presence or absence of the lewis base , were relatively insensitive to the temperature of polymerization , and produce poly(hexene) with molecular weights up to <nUm> . the <nUm> / MAO catalyst has about five times higher activity at <nUm> ° C but is almost inactive at − <nUm> ° C ; the overall activation energy is <nUm> kcal mol-1 . In contrast , the activity for hexene polymerization by the <nUm> / <nUm> / TEA catalyst is actually slightly greater at lower temperature . the MW 's of poly(hexene) obtained with the zirconocenium catalysts are only in the tens of thousands because of rapid b-hydride elimination by the electrophilic cationic Zr center . 
propylene was polymerized with rac-ethylene-bis (1-e5-indenyl)dichlorozirconium / methylaluminoxane in solvents of different polarity . the poly ( propylene ) formed was separated by solvent extraction ; 13C-NMR and DSC measurements were made on the polymer fractions . the poly(propylene) in each solvent fraction has its characteristic molecular weight steric pentad distributions , melting transition temperature , and enthalpy for fusion irrespective of the polymerization medium . the results suggest that the medium dielectric constant does not affect the polymerization rate or the intrinsic stereoselectivity , propagation and chain transfer rates a given catalytic species but can alter the occurrence of steric insertion errors through shifting of distributions of the propagating species producing poly(propylenes) of different stereoregularities . 
propylene was polymerized by binary zirconocenium catalysts derived from rac-ethylenebis(1-e5-indenyl)dimethylzirconium and cation forming agents (C6H5)3C+(C6F5)4B- and BC18F15 . polymerizations were also performed with the ternary systems of Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 , Et3Al , and the cation forming agents . the catalyst systems , with the inert noncoordinating counter-ion , (C6F5)4B- , have much higher activity and stereoselectivity than the ones with the CH3B-(C6F5)3 counter-ion . much less active still are catalysts having BF4- or (C6H5)4B- counter-ions . similar but smaller effects of counter-ion structure on ethylene polymerization were observed . 
racemic isopropylidene (1-e5-cyclopentadienyl)(1-e5-indenyl) dichlorozirconium and the 3-methylindenyl derivative have been synthesized and characterized . these precursors activated with methylaluminoxane produce poly(propylene) with hemiisotactic microstructures . 
the syndiospecific propylene polymerizations catalyzed by isopropylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl)- and (2,2-dimethylpropylidene)(cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl)-zirconocenium ( 1+ and 2+ ) have been investigated theoretically and compared with experimental observations . with the ab initio calculated structures for the transition state ( TS ) of 1+(M)P and 2+(M)P ( m = propylene , P = 2-methylpentyl ) , their steric energies ( e ° ) have been computed using MM2 force-field . the difference between steric energies e ° ( m ) and e ° ( r ) for the meso and racemic enchainment of propylene , respectively , is defined as the stereocontrol energy [ dE ° ( m − r ) ] for syndiotactic propagation . the dE ° ( m − r ) for the TS of 1+ (M)P is about <nUm> kcal / mol , the value is <nUm> kcal / mol greater for 2+(M)P . the observed steric pentad distributions of the syndiotactic poly(propylene) obtained by these catalysts are consistent with smaller effective stereocontrol energy , which is about two-third as large as dE ° ( m − r ) values calculated for the MM2 optimized structure . syndiotactic enchainment is favored over isotactic enchainment for all combinations of site configurations in the catalyst . a-Agostic interaction seems to enhance syndioselectivity , whereas g-agostic interaction changes the stereoselectivity to meso enchainment . the mirror plane symmetry of the syndiotactic propagating species renders the stereoselectivity of the polymerization insensitive to reaction conditions . these catalysts are also highly regiospecific . 
propene was polymerized at <nUm> ° C and 2-bar propene in toluene using methylalumoxane ( MAO ) activated rac-Me2Si(Benz[e]Indenyl)2ZrCl2 ( BI ) and rac-Me2Si(2-Me-Benz[e]Indenyl)2ZrCl2 ( MBI ) . catalyst BI / MAO polymerizes propene with high activity to afford low molecular weight polypropylene , whereas MBI / MAO is less active and produces high molecular weight polypropylene . variation of reaction conditions such as propene concentration , temperature , concentration of catalyst components , and addition of hydrogen reveals that the lower molecular weight polypropylene produced with BI / MAO results from chain transfer to propene monomer following a 2,1-insertion . A large fraction of both metallocene catalyst systems is deactivated upon 2,1-insertion . such dormant sites can be reactivated by h2-addition , which affords active metallocene hydrides . this effect of h2-addition is reflected by a decreasing content of head-to-head enchainment and the formation of polypropylene with n-butyl end groups . both catalysts show a strong dependence of activity on propene concentration that indicates a formal reaction order of <nUm> with respect to propene . MBI / MAO shows a much higher dependence of the activity on temperature than BI / MAO . At elevated temperatures , MBI / MAO polymerizes propene faster than BI / MAO . 
Bis(1-indenyl)-di[1'S , 2'R , 5'S)-methoxy]silane ( 1 ) was converted into a mixture of corresponding ansa-diastereomeric zirconocenes . further purification afforded a single dia-stereomer , di[(1'S , 2'R , 5'S)-methoxy ] silylene-bis[e5-1(R , r)-(+)-indenyl ] dichlorozirconium ( 2 ) , which is optically active and hydrocarbon soluble . extremely rapid ethylene , propylene , and ethylene-hexene polymerizations were observed both in toluene and n-heptane solutions ; for instance , at <nUm> ° C , activity for ethylene polymerization reaches ∼ <nUm> × <nUm> ( g of PE / ( ( mol of Zr ) · [C2H4] · h ) . the “ bare ” zirconocenium ion generated from <nUm> / TIBA / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 exhibits unusual polymerization behaviors ; the polymerization activity increases monotonically with temperature of polymerization ( tp ) up to a conventional polymerization condition ( <nUm> – <nUm> ° C ) , and the 13C NMR study shows that the isotactic poly-propylene obtained has fairly high [mmmm] methyl pentad distributions at high tp ( 25 ° C with [mmmm] ∼ <nUm> – <nUm> ) and a perfect stereoregularity at low tp ( 0 ° C with [mmmm] > <nUm> ) . the catalyst precursors <nUm> and Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 3 ) supported on silica by different approaches produced poly(olefins) of different molecular weights and stereoregularities , and a methylaluminokane and Ph3CB(C6F5)4 free silica-supported zirconocene system was found to be activated by triisobutylaluminum . 
the study of ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization with the zirconocene catalyst , bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl <nUm> ) / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , anchored on a MgCl2(THF) <nUm> support was carried out . the influence of 1-hexene concentration in the feed on catalyst productivity and comonomer reactivity as well as other properties was investigated . additionally , the effect of support modification by the organoaluminum compounds [ ( MAO , trimethlaluminum ( AlMe3 ) , or diethylaluminum chloride ( Et2AlCl ) ] on the behavior of the ClMg 2(THF)2 / Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst in the copolymerization process and on the properties of the copolymers was explored . immobilization of the Cp2ZrCl2 compound on the complex magnesium support MgCl2(THF)2 resulted in an effective system for the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene . the modification of the support as well as the kind of organoaluminum compound used as a modifier influenced the activity of the examined catalyst system . additionally , the profitable influence of immobilization of the homogeneous catalyst as well as modification of the support applied on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the copolymers was established . finally , with the successive self - nucleation / annealing procedure , the copolymers obtained over both homogeneous and heterogeneous metallocene catalysts were heterogeneous with respect to their chemical composition . 
statistical copolymers of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) with n-butyl- , s-butyl , t-butyl- , n-hexyl- , decyl- , stearyl- , allyl- , trimethylsilyl- and trimethylsilyloxyethyl methacrylate were prepared by zirconocene - catalyzed copolymerization . the reactivity ratios of MMA copolymers with butyl- , hexyl- , and stearyl methacrylate were estimated using the finemann - ross , the inverted finemann - ross , and the kelen - tudos graphical methods . structural parameters of the copolymers were obtained from the calculated dyad sequences , derived by using the reactivity ratios . the effect of the nature of the methacrylate ester group and the catalytic system used on the copolymer structure is discussed . the glass - transition temperature ( tg ) values of MMA copolymers with butyl- and hexyl methacrylate were measured and examined in the frame of several theoretical equations , allowing the prediction of these tg values . the best fit was obtained using barton and johnston equations , taking the monomer sequence distribution of the copolymers into account . 
metallocene and other transition metal complexes activated by methylaluminoxane are highly active catalysts for the polymerization of olefins , diolefins , and styrene , which was discovered at the university of hamburg about <nUm> years ago . these catalysts allow the synthesis of polymers with a highly defined microstructure , tacticity , and stereo - regularity , as well as new copolymers with superior properties such as film clarity , tensile strength , and lower extractables . A better understanding of the mechanism of olefin polymerization leads to findings of other new single site catalysts . the development of the metallocene / MAO - catalysts from their discovery to their present state of the art is presented . 
the copolymerization of propylene and 3-buten-1-ol protected with alkylaluminum [ trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) or triisobutylaluminum ] was conducted with an isospecific zirconocene catalyst [ rac-dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl) zirconium dichloride ] , combined with methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst , in the presence of additional TMA or H as the chain - transfer reagent if necessary . the results indicated that endhydroxylated polypropylene was obtained in the presence of the chain - transfer reagents because of the formation of dormant species after the insertion of the 3-buten-l-ol - based monomer followed by chain - transfer reactions . the selectivity of the chain - transfer reactions was influenced by the alkylaluminum protecting the comonomer and the catalyst structure . 
the copolymerization of ethylene and n-(vinylphenyl)carbazole ( VPC ) was carried out with constrained geometry catalysts ( CGC ) and isopropylidene-bridged zirconocene catalyst . the copolymerization of ethylene and styrene was successfully achieved with half - sandwiched titanocene catalysts which include bridged cyclopentadienyl and amino ligands . it was observed that the copolymer exhibited semicrystalline / rubbery , amorphous rubbery and amorphous / glassy features with increasing styrene content . the results show that the electronic interaction between VPC and the active species affected the reactivity of VPC rather than the steric factor of the active species . 
through the diels - alder reaction between cyclopentadiene groups attached to polystyrene in the presence of zirconocene , novel polystyrene - supported metallocene catalysts were prepared . A novel method for immobilizing metallocene catalysts was investigated , and the resultant polystyrene - supported metallocene for olefin polymerization was studied . the results of olefin polymerization showed that different crosslinking degrees of support in the catalyst system had significant effects on the catalytic behavior . the influence of the [Al] / [Zr] molar ratio and the temperature on the (co)polymerization activity was studied . when 1-hexene and 1-dodecene were used for copolymerization with ethylene , an obvious positive comonomer effect was observed . 
investigation of the characteristics and performance in propylene polymerization of silica - immobilized methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , in combination with a moderately and a highly isospecific zirconocene catalyst , has revealed that a simple impregnation of silica with MAO at ambient temperature is insufficient to obtain uniform distribution of MAO throughout the support particle . homogeneous Al distribution throughout the support , giving increased catalyst activity , was achieved by a more rigorous impregnation of silica with MAO at elevated temperatures . the highest catalyst activities were obtained by precontacting the MAO with the zirconocene to generate the activated species before immobilization on silica . polymer particle morphology was strongly dependent on the characteristics of the silica used for catalyst immobilization . 
statistical copolymers of methyl methacrylate with cyclohexyl and trimethylsilyloxy ethyl methacrylate were synthesized with two different catalytic systems based on the zirconocene complex Cp2ZrMe <nUm> . the reactivity ratios of methyl methacrylate and these methacrylates were calculated with the finemann - ross , inverted finemann - ross , and kelen - tudos graphical methods . the structural parameters of these copolymers were estimated from the calculation of the dyad monomer sequence fractions . two different borate cocatalysts were employed , and their effect on the copolymerization process is discussed . 
the polymerization behavior of cyclohexyl methacrylate and trimethyl-silyloxyethyl methacrylate with the catalytic system cp 2ZrMe2 / BC18F15 / ZnEt <nUm> was examined . block copolymers of these bulky methacrylates with methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) , having high molecular weights and relatively narrow molecular weight distributions , were prepared . n-Butyl acrylate and tert-butyl acrylate were polymerized with various catalytic systems based on zirconocene complexes . these polymerizations seemed to proceed to a nonquantitative yield , producing polymers with high molecular weights and relatively low polydispersities . this behavior indicated the presence of termination reactions in the initiation step , which appeared to be faster than the propagation step . block copolymers of these acrylates with MMA were synthesized with the catalytic system rac-Et(Ind)2ZrMe2 / [ B(C6F 5)4]-[Me2NHPh]+ / ZnEt <nUm> , starting from the polymerization of MMA . the block copolymers produced were well defined in most cases , as indicated by size exclusion chromatography , NMR , and differential scanning calorimetry measurements . 
an investigation of the polymer particle growth characteristics and polymer molecular weight and composition distributions in ethylene homopolymerization and ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization has been carried out with a catalyst comprising a zirconocene and methylaluminoxane immobilized on a silica support . the presence of 1-hexene leads to higher productivity and easier fragmentation of the support during particle growth . crystallization analysis fractionation and gel permeation chromatography analysis of ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers prepared at different polymerization times reveals a broadening of the chemical composition distribution with increasing polymerization time as a result of the gradual formation of a relatively high-molecular-weight , ethylene-rich fraction . the results are indicative of significant monomer diffusion effects in both homopolymerization and copolymerization . 
the formulation of the 4-butenyl end group in zirconocene with catalyzed propulene polymerization , was analyzed . the olefin polymerization with metallocene catalysts has attracted much academic and industrial research interest . the analysis of polymer chain ends provides key structural information for the determination of the chain transfer mechanisms in olefin polymerization . the catalyst solution was prepared in an inert atmosphere adding <nUm> mmol of RhCl(PPh <nUm> ) <nUm> in <nUm> ml of dry toluene . the evaluation of the intensity of unsaturated groups shows the percentage of 4-butenyl increases with respect to 2-butenyl in the treatment of the polymer with the hydride complex derived from RhCl(PPh <nUm> ) <nUm> . the results show that the mechanism of the formation of 4-butenyl chain ends may be the isomerization of cis 2-butenyl catalyzed by a zirconocene hydride complex formed in situ during polymerization . 
C1 - symmetric diastereoisomers of a zirconocene dichloride , SiMe2(3-benzylindenyl)(indenyl)ZrCl2 , known as catalyst precursors used to produce polypropy - lenes with similar molecular weights and tacticities , have been investigated in ethylene polymerization . activated by methylaluminoxane , they produce microstructurally different polymers : high - density polyethylene and linear low - density polyethylene , the latter characterized by the presence of ethyl branches . the formation of branches is relevant in the complex having a sterically more crowded ( inward ) site . A comparison with the complex without substituents , meso-SiMe2(indenyl) 2ZrCl2 , show that the presence of a benzyl group on only one of the two indenyl moieties can regulate the number of branches and the molecular weight of the macromolecule . actually , the unsubstituted complex is able to give double the number of branches and lower molecular weights , whereas the ci - symmetric disubstituted complexes previously reported generally give linear polyethylene . 
the impacts of propylene prepolymerization on ethylene / 1-hexene and ehylene / 1-octene copolymerization studies carried out with a catalyst comprising a zirconocene and MAO immobilized on a silica support were analyzed . the copolymerization of samples , following the prepolymerization , was carried out by the charging of the desired amount of the comonomer to the reactor , along with n-heptane and an ethylene pressure applied . the catalyst used was prepared by the impregnation of a silica support with a mixture of MAO and rac - et / ( ind ) 2ZrCl2 . results show that the application of a propylene prepolymerization was significantly increased in the subsequent ethylene polymerization . also , the prepolymerization of a silica - supported metallocene catalyst with propylene before ethylene / 1-hexene or ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization can lead to a narrowing of the CCD in the resulting copolymers . 
the copolymerization of propylene and disubstituted diallylsilanes [ ( CH2 = CH-CH2-)2R2Si ( r = CH <nUm> or C6H5 ) ] was investigated with isoselective and syndioselective zirconocene catalysts with methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst . the syndioselective catalyst showed a higher reactivity for disubstituted diallylsilanes than the isoselective catalysts . diallyldimethylsilane was incorporated into the polymer chain via cyclization insertion preferentially and formed 3,5-disubstituted dimethylsilacyclohexane units in the polypropylene main chain . In the copolymerization with diallyldiphenylsilane , diallyldiphenylsilane was copolymerized via both cyclization insertion and 1,2-insertion , which formed a pendant allyl group . the structures of isolated silacyclohexane units , determined by 13C NMR and distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer spectroscopy , proved that the 1,2-insertion of diallylsilanes proceeded with enantiomorphic site control ; however , the diastereoselectivity of the cyclization reaction was independent of the stereoselectivity of the catalysts used , and cis-silacyclohexane units were mainly formed . 
vinylcyclohexane ( VCH ) was copolymerized with ethene and propene using methylaluminoxane - activated metallocene catalysts . the catalyst precursor for the ethene copolymerization was rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)ZrCl2 ( 1 ) . propene copolymerizations were further studied with Cs - symmetric isopropylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl)ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , C 1-symmetric ethylene(l-indenyl-2-phenyl-2-fluorenyl)ZrCl2 ( 3 ) , and " meso " -dimethylsilyl[3-benzylindenyl)(2-methylbenz[e]indenyl) ]ZrCl2 ( 4 ) . catalyst <nUm> produced a random ethene - VCH copolymer with very high activity and moderate VCH incorporation . the highest comonomer content in the copolymer was <nUm> mol % . catalysts <nUm> and <nUm> produced poly(propene-co- vinylcyclohexane ) with moderate to good activities [ up to <nUm> and <nUm> kg of polymer / ( mol of catalyst × h ) for <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ] under similar reaction conditions but with fairly low comonomer contents ( up to <nUm> and <nUm> % for <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ) . catalysts <nUm> and <nUm> , both bearing a fluorenyl moiety , gave propene - VCH copolymers with only negligible amounts of the comonomer . the homopolymerization of VCH was performed with <nUm> as a reference , and low-molar-mass isotactic polyvinylcyclohexane with a low activity was obtained . 
the ring - opening polymerization of e-caprolactone ( e-CL ) and d-valerolactone ( d-VL ) using nine catalytic systems consisting of a combination of three C2V zirconocene complexes and three borate cocatalysts is discussed . the polymerizations proceed in a well - controlled manner , producing polymers with relatively high molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions . kinetic experiments of the polymerization of e-CL with the catalytic system Cp2ZrMe2 / B(C 6F5)3 ( 1 ) showed a linear dependence between polymerization yield and molecular weight with time , as well as between the molecular weight with the molar ratio of the monomer over the catalyst [e-CL] / [Zr] , indicating sufficient control of the polymerization reaction . the catalytic system ( 1 ) was utilized for the synthesis of well - defined block copolymers of MMA with e-CL and d-VL . all samples were characterized by size exclusion chroma - tography , nuclear magnetic resonance , and differential scanning calorimetry . 
mesoporous aluminas with average pore sizes of <nUm> - <nUm> nm were prepared by anodization of an aluminum film ( AAO ) , and by a sol - gel templating method ( TPL ) . In addition to a commercial alumina and sulfated TPL , the aluminas were used as supports for cyclopentadienyl zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl <nUm> ) and trimethyl(e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium ( Cp*ZrMe3 ) and tested in the polymerization of ethylene . the metallocenes supported on the alumina prepared with the templating method and its sulfated modification exhibited polymerization activities of <nUm> and <nUm> kgPE / ( molZr × h × bar ) , respectively , comparable to that obtained with silica - supported metallocenes ( <nUm> kg PE / ( molZr × h × bar ) ) . the acid site distribution of the aluminas was studied with FTIR and temperature programmed desorption ( TPD ) of pyridine , and also the amount of medium and strong acid sites was determined gravimetrically from the adsorption of pyridine . relative to the surface area , AAO with the highest amount of acid sites ( <nUm> mmolPY / mAAO2 ) adsorbed cp 2ZrCl2 and Cp*ZrMe3 the most . study of the polymers ' morphology with a scanning electron microscope revealed polyethylene nanofibers in all the polymer samples , also in those obtained from the reference polymerizations with homogeneous Cp2ZrCl2 and Cp*ZrMe3 . this finding suggests that a catalyst support with a tubular pore structure is not a prerequisite for the formation of polymer nanofibers . 
poly(propylene-ran-1,3-butadiene) was synthesized using isospecific zirconocene catalysts and converted to telechelic isotactic polypropylene by metathesis degradation with ethylene . the copolymers obtained with isospecific C2 - symmetric zirconocene catalysts activated with modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) had 1,4-inserted butadiene units ( 1,4-BD ) and 1,2-inserted units ( 1,2-BD ) in the isotactic polypropylene chain . the selectivity of butadiene towards 1,4-BD incorporation was high up to <nUm> % using rac-dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( Cat-A ) / MMAO . the molar ratio of propylene to butadiene in the feed regulated the numberaverage molecular weight ( Mn ) and the butadiene contents of the polymer produced . metathesis degradations of the copolymer with ethylene were conducted with a CI6W / SnMe4 / propyl acetate catalyst system . the 1H NMR spectra before and after the degradation indicated that the polymers degraded by ethylene had vinyl groups at both chain ends in high selectivity . the analysis of the chain scission products clarified the chain end structures of the poly(propylene-ran-1,3-butadiene) . 
the influence of ligand structure on copolymerization properties of metallocene catalysts was elucidated with three C1 - symmetric methylalumoxane ( MAO ) activated zirconocene dichlorides , ethylene(1-(7 , 9)-diphenylcyclopenta-[a]-acenaphthadienyl-2-phenyl-2-cyclopentadienyl)ZrCl <nUm> ( 1 ) , ethylene(1-(7 , 9)-diphenylcyclopenta[a]-acenaphthadienyl-2- phenyl-2-fluorenyl)ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , and ethylene(1-(9)-fluorenyl-(R)1- phenyl-2-(1-indenyl)ZrCl2 ( 3 ) . polyethenes produced with <nUm> / MAO had considerable , ca. <nUm> % amount of trans-vinylene end groups , resulting from the chain end isomerization prior to the chain termination . when ethene was copolymerized with 1-hexene or 1-hexadecene using <nUm> / MAO , molar mass of the copolymers varied from high to moderate ( 531-116 kg / mol ) depending on the comonomer feed . At <nUm> % comonomer feed , ethene / 1-olefin copolymers with high hexene or hexadecene content ( around <nUm> % ) were achievable . In the series of catalysts , polyethenes with highest molar mass , up to <nUm> kg / mol , were obtained with sterically most crowded <nUm> / MAO , but the catalyst was only moderately active to copolymerize higher olefins . catalyst <nUm> / MAO produced polyethenes with extremely small amounts of trans-vinylene end groups and relatively low molar mass 1-hexene copolymers ( from <nUm> to <nUm> kg / mol ) with similar comonomer content as <nUm> . these results indicate that the catalyst structure , which favors chain end isomerization , is also capable to produce high molar mass 1-olefin copolymers with high comonomer content . In addition , an exceptionally strong synergetic effect of the comonomer on the polymerization activity was observed with catalyst <nUm> / MAO . 
C2 - symmetric group <nUm> metallocenes based catalysts ( rac - [ CH 2(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 ( 1 ) , rac-[CH2(1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 ( 2 ) and rac - [ CH 2(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]TiCl2 ( 3 ) ) are able to copolymerize styrene and 1,3-butadiene , to give products with high molecular weight . In agreement with symmetry properties of metallocene precatalysts , styrene homosequences are in isotactic arrangements . full determination of microstructure of copolymers was obtained by 13C NMR and FTIR analysis and it reveals that insertion of butadiene on styrene chain - end happens prevailingly with 1,4-trans configuration . In the butadiene homosequences , using zirconocene - based catalysts , the 1,4-trans arrangement is favored over 1,4-cis , but the latter is prevailing in the presence of titanocene ( 3 ) . diad composition analysis of the copolymers makes possible to estimate the reactivity ratios of copolymerization : zirconocenes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) produced copolymers having r1 × r2 = <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ( where <nUm> refers to styrene and <nUm> to butadiene ) ; while titanocene ( 3 ) gave tendencially blocky styrene-butadiene copolymers ( r1 × r2 = <nUm> ) . the copolymers do not exhibit crystallinity , even when they contain a high molar fraction of styrene . probably , comonomer homosequences are too short to crystallize ( ns <nUm> , in the copolymer at highest styrene molar fraction ) . 
we inclusively investigated polymerization behavior and structure of co-polymer in the copolymerization of propylene and alkylaluminum - protected polar allyl monomers . the control of the arrangement of polar group in the copolymer was discussed . it was proved that the location of polar group could be controlled by zirconocene catalyst and a kind of polar monomer . the indenyl or the 2-methylindenyl ligands of zirconocene were favored to produce end - functionalized polymers . it was also found that the trimethylaluminum- protected allylamine and triisobutylaluminum - protected allylmercaptan had superior ability in the synthesis of end - functionalized polypropylene . on the other hand , the 2-methyl-4-phenylindenyl ligand produced the copolymers containing both the end - polar unit and inner - polar unit at the polymer chains . terpolymerization of propylene , polar allyl monomer , and 5-hexen-1-ol was also conducted . the NMR study of the terpolymer revealed that both the 5-hexen-1-ol and the polar allyl monomer were incorporated into the polymer chain . it has also become apparent that the polar allyl monomer units predominantly occupied the chain end , while the 5-hexen-1-ol units were located at the inner of main chain . consequently , we have achieved the synthesis of functionalized polypropylene in which the arrangement of polar group was precisely controlled . 
highly filled polyethylene (PE)-based nanocomposites were obtained by in situ polymerization technique . an organically modified montmorillonite , cloisite ® <nUm> A ( C15A ) , was previously treated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) to form a supported cocatalyst ( C15A / MA0 ) before being contacted with a zirconocene catalyst . the main features of C15A / MA0 intermediates were studied by elemental analysis , TGA , TGA - FTIR , WAXD , and TEM . MAO reacts with the clay , replaces most of the organic surfactant within the clay galleries and destroys the typical crystrallographic order of the nanoclay . the catalytic activity in the presence of C15A / MAO is higher than in ethylene polymerization without any inorganic filler and increases with MAO supportation time . this indicates that part of the polymer chains grows within the clay galleries , separates them , and makes it possible to tune the final morphology of the composites . the polymerization results and the influence of C15A pretreatment and polymerization conditions on thermal and morphological properties of the hybrid PE / C15A nanocomposites are presented . 
the copolymerization of ethylene ( e ) and norbornene ( NB ) was investigated using the commercially available and inexpensive catalyst system , cyclopentadienylzirconium trichloride (CpZrCl3)Zisobutyl-modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) , at a moderate polymerization temperature in toluene . for the CpZrCl3 catalyst system activated by aluminoxane with a <nUm> mol % methyl group and a <nUm> mol % isobutyl group ( MMAO ) , the quantities of the charged NB and the polymerization temperature significantly affected the molecular weights , polydispersities , and NB contents of the obtained copolymers and the copolymerization activities in all the experiments . As the charged NB increased and thereby the NB / e molar ratio increased , the NB content in the copolymer increased and reached a maximum value of <nUm> mol % . the CpZrCl <nUm> / MMAO ( [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> ) catalyst system with the [NB] of <nUm> mol L-1 and ethylene of <nUm> MPa at <nUm> ° C showed the highest activity of <nUm> kg molZr.-1 h-1 and molecular weight of <nUm> g mol-1 . the 13C NMR analysis showed that the CpZrCl3 / MMAO catalyst system produced the E-NB random copolymer with a number of NB homosequences such as the NN dyad and NNN triad . 
copolymerizations of ethylene or propylene and allyl monomers containing 9-fluorenyl group , diallyl-di-9-fluorenylsilane ( DAFS ) , 9,9-diallylfluorene ( DAF ) , and 9-allylfluorene ( AF ) , were investigated with various zirconocene catalysts using methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst . the bridged zirconocene catalysts , especially a syndioselective catalyst , showed a higher reactivity for all the comonomers than the nonbridged catalysts . DAFS was mainly incorporated into the polymer chain via cyclization insertion , whereas DAF was copolymerized via both 1,2-and cyclization insertions . cyclization selectivity , ratio of cyclized insertion unit , of DAF in the copolymerization with propylene was higher than that in the copolymerization with ethylene . copolymerization with AF yielded low - molecular weight copolymer because of frequent chain transfer reaction . optical properties of the propylene based - copolymers were investigated by UV - vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy , and absorption - and emission - derived from fluorenyl groups were detected in the copolymers . 
monodisperse cyano-functionalized porous polymeric beads were synthesized by seeded polymerization ; these microparticles were further used as support for zirconocene catalyst , which performed as a solid homogeneous catalyst in ethylene polymerization . 
copolymerization of ethylene and diallyl-bis(pyren-1-yl)-silane ( APyS ) was investigated with zirconocene catalysts , rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) and diphenylmethylene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 2 ) , using methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst . APyS was copolymerized via both 1,2-insertion and cyclization insertion , and cyclization selectivity , ratio of cyclized insertion unit , of APyS in the copolymers obtained with catalyst <nUm> was higher than that obtained with catalyst <nUm> . catalyst <nUm> showed a higher reactivity for APyS than catalyst <nUm> . photophysical properties of the copolymer were investigated by UV - vis and photoluminescence ( PL ) spectroscopy , and absorption and fluorescence derived from pyrenyl groups were detected in the copolymers . chloroform solution of the copolymer showed emission derived from both monomer and eximer of pyrenyl units . only the emission derived from eximer of pyrenyl units was observed in the cast film . the polarized PL spectrum of an oriented film showed anisotropy , and the polarization excitation parallel to the drawing direction showed high fluorescence intensity . 


the electron ionization mass spectrometric behaviour of a new series of hafnocene and zirconocene diadamantanolates is discussed . they are also compared on the basis of mass-analyzed ion kinetic energy spectrometry . fragmentation patterns of the complexes in question give relevant information on their gas-phase behaviour as MO2 / MC ( m = Zr , Hf ) precursors for metal-organic chemical vapour deposition . 
two supported metallocene catalysts ( CS : PQ <nUm> / MAO / cp 2ZrCl <nUm> and CS <nUm> : PQ 3030-BuGeCl <nUm> / MAO / cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ) were prepared by sequentially loading MAO and cp 2ZrCl <nUm> on partially dehydroxylated silica PQ <nUm> . In catalyst CS <nUm> , nBuGeCl <nUm> was used to functionalize the silica . these catalysts were characterized by DR - FTIR spectroscopy , CPMAS NMR spectroscopy , and XPS . their catalytic performance was evaluated by polymerizing ethylene using the MAO cocatalyst and characterizing the resulting polymers by GPC . both catalysts produced two metallocenium cations ( cation <nUm> : [ cp 2ZrCl ] + and cation <nUm> : [ cp 2ZrMe ] + ) with comparable equilibrium concentrations and showed varying solid - state electronic environments . the modified supports ( PQ <nUm> / MAO and PQ 3030-BuGeCl <nUm> / MAO ) acted as weakly coordinating polyanions and stabilized the above cations . BuGeCl <nUm> did not affect the solid - state electronic environment . however , it increased the surface cocatalyst to catalyst molar ratio ( Al : Zr ) , acted as a spacer , increased catalyst activity , and enhanced chain - transfer reactions . the separately fed MAO cocatalyst shifted the equilibrium between cation <nUm> and cation <nUm> toward the right . consequently , more cation <nUm> was generated , which acted as the effective and active single - site catalytic species producing monomodal PDI . 

imidozirconocene complexes ( Cp2Zr = NR(THF) ) possess a rich reaction chemistry , in contrast to many imido complexes of later transition metals . the synthesis and structural characteristics of these compounds are briefly described , along with a qualitative molecular orbital description of the metallocene - imido interaction . imidozirconocene complexes react at the Zr = N linkage with a variety of X-H bonds , and undergo overall [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition reactions with a wide range of unsaturated organic and organometallic compounds . results of studies detailing the scope and mechanism of these reactions are presented herein , along with applications to catalytic hydroamination , imine metathesis , and asymmetric transformations . 
radical reactions mediated by schwartz reagent and zirconocene(alkene) complex are firstly described . schwartz reagent is a promising alternative to tributyltin hydride and the first transition metal hydrido complex used as a radical mediator in organic synthesis . A zirconocene ( alkene ) complex effects single electron transfer to alkyl halide to generate the corresponding alkyl radical . secondly , serendipitous allylic C - H bond activation of the coordinating alkene of zirconocene(alkene) complex and its application to organic synthesis are summarized . by utilizing equilibrium between zirconocene(alkene) and zirconocene 2-alkenyl hydride , reaction of acid chloride with zirconocene(alkene) provides the corresponding homoallylic alcohol by sequential attacks of the hydride and 2-alkenyl moieties . A set of hydride and 2-alkenyl attacks on 1,4-diketone yields 6-heptene-1,4-diol derivative in high yield with high stereoselectivity . selective capture of the hydride with diisopropyl ketone gives zirconocene 2-alkenyl alkoxide , which is a useful reagent for stereoselective allylation of aldehyde and imine . a-Halo carbonyl compounds undergo radical allylation with the zirconocene 2-alkenyl alkoxide which serves as a substitute for allyltin . 
metal contents in supported zirconocene catalysts were comparatively determined by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and rutherford backscattering spectrometry . A series of supported zirconocenes was prepared by grafting sequentially Cp2ZrCl2 ( cp = cyclopentadienyl ) and (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 on to silica . the addition order and molar ratio of the two catalysts were varied . the grafted metal content was shown to be coherent between the two techniques and was between <nUm> and <nUm> wt % Zr / O2Si . the steric effect played by the ligand influences the final zirconocene grafted content . No influence of the grafting order was observed . nevertheless , catalyst systems in which (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 was either immobilized in the first place or at a higher molar ratio were shown to be more active in ethylene polymerization . extended x-ray absorption fine structure analysis in the Zr - edge showed that systems bearing cp 2ZrCl2 and (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 in a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio afforded a more disoriented system . according to electron probe microanalysis , the metal distribution in the catalyst particle was more uniform than that resulting from the immobilization of solely ( nBuCp ) 2ZrCl2 on silica . 
Cp2ZrCl2 setzt sich mit Li(THF)2PHCy ( cy = C6H11 ) zu der metallacyclischen verbindung cp2 <nUm> , um . im 31P{1H}-NMR-Spektrum von <nUm> , tritt das fur ein A2X-System zu erwartende aufspaltungsmuster auf , was auf das vorliegen der meso-Formen in losung hinweist . auch im festkorper liegen nur die meso-Formen vor . <nUm> , kristallisiert monoklin in der raumgruppe P21 / n ( nr . <nUm> ) mit a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 und vier formeleinheiten pro elementarzelle ( <nUm> unabhangige beobachtete reflexe , r = <nUm> % ) . der zentrale ZrP3-Ring in <nUm> , ist angenahert planar . die ZrP-Bindungslangen sind mit <nUm> und <nUm> Å fast gleich .

Es wird uber die synthese und die NMR-spektroskopische charakterisierung von zirconocendibenzylen mit substituierten cyclopentadienylringen und den einfluss der substituenten auf die bindungen zwischen dem zirconiumatom und den benzylgruppen berichtet . die molekulstruktur von (Me3SiC5H4)2Zr(CH2C6H5)2 wird mitgeteilt und diskutiert . 
bei reaktionen substituierter zirconocendichloride , Cp2ZrCl2 , mit vinyllithium entstehen in abhangigkeit von der anzahl und der raumerfullung der substituenten zirconacyclopent-2-ene , cp2 ( formula presented . ) H , oder Zirconocen-butadien-Komplexe , Cp2Zr(C4H6) . diese verbindungen wurden durch ihre 1H- und 13C-NMR-Spektren charakterisiert . die werte der 91Zr-NMR-chemischen verschiebungen der substituierten Cp'2ZrCl2 stehen in beziehung zu den jeweiligen bindungswinkeln Cp'ZrCp' bzw . ClZrCl und sind damit als empirische parameter fur die abschatzung des reaktionsverhaltens von zirconocendichloriden geeignet . 
die substitution des THF-Liganden in Cp2Zr(THF)(Me3SiCCSiMe3) ( 1 ) durch pyridin ergibt den komplex Cp2Zr(e1-NC5H5)(Me3SiCCSiMe3) ( 3 ) . im gegensatz zu <nUm> ist komplex <nUm> stabil in kohlenwasserstoffen . In temperaturabhangigen 1H- und 13C-NMR-Spektren zeigt <nUm> in losung dynamisches verhalten durch eine rotation des Alkin-Liganden . zusatzlich tritt beim losen von <nUm> in pyridin ein austausch zwischen koordinierten und freien Pyridin-Molekulen auf . die kristallstrukturanalyse von <nUm> belegt eine tetraedrische koordinationsgeometrie am Zirkonium-Zentrum bestehend aus den cp- , alkin- und Pyridin-Liganden . der komplex <nUm> reagiert wie verbindung <nUm> mit wasser und kohlendioxid zu gleichen produkten . 
pyridinverbruckte metallocendichloride des typs C5H3N-2,6-(CH2C5H4)2MCl2 ( m = Zr ( 2 ) , Hf ( 5 ) ) wurden synthetisiert . aufgrund einer N → Zr-Wechselwirkung wird die bildung von Zirconocen-Kationen begunstigt . so entsteht bei der einwirkung von feuchtigkeit auf <nUm> die ionisch aufgebaute verbindung [C5H3N-2,6-(CH2C5H4)2Zr(Cl)(OH2)]2[ZrCl6] <nUm> . die verbindungen wurden 1H-NMR und MS-spektroskopisch charakterisiert . die kristallstruktur von <nUm> lasst eine verknupfung der kationen und anionen uber H-Bruckenbindungen erkennen . 
die reaktion von (Z)Cp2Zr{C(Ph) = C(H)P(SiMe3)2}(Cl) mit lithiumphenylacetylid liefert den Zirkonocen-Alkinyl-Alkenyl-Komplex (Z)Cp2Zr(CCPh){C(Ph) = C(H)P(SiMe3)2 } ( 1 ) . <nUm> wurde spektroskopisch ( IR , NMR , MS ) und rontgenstrukturanalytisch charakterisiert . die verbindung kristallisiert triklin in der raumgruppe P1 mit a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> , β = <nUm> , γ = <nUm> ° . <nUm> weist zwei unterschiedliche ZrC-Bindungslangen auf ( ZrC( = C ) ) <nUm> , ZrC(C) <nUm> Å ) . im festkorper wird eine ZrP-Wechselwirkung beobachtet ( ZrP <nUm> Å ) . 
the zirconocene bisphosphanido complexes [ (e-C5H4R)2Zr{PH(2,4,6-iPr 3C6H2)}2 ] ( r = me , H ) react with [(NBD)M(CO)4] ( NBD = norbornadiene , m = Cr , Mo ) to give only one diastereomer of the phosphanido-bridged heterobimetallic dinuclear complexes cis-rac-[(e-C5H4R)2Zr{m-PH(2,4,6- iPr3C6H2)}2M(CO) <nUm> ] [ r = me , m = Cr ( 1 ) , Mo ( 2 ) ; r = H , m = Mo ( 3 ) ] . however , no reaction was observed between and [ (e-C5H5)2Zr{PH(2,4,6-tBu 3C6H2)}2 ] and [Pt(PPh3)4] . 1-3 were characterised spectroscopically . for 1-3 , the presence of the racemic isomer was shown by NMR spectroscopy .

the reaction of [ cp ° 2Zr(OOCCH2SH-k 1O)(OOCCH2SH-k2O,O') ] with [Cp'2MoH2] yields the dinuclear Zr IV / IMoV complex [ cp ° 2Zr(OOCCH 2S-k2O,S)(m-O-OOCCH2S-k 1O , k2O',S)(MoCp'2) ] ( 1 ) ( cp ° = C5EtMe4 , cp' = C5MeH <nUm> ) . for comparison of NMR data , [ Cp'2Mo(OOCCH 2S-k2O,S ) ] ( 2 ) was prepared from [ cp' 2MoH2 ] and mercaptoacetic acid . <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized spectroscopically ( 1H , 13C NMR and IR ) and a crystal structure determination was carried out on <nUm> . 
the secondary hydroxyalkylphosphanes RPHCH2OH [ r = 2,4,6-Me 3C6H2 ( mes ) ( 1 ) , 2,4,6-iPr 3C6H2 ( tipp ) ( 2 ) ] , 1-AdPH-2-OH-cyclo-C 6H10 ( 3 ) and RPH(CH2)3OH [ r = ph ( 4 ) , mes ( 5 ) , tipp ( 6 ) , cy ( 7 ) , tBu ( 8 ) ] were obtained from primary phosphanes RPH2 and formaldehyde ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) or from LiPHR and cyclohexene oxide ( 3 ) or trimethylene oxide ( 4-8 ) . starting from <nUm> or <nUm> and [ cp R2ZrMe2 ] [ CpR = C 5EtMe4 ( cp ° ) , CH ( cp ) , C 5MeH4 ( cp' ) ] , the monoalkoxyphosphane - substituted zirconocene complexes [ CpR2Zr(Me){O(CH2) 3PHMes } ] [ CpR = cp ° ( 9 ) , cp ( 10 ) ] were prepared . with [CpR2ZrCl2] , the bisalkoxyphosphane - substituted complexes [ Cp'2Zr{O(CH2)3PHMes} <nUm> ] ( 11 ) and [ Cp2Zr{O(CH2)3PHCy} <nUm> ] ( 12 ) are obtained , and with [TpRZrCl3] , the trisalkoxyphosphane - substituted zirconium complexes [ TpRZr{O(CH 2)3PHMes}3 ] [ TpR = trispyrazolylborato ( tp ) ( 13 ) , TpR = tris(3,5-dimethyl) pyrazolylborato ( tp* ) ( 14 ) ] are prepared . the reaction of <nUm> with [AuCl(tht)] ( tht = tetrahydrothiophene ) yielded the mononuclear complex [AuCl{PHMes(CH2)3OH}] ( 15 ) . the trinuclear complex [Cp2Zr{O(CH2)3PHMes(AuCl)}2] ( 16 ) was obtained from [Cp2ZrCl2] and <nUm> . compounds 1-16 were characterized spectroscopically ( 1H- , 31P- , 13C - NMR ; IR ; MS ) and compound <nUm> also by crystal structure determination . the bis- and tris-alkoxyphosphane - substituted complexes 11-14 and <nUm> were obtained as mixtures of two diastereomers which could not be separated . 
the enantiomeric pure TADDOLate complexes of the heavier group <nUm> metals [(e5-C5H5)2M{(S,S)-TADDOLate}] ( m = Zr , Hf ) were prepared by treatment of (S,S)-TADDOL with <nUm> equivalents of n-butyl lithium followed by reaction with zirconocene and hafnocene dichloride , respectively . the new complexes have been characterized by standard analytical / spectroscopic techniques and the solid - state structures of both compounds were established by single crystal x-ray diffraction . the title compounds are the first fully characterized TADDOLate complexes of zirconium and hafnium . 

the effect of the structure and surface properties of support material on metallocene ( zirconocene chloride ) adsorption and catalyst activity in ethene polymerization was studied . commercial grace silica , mesoporous silicate , MCM-41 , and aluminium - modified MCM-41 were used as supports . the highest amount of zirconocene dichloride was adsorbed on Al - modified MCM-41 ( Si / Al = <nUm> ) , providing the most reactive sites for attachment of the active component on the support surface . the 13C-CPMAS NMR studies proved that Cp2ZrCl2 is bound to the support surface . also the highest activity in ethene polymerization was obtained using this support . 
we studied a ZSM-5 zeolite as metallocene support for ethylene polymerization . we transformed the Na-ZSM-5 into H-ZSM-5 . after the cation exchange , the zeolite was calcined at three different temperatures . characterization of the material indicated that by means of the calcination procedure it is possible to produce dealuminization with an increase in extraframework aluminum ( EFAL ) . we prepared zirconocene - supported catalysts on zeolitic supports using two preparation methods . the higher activity was observed with the zirconocene supported on ZSM-5 pre-treated at <nUm> ° C . we think that the dealuminization process generates an increase in EFAL . this EFAL is responsible for the higher activity . 
the concept of the frustrated lewis pair ( FLP ) offers a valuable paradigm for transition metal complexes . this chapter describes recent developments in FLP chemistry where one or both of the lewis acidic or lewis basic components are based on a transition metal . At the forefront of these developments have been zirconocene - phosphinoaryloxide complexes ; the activation of small molecules , including H , CO2 , ethers , olefins and alkyl chlorides or fluorides , with such zirconocene ( or group <nUm> metallocene in general ) phosphine pairs is described . nascent catalytic applications for such complexes in dehydrogenation reactions and future possibilities for catalytic reactivity are also highlighted . A wider discussion of how the FLP concept may rationalise previous examples of cooperative reactivity in transition metal complexes , such as the heterolytic cleavage of hydrogen , suggests a strong and useful analogy . 
the development of ansa - metallocene catalysts is considered along several lines of interest-ansa-metallocene complexes with different ligand frameworks , insights gained with regard to relevant reaction intermediates and contributions of ansa - metallocene catalysts to industrial polymer production - with a view toward the present state of the art in these fields of catalysis research . 
spontaneously formed fibers are formed from a number of metal - containing polymers when synthesized employing the interfacial polymerization system . this topic is reviewed with emphasis on group IVB and organotin - containing polymers . over <nUm> organotin polymers were surveyed for fiber formation . it is believed that fiber formation is favored when the backbone is rigid . the fibers have aspect ratios over <nUm> . their use as fibers in composites is encouraged . 

twentytwo new substituted metallocene Cp1Cp2MCl2 ( m = Ti , Zr or Hf ) dichlorides have been prepared and the catalytic activity of some of them in alkene polymerization has been primarily evaluated . 
the cp < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ClZr < inf > <nUm> < / inf > / C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > AlCl < inf > <nUm> < / inf > system ( cp = p-cyclopentadienyl ) was found to be an active catalyst for polymerization of alkynes . both internal and terminal alkynes were polymerized by this homogeneous catalytic system . spectroscopic observation of a zirconacyclopentadiene compound in the above reaction led to the investigation of zirconacyclopentadienes as possible reaction intermediates . the zirconacyclopentadiene on reaction with phenylacetylene produced larger zirconacycles and poly-(phenylacetylene) . apparently , the mechanism of polymerization of alkynes is by successive insertion of the alkyne into the zirconium-carbon bond , producing expanded zirconacycles , elimination of which results in the formation of a polyalkyne . 
propene was polymerized with ethylene bis(-1-indenyl)-dichlorozirconium ( Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) and methylalumoxane ( MAO ) at <nUm> ° C . the polymer was fractionated by solvent extraction ; there was no hexane insoluble material . the pentane insoluble , hexane soluble ( C5iC6s ) fraction contains <nUm> % mmmm pentads . it has x-ray crystallinity of <nUm> % comprised of <nUm> % g-phase , and no NMR detectable misinsertions . however , 1,3-insertion was found in the more soluble fractions . 
polymerization of ethylene and copolymerization of ethylene-propylene proceeded smoothly by using homometallic binuclear zirconium complex <nUm> or heterometallic binuclear zirconium - titanium complex <nUm> / methylaluminoxane catalyst system . the molecular weight distributions of polymers obtained by the binuclear zirconium complexes were broader than that produced by mononuclear zirconium complex . 
the catalytic performance ( activity and polymer properties ) of metallocenes with different symmetries in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) in the polymerization of propylene has been investigated at different temperatures , under standardized reaction conditions . the zirconocene rac-ethylene ( e5-1-indenyl ) zirconium ( IV ) dichloride , with C2 symmetry , produces isotatic polypropylene and isopropylidene(e5-cyclopentadienyl ( e5-9-fluorenyl ) zirconium ( IV ) dichloride , with CS symmetry , syndiotactic polypropylene . the degree of the tacticity of these polymers increases with decreasing polymerization temperature . only atactic polypropylene was formed with the unbridged zirconocenes bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl) zirconium ( IV ) dichloride and bis(e5-indenyl zirconium ( IV ) dichloride at any temperature investigated ( 10-60 ° C ) . 
the comparison of the copolymers obtained with the Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO and Cp2HfCl2 / MAO catalyst systems showed that the catalyst having hafnocene was much more reactive towards 1-octadecene than zirconocene . the comonomer concentration had to be three times higher in the zirconocene copolymerization than in the hafnocene copolymerization when the level of <nUm> mol- % was reached . although the hafnocene catalyst was more reactive towards 1-octadecene , the molecular weights were higher than in the copolymers obtained with the zirconocene catalyst . the total activity of the zirconocene was <nUm> times higher than with the hafnocene catalyst . with the zirconocene catalyst the activity towards ethylene was constantly increasing by increasing the comonomer concentration but stayed nearly constant with the hafnocene catalyst . it seemed that there is no rate enhancement effect upon comonomer addition with the hafnocene catalyst . 
three ethylene-bridged unsymmetric zirconocene dichlorides bearing a cyclopentadienyl unit together with either a tetraphenylcyclopentadienyl- ( 8 ) , a 7,9-diphenylcyclopent[a]-acenaphtha-dienyl-(9) or a fluorenyl group ( 10 ) were used for propene polymerization after activation with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) at <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> ° C . whereas <nUm> is inactive at all , <nUm> produces atactic polypropene waxes with high activity . the polypropene products of <nUm> are syndiotactic with stereoregularities depending on the polymerization temperature as well as on monomer and on MAO concentration . 
polymerization of propylene was carried out at <nUm> ° C in the presence of methyl methacrylate(MMA) or ethyl benzoate(EB) using rac-Et(Ind)2ZrMe2 or rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrMe2 / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 as catalyst , which resulted in highly isotactic poly(propylene) with [mmmm] > <nUm> % , Tm = 160-161 ° C and very few 1,3- or <nUm> regioirregular units . with the use of an achiral zirconocene Cp2ZrMe2 , a polymer with Tm = <nUm> ° C was resulted as well . base on these experimental fact that the zirconocene can form a C1 - symmetrical complex with a lewis base . 
the norbornene / ethene copolymerization was investigated by using two CS - symmetric ( [Me2C(Fluo)(Cp)]ZrCl2III , [Ph2C(Fluo)(Cp)]ZrCl2IB ) and two C2 - symmetric ( [Me2Si(Ind)2]ZrCl2I , [Ph2Si(Ind)2]ZrCl2II ) catalysts with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst . this investigation focussed not only on the different polymerization behavior , like catalyst activity , but also considers the material properties of the synthesized copolymers . it was found , that the CS - symimetric catalysts are very well suitable to yield amorphous copolymers with glass transition temperatures above <nUm> ° C and molecular weights > <nUm> g / mol . these copolymers could be used as potential starting materials for optical discs and fibers . 
the antitumor activity of the metallocene dichlorides TDC , ZDC , and HDC against ehrlich ascites tumor in CF <nUm> mice is investigated . A single i.p. injection of TDC in the optimum dose ( 30-60 mg / kg ) <nUm> h p.t.t . achieves survival of 80-90 % of the animals until day <nUm> p.t.t . without any tumor manifestation . this indicates an increase in the mean survival time of about <nUm> % referred to the untreated animals . In contrast , ZDC and HDC exhibit no recognizable antineoplastic properties under equal experimental conditions . assuming a similar mechanism of tumor inhibition for both DDP and the antineoplastic active metallocene dichlorides TDC , VDC , and MDC , the comparatively increased non-bonding Cl ... Cl distance ( " bite " ) of ZDC and HDC may be responsible for the cancerostatic inactivity of the latter compounds . 
the in vitro growth - inhibiting potencies of titanocene dichloride ( TDC ) , zirconocene dichloride ( ZDC ) , hafnocene dichloride ( HDC ) , vanadocene dichloride ( VDC ) , and molybdocene dichloride ( MDC ) against ehrlich ascites tumor ( EAT ) cells cultured in vitro as permanently growing suspension cultures were determined . the most striking growth - suppression activity was detected for VDC . A VDC concentration as low as <nUm> · <nUm> < sup > <nUm> < / sup > mol / l effects a highly significant diminution of cell proliferation . TDC and MDC inhibit cellular growth only in concentrations of <nUm> · <nUm> < sup > <nUm> < / sup > or <nUm> < sup > <nUm> < / sup > mol / l , respectively , whereas ZDC and HDC , which are ineffective against EAT cells in vivo , require higher concentration levels . the growth inhibition is caused by a cytotoxic action of the metallocene dichlorides , as is demonstrated in the case of VDC and TDC by differentiation of live and dead EAT cells by means of the dye lissamine green . 
by reaction of the [1]zirconocenophane(CH)3)2Si(C5H4)2ZrCl2 with equivalent amounts of Li Et3BH and sulfur , C12H14S5SiZr can be prepared as chelate complex . the structure of this S5Zr chelate is discussed on the basis of its1H NMR spectrum . 
<nUm> . the thermal and photoinduced reactions of Cp2MMMe2 ( m = Ti , Zr ) with Et3EH ( e = Ge , Sn ) produce <nUm> mole of Et6E2 , <nUm> moles of methane , and <nUm> mole of Cp2M . compounds with the general formula Cp2M(EEt3)2 could not be obtained . <nUm> . the exchange reaction of Cp2MCl2 ( m = Ti , Zr ) with Et3ELi ( e = Ge , Sn ) in THF or toluene at <nUm> ° C results in the formation of compounds with the general formula Cp2M(EEt3)2 , which decompose at <nUm> ° C , yielding <nUm> mole of Et6E2 and an adduct of the biscyclopentadienyl derivative of the metal with THF . 
A new class of polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane ( POSS ) copolymers has been developed by incorporating into a polymer backbone the POSS disilanol macromer , (c-C6H11)8Si8O11(OH)2 , along with a variety of inorganic comonomers . these new inorganic cluster - based copolymers were synthesized using a condensation polymerization approach , with formation of metal oxygen bonds and climination of ClH ( as HNEt3 Cl ) or CH4 driving the reaction . the polymers thus formed are isolated as amorphous powders but do not display any observable glass transition ; they decompose without melting at over <nUm> C under nitrogen . especially interesting is the formation of a zirconocene - bridged copolymer which is stable to both air and methanol . 
zirconocene and hafnocene dihydrides Cp2MH2 ( m = Zr , Hf ) are capable of rapid absorbing carbon dioxide at room temperature and atmospheric pressure in a THF medium . In the case of Cp2ZrH2 , the reaction results in the cleavage of the C = O bond of a CO2 molecule to form cyclic trimeric zirconocene oxide [Cp2ZrO]3 , whose structure was confirmed by analytical and spectral methods as well as by x-ray diffraction study . small amounts of formaldehyde and methyl formate are found in the organic products of the reaction . 
A mixture of rac- and meso-2,2'-propylidene-bis(e <nUm> -indenyl)zirconium dichlorides was obtained in <nUm> % yield . the compounds were separated , and their structures were established by x-ray structural analysis . 
Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and the MAO co-catalyst , which polymerize ethylene and propylene , were heterogenized on partially dehydroxylated davison silica <nUm> , following the method of equilibrium adsorption . the dispersion of these catalyst components on the silica support was investigated by measuring the spatial concentration profiles of Si , Al , and Zr using a micro-PIXE technique . these components were found to be uniformly distributed over the support irrespective of the variation in the heterogenization procedures and the experimental conditions used . the Si : Al ratios determined by the micro- PIXE technique were similar to those measured by the spectrophotometric method . however , the Al : Zr ratios measured by the former were somewhat lower than those determined by the latter . Micro-PIXE measurements confirmed the presence of several trace impurities such as K , Ca , Ti , Fe , Ni , Cu , and Zn which may potentially poison the resulting catalyst . 
ansa-{e <nUm> ,e 5' -[1,1'-(1-Silacyclopent-3-ene-1,1-diyl)bis(indenyl)] } dichlorozirconium ( 1a,b ) was synthesized . the crystal structure of meso-[(1,4-CH <nUm> CH = CHCH <nUm> )Si(C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ] ( 1b ) was established by x-ray diffraction analysis . photoinduced interconversion of the racemic ( 1a ) and meso forms was studied under various conditions . the photostationary state ( rac : meso = <nUm> : <nUm> ) was established rapidly when solutions of ansa - zirconocene were irradiated with visible light . 
an efficient synthetic approach to 3-alkyl(aryl)-2-bromoindenes was developed . the reaction of 2-bromo-3-tert-butylindene with MeMgI catalyzed by Ni(dppp)Cl <nUm> afforded 3-tert-butyl-2-methylindene from which bis(3-tert-butyl-2-methylinden-l-yl)methane and the corresponding ansa - zirconocene were synthesized . 
A linear correlation between the electrochemical gap values ( g = eox - ered ) and the energies of optical transition in the UV - vis region was found and justified for a series of non-bridged and bridged bent - sandwich zirconocene complexes with the general formula R(n5-L)2ZrX2 , where L = cyclopentadienyl ( cp ) , indenyl ( lnd ) , fluorenyl ( flu ) ; x = Cl , me ; the bridging group r = SiMe2 , CH2 . 
the first acetylene complex of hafnium , cp <nUm> Hf[Me <nUm> CaSi ≡ CHf(H)Cp <nUm> ] , was synthesized by the reaction of hafnocene dihydride cp <nUm> HHf <nUm> with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene in benzene . the reaction is accompanied by elimination of the me <nUm> Si group from the molecule of the initial acetylene , as a result of which the acetylenide derivative of hafnium cp <nUm> Hf(C ≡ CSiMe <nUm> )(H) acts as an acetylene ligand in the complex . under analogous conditions , the reaction of zirconocene dihydride cp <nUm> HZr <nUm> with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene affords an analogous acetylene complex of zirconium cp <nUm> Zr[M <nUm> CSi ≡ CZr(H)Cp <nUm> ] . reactions of cp <nUm> HHf <nUm> with tolane and 3-hexyne proceed differently than the reaction with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene . here the corresponding hafnacyclopentadiene metallacycles are the final products . 
comparative analysis of catalytic activity of substituted bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichlorides with the general formula ( r n cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( MeCp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( Pr i cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( Pr i <nUm> cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( bu n cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( bu i cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( bu t cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , cp* <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( cp* = me <nUm> C <nUm> ) , ( me <nUm> SiCp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , ( cyclo-C <nUm> H <nUm> cp ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> , and [ ( cyclo-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> cp ] <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ) in ethene polymerization using polymethylalumoxane as the cocatalyst was performed . the molecular mass characteristics of the polyethylene samples obtained were determined . A linear correlation of the specific activity of the catalysts and the turnover number with the electronic and steric characteristics of substituents at the cp ring of the complexes was established for the first time . analysis of the polymerization kinetics and the obtained correlation between the specific activity of the complexes and molecular mass characteristics of the polyethylene samples suggest that alkyl substituents participate in reactions responsible for the restriction of the polymer chain growth and regeneration of the active center . these interactions most likely involve associates of AlMe <nUm> with polymethylalumoxane molecules . 
A DFT study of ethylene polymerization by zirconocene catalysts was carried out . stationary points corresponding to intermediates and transition states were located on the potential energy surface of the [ cp <nUm> CZr <nUm> H <nUm> ] + + C <nUm> H <nUm> model system . three possible reaction mechanisms involving the formation of b-agostic complexes were considered . the energy and thermodynamic characteristics for different reaction pathways were calculated . corresponding activation energies lie in the range <nUm> - <nUm> kcal mol <nUm> . 
the catalytic properties of the zirconium complex with " constrained geometry " Me2SiCp*NBu1ZrX2 ( cp* = C5Me4 , x = Cl ( 1a ) , me ( 1b ) ) and bridged bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconocene Me2SiCp2ZrX2 ( x = Cl ( 2a ) , me ( 2b ) ) during their activation with triisobutylaluminum / perfluorophenyl borates ( TIBA / LB(C6F5)4 , L = CPh3 ( 3 ) , Me2HNPh ( 4 ) ) in ethylene polymerization under a monomer pressure of 2-20 atm were studied by comparison . both dichloride complexes exhibit moderate activity under the action of the combined TIBA / <nUm> activating agent and give linear high-molecular-weight polyethylene ( PE ) . the interaction of the dimethyl complexes with TIBA / <nUm> afford active sites in which the growing polymeric chain is intensely transferred to the monomer , due to which low-molecular-weight PE is formed . the dichloride complexes affected by TIBA / <nUm> also afford low-molecular-weight PE . analysis of the structure of the polymeric products ( 1H NMR spectrometry , IR spectroscopy ) , molecular - weight parameters of the PE samples ( gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) ) , and kinetics of polymerization suggested that the active site contains AlBu13 as a heteronuclear bridged cationic complex . the influence of various basic substrates ( the products of chain transfer with the terminal vinyl groups , the dimethylaniline fragment of borate <nUm> or other amine specially introduced into the reaction mixture ) on the catalytic properties of the Zr-Al site was revealed . the polymerization rate and molecular - weight parameters of PE as functions of the reaction temperature , ethylene pressure , and modifying additives were studied . 
polymerization of ethylene on zirconocene catalysts was studied with the density functional theory . the approach proposed previously for the model system cp <nUm> ZrEt + + C <nUm> H <nUm> was extended to substituted zirconocene catalysts ( RCp ) <nUm> ZrEt + , which allowed us to compare the results of calculations with the experimentally found rate constants of chain propagation . the ethyl fragment was demonstrated to be an adequate model for a growing polymer chain . the order of decrease in the activation energy of chain propagation calculated for compounds with r = H , me , Pr n , and bu n is in qualitative agreement with the experimental data . however , the quantitative description gave underestimated theoretical rate constants of chain propagation compared to the experimental values . In the case of polyalkyl-substituted zirconocenes ( r = 1,2-Me <nUm> or me <nUm> ) , no correlation between the calculated and experimental characteristics was observed . the results were explained using the simplest model reaction of the replacement of the MeMAO - counterion by an ethylene molecule accompanied by displacement of the former to the outer coordination sphere of the Zr atom . this step was demonstrated to control the kinetics of the process . it was concluded that the isolated - cation model used in early investigations is not adequate and calls for modification with regard to the effect of the counterion . 
o-Thiatelluraphenylenezirconocene complexes were obtained in good yield by reaction of dilithium o-benzenthiatelluride with zirconocene dichlorides . these compounds represent the first examples of heterodichalcogenaphenylene bent metallocences . they were characterized by spectroscopic methods and the effect on the n.m.r . results of stepwise substitution of one and two Te atoms for S is discussed . x-ray crystal structure analysis was performed for one representative complex . the structure is very similar to that previously reported for a diselenaphenylene complex , but the disorder observed for chalcogen atoms prevents an accurate comparison of the geometrical parameters with other related compounds . 
the mixtures of non-conjugated dienes , 4-methyl-1,4-hexadiene and 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene ( MHD ) , were successfully synthesized by the reaction of isoprene with ethylene using Fe (III) - based catalyst in toluene . the conversion was over <nUm> mol % on the basis of the initial amount of isoprene used . the production yield for MHD was nearly <nUm> mol % , the other was polyisoprene . the mixtures were successfully copolymerized with ethylene by using zirconium - based metallocenes . the products were characterized by the combinations of gas chromatography , high temperature gel permeation chromatography , 1H NMR , 13C NMR , high temperature 1H NMR , UV / visible spectroscopy , and differential scanning calorimetry . it was found that 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene was active enough to be incorporated into the copolymer chain but the corresponding isomeric material , 4-methyl-1,4-hexadiene , was inactive in metallocene - catalyzed copolymerizations . specifically , in the zirconocene - catalyzed copolymerizations of ethylene with MHD , ansa - structure catalysts seem to be more efficient than non-bridged type zirconocene . the degree of incorporation of MHD in the resulting copolymers was able to be controlled by the amount of non-conjugated dienes used initially . 
new group <nUm> metallocene oligosilyl compounds ( RSi(SiMe3)2MCp2CI ; m = Zr , r = H , me , SiMe3 , SiMe21Bu , SiMe2CMe2CHMe2 , SiMe2Si(SiMe3)3 ; m = Hf , r = H , SiMe3 ) have been synthesized by reaction of the respective oligosilyl potassium compounds with zirconocene or hafnocene dichloride . 
the catalytic activities of five bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complexes of group IV metallocenes in the dehydrocoupling reaction of various 1,2-disubstituted hydrodisilanes were investigated . the reactions were monitored by GC / MS analysis in the early stages , and the polymers were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography . 
the homo- and copolymerization of styrene ( S ) with p-methylstyrene ( p-MeS ) and p-tert-butylstyrene ( p-ButS ) has been tested using initiator systems of the Ph2Zn-metallocene-MAO type . the metallocenes used were CpTiCl3 , IndTiCl3 , (n-BuCp)2TiCl <nUm> , Ind2ZrCl2 and Et(Ind)2ZrCl <nUm> . the Ph2Zn-metallocene-MAO systems homopolymerize styrene , p-methylstyrene and p-tert-butylstyrene , producing syndiotactic polymers in the case of the titanocenes and amorphous polymers in the case of the zirconocenes . the S / p-MeS and S / p-ButS copolymers obtained with the Ph2Zn-titanocene-MAO systems are enriched in the comonomer with respect to the initial feed . 
copolymerizations of ethylene with 1-decene were carried out with a series of stereospecific metallocene compounds , rac - (EBI)Zr(NMe2) <nUm> [ <nUm> , EBI = ethylene-1,2-bis(1-indenyl) ] , rac - (EBI)Hf(NMe 2)2 ( 2 ) , rac-Me2Si(1-C5H 2-2-Me-4-tBu)2Zr(NMe2)2 ( 3 ) , ethylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)ZrMe2 [ <nUm> , Et(Flu)(Cp)ZrMe2 ] and isopropylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl) ZrMe2 [ <nUm> , iPr(Flu)(Cp)ZrMe2 ] , combined with Al(i-Bu) <nUm> / [CPh3][B(C6F5)4] cocatalyst . all catalyst systems showed very high copolymerization rates and the 1-decene reactivity decreased in the order of <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> ∼ <nUm> > <nUm> . the reactivity product of ethylene and 1-decene ( rE x rD ) was below <nUm> except <nUm> catalyst , corresponding to random copolymer structures with an alternating character . the melting point ( Tm ) , crystallinity ( xc ) , intrinsic viscosity ( [e] and density of the 1-decene / ethylene copolymers decreased markedly with an increase in the 1-decene content , regardless of the type of catalytic system . 
propylene copolymerization with 1-hexene and 4-methyl-1-pentene in liquid propylene medium in presence of MAO - activated C2 - symmetry ansa - zirconocene rac-Me2Si(4-Ph-2-MeInd)2ZrCl2 was studied . random copolymers of propylene with 1-hexene and 4-methyl-1-pentene content up to 7mol[?] % were obtained at <nUm> ° C . general kinetic characteristics of propylene / higher a-olefin copolymerization were evaluated . the distinct feature of propylene copolymerization with 1-hexene and 4-methyl-1-pentene in liquid propylene medium - the proximity of comonomer relative reactivity ratios ( r1 r21 ) that indicates azeotropic nature of copolymerization processes in studied conditions . synthesized copolymers were characterized with the use of IR , 13C NMR , GPC , WAXD , DSC techniques , and uniaxial tensile testing . 
this article reveals the dependence of crystalline phases in titania on the intrinsic activity during in situ polymerization of ethylene / 1-hexene using the zirconocene / dMMAO catalyst to produce LLDPE / O2Ti nanocomposites . first , the O2Ti nanoparticles having different crystalline phases were employed as the nanofillers by impregnation with dMMAO to obtain dMMAO / O2Ti then , copolymerization of ethylene / 1-hexene using zirconocene catalyst was performed in the presence of dMMAO / O2Ti . it was found that the catalytic activity derived from the anatase O2Ti ( A ) was about four times higher than that obtained from the rutile OTi <nUm> . ( r ) . this was likely due to higher intrinsic activity of the active species present on the TiO2(A) . In addition , increased [Al]dMMAO / [Zr]cat ratios apparently resulted in enhanced activities for both O2Ti ( A ) and tio ( r ) . however , the O2Ti ( r ) showed less deactivation upon increased [Al]dMMAO / [Zr]cat ratios . this can be attributed to strong interaction between dMMAO and O2Ti . ( r ) as proven by the TGA measurement . the microstructure of the LLDPE / O2Ti obtained was found to be random copolymer for both O2Ti ( A ) and O2Ti ( r ) . 
the copolymerization of styrene with isoprene ( ip ) has been tested using combined zirconocene-methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) initiating system . both '' halfsandwich '' and real zirconium - based metallocenes were used . regardless of the metallocene employed , conversion to copolymer was much influenced by the proportion of ip in the initial feed . As the proportion of ip is enriched , conversion to copolymer decreases substantially . results of NMR and DSC analyses indicate that the products obtained were truly copolymers and not a mixture of both homopolymers . the studied zirconocene - MAO initiating system produces atactic polystyrene . A small amount of ip in the initial feed substantially diminishes the conversion and at best traces of poly(isoprene) were detected in the homopolymerization of ip with these initiating systems . 
the spherical zirconia modified with BCl3 , Cl4Si , and glycerol was used as the support for rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst to catalyze the copolymerization of ethylene / 1-hexene . it is aimed to investigate the modification effects from different modifiers on copolymerization behaviors and compare the results with the unmodified system . the modified supports show higher activity than the unmodified one . especially , the Cl4Si modification exhibited the highest activity and produced copolymer with the largest 1-hexene insertion . this can be attributed to stronger interaction between the support and MAO along with the presence of Cl4Si as a spacer group resulting in the absence of induction period . the modification did not affect the copolymers microstructure and the random copolymers were obtained from all supported systems . the narrower molecular weight distribution can be obtained from the modified supports . besides , BCl3 modification presents the highest molecular weight of polymer probably due to BCl3 suppressing chain transfer reactions . 

allylbenzene was polymerized in the presence of two types of homogeneous zirconocene catalysts ( co-catalyst methylaluiminoxane ) . selective chain termination through ss-hydride elimination or chain transfer to aluminum was observed depending upon the catalysts employed . the rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 , and rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 , catalysts gave the polyallylbenzenes with saturated end groups due to chain transfer to aluminum , while the Cp2ZrCl2 catalyst gave the polyallylbenzenes with vinylidene end groups due to ss-hydride elimination . 
lewis acidic sites ( LAS ) of silica , modified with TMA and MAO samples differed by TMA content , have been characterized by IR spectroscopy ( CO adsorption as probe molecule at <nUm> K ) . two types of LAS were found on the surface of silica modified with MAO and TMA : m LAS of moderate strength ( vCO = 2204-2212 cm-1 ) and weak W LAS ( vCO = <nUm> cm-1 ) . the concentration of these acidic sites has been estimated . it was shown by IRS study CP2ZrMe2 interacts both with W LAS and m LAS . correlation between the amount of m LAS and the activity of ethylene polymerization has been found . 
thirteen differently substituted long - chain amide- and amine - functional alkenes were synthesised and used as comonomers in zirconocene / methylaluminoxane - catalysed copolymerizations with ethylene and propylene . characterization of the prepared copolymers showed the formation of functionalized copolymers with isolated comonomer units . the incorporation level of the comonomers ranged from <nUm> to <nUm> mol % with ethylene and from <nUm> to <nUm> mol % with propylene . the molar masses of the copolymers were lower than those of the corresponding homopolymers . end group analysis of the copolymers by NMR suggested that the dominant chain termination mechanism was chain transfer to aluminium . 
synthesis and activity of bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride catalyst supported on unconventional silica - type material obtained in sol - gel process and activated by organoaluminium co-catalyst were studied . the effect of support modification conditions ( thermal dehydration and / or modification by organoaluminium compound ) and a type of co-catalyst on an activity of the catalytic system in ethylene polymerization and properties of resulting polymers were investigated and compared with results obtained earlier for vanadium catalysts supported on mentioned sol - gel carrier . the most appropriate method of the sol - gel silica - type support preparation is thermal pre-treating ( <nUm> ° C ) followed by modification with AlEt2Cl . metallocene catalyst supported on such sol - gel product and activated by MAO appeared to be most active among studied systems . studied Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO supported on silica - type sol - gel carrier allow to obtain polyethylene ( at <nUm> ° C polymerization temperature ) with yield up to 30*106 g / ( molZr*h ) , molecular weight below <nUm> <nUm> and MWD = 2-4 . 
ethene was homo- and copolymerized in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO)-activated zirconocenes comprising (Me5Cp)2ZrCl2 ( cp* ) and racemic dimethylsilylene-bis[-2-methyl-indenyl] - bridged zirconocene dichloride where the ligand framework was varied by benzannelation ( MBI ) , 4-phenyl ( MPI ) , and 4-naphthyl ( MNI ) substitution . zero shear viscosity and shear thinning of the ethene homopolymers increased as a function of the catalyst system with MNI · MPI > MBI » cp* and were correlated with the presence of long chain branches formed via reinsertion of vinyl-terminated polymer chains . the ranking was confirmed using the reduced vanGurp palmen plot ( σ vs. IG*I / GN0 ) being less sensitive on molecular weight for polyolefin materials . poly(ethene-co-propene)s ( EP ) containing <nUm> and <nUm> wt.- % propene were long chain branched as reflected by pronounced viscosity build-up at low angular frequency and increased shear thinning at higher angular frequency , whereas with propene comonomer content exceeding <nUm> wt.- % EP was essentially linear . 
synthesis and activity ofbis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride catalyst supported on unconventional silica - type material obtained in sol - gel process and activated by organoaluminium co-catalyst were studied . the effect of support modification conditions ( thermal dehydration and / or modification by organoaluminium compound ) and a type of co-catalyst on an activity of the catalytic system in ethylene polymerization and properties of resulting polymers were investigated and compared with results obtained earlier for vanadium catalysts supported on mentioned sol - gel carrier . the most appropriate method of the sol - gel silica - type support preparation is thermal pre-treating ( <nUm> ° C ) followed by modification with AlEt2Cl . metallocene catalyst supported on such sol - gel product and activated by MAO appeared to be most active among studied systems . studied Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO supported on silica - type sol - gel carrier allow to obtain polyethylene ( at <nUm> ° C polymerization temperature ) with yield up to 30*106 g / ( molZr*h ) , molecular weight below <nUm> <nUm> and MWD = 2-4 . 


the present study showed enhanced activities of ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization via O2Ti - O2Si mixed oxides - supported MAO with a zirconocene catalyst . it was proposed that titania was decorated on silica surface and acted as a spacer to anchor MAO to the silica support resulting in less steric hindrance and less interaction on the support surface . 
the bimodal polyethylene obtained from O2Ti - supported zirconocene / MAO catalyst was observed during polymerization of ethylene and ethylene / 1-hexene . by means of XPS , it revealed that O2Ti consisted of ti3+ ( BE = <nUm> eV ) and ti4+ ( BE = <nUm> eV ) . the dual catalytic sites were attributed to the presence of ti3+ and Ti 4+ in O2Ti . 
the study revealed enhancement ( four to seven times ) of catalytic activities for ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization via the Zr - modified OSi 2-supported the metallocene / MAO catalyst . increased activity can be attributed to an increase in absorption ability of MAO on the modified support . In addition , the strong interaction between MAO and the support was also considered . 

the synthesis , characterization , and application of a wide variety of metallocene and metallocene - like polymers and oligomers is described . much of this effort involves the group IVB metallocenes , but the work of vanadium and ruthenium are also included . the use of these materials as analytical reagents , laser modifiers , and in solar energy conversion is described . 
the conductivity of the polyamine derived from titanocene dichloride and 2-nitro-1,4-phenylenediamine increases to <nUm> to <nUm> fold when doped with iodine . larger increases are found for the analogous polyamines except derived from zirconocene dichloride ( increased 103-104 fold ) and hafnocene dichloride ( 105-106 fold ) and for certain other diamines . the conductivity of the product of titanocene dichloride and n-methyl-1,4-phenylenediamine increased <nUm> fold when doped . by comparison , conductivity increased only tenfold for the product from titanocene dichloride and chloro-1,4-phenylenediamine and less for the titanocene product with 1,4-phenylenediamine and methoxy-1,4-phenylenediamine and none for the product from dibutyltin dichloride and 2-nitro-1,4-phenylenediamine . conductivity did not appreciably change when samples were exposed to the atmosphere for <nUm> h. MALDI MS and IR results are consistent with the formation of C-I compounds for doped materials . 


polyethylene nanocomposites were prepared by in-situ polymerization technique by using highly active metallocene catalyst zirconocene ( cp 2ZrCl2 ) in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the influence of different concentrations ( <nUm> , 0.6,0.83,1.6 and <nUm> wt. % ) of nano calcium zirconate on catalytic activity and polymer properties was investigated . there was a steep increase in the activity of zirconocene catalyst ( from <nUm> to 185[?] × [?]10-3 g-PE / mol h bar , ) by addition <nUm> wt. % of the nanofiller the results of differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , crystallization analysis fractionation ( CRYSTAF ) and wide angle x-ray diffraction ( WAXD ) show that the percentage crystallinity was influenced with respect to the nanofiller concentration . microcalorimeter was used to study the effect of nanofiller on the pyrolysis of polyethylene . the fibrils morphology appearing on the fractured surface was reduced significantly with the addition of nanofiller as is evident from SEM morphology . 
the successive self - nucleation / annealing technique ( SSA ) by differential scanning calorimetry has been applied to study the heterogeneity of ethylene-hexene-1 copolymers produced with supported catalytic systems of different compositions : highly active supported ziegler - natta ( Z-N ) catalysts - a titanium - magnesium catalyst Cl4Ti / Cl2Mg ( TMC ) and a vanadium - magnesium catalyst Cl4V / Cl2Mg ( VMC ) , a supported zirconocene catalyst Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 / OSi <nUm> ( MAO ) , and a chromium - oxide catalyst CrO3 / OSi <nUm> . comparative data by SSA technique with the same temperature program were obtained for copolymers differed by MWD from narrow to very broad ( mw / Mn = 2.4-54 ) and short chain branching distribution from narrow ( zirconocene catalyst ) to very broad ( TMC and chromium oxide catalysts ) . it is demonstrated that copolymers produced with the zirconocene catalyst have the narrowest melting range and do not contain thick lamellae . the widest lamella thickness distribution has been found for a copolymer produced with the chromium - oxide catalyst . copolymers produced with the supported Z-N catalysts are ranked in the middle with a more narrow lamella thickness distribution for copolymer prepared with VMC as compared with the one produced with TMC . the SSA results are compared with the data on copolymer fractionation by TREF . it is shown that these methods give a good correlation for copolymers with narrow short - chain branching distribution produced with the supported zirconocene catalyst . In the case of copolymers produced with TMC , TREF yields a higher content of the high - branched fractions . 

the heterogenized reaction products of the partial hydrolysis of the organoaluminum compounds AlMe3 and Al(i-Bu)3 with water as a constituent of highly hydrated supports , zeolite ( ZSM-5-H2O ) and montmorillonite ( MMT-H2O ) , have been synthesized . the thermal degradation of the resulting heterogenized methylalumoxane compound and methylalumoxane ( MAO ) in a solid state is studied by temperature - programmed desorption with the mass - spectrometric analysis of liberated gaseous products , and the structural identity of the above compounds is found . alkylalumoxanes prepared immediately on the surface of a support form heterogenized complexes with the metallocenes Cp2ZrCl2 and Et(Ind) 2ZrCl2 . these heterogenized complexes exhibit high activity in the reactions of ethylene and propylene polymerization . for this reason , MAO can be replaced by AlMe3 or Al(i-Bu)3 and the additional introduction of MAO or another alkylaluminum for zirconocene activation is unnecessary . it has been found that , upon the immobilization of commercial MAO on dehydrated O2Si , the MAO molecule loses a portion of its most reactive methyl groups and , as a result of this , becomes incapable of activating metallocenes . 



the effect of ferrocene and zirconocene dichloride on the rate and constants of copolymerization of methyl methacrylate with styrene was studied . the results obtained suggest that the metallocenes in the elementary steps of the reaction . 
transformation of electronic absorption spectra of zirconocene catalytic systems Ph2CCpFluZrCl2-polymethylalumoxane ( MAO ) and rac-Me2Si(2-Me,4-PhInd)2ZrCl2 - MAO ( flu is fluorenyl , ind is indenyl ) in toluene was studied upon a change in the ratio of reactants A1MAO / Zr from <nUm> to <nUm> mol mol-1 . analysis of the spectroscopic data using statistical methods determined the number of reaction products in each system . A reaction model including three equilibria and being common for the both systems was proposed . effective equilibrium constants and absorption spectra of individual reaction products were determined by parametric self - modeling of the experimental spectra . 
A procedure was developed for the synthesis of trinuclear cyclic ( Zr III)2-Al hydrides [(Cp2Zr)2(m-H)] (m-H)2AlX2 ( x = Cl ( 1a ) or Br ( 1b ) ) . these complexes were prepared in 60-65 % yields by the reaction of Cp2ZrX2 with AlH4Li in the presence of Br2Co and tolane . the structures of complexes 1a and 1b and iodide 1c ( x = I ) were studied by NMR spectroscopy in solvents of different basicities ( toluene , THF , and pyridine ) . complex 1a is unsolvated and monomeric in all solvents ; complex 1b , in toluene and THF ; complex 1c , in toluene only . At room temperature , complex 1a does not catalyze hydrogenation of hex-1-ene and does not react with tolane , but reacts with the latter at high temperature to give bis(e5- cyclopentadienyl)-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylzirconacyclopentadiene . the reaction of equivalent amounts of complex 1a and ClH produces the [ ( Cp2Zr ) 2(m-Cl)](m-H)2AlCl2 complex . the structure of the latter was established by x-ray diffraction . 
preparative procedures were developed for the synthesis of new transmethylated bis-cyclopentadienyl ligands with phosphine - containing bridging fragments . these ligands were isolated as the dilithium salts Li 2[(C5Me4CH2)2PPh] ( 1 ) and Li2[(C5Me4CH2CH2) 2PPh ] ( 3 ) . phosphorus - substituted 3-ansa-zirconocene dichloride [(C5Me4CH2)2PPh]ZrCl2 was synthesized starting from <nUm> . the NMR spectroscopic data provide evidence for the absence of the Zr-P coordination interaction in solution . A straightforward approach to 5-ansa-zirconocene dichloride [ ( C5Me 4CH2CH2)2PPh]ZrCl2 starting from lithium salt <nUm> and Cl4Zr was shown to be impossible .

In the reduction of compounds <nUm> and <nUm> , intramolecular C-H activation highly selectively afforded the fulvene hydride complexes Zr(H)(e5- C5Me5)[e5:e2(C,P)-(CH 2)C5Me3CH2CH2PR <nUm> ] ( r = me ( 7 ) , ph ( 8 ) ) ; in the case of compound <nUm> , the aryl hydride Zr(H)(e5:C5Me5)[e5 : e1(C)-C5Me4CH2CH 2PPh(o-C6H4) ] ( 9 ) was also formed . the reduction of complexes <nUm> and <nUm> gave the ZrII derivatives Zr[e5:e1(P)- C5Me4CH 2CH2PMe2]2 ( 12 ) and Zr[e5:e1(P)-C5Me4CH 2CH2PMe2][e5 : e1(P)-C5Me4CH2 CH 2PPh2 ] ( 14 ) stabilized by two phosphine groups . the second product in the reduction of compound <nUm> was the fulvene hydride complex Zr(H)(e5-C5Me4CH2CH 2PPh2)[e5:e2(C,P)-(CH 2)C5Me3CH2CH2PMe <nUm> ] ( 15 ) . the reaction of compound <nUm> with an excess of MeI resulted selectively in replacement of the hydride ligand by iodide to give the complex ZrI(e5-C5Me5)[e5 : e2(C,P)-(CH2)C5Me3CH 2CH2PMe2 ] ( 10 ) . In contrast , in the reaction of compound <nUm> with Me2Si(H)Cl , the Zr - CH2 bond underwent cleavage to give the chloride hydride complex Zr(H)Cl(e5-C 5Me5)[e5:e1(P)-C 5Me3(CH2SiMe2H)CH2CH 2PMe2 ] ( 11 ) . In the reaction of complex <nUm> with CO , a phosphine group was replaced by CO to form the complex Zr(CO)(e5-C 5Me4CH2CH2PMe2 ) [ e5:e1(P)-C5Me4CH 2CH2PMe2 ] ( 13 ) . the results obtained were compared with analogous reduction reactions of MeO- , MeS- , and me <nUm> N - functionalized zirconocene dichlorides .

the interaction of the negishi reagent cp 2ZrBu n 2with 1,4-bis(tert-butyl)butadiyne ButC ≡ C-C ≡ CBut leads to four products : a five - membered zirconacyclocumulene complex cp 2Zr(e 4-Bu tC 4Bu t ) ( 2 ) synthesized earlier by another method , the previously unknown seven - membered zirconacyclocumulene cp 2Zr[e 4-Bu tC <nUm> ( bu t)-C(C 2Bu t ) = CBu t ] ( 3 ) as well as small amounts of the zirconocene binuclear butatrienyl complex cp <nUm> ( bu n)Zr(Bu tC 4Bu t)Zr(Bu n)Cp <nUm> ( 4 ) , and the dimeric acetylide [ cp 2ZrC ≡ CBu t ] <nUm> ( 5 ) . the structure of complexes 2-5 was established by x-ray diffraction studies . 
A Cp2ZrCl2 - catalyzed cycloalumination of 3-methylidenespiro[cyclobutane-1,3'-(5'a)-cholestane] with Et3Al gives 3-ethyl-3-aluminadispiro[cyclopentane-1,1'- cyclobutane-3',3''-(5''a)-cholestane ] in <nUm> % yield . 
isobutylalumoxanes of different composition were synthesized by the hydrolysis of triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) with crystalline hydrate CuOS 4*5H2O and water taken as cooled ice or as vapor . the composition of the formed alumoxanes and the degree of water participation in their formation was monitored by 1H NMR . the hydrolysis of TIBA on CuSO4*5H2O is rather selective method of synthesis of alumoxanes . the synthesized alumoxanes were used for the activation of dimethylated zirconocenes rac-Me2Si(2-Me,4-PhInd) 2ZrMe2 and rac-Et(2-MeInd)2ZrMe2 in propylene polymerization at the molar ratios Al / Zr = 50-750 . it was concluded that the hydrolysis afforded several products with different structures and different activating ability . the systems with oligomeric forms of isobutylalumoxanes , especially those obtained by TIBA hydrolysis with water , showed the highest activity . 
A one - pot method for the synthesis of polycyclic phospholanes and phospholane 3-oxides from norbornenes was developed based on their cp 2ZrCl2 - catalyzed cycloalumination . the in situ formed polycyclic aluminacyclopentanes were treated with organic dichlorophosphines ( RPCl2 , where r = me , but , ph ) to obtain polycyclic phospholanes . the phospholanes were oxidized with hydrogen peroxide to obtain their 3-oxides in 81-92 % yields . 


the direct photophysical approach to the estimation of the energy and orbital nature of electron - excited states of organometallic compounds of early transition metals was described . the concentration dependence of the zirconocene luminescence quenching was studied using cyclopentadiene . the quenching of metallocene Cp2MIVCl2 luminescence was observed using CsHU . the results of experiments on quenching of the luminescence of group IVB complexes in the presence of CsHU were obtained even in the case of ET ≥ ET . 
A series of six - coordinate " half - sandwich " zirconocene phosphates and phosphonates have been synthesized by the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with ( diphenyl- , dibenzyl-)phosphate and methylphenylphosphinic acid under different conditions . all of the complexes were characterized by elemental analysis , FT-IR and NMR ( 1H , 13C ) spectroscopy . except for complex <nUm> , the structures of complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were confirmed by x-ray crystallography . the structure analyses reveal that complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> are trinuclear complexes with fascinating m3-oxygen bridging ligands , central to a Zr-O backbone ( Cp2ZrCl2 : ligand is <nUm> : <nUm> ) while complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> are centrosymmetric dinuclear complexes built up about the trapezoidal Zr2(m2-OH)2 unit ( Cp2ZrCl2 : ligand is <nUm> : <nUm> ) . 
reactions of Cp2ZrCl2 with homometallic complexes of aluminium containing one residual hydroxy group Al(OGO)(OGOH) and Al(L)(OGOH) [ where g = G1 = CMe2CMe2 ( 1a ) ; g = g <nUm> = CMe2CH2CHMe ( 1b ) ; g = G3 = CMe 2CH2CH2CMe2 ( 1c ) and L = L <nUm> = C7H5O = C2H4NO , g = G1 ( 2a ) ; L = L1 , g = G2 ( 2b ) ; L = L1 , g = G3 ( 2c ) ; L = L2 = C11H7O = NCH 2CH2O , g = G1 ( 2d ) ; L = L2 , g = g <nUm> ( 2e ) ; L = L2 , g = G3 ( 2f ) ] in THF using et <nUm> N as ClH acceptor affords novel heterobimetallic compounds of the types Al(OGO)2Zr(Cl)Cp2 and Al(L)(OGO)Zr(Cl)Cp <nUm> , respectively . all of these derivatives have been characterised by elemental analyses , molecular weight measurements , and spectroscopic [ IR , NMR ( 1H and 27Al ) ] studies . 
synthesis and characterization of titanium(IV) and zirconium(IV) complexes of the types Cp2M(Cl)(HPO) , Cp2M(HPO)2 , cp 2M(O[?]N[?]O) and Cp2M(O [?]N[?]S ) ( where m represents titanium or zirconium and HPO , O[?]N[?]O and O[?]N [?]S represent the donor sets of the ligands ) have been reported . these new derivatives have been prepared by the reactions of titanocene dichloride or zirconocene dichloride with 2-hydroxy-N-phenyl benzamide(HPOH) , 1-[(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1-N-phenylamino]hydrazine-carboxamide ( HO [?]N[?]OH ) and 2-hydroxy-N-phenyl benzamide benzothiazoline ( HO[?]N[?]SH ) in different molar ratios . the ligands and their complexes have been characterized by the elemental analyses , conductance measurement , molecular weight determinations and spectral studies . on the basis of electronic , i.r. , 1H.-n.m.r . and 13C.-n.m.r . spectral studies , trigonal bipyramidal and octahedral geometries have been proposed for the resulting complexes . all the ligands and their complexes have been screened for their biological activity on several pathogenic fungi and bacteria and were found positive in this respect . 
some zirconium compounds containing chelating diamido dipyrrole or tetra-amido tetra-pyrrole ligands were synthesized and used as polymerization catalyst with high polymerization activity of ethylene at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> bar , in presence of MAO or BC18F15 as co-catalyst . the maximum catalytic activity reached <nUm> kg / mol bar h for ethylene polymerization by zr2(octa-phenyl calix[4]pyrrolidine)Cl4 . these results reveal that half - zirconocene like complexes including four terminal chlorine and one calix[4]pyrrolidine in middle with both π and s-interaction have the highest ethylene polymerization turnover ( compounds <nUm> , <nUm> ) . 
substituted 1,4-dimagnesium reagents were synthesized by the zirconocene - catalyzed reaction of alkenes with ethylmagnesium reagents in the presence of a methylmagnesium containing additive . improved selectivity for formation of dimagnesium reagents over monomagnesium reagents was obtained in the presence of the methylmagnesium containing additive . the ratio of monoto dimagnesiated products was extrapolated from the ratio of alkene to diene in the products formed when the reaction was quenched with allyl bromide . the extent of the increase in the alkene / diene ratio was dependent on the type of organomagnesium halide , with greatest increases ( <nUm> % ) for the alkylmagnesium chlorides . A mechanism for improved selectivity by suppression of b-hydrogen abstraction in the catalytic cycle is presented . quenching the 1,4-dimagnesium reagents with allyl bromide yielded decadienes . 
zirconocene reagents derived from zirconocene dichloride and two equivalents of butyllithium react with allylic , homoallylic diene ethers . hydrolysis of the reaction products yields substituted tetrahydropyrans . the reaction is postulated to occur via cyclization of the diene to form a zirconacyclopentane . this cyclization occurs without allylic rearrangement . 
the bis(b-diketonato) Zr complexes CpZr(acac)2Cl ( acac = acetylacetonato ) ( 1 ) and Cp*Zr(acac)2Cl ( 2 ) can be synthesized by the reaction of Cp'ZrCl3(Cp' = cp or cp* ) with <nUm> equiv of lithium acetylacetonate . CpZr(acac)2Cl ( 1 ) can be quantitatively prepared by treatment of Cp2ZrCl2 with excess acetylacetone . the tris(b-diketonato) Zr complex CpZr(tfac) <nUm> ( tfac = trisfluoroacetylacetonato ) ( 3 ) has been prepared by treatment of CpZrCl3 with sodium trisfluoroacetylacetonate . the replacement of both chlorine atoms and one cp group from zirconocene dichloride by nonfluorinated diketone , acetylacetone , readily occurs at room temperature in triethylamine medium , offering the tris(b-diketonato) Zr complex CpZr(acac)3 ( 4 ) . the complexes were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopic methods . In addition , the molecular structures of complexes <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined by x-ray diffraction methods . when activated by excess methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , these complexes were active for ethylene polymerization , offering polyethylenes with high molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions . complex <nUm> showed a very high ethylene polymerization activity of up to <nUm> kg PE / mol zr*h at <nUm> atm . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were also active for ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization . 
Nano-TiO <nUm> particles with a range of crystallite sizes were synthesized by a conventional sol - gel method , and then used as nanoparticle substrates in the synthesis of LLDPE / OTi <nUm> nanocomposites via in situ polymerization of ethylene / 1-hexene with zirconocene / MMAO catalyst . it was found that the size of the nano-TiO <nUm> crystallite nanoparticles can influence the catalytic activity in the polymerization system . the larger nano-TiO <nUm> crystallites provided better catalytic activity in the polymerization system due to more space for monomer attack . In addition , by thermo - gravimetric analysis , it can be seen that the larger nano-TiO <nUm> crystallites also exhibited lower interaction with available MMAO . consequently , the MMAO reacted more efficiently with the zirconocene catalyst during the activation process , and enhanced polymerization catalysis . all the polymer nanocomposites products did not have well defined melting temperature indicating non-crystalline polymers . this is due to the high amount of hexene incorporation ( based on 13C NMR ) . the difference in crystallite sizes of the nano-TiO <nUm> also affected how 1-hexene became incorporated into the polymer nanocomposites . the smaller crystallite size of nano-TiO <nUm> allowed greater 1-hexene incorporation due to depression of the reactivity of the ethylene . the contribution of this work helps develop a better understanding of the role of nano-TiO <nUm> in the catalytic activity of the polymerization system and in the microstructure of the polymer composite product . however , this study only considers work on the laboratory scale , so for commercial application of these results , it is necessary to scale up the polymerization process . it is only at this stage , that other physical properties , such as the mechanical properties of these materials can be sensibly determined . 
Ansa-Cyclohexyl-bis(4,5,6,7-tertrahydro-1-indenyl) zirconium dichloride ( 5 ) was used as catalyst for propylene and ethylene polymerization together with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) as the cocatalyst . isotactic polypropylene ( PP ) was obtained with the highest activity of <nUm> × <nUm> g PP ( molZr ) -1h-1 . the meso-meso ( mmmmm ) pentads sequence content of PP was determined by 13C NMR spectroscopy . the dependence of the microstructure on the reaction temperature and the Al / Zr molar ratio was examined and the catalytic activity of complex <nUm> was compared with that of the similar ansa - zirconocene <nUm> . the high activity of the new zirconocene <nUm> for propylene isospectic polymerization at high temperature ( <nUm> ° C ) is the result of its unique bridged - group structure . complex <nUm> / MAO displays also high catalytic activity of <nUm> × <nUm> to <nUm> × <nUm> g PE(molZr)-1h-1 in the homo-polymerization of ethylene . the visometric molecular weight of PE ranges from <nUm> × <nUm> to <nUm> × <nUm> g*mol-1 under the given conditions . 13C NMR spectroscopy analysis proves the PE to be linear polyethylene ( LPE ) . 


OZn nanoparticle was used for preparing supported catalyst , which was applied in copolymerization of ethylene and 1-octene to obtain LLDPE / OZn nanocomposite . there were two different impregnation methods ( in situ and ex situ ) in preparing the nano-ZnO supported catalyst . the investigation to compare both methods was conducted by employing various 1-octene initial concentrations in copolymerization . it was found that a heterogeneous catalytic system comprised a supported catalyst , prepared by in situ impregnation , provided higher catalytic activities and 1-octene incorporations compared to those of ex situ impregnation under similar condition perhaps due to closer similarity to a homogeneous system . for the ex situ impregnation , it was found that when zirconocene was directly impregnated onto the support , the catalytic activity decreased . this was due to zirconocene close vicinity to the supports and even deep into the support structure proved by XPS and TGA measurements . therefore , it was more inaccessible to monomer attack and reducing the catalytic activity . the separate study on each catalytic system relating to the comonomer effect was also conducted by applying initial comonomer concentrations varied between <nUm> and <nUm> mmol . the increase in catalytic activity with increasing comonomer concentration can be considered as a positive comonomer effect , and the opposite was true for a negative comonomer effect . it was found that both positive and negative comonomer effects occurred in in situ impregnation and ex situ impregnation systems with Zn / ( Al ? Zr ) support , whereas only positive comonomer effect was found in an ex situ impregnation system with Zn / Al support . this suggested that the comonomer effect was varied according to the nature of each system . the polymer properties , such as relative crystallinity and thermal properties were also investigated and found to alter with 1-octene concentration . 


the bis(anilino)phosphine oxide (PhNH)2P(O)H as a ligand reacts directly with zirconocene dichloride CCl2P2Zr to afford H(PhNH)P[(NPh)OZr(Cp)2Cl] ( 1 ) , while in the presence of triethylamine as a base the ligand is deprotonated and H(O)P[(NPh)2Zr(Cp) <nUm> ] ( 2 ) is isolated in a very good yield . when the ligand is treated with Cl4Ti , however , the diligand complex Cl3TiO(NPh) PH(NPh)PHO(Nph)TiCl3 ( 3 ) is separated in high yield . these new compounds have been fully characterized by FT-IR , UV - vis spectrophotometry and multi-nuclear ( 1H , 31P ) NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis as well as XRF analysis of SEM images . 



A method is described that allows the preparation of stable conjugated primary enamines containing furyl or pyridyl substituents . In a template reaction (butadiene)zirconocene is 1,4-selectively coupled to two 2-cyanopyridine equivalents to give the nine - membered metallacycle 8b . subsequent treatment with methanol removes the bent metallocene template and leads to the formation of 1,6-diamino-1,6-bis(2-pyridyl)-1,3,5-hexatriene ( 9b ) . the 1,6- diamino-1,6-bis(2-furyl)-1,3,5-hexatriene system ( 9a ) was prepared analogously ( <nUm> % isolated ) . subsequent addition of benzonitrile to (butadiene)ZrCp2 followed by 2-cyanopyridine or 2-cyanofurane gave the respective unsymmetrically substituted 1,6-diaminohexatrienes in good yield . 
retentions following ( n , γ ) reactions in solid state and in solution in benzene were measured for 1,1'-trimethylenetitanocene dichloride and for the corresponding derivatives of zirconocene dichloride and hafnocence dichloride . comparisons are made of these retentions with those previously measured for the parent compounds . retentions in solution are best interpreted as due to a fast three - body recombination reaction for the parent compounds and to a fast two - body recombination reaction for the bridged derivatives . 
As part of the characterization of substituted biscyclopentadienyl Ti(IV) and Zr(IV) compounds , 13C NMR and 1H NMR data have been obtained which indicate that the effects of both metal shielding ( Ti versus Zr ) and ring substitution can be taken into account by a simple additive relationship so that it is possible to predict accurately chemical shifts for these systems . 
metallacycles are formed upon thermolysis of (s-trans-e4-butadiene)zirconocene and binuclear (e2-aldehyde)zirconocene complexes or photolysis of diphenylzirconocene in the presence of t-butyl- , trimethylsilyl- , and phenyl-acetylene . from a surprising equally high preference for a-t-butyl- and -trimethylsilyl-substituted products as well as the statistically favoured 2,4-disubstituted metallacyclopentadienes formed from t-butyl- or trimethylsilyl-acetylene it is suggested , that the position of the substituents in the final product is predominantly determined by the coordination of the alkyne preceding the ring - closure reaction . In contrast to the thermally induced reactions the expected major product ( 2,5-disubstituted zirconacyclopentadiene ) of the kinetically controlled cyclization reaction is formed upon photolysis of diphenylzirconocene in the presence of phenylacetylene . 
titanocene and zirconocene derivatives with an interannular tetramethylethylene bridge can be made by reductive coupling of 6,6-dimethylfulvene with sodium amalgam , sodium anthracenide , or magnesium metal / CCl4 as reducing agents and subsequent reaction of the anionic tetramethyldicyclopentadienylethane product with Cl3Ti or Cl4Zr in THF . 
treatment of Cp2ZrCl(CH2PPh2) ( cp = e5-C5H5 ) with CO gave the dinuclear complex (Cp2ZrCl)2 [OCCH(PPh2)] ; a single crystal x-ray diffraction study revealed a coplanar doubly - chelated arrangement { A figure is presented } with electron delocalization throughout the six - atom nucleus . 
UV photolysis of mixtures of dialkyl or diaryl complexes of group IVA metals (e5-t-BuC5H4)2M(CH3)2 ( m = Zr , Hf ) containing grey selenium gives the new complexes [(e5-t-BuC5H4M(m-Se)]2 ( II ) . these complexes are also formed by UV irradiation of a solution of equimolar amounts of I and (e5-t-BuC5H4)2M(SePh)2 . 
the dark green crystalline [ZrCp''2(CO)2] ( cp'' = e-C5H3(SiMe3)2 ) , ( I ) ( d(13CO) <nUm> ppm ) , was prepared by reduction from [ZrCp''2Cl2] and either CO ( using HgNa , Cl2HgMg , or li2 [COT] ) or CHgNaO2 in high ( CO ) to moderate ( CO2 ) yield ; the HgNa / CO procedure was much more effective than for Zr analogues having e-C5H5 or e-C5H4(SiMe3) ligands ; the carbonyl complex I is a convenient precursor to CO-free derivatives obtained either by oxidative addition or ligand displacement . 
the photolysis of Cp2Zr(CO)2 with diphenylacetylene or 3-hexyne yields the respective zirconacyclopentadiene complexes Cp2Z(C4R4) ( r = ph , et ) . the thermolysis of Cp2Z(CO)2 with 3-hexyne or bis(pentafluorophenyl)acetylene also leads to the formation of Cp2Z(C4R4) ( r = et , C6F5 ) . ClH degradation of Cp2Zr[C6(C6F5)4] yields 1,2,3,4-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)-1,3-butadiene and Cp2ZrCl2 . when Cp2Zr(CO)2 is heated with diphenylacetylene in a closed vessel , tetraphenylcyclopentadienone is formed along with Cp2Zr(C4Ph4) . the hafnacyclopentadiene complexes Cp2Hf(C4R4) ( r = ph , C6F5 , et ) are obtained when Cp2Hf(CO)2 is thermolyzed with the respective acetylene in refluxing octane . complexes Cp2Hf(C4R4) ( r = ph , et ) are also formed when Cp2Hf(CO)2 is photolyzed with diphenylacetylene or 3-hexyne , respectively . the monocarbonyl-triphenylphosphine complexes Cp2M(CO)(PPh3) ( m = Zr , Hf ) can be prepared via the irradiation of hydrocarbon solutions of Cp2M(CO)2 and triphenylphosphine . these complexes react readily with diphenylacetylene and 3-hexyne at 55-60 ° C to afford the corresponding metallacyclopentadiene complexes Cp2M(C4R4) ( m = Zr , Hf ; r = ph , et ) . the metallocene dicarbonyls Cp2M(CO)2 ( m = Zr , Hf ) are readily prepared via the reduction of Cp2MCl2 ( m = Zr , Hf ) with amalgamated magnesium metal in THF solution under one atmosphere of carbon monoxide . 
the chiral ansa - zirconocene derivative ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)-zirconium(IV) dichloride has been prepared by reaction of dilithiobis(indenyl)ethane with Cl4Zr and subsequent hydrogenation . the product has been shown to be the 1-R,S rather than meso-metal - ring linkage stereoisomer by an x-ray determination of the molecular structure . 
ethylene-bridged titanocene and zirconocene derivatives with permethylated ring ligands , C20Cl2H28Ti and C20Cl2H28Zr , have been synthesized and their crystal structures determined . 
Cp2Zr(-NCHR)Cl compounds ( 9a-9c : r = CH3 , C6H5 , CH2Ph,respectively ) are formed upon hydrozirconation of nitriles . subsequent reaction with an aryllithium reagent yields Cp2Zr(-NCHR)Ar ( 14 ) . the ( alkylidene amido)zirconocene complexes are characterized by a linear heteroallene - type structure possessing an sp - hybridized nitrogen atom . <nUm> reacts with the oligomeric metallocene dihydrides (Cp2ZrH2)x ( 15 ) and (Cp2HfH2)c , ( 17 ) , respectively , to form the binuclear compounds Cp2Zr(m-NCHR)(m-Cl)MCp2 ( <nUm> , m = Zr ) and ( <nUm> , m = Hf ) . the formation of these thermally very stable metal complexes is discussed . 
the reaction of imidoylzirconocene complexes with zirconocene hydrides yields (N-alkylamido)zirconocene complexes . for a mechanistic study , the specifically substituted imidoylzirconocene complexes 3b-3d have been prepared and treated with the oligomeric metal hydrides (Cp2ZrH2)x ( 1b ) and (Cp2ZrHCl)x ( 1c ) . ( N-Benzyl formimidoyl)zirconocene chloride ( 3b ) was obtained by treating 1c with benzyl isonitrile 2a . treatment of dimethylzirconocene with 2a gave ( n-benzyl acetimidoyl)methylzirconocene ( 3c ) , which was treated with PhICl2 to give (N-benzylacetimidoyl)zirconocene chloride ( 3d ) . the reaction of 3d with (Cp2ZrH2)x ( 1b ) yielded (N-benzyl-N-ethylamido)zirconocene chloride ( 4b ) as the only identified product . A <nUm> <nUm> mixture of 4b and methylzirconocene chloride was obtained upon treatment of 3c with (Cp2ZrHCl)x ( 1c ) ; in contrast , the reaction of 1c with 3b gave an equimolar mixture of Cp2ZrCl2 and (N-benzyl-N-methylamido)zirconocene chloride ( 4c ) . reaction paths through binuclear ( m-CHR' = NR ) zirconocene intermediates are proposed to explain these experimental observations . 
polymer - attached Cp2ZrCl2 , Cp2HfCl2 , CpZrCl3 , CpHfCl3 , Cp2ZrCl and Cp3HfCl have been prepared . the polymer - attached Cp2ZrCl2 , on reduction with BuLi , produced an active catalyst whose efficiency for olefin hydrogenation is about eight times as great as that of the corresponding homogeneous species under the same conditions . the reduction products of supported zirconocene and hafnocene complexes are active hydrogenation catalysts for diphenylacetylene which was hydrogenated to 1,2-diphenylethane through intermediate stilbene . the similar reduction products have also been employed in catalytic isomerization of allylbenzene , cis-stilbene and 1,5-cyclooctadiene . allylbenzene was converted into a mixture of trans- and cis-propenylbenzene , cis-stilbene was isomerized to trans-stilbene , and 1,5-cyclooctadiene was isomerized to 1,3-cyclooctadiene through the 1,4-cyclooctadiene intermediate . polymer - attached Cp2ZrCl2 , CpZrCl3 , Cp2HfCl2 , and CpHfCl3 can be used directly , without going through the reduction process , for the low yield epoxidation of cyclohexene . polymer - attached Cp2ZrCl2 was used in hydrozirconation and carbon monoxide reduction studies . 
thermolysis of zirconocene dicarbonyl at <nUm> ° C in toluene in the presence of an equimolar amount of trimethylphosphite produced dark green crystals of Cp2Zr(CO)[P(OCH3)3] ( 5 ) in about <nUm> % isolated yield . <nUm> was characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy ( v(CO) <nUm> cm-1 ) and by an x-ray crystal structure analysis . <nUm> crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1 with cell constants a <nUm> , b <nUm> , c <nUm> Å , α <nUm> , β <nUm> , and γ <nUm> ° ; z = <nUm> . characteristic bond distances ( for the two crystallographically independent molecules ) are COZr <nUm> , <nUm> ; CO <nUm> , <nUm> ; PZr <nUm> , <nUm> Å . spectroscopic parameters of <nUm> are compared with those of <nUm> group IV metallocene carbonyl complexes described in the literature . 
dimeric metallocene dihydrides [(e5-t-BuC5H4)2MH(m-H)]2 ( <nUm> ; m = Zr , Hf ) react with elemental chalcogens to give the four - membered metallacycles [(e5-t-BuC5H4)2M(m-E)]2 ( <nUm> , e = Se ; <nUm> , e = S ) . In the case of sulfur , the reaction also gives (e5-t-BuC5H4)2MS5 ( 4 ) . both <nUm> and <nUm> are shown to come from subsequent reactions of the primary insertion product (e5-t-BuC5H4)2M(SH)2 . 
the one - electron reduction of zirconocene and hafnocene dichlorides Cp2MCl2 ( m = Zr or Hf ) yields the corresponding anion Cp2MCl2- . there is no cleavage of an MCl bond , in contrast to the result in the case of the analogous titanocene and vanadocene dichlorides . 
the compound (butadiene)zirconocene reacts readily at room temperature with iron carbonyl complexes under CC coupling of the conjugated diene ligand with a carbonyl carbon atom . starting from C5FeO5 and (C4H6)ZrCp2 the metallacyclic (p-allylzirconoxy)carbene iron complex is obtained in good yield . from the (butadiene)zirconocene equilibrium mixture ( 12a 14a = <nUm> <nUm> ) the preferred reaction of the (s-trans-e4-diene)metallocene isomer with C5FeO5 or Fe(CO)4PPh3 takes place . (s-cis-Butadiene)ZrCp2 ( 14a ) , which is a stronger nucleophile than its isomer ( 12a ) , appears to be inert towards these metal carbonyls under kinetically controlled reaction conditions . this suggests a novel mechanism for the m-carbonyl → m-carbene transformation . 
A new method has been developed to synthezise group <nUm> metallocene ylides . Ph3PCH2 reacts with in situ generated (e2-ethene)MCp2 ( m = Zr , Hf ) , (e2-aryne)MCp2 ( m = Ti , Zr ) , or with ( e4-conjugated diene)MCp2 ( m = Zr , Hf ) via intramolecular hydrogen transfer to form metallocene ylides Cp2M(R)CHPPh3 . In some cases competitive methylene transfer occurs leading to four - membered metallacycles . the metallocene ylides all exhibit a substantial metal to carbon p-interaction , increasing in strength on going from hafnium to titanium as the central metal atom . ylide reactivity is greatly reduced . with a non-enolizable ketone , Cp2Zr(CH2CHCHCH3)CHPPh3 reacts via the reverse of the metallocene ylide forming reaction . with enolizable ketones , zirconocene or hafnocene ylides serve as bases and form metal enolates . the resulting enolate ( e ) / ( z ) ratio strongly depends on the group r of the metallocene ylide base Cp2Zr(R)CHPPh3 . 
(e4-Butadiene)zirconocene reacts with (e-C5H4Cl)Co(CO)2 at ambient temperature to yield the metallacyclic zirconoxycarbene complex Cp2Zr(C4H6)(OC)Co(CO)(C5H4Cl) ( 6 ) . In contrast to the analogous chlorine - free carbene complex <nUm> equilibration with the starting materials could not be observed for <nUm> . complex <nUm> crystallizes in space group P21 / c with cell constants a <nUm> , b <nUm> , c <nUm> Å , β <nUm> ° . the solid state structures of <nUm> and <nUm> , as determined by x-ray diffraction , are very similar . this indicates that the electronic influence of the ( C5H4X ) ligands on the CCoO bond of the starting material may be the reason for the observed different equilibrium ratios between carbene complexes and the educts Cp2Zr(butadiene) and (e-C5H4X)Co(CO)2 . 
zirconocene ( n-octyl ) chloride , [(e5-C5H5)2Zr(n-Oct)Cl] , prepared in situ from 1- , 2- , or 3-octene and zirconocene hydrogen chloride , has been found to react smoothly with <nUm> molar equivalents of stannic chloride to give moderate to high yields of n-octyltin(IV) trichloride at room temperature . 
four zirconocene systems , each containing tertiary phosphine functionality indirectly linked to either or both cyclopentadienyl rings , are described . unlike the phosphinomethylzirconocenes , in which the metal and the phosphine strongly influence each other 's basic chemistry , it has been found that a variety of transformations may be carried out at either site on the more indirectly linked systems without interference from the other . thus reduction and hydrozirconation proceed normally at the Zr center , and quaternization and complexation to a second metal may be achieved at the phosphine . two " early - late " multimetallic systems containing Zr and Co have been prepared . reduction and acylation at Co proceed without interference from Zr ; however , attempts to generate hydrides at Zr in the bimetallic systems were unsuccessful . 
elementary sulfur and selenium combine ( in boiling heptane ) with [(tBuCp)2-Zr(C6H4R)2] ( cp = e5-C5H4 ; r = CH3O ) to give the corresponding dichalcogenophenylenezirconocene . with tellurium , the reaction proceeds only at lower temperature ( in boiling hexane ) , affording the first ditellurophenylenezirconocene . As no metallacycle was obtained with the cp ligand or when the metal is Hf , complexes of the general type [(RCp)2MSe2C6H4-o] ( m = Ti , Zr , Hf ; r = H , t-Bu , CH3 ) have been synthesized by allowing metallocene dichlorides to react with potassium benzenediselenolate , prepared by cleaving [(t-BuCp)2ZrSe2C6H4-o] with t-BuOK . 
the reaction of zirconocene dichloride with disodium terephthalate in the two - phase system H2O / CCl3H yields the novel cyclic three - nuclear complex tris[di(p-cyclopentadienyl) (m-terephthalato)zirconium(IV) ] ( 5 ) , which can be isolated as the CCl2H2 solvate ( sol : <nUm> <nUm> ) . the three dicarboxylato bridges act as ( <nUm> + <nUm> ) - dentate ligands , such that each Zr atom has three ligating O atoms in addition to its cp ligands and thus has an 18-electron configuration . the twenty-seven-membered central ring of <nUm> is puckered . the structure of <nUm> has been solved by an x-ray diffraction study . the complex crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21 / n , with z = <nUm> , and the lattice parameters a <nUm> , b <nUm> , c <nUm> Å , β <nUm> ° . 
the zirconocene ylide Cp2Zr(Ph)CHPPh3 ( 1a ) reacts with benzyl isonitrile at temperatures above <nUm> ° C by insertion into the ZrC(ylide) bond to give the (e2-iminoacyl)zirconocene complex Cp2Zr(Ph)[e2-N(CH2Ph)C(CHPPh3)] ( 2a ) . complex 2a crystallizes in the space group P <nUm> - with a <nUm> , b <nUm> , c <nUm> Å , α <nUm> , β <nUm> , γ <nUm> ° . the x-ray diffraction study , showed 2a the ( e2-iminoacyl ) metallocene stereoisomer to have an " RN - inside " arrangement . the bonding parameters of the Ph3PCHC[Zr]NCH2Ph unit are consistent with 2a being an internally lewis - acid coordinated stabilized ylide . similarly the hafnocene ylide Cp2Hf(C2H5)CHPPh3 ( 1c ) reacts with benzyl isonitrile to give 2c which was identified by x-ray crystallography . it crystallizes in space group I <nUm> - with a <nUm> , b <nUm> , c <nUm> Å , α <nUm> , β <nUm> , γ <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> . the MC and MN bonds of the ( e2-iminoacyl ) metallocene moiety in 2c are slightly shorter than those in 2a . 
(e4-Butadiene)-zirconocene and -hafnocene each react with two molar equivalents of 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane to give nine - membered metallacycles Cp2MON(R)CH2CH = CHCH2N(R)O ( 8a : r = t-Bu ; m = Zr ; 8b : r = t-Bu , m = Hf ) , which have a trans-carbon-carbon double bond in the ring . In solution two different dynamic processes can be observed by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy . enantiomerization of the chiral ring system ( dent ‡ ( <nUm> K ) ≈ <nUm> kcal / mol ) is observed at high temperature , whereas at low temperature an equilibration process involving hindered N-CMe3 rotation becomes slow on the NMR time scale ( DGrot ‡ ( <nUm> K ) ≈ <nUm> kcal / mol ) .

syntheses of disubstituted , tetramethylethanediyl-bridged titanocene derivatives (CH3)4C2(1-C5H3-3-R)2TiCl2 , with r t-butyl , trimethylsilyl , isopropyl , a,a-dimethylbenzyl and 1-phenylcyclohexyl , by reductive coupling of the appropriately substituted 6,6-dimethylpentafulvenes with Mg / CCl4 and reaction of the resulting di-Grignard compounds with TiCl3*3THF are described along with those of several zirconium analogues . the reaction sequence in each case gives , together with the desired racemate , comparable amounts of the corresponding meso-configurated complex . the NMR data for the racemic and meso diastereomers of these compounds and crystal structures of one meso and several racemic representatives are reported . 
the reaction of zirconocene dichloride with acetylene dicarboxylic acid in the two - phase systems H2O / CCl2H2 and H2O / CCl3H gives the polymeric compounds [Cp2Zr(m-OCOCCOCO)]n ( 1 ) and [ Cp2Zr(m-OCOCCOCO) · CHCl3]n ( 2 ) in crystalline form . x-ray structure investigations show that in both compounds the polymer chains have <nUm> symmetry and are packed parallel to each other in the crystals . the dicarboxylato bridges act as ( <nUm> + <nUm> ) - dentate ligands , such that each Zr atom has three ligation O atoms in addition to its cp ligands and thus has an 18-electron configuration . 
insertion of borohydride into the metallaoxirane CZr bond takes place upon treatment of the (e2-formaldehyde)zirconocene dimer <nUm> with 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane . the resulting metallacyclic dimer [Cp2ZrOCH2B(C8H14)H]2 ( 4 ) has been characterized by x-ray diffraction . complex <nUm> is a model for an intermediate stage of the insertion of CO-derived methylene groups into metalhydrogen bonds , such as is thought to occur in fischer - tropsch type processes . 
many metal carbonyls add to reactive ( m2-olefin ) group <nUm> metallocene type complexes ( e.g. (m2-aryne)titanocene or -zirconocene , (butadiene)ZrCp2 ) forming metallacyclic titanoxy- or zirconoxycarbene complexes . the metallacyclic (p-allyl)zirconoxycarbene complex derived from (s-trans-m4-butadiene)zirconocene and hexacarbonyltungsten adds to organic carbonyl substrates to give nine - membered metallacyclic carbene complexes Cp2ZrOC[W(CO)5]CH2CHCHCH2CR1R2O , exhibiting trans-CC double bonds . the zirconoxycarbene complexes undergo stereoselective base - induced alkylation and wittig - olefination reactions . oxygen - bridged dimeric (e2-formaldehyde)zirconocene is obtained in high yield upon treatment of the carbon monoxide hydrozirconation product with methyllithium . the [(e2-CH2O)ZrCp2] - dimer undergoes various insertion reactions with aluminum hydride or boron hyridge reagents . metal carbonyl complexes insert selectively into one metallaoxirane CZr bond of [(e2-CH2O)ZrCp2]2 to give cyclic Cp2ZrOC-[ML2]CH2O containing zirconoxycarbene complexes . 
titanocene , zirconocene , and hafnocene dichlorides were reduced in the presence of terminally disubstituted 1,6-heptadiyne or 1,7-octadiyne to produce dicyclopentadienylmetallabicyclooctadienes and -nonadienes . the compounds were characterized by elemental analysis and 1H and 13C NMR spectrometry , and (C5H5)2HfC7H6[Si(CH3)3]2 was characterized by x-ray diffraction techniques . the compounds crystallized in the triclinic space group P1 in a unit cell of dimensions a <nUm> , b <nUm> , c <nUm> Å , α <nUm> , β <nUm> , γ <nUm> ° and V <nUm> A3 . refinement was done to a final agreement for <nUm> reflections with F023s(F02) of R(F) = <nUm> . 
the oligomeric hydrido zirconium complex [Cp2Zr(H)(CH2PPh2)]n ( 1 ) reacts with (e4-butadiene)zirconocene to yield the ( m-1-e1:1,2-e2-butenyl ) , ( m-phosphinomethylene ) doubly bridged binuclear zirconocene complex [Cp2-Zr(m-CHCHC2H5)(m-CH2PPh2)ZrCp2] <nUm> . complex <nUm> reacts with butadiene to give <nUm> and Ph2PCH3 . At <nUm> ° C complex <nUm> catalyzes the chemoselective hydrogenation of 1,3-cyclooctadiene to cyclooctene . formation of a binuclear m-alkenyl zirconium(IV) / zirconium (II) intermediate , similar to <nUm> , is proposed to explain the effective protection of the remaininig CC double bond in the catalytic cycle . 
the (e2-formaldehyde)zirconocene dimer (Cp2ZrOCH2)2 ( 7 ) inserts CO2 into the zirconium to carbon bond of the metallaoxirane moiety to give [(Cp2ZrOCH2)(Cp2ZrOCH2OCO)] ( 8 ) . reaction with diphenylketene <nUm> gives the cyclodimeric <nUm> : <nUm> addition product (Cp2ZrOCH2OCCPh2)2 ( 10 ) via the mono-insertion product <nUm> . similarly , treatment of <nUm> with t-butylisocyanate yields the intermediate complex [(Cp2ZrOCH2)(Cp2ZrOCH2OCNCMe3)] ( 11 ) which gives the final product (Cp2ZrOCH2OCNCMe3)2 ( 12 ) . here two five - membered metallacycles are joined together by oxygen bridges via a central four - membered OZr metallacycle . complex <nUm> was characterized by x-ray diffraction . it crystallizes in space group P21 / n with cell parameters a <nUm> , b <nUm> , c <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° ; z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , rw = <nUm> . 
3-Arsolenes , R1AsCH2C(Me)C(R2)CH2 ( R1 = ph , me , t-Bu , R2 = H , me ) , are obtained in good yield from chloroarsines , R1AsCl2 , and zirconocene diene complexes . they react with methyl iodide at room temperature to give arsonium salts and with Cr(CO)5THF to form the corresponding chromium complexes . 
reaction of M2'[(e5-C5H4)2Si(CH3)2] ( M' = Li , Na , K ) with MCl4 produced the known complexes [(e5-C5H4)2Si(CH3)2]MCl2 ( m = Ti ( 1 ) and Zr ( 2 ) . along with the predominant product in each case a new titanium and zirconium compound is isolated . treatment of the complexes <nUm> and <nUm> with C4H11LiSi gives the novel derivatives [(e5-C5H4)2Si(CH3)2]M[CH2Si(CH3)3]2 ( m = Ti ( 4 ) and Zr ( 5 ) ) which have been characterized by NMR and mass spectrometry and in the case of <nUm> by an x-ray structural determination . 
(e4-Isoprene)zirconocene reacts with hexacarbonyltungsten to give the metallacyclic (p-allyl)zirconoxycarbene complex Cp2ZrOC[W(CO)5]CH2CHC(CH3)CH2 ( 14a ) , the structure of which has been determined by an x-ray diffraction study . only one regioisomer is formed , that with the methyl substituent at the meso-position ( C2 ) of the p-allyl-carbene ligand chain . complex 14a undergoes insertion of one equivalent of acetone to give the nine - membered metallacyclic zirconoxycarbene complex Cp2ZrOC[W(CO)5]CH2CHC(CH3)CH2CR1R2O ( <nUm> , R1 = R2 = CH3 ) , which has an e-configurated endocyclic CC double bond . the chiral metallacycle <nUm> undergoes a thermally induced intramolecular enantiomerization , the activation barrier for which has been determined by dynamic 1H NMR spectroscopy to be DGent ≠ ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal / mol . with pinacolone , 14a forms an analogous nine - membered metallacyclic zirconoxycarbene complex ( only one diastereoisomer observed under thermodynamic control ) , which undergoes a stereo - unselective base - induced a-alkylation reaction to yield a <nUm> / <nUm> mixture of diastereomeric c6-monomethylated carbene complexes . 
(e5-Formaldehyde)zirconocene dimer [Cp2ZrOCH2]2 ( 5 ) reacts with tert-butylisothiocyanat at <nUm> ° C by sequential insertion of the heterocumulene SC into the metallaoxirane CZr linkages . the mono-insertion product [(Cp2ZrOCH2)*(Cp2ZrOCH2C[NCMe3]S)] ( 13 ) is detected as an intermediate by 1H / 13C NMR spectroscopy . the final reaction product is [Cp2ZrOCH2C[NCMe3]S]2 ( 14 ) . the five - membered metallacyclic subunits of <nUm> are connected by means of the ring oxygen atoms to give a metallatricyclic dimer with a OZr containing central four - membered ring system . complex <nUm> was characterized by x-ray diffraction . it crystallizes with C6D6 solvent in space group P21 / c with cell parameters a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , rw = <nUm> . 
titanocene and zirconocene complexes with a phenyl or 1-naphthyl substituent in one b-position of each C5 - ring ligand and with an interannular tetramethylethano- or dimethylsilano-bridge have been prepared . racemic complex isomers , which are formed together with varying amounts of their meso isomers , were separated from the latter and characterised by 1H NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallographic studies . 
the hydrosilation of olefins such as styrene , 1-hexene , and 2-pentene with diphenylsilane can be carried out with catalysts generated from zirconocene dichloride and two equivalents of butyllithium . complete regioselectivity is observed as only terminal organosilicon products are produced ( ∼ <nUm> % ) . In the case of styrene , three major products are formed : diphenylphenethylsilane ( <nUm> % ) , trans-1-diphenylsilyl-2-phenylethene ( <nUm> % ) , and ethylbenzene ( <nUm> % ) . the product distribution was found to be dependent on reagent concentrations : reactions run with excess diphenylsilane favored diphenylphenethylsilane ; excess styrene favored trans-1-diphenylsilyl-2-phenylethene . extensive H / d exchange is observed in the hydrosilation of styrene with Ph2SiD2 . 
polymerization of Me3SiSiHMe2 , Me2HSiSiHMe2 and MeH2SiSiH2Me takes place readily in the presence of Cp2MR2 catalyst ( CP = CH ; m = Ti , Zr ; r = me , nBu ) in the absence of a solvent ( " polymerization in bulk " ) to give a mixture containing trisilanes , tetrasilanes , pentasilanes , higher oligosilanes and polysilanes . depending on the reaction conditions different proportions of linear oligo- and poly-silanes are obtained . MeH2SiSiH2Me also yields branched oligo- and poly-silanes . polymerization of MeH2siSiH2Me " in bulk " in the presence of a catalytic amount of Cp2MR2 ( CP = CH ; m = Ti , Zr ; r = me , nBu ) leads to a new type of polysilane polymer , poly(methylsilane) , (MeSiHx)n , which is thought to be the first organosilicon " living polymer " . MeH2SiSiH2Me is also polymerized in inert solvents in the presence of Cp2MR2 ( CP = CH ; m = Ti , Zr ; r = me , nBu , ph ) catalysts . 
the reaction of (e2-formaldehyde)zirconocene dimer ( 3 ) with hafnocene dichloride ( 5 ) at room temperature gives the heterobimetallic complex [ m-(e1-O : e2-C,O-formaldehyde)(Cp2ZrCl)(Cp2HfCl) ] . from thermochemical considerations it is suggested that methylene migration from zirconium to hafnium occurs during the reaction , favouring the regioisomer Cp2(Cl)Zr-O-CH2-Hf(Cl)Cp2 ( 7 ) under equilibrium conditions . 
hydrozirconation-deuterolysis of (E)-3-methoxy-1-phenyl-1-propene was found to give a- and o-deuterated propylbenzenes after elimination of the ether function . an unforeseen higher degree of benzylic substitution in the propylbenzenes was observed . In an effort to account for the regiochemical outcome of the reaction , hydrozirconation of propenylbenzenes with mixed reagents and deuterozirconation was investigated . hydrozirconation of (E)-3-propenol-2-propenol results in loss of the hydroxyl group to only a small extent , and after hydrozirconation and deuterolysis fair yields of benzenopropan-g-d-ol are formed . carbonyl insertion into 3-hydroxyl-1-phenyl-1-zirconocene-propane gives low yields of the lactone dihydro-3-phenyl-2(3H)-furanone . 
reaction of tris(trimethylsilyl)cyclopentadienyllithium with zirconium and hafnium tetrachloride affords 1,1',2,2',4,4'-hexakis(trimethylsilyl)zirconocene dichloride and 1,1',2,2',4,4'-hexakis(trimethyl-silyl)hafnocene dichloride . these complexes show hindered rotation of the cyclopentadienyl ligands , with barriers to rotation of <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal / mol and <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal / mol being found for the zirconium and hafnium complex , respectively . these values are compared with those of the corresponding 1,1',3,3'-tetrakis(trimethylsiyl)metallocene dichlorides and a model is proposed to account for the large differences in rotational barriers . 
the interaction of zirconocene dichloride derivatives with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) was studied in toluene medium under argon and ethylene atmospheres by IR , 13H , 13C , 27Al and 29Si NMR spectroscopy . data relating to polymerization of ethylene on these catalysts are given . 
the five - membered metallacycle Cp2Zr(CR1 = CR2CR2 = CR1 ) ( <nUm> , R1 = SiMe3 , R2 = ph ) is a suitable starting material for the in situ generation of the reactive (e2-phenyltrimethylsilylethyne)zirconocene ( 3 ) . thus , thermolysis of <nUm> ( <nUm> ° C ) with trimethylphosphane gives Cp2Zr(Me3SiC*z.tbnd ; CPh)(PMe3) ( 8 ) and free Me3SiCCPh ( 4 ) . subsequent reaction of <nUm> with acetophenone produces Cp2Zr[CR1 = CR2CMePhO ] ( <nUm> , R1 = SiMe3 , R2 = ph ) . thermolysis of <nUm> in the presence of CpW(CO)3H also results in the liberation of one quivalent of <nUm> . the reactive intermediate <nUm> is protonated to give Cp2Zr(CR1 = CHR2)(m-OC)W(CO)2CP ( <nUm> , R1 = SiMe3 , R2 = ph ) . treatment of <nUm> with [HNEt3][BPh4] in acetonitrile gives the cationic Cp2Zr(CR1 = CR2CMe = NH)(CH3CN)+ ( 3a : R1 = SiMe3 , R2 = ph ) and its regioisomer 13b ( R1 and R2 exchanged ) . there is evidence that the complexes <nUm> are formed by acetonitrile addition to thermally - generated <nUm> to give Cp2Zr(CR1 = CR2CMe = N ) , which is then subsequently protonated at the basic ring nitrogen . these reactions show that a readily available metallacyclopentadiene system can be used as a convenient synthetic equivalent of a very reactive (e2-alkyne)metallocene complex by thermally induced equilibration in the presence of suitable trapping reagents . 
methyl e2-1,2-diphenylhydrazido(1-)zirconocene ( 1 ) has been synthesized from the monopotassium salt of 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and Cp2Zr(Me)(Cl) . heating <nUm> in THF causes extrusion of methane , generating the transient hydrazido complex Cp2Zr(N2Ph2) ( 2 ) which is trapped by solvent to yield the THF adduct Cp2Zr(N2Ph2)(THF) ( 3 ) . the THF ligand of compound <nUm> was replaced with a variety of s-donor ligands to form the ligated hydrazido complexes Cp2Zr(N2Ph2)(L) ( L pyridine ) ( 4 ) , PMe3 ( 5 ) , NCPh ( 6 ) and CNCMe3 ( 7 ) ) . compound <nUm> was characterized by x-ray diffraction . the THF adduct <nUm> also undergoes a reaction involving insertion of alkynes into one of its metal-nitrogen bonds . thus , reaction of <nUm> with 2-butyne and 3-hexyne leads to zirconocene 2,3-diazametallacyclopentenes <nUm> and <nUm> respectively . the structure of these metallacycles was supported by an x-ray diffraction study of <nUm> . compound <nUm> also reacted with phenylacetylene and acetophenone via deprotonation to furnish the e2-hydrazido(1-)acetylide ( 10 ) and enolate ( 11 ) , respectively . 
thermolysis of bis(2-furyl)zirconocene <nUm> at <nUm> ° C gives 1,1-bis(e-cyclopentadienyl)-1-zircona-2-oxa-6-(2'-furyl)cyclohexa-3,5-diene <nUm> via a coupled s,s-exchange reaction . complex <nUm> was characterized by x-ray diffraction and shown to be monomeric in the crystal and to have a non-planar twist - like oxametallacyclohexadiene ring conformation . 
the reaction of methylzirconocenechloride with 2-bornenyllithium yields (2-bornenyl)methylzirconocene ( 10a ) . carbonylation of 10a takes place exclusively by CO-insertion into the Zr - c(sp2) bond to give Cp2ZrMe(e2-OC-C10H15) ( 16a ) . the corresponding hafnium complex 10b reacts analogously to give 16b . complex 16a was characterized by x-ray diffraction , and found to contain an e2-acyl ligand bonded to zirconium in the thermodynamically favored " o-inside " arrangement with the following bonding parameters : d Zr-C(acyl) = <nUm> Å , d Zr-O(acyl) = <nUm> Å , d CO = <nUm> Å , angles O(acyl)ZrC(acyl) = <nUm> ° , ZrC(acyl)O(acyl) = <nUm> ° . 
titanocene and zirconocene ketene acetal derivatives have been prepared by reaction of the respective metallocene dichloride with the lithium enolate of isobutyric acid methyl ester . the crystal structure of C14ClH16O2Ti is reported . 
the reaction of the ferrocene-1,1'-diselenol in the presence of NEt3 , or the corresponding dilithium salt , with the tert-butylzirconocene dichloride led to the dimeric [3,3']ferrocenophane [ C10FeH8Se2Zr (C5H4tBu)2]2 ( 1 ) , as opposed to the result published previously ( B. gautheron et G. tainturier , J. organomet . chem. , <nUm> ( 1984 ) C30 . however , the 1H NMR spectra of <nUm> recorded at different temperatures correspond well with those of a [3]ferrocenophane exhibiting a dynamic inversion of the " ane " bridge . the x-ray structure only allowed the choice between the two possible arrangements . surprisingly , monomeric species were effectively isolated from the reaction when zirconocene dichloride and tert-butylhafnocene dichloride were used . the dependence of the dimeric structure on the nature of the elements present must be rationalized . 
monomeric zirconocene dipicolinate complexes , which have a formal 18-electron configuration , are stable towards water and relatively inert against aqueous ClH . methylmagnesium chloride attacks these complexes at the dipicolinate carboxyl groups and subsequent reaction with aqueous ClH gives 2,6-diacetyl pyridine and the zirconocene dichloride . other dicarboxylates , such as 3,4-dimethoxyfurane-2,5-dicarboxylate or isophthalate , form binuclear zirconocene complexes , in which one bidentate and one monodentate carboxylate ligand generate a formal 18-electron configuration . these complexes react with methylmagnesium chloride to give the respective zirconocene dimethyl complexes , i.e. by normal replacement of CO bonds by C2H3 bonds . 
the mono- and bis-cyclopentadienyl compounds 1-(Cp'')-4-(CH3)C6H4 ( 1 ) and <nUm> , 4-(Cp'')2C6H4 ( 2 ) ( cp'' = 3,4-dimethylcyclopenta-1,3-diene-1-yl ) have been synthesized . the reactions of the lithium salts of <nUm> and <nUm> with CpZrCl3 · dme ( dme = dimethoxyethane ) and Cp*ZrCl3(CP* C2H3 ) yielded the mono- and bi-nuclear bridged zirconocenes 1-(Cp''ZrCpCl2)-4-(CH3)C6H4 ( 3 ) , 1,4-(Cp''ZrCpCl2)2C6H4 ( 4 ) and 1,4-(Cp''ZrCp*Cl2)2C6H4 ( 5 ) . when activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , the mono- and bi-nuclear zirconocenes <nUm> and <nUm> catalyse the polymerization of propene . the influence of the catalyst composition on the polymerization kinetics and molecular weight is discussed . 
the possible role of an a-agostic interaction in the course of an olefin insertion at a ziegler - natta catalytic centre in [Cp2Zr(C2H4)CH3]+ has been studied by extended huckel calculations . it is shown that in a cationic zirconocene catalyst an a-agostic H Zr contact plays no role in a ground state species but becomes increasingly important along the reaction coordinate for the CC bond - forming insertion reaction . this can be traced to the weakening of the ZrCalkyl bond and the simultaneous transformation to a more electron deficient zirconium species . In contrast , a b-agostic interaction in [ Cp2Zr(C2H4)CH2CH3+ leads to a stable ground state b-H Zr contact . the agostic interaction of one hydrogen on the a-carbon is also compared to an agostic contact of two a-hydrogens . the behaviour of orbital energies and the H Zr overlap population has been examined as a function of the angles of methyl tilt and olegfin shift . 
zirconocene , generated in situ , reacts with trimethylsilylacetylene to form the dimeric complex [ cp2Zr ( C CSiMe3)]2 as a byproduct . this compound has been fully characterized and its solid- state structure established by an x-ray single crystal structure analysis . 
the phosphido-bridged dinuclear zirconocene(III) complexes cis-[Cp'2Zr(m-PHR)]2 ( cp'2 C5H4Me , r tBu ( 1 ) , ad ( 2 ) ) are isolated from the reaction of Cp'2ZrCl2 with solvent - free LiPHR ( r C4H9(tBu) , C2H3 ( ad ) ) . it can be shown by 31P NMR spectroscopy that the complexes Cp'2Zr(PHR)2 and { A figure is presented } are also formed , as well as the oxidation products of LiPHR , meso- and d,l-P2H2R2 . <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized spectroscopically ( NMR , IR , MS ) and by x-ray structure determination . only one isomer ( cis ) is present in the solid state and in solution . the PZr bond lengths range from <nUm> Å to <nUm> Å in <nUm> , and from <nUm> Å to <nUm> Å in <nUm> . the central PZr ring of <nUm> and <nUm> is slightly puckered ( dihedral angle : <nUm> ° ( 1 ) , <nUm> ° ( 2 ) ) . the long Zr3*Zr distance of <nUm> Å ( 1 ) and <nUm> Å ( 2 ) indicates the absence of zrinteraction . 
Methyl(N-pyrrolyl)zirconocene ( 8a ) reacts with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane selectively by transfer of the heterocyclic ligand to give the methylzirconocene cation , which is an active ethylene polymerization catalyst when generated in situ in toluene . In contrast , (diethylamido)methylzirconocene ( 8b ) undergoes only transfer of the methyl group when treated with the B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> lewis acid , to five the (diethylamido)zirconocene cation ( 10b ) . the [ ( et <nUm> N)ZrCp <nUm> + MeB(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> - ] salt is not stable and rapidly reacts at room temperature with methane elimination and formation of a cationic ( η <nUm> -iminoacyl)metallocene system . the resulting [ cp <nUm> zr(e <nUm> -MeC = NEt ) + HB(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> - ] species ( 11b ) is isolated with an <nUm> % yield . Methyl(N-piperidyl)zirconocene ( 8c ) reacts similarly when treated with B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> to give the ( η <nUm> -iminoacylium)zirconocene ( 11c ) via the intermediate 10a . 
reaction of indenyllithium with 1,1-dichlorosilacyclobutane gave a mixture of diastereomeric isomers of 1,1-bis(10ineenyl)-1-silacyclobutane ( 1 ) , and the product was in turn converted into diastereomeric (1,3-propanediyl)silylene-bis(1-indenyl)dichlorozirconium complexes ( 2 ) in a <nUm> : <nUm> racemic : meso ratio . complex <nUm> was activated with either methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) or Ph3CB(C6F5)4 to perform ethylene and propylene polymerization over a very board range of temperature of polymerization ( <nUm> ° C ≤ tp ≤ <nUm> ° C ) . variations of the polymerization activity ( A ) and molecular weight ( MW ) with tp were investigated as well as the isotactic yield ( IY ) in the case of propylene polymerizations . comparisons of those results with other closely related ansa - zirconocene precursors were also made . 
the terminal nitrogen atoms of phenyl azide and diphenyldiazomethane insert into one of the carbon-zirconium bonds of zirconacyclopentanes to give novel <nUm> electron azazirconacycles that are very stable towards hydrolysis . an x-ray diffraction study has been carried out on the triazenido alkyl zirconocene complex <nUm> . hydrogenolysis of the diphenyldiazomethane inserted zirconacycle gives a primary amine , the first example of the direct formation of amines from organozirconium compounds . 
A variety of new chiral one-carbon - bridged metallocene derivatives of titanium and zirconium has been prepared . addition of the anions of cyclopentadiene , indene and fluorene to 6-t-butylfulvene produced the ligands t-BuCH(C5H5)R ( r = CH , <nUm> ; C9H7 , <nUm> ; C13H9 , <nUm> ) . the reaction of the ligands 8-10 with n-BuLi produced the corresponding bis-anions , which were reacted with titanium or zirconium tetrachloride at low temperature ( <nUm> ° C ) , to produce the complexes t-BuCH(e5-C5H4)(R)MCl2 ( r = e5-C5H4 , m = Ti , <nUm> ; r = e5-C5H4 , m = Zr , <nUm> , r = e5-C9H6 , m = T , <nUm> ; r = e5-C9H6 , m = Zr , <nUm> ; r = e5-C13H8 , m = Zr , <nUm> ) . the chlorine atoms in complexes <nUm> and <nUm> can be easily replaced by methyl groups producing the corresponding dimethyl derivatives <nUm> and <nUm> . 
reactions of zirconocene - alkene complexes Cp2Zr(CH2CHR)(PR'3) ( r H , me , et , SiR''3 or Ar ) with aldehydes or ketones were investigated . zirconocene-ethylene , -propylene or 1-butene complexes reacted with aldehydes or ketones at terminal carbons of alkenes to give the corresponding alcohols after hydrolysis with a high regioselectivity . A similar type of reaction product was also obtained by a reaction of zirconacyclopentanes with aldehydes . this reaction proceeded via b-b'carbon-carbon bond cleavage of zirconacyclopentanes . A reaction of zirconocene - vinylsilane complexes with ketones afforded 3-trimethylsilyl-1-oxa-2-zirconacyclopentanes with an excellent regioselectivity . carbon-carbon bond formation occurred exclusively at the terminal carbon of vinylsilanes . their corresponding g-silylalcohols were obtained after hydrolysis . the products showed that vinylsilanes reacted with carbonyl compounds at the b-carbon to silyl group . it is in sharp contrast to the conventional reactions of vinylsilanes of which the a-carbon normally attacked electrophiles . the reactions of styrene and its derivatives with pentan-3-one on zirconium gave a mixture of two regioisomers . substituents of alkenes tend to be in a-position to Zr in 1-oxa-2-zirconacyclopentanes . this orientation showed a different aspect of the formation of 1-oxa-2-zirconacyclopentanes from the alkene - alkene coupling reaction on zirconium . the regioselectivity of the reaction with carbonyl compounds decreased in this order ; r = alkyl > silyl > aryl . 
hydrozirconation of various alkenylboronic esters <nUm> with H(Cl)ZrCp2 produces a new class of bidentate lewis acids as crystalline solids or oils , <nUm> , in 81-96 % yield . products <nUm> were characterized by IR , NMR , and in selected cases elemental analysis . 
the reaction of CCl2P2Zr ( cp CH ) with solvent - free LiPH(2,4,6-tBu3C6H2) yields the terminal zirconocene phosphido complexes Cp2Zr(Cl){PH(2,4,6-tBu3C6H2)} ( 1 ) ( <nUm> : <nUm> reaction ) or Cp2Zr{PH(2,4,6-t Bu3C6H2)}2 ( 2 ) ( <nUm> : <nUm> reaction ) . <nUm> is more readily obtained from the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with H2P(2,4,6- tBu3C6H2 ) in the presence of Mg . <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized spectroscopically ( NMR , IR , MS ) . an x-ray structure determination of <nUm> shows that the PZr bond lengths ( PZr <nUm> Å , P2Zr <nUm> Å ) are identical . <nUm> and <nUm> exhibit dynamic NMR behaviour ( 1H ) indicating rotation around the PC bond and inversion of the phophido group . 
two series of group <nUm> bent metallocene complexes bearing cholestanol - derived substituents at their cp - rings have been prepared . 5a-Cholestan-3 a-ol was converted to the 3a-mesylate . nucleophilic substitution with CpNa , followed by deprotonation and treatment with ZrCl4(THF)2 gave bis[e5-(5a-cholestan-3b-yl)cyclopentadienyl]zirconium dichloride 3b-5 . 5a-Cholestan-3-one <nUm> was converted to the corresponding fulvene , methyl lithium was added and deprotonation and addition to ZrCl4(THF)2 furnished bis[e5-(3b-methyl- 5a-cholestan-3a-yl)cyclopentadienyl]zirconium dichloride ( 11b ) . treatment of the chiral cp - substituted zirconocene dichlorides with a large excess of methyl alumoxane gave homogeneous ziegler catalysts . propene polymerization proceeded with overall stereochemical chain end control to give partly isotactic polypropylene . 
the zirconocene alkyne complexes Cp2Zr(THF)(Me3SiCCSiMe3) ( 1 ) and Cp2Zr(py)(Me3SiC CSiMe3 ) ( 2 ) react with acetone to yield the new zirconadihydrofurane complex Cp2ZrOC(Me2) C(SiMe3)C(SiMe3) ( 3 ) . reaction of <nUm> with tolan gives , under substitution of the alkyne moiety , a further dihydrofurane compound Cp2ZrOC(Me2)C(Ph)C(Ph) ( 4 ) . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> are characterized by NMR and x-ray structure analyses . they are compared with the known titanocene complex cp2 TiOC(Me2)C(Ph)C(Ph) ( 5 ) to study the influence of the metals m = Ti , Zr and the substituents r = ph , SiMe3 in selected metalladihydrofuranes Cp2MOC(Me2)C ( r ) C ( r ) . although the structures of complexes <nUm> and <nUm> are similar , the complexes display different reactivities . thus <nUm> is capable of reacting with tolan , CO2 and water at room temperature , while <nUm> is inactive towards these compounds under the same conditions . 
3-Arsolenes R-AsCH2C(Me)C(R')CH2(R = ph , me , tBu , Cl , R' = H , me ) are readily obtained from zirconocene-butadiene complexes and RAsCl2 . alkylation with methyl iodide gives arsonium salts [R(Me)AsCH2C(Me)C(R')CH2]I ( r = ph , me , tBu , R' = H , me ) , treatment with sulphur gives sulphides R(S)AsCH2 C(Me)C(Me) - CH2 ( r = me , tBu ) , while oxidation with br2 or Cl2O2S results in ring cleavage . from chloroarsolene ClAsCH2C(Me)C(Me)CH2 substitution products R-AsCH2C(Me)C(Me)CH2 ( r = I , H , SPh , OMe , NMe2 ) as well as coupling products with AsAs , As2O , and As2S units were synthesized . In addition , a number of arsolene complexes with the metals chromium , molybdenum , tungsten , and ruthenium is described . 
we have demonstrated a very efficient ( <nUm> steps , <nUm> % yield from 1-octen-7-yne and 1,2-diiodobenzene ) and novel synthesis of 1,2-bis(9-bicyclo[4.3.0]-non-1,6-dinyl)benzen . we utilized for the firstime in a bis(cyclopentadiene) synthesis the double pauson - khand cyclization and shapiro - elimination methods . the double pauson - khand cyclization is also successful in the preparation of ethylene-bridged bis(cyclopentadienes) . A novel iodine - promoted elimination of allyl methyl ethers was also applied in the preparation of bis(cyclopentadienes) . the solid state structure of 1,2-bis(9-bicyclo[4.3.0]-non-1,6-dienyl)benzenedichlorotitanium ( dl-4a ) was obtained and it shows a very obtuse angle between the cyclopentadienyl substituents . the crstallographic data for dl-4a are as follows : C24Cl2H24Ti , monoclinic , C2 / c . a = <nUm> A ̊ , b = <nUm> A ̊ , c = <nUm> A ̊ , β = <nUm> ° , volume <nUm> A3 , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , rw = <nUm> % , goodness of fit <nUm> . 
the six - membered ring annulated C <nUm> - bridged ansa - metallocene [(4-cyclopentadienylidene)-4,7,7-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl]zirconium dichloride ( 6a ) was treated with " butadiene-magnesium " to yield the corresponding ( s-cis-e <nUm> -butadiene)ansa-zirconocene complex as a mixture of two diastereoisomers ( 8a / 8a' ) . their mutual interconversion was monitored by dynamic <nUm> H NMR spectroscopy at high temperatures . the gibbs activation energy of the thermally induced 8a =8a' (butadiene)metalocene ring topomerization is DG inv ≠ ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol <nUm> . this is about <nUm> kcal mol <nUm> higher than observed for the analogous ( σ <nUm> , p-butadiene)metallocene ring inversion process in the parent bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium system . the corresponding ( s-cis-e <nUm> -butadiene)ansa-hafnocene complex ( <nUm> / 9' ) was prepared analogously . its ( η <nUm> -butadiene)Hf inversion barrier ( DG inv ≠ ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol <nUm> ) is about <nUm> kcal mol <nUm> higher than that of the ( s-cis-e <nUm> -butadiene)HfCp <nUm> reference . the ( s-cis-e <nUm> -butadiene)[7-n-butyl-(4-cyclopentadienylidene)4,7-dimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl]zirconium complex 8b was characterized by x-ray diffraction . the e-butadiene ligand exhibits only a small CC bond alteration ( <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> Å ) and a relatively small difference of the butadiene C terminal -Zr ( <nUm> and <nUm> Å ) vs. C internal -Zr ( <nUm> and <nUm> Å ) bond lengths . this points to an increased π complex character of the rigid ansa - metallocene complex compared with the parent ( s-cis-e <nUm> -butadiene)zirconocene complex 2a whose structure was determined as a reference ( 2a : butadiene C terminal Zr , <nUm> and <nUm> Å , C internal Zr , <nUm> and <nUm> Å ) . A theoretical extended huckel theory analysis has revealed that the pronounced increase in the butadiene metallocene topomerization barrier on going from the " normal " bent metallocene ( D(1)ZrD(2) , <nUm> ° , where D(1) and D(2) denote the centroids of the cp rings ) to the strained C <nUm> - bridged ansa - metallocene complex <nUm> containing a markedly opened bent metallocene wedge ( 8b : D(1)ZrD(2) , <nUm> ° ) is electronic in origin , probably caused by closing the energy gap between the 2a <nUm> and b <nUm> frontier orbitals . we conclude that the stereoelectronic features of the bent metallocenes can be controlled by the application of specific steric constraints . 
reaction of Si(1,3-tBu2-C5H3)Me3 with MCl4 ( m = Ti , Zr ) in toluene or hexane at room temperature affords the new trichloromonociclopentadienyl-type derivatives [M(1,3-tBu2-e5-C5H3)Cl3] ( m = Ti ( 2 ) , Zr ( 3 ) ] . treatment of complexes <nUm> and <nUm> with appropriate alkylating reagents in hexane gives the 1,3-di(tert-butyl)cyclopentadienyl trialkyl titanium and zirconium complexes [M(1,3-tBu2-e5-C5H3)R3] [ m = Ti , r = CH3 ( 4 ) , CH2 ph ( 5 ) ; m = Zr , r = CH3 ( 6 ) , CH2 ph ( 7 ) , CH2CMe2Ph(8) ] . interestingly , when <nUm> reacts with <nUm> equivalents of LiCH2CMe2Ph in hexane at room temperature the ring-tert-butyl-metallated complex [ Ti(1-tBu-3-CMe2CH2-e5-C5H3) (CH2CMe2Ph)2 ] ( bd9 ) was isolated in <nUm> % yield . the cationic mono(1,3-di-(tert-butyl)cyclopentadienyl) dibenzyl zirconium species [Zr(1,3-tBu2-e5-C5H3)(CH2Ph2]+ , generated in situ by reaction of the tribenzyl complex <nUm> with BC18F15 or [CPh3]+[B(C6F5)4]- reagents , is reported and their dynamic NMR behaviour in CD2Cl2 solutions at low temperatures is studied . 
A variety of new silylene-bridged fluorenyl-containing ligands has been synthesized with good yields via a convenient synthetic route . two dimethylsilylene-bridged (e5-indenyl)(e5-fluorenyl)(1) and (e5-cyclopentadienyl)(e5-fluorenyl) ( 2 ) zirconocene dichlorides with C1 and Cs molecular symmetry have also been prepared . upon activation with methyl aluminoxane , the former produced a polypropylene of high molecular weight , but with low activity and isotacticity . the latter catalyzed non-stereospecific propylene polymerization without any syndiotactic tendency , but with <nUm> and <nUm> times greater ethylene and propylene activity respectively than the former catalytic system . 
the synthesis , crystal structure and propene polymerization behaviour of four bridged zirconocene dichlorides is presented . all catalysts are capable of isotactic propene polymerization . methyl substitutions at the 2- , 4- and 7-positions of the bridged bis(indenyl)zirconocene dichlorides were introduced . the methyl substituent in the 7-position of the idenyl ring induces a significant steric interaction with the bridging group . on comparison of the 2,4,7-methyl substituted catalysts with their unsubstituted counterparts , only the ethylidene bridged catalyst rac-1,2-ethylidene-bis(2,4,7-trimethyl-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 4 ) is forced into the optimum geometry for isotactic propene polymerization . owing to the steric bulk at the bridge catalyst <nUm> is very rigid with respect to the movement of the idenyl rings and the metal centre thus produces highly isotacic polypropene even up to high polymerization temperatures . molecular mechanics calculations and temperature - dependent NMR measurements demonstrate that catalyst <nUm> is not able to equilibrate between the λ and δ conformational state as the corresponding rac-1,2-ethylidene-bis(-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 3 ) catalyst does . In the case of the catalyst isopropyliden((3-tert-butyl)cyclopentadienyl-9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride (6)_the substitution in the 3-position changes the symmetry from Cs to C1 . this catalyst produces isotactic polypropene but with a decreased polymerization activity . 
the previously unknown 1,1-dichloro-2,3,4,5-tetramethyl-1-silacylopenta-2,4-diene ( 3 ) was prepared in a three - step synthesis starting from zirconocene dichloride , 2-butyne , and n-butyllithium via bis(cyclopentadienyl)-2,3,4,5-tetramethyl-1-zirconacyclopenta-2,4-diene ( 1 ) and 1,4-diiodo-1,2,3,4-tetramethylbuta-1,3-diene ( 2 ) . <nUm> was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single - crystal x-ray diffraction . reaction of the new silole <nUm> with <nUm> equivalents of lithium in THF gives the corresponding dianion 4. 1H- , 13C- , and 29Si - NMR chemical shifts of <nUm> compared with <nUm> indicate some aromatic character for the ionic species . trapping of <nUm> with Me3SiCl gives 1,1-bis(trimethylsilyl)-2,3,4,5-tetramethysilole ( 5 ) in quantitative yield . 
reactions of either C8H11P or dmpe ( dmpe = C3H8P ) adducts of Cl4Zr with four equivalents of C5H7K lead to the formation of the respective <nUm> or <nUm> electron mono(ligand) adducts of the open zirconocene C10H14Zr . both complexes were found to exist in the expected symmetric conformations , as confirmed for the dmpe complex by a single crystal x-ray diffraction study . 
the enantiomerically pure C2 - symmetrical (DMeBCOCp)2ZrCl2 complex (+)-3 was synthesized from enantiomerically pure (-)-DMeBCOCp ligand (-)-1 . zirconocene (+)-3 was recrystallized from toluene to provide single crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction . the unit cell contained two conformationally similar molecules in the monoclinic space group P21 ( # <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> A ̊ , b = <nUm> A ̊ , c = <nUm> A ̊ , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A 3 , z = <nUm> . of the <nUm> unique reflections , <nUm> observed reflections ( 3s or greater ) were refined to give a final r = <nUm> and rw = <nUm> . the cyclopentadienyl substituents are arranged in a roughly C2 - symmetrical orientation and the cyclopentadienyl carbons are close to a synclinal orientation . 
A study was made of the polymerization of ethylene involving the use of a series of [e4-4-RC6H4C(NSiMe3)2]2ZrCl2 as precatalysts ( r = H ( 1 ) ; CH3 ( 2 ) ) . the benzamidinate zirconium dichloride complexes were prepared from Cl4Zr and the corresponding 4-RC6H4C(NSiMe3)2Li* TMEDA ligand . the structure of complex <nUm> was determined by a low - temperature x-ray diffraction study . " cationic " ethylene polymerization catalysts were generated from <nUm> and <nUm> with methylalumoxane . the polymerization activity and the molecular weights of the polymers are strongly dependent on the catalyst and cocatalyst concentrations . the polymerization activity increases drastically with increase in pressure and temperature and decreases when electron - releasing groups are attached to the aromatic ring . 
insertion of aldehydes into alkyne - zirconocene complexes provides configurationally pureallyl alcohols in a one - pot procedure . In the case of unsymmetrical alkynes , the regioselectivity of the insertion process is high for terminal alkynes . with trimethylsilyl-substituted alkynes the regioseectivity is low . the insertion of chiral aldehydes into the symmetrical oct-4-yne-zirconocene complex provides the cram isomer as the major product . on the other hand , reaction of the complex derived from a terminal alkyne with 2-phenylpropanal leads primarily to the anti-Cram product . the results are explained in terms of a four - centre transition - state model . 
the preparation of new zirconocene dichloride complexes containing 9-substituted fluorenyl ligands is reported . the complexes were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy . 
the three novel zirconocenophane dichlorides [(O(Me2SiC5H4)2)ZrC12] ( 3 ) , [O(Me2SiC5H3-tC4H9)2)ZrC12] ( 4 ) and [{Me2Si(OMe2SiC5H4)2)ZrCl2]n ( 5 ) have been prepared and characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy . according to a successful single - crystal x-ray study , <nUm> crystallizes from n-hexane as a racemic mixture with exclusively 1,3-disubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligands and Cl centres oriented transoid to the O atoms . <nUm> : monoclinic ; space group P2 <nUm> c , a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> pm ; β = <nUm> ° ; r = <nUm> ( rw = <nUm> ) . In solution ( room temperature ) , all three complexes are fluxional ; moreover the NMR spectrum of <nUm> displays the resonances of two isomers ( <nUm> : <nUm> ) . according to a mass spectrometry study of <nUm> , the B2 e-coupled scan of the molecular ion M+ ( m z = <nUm> ) indicates at least four " parent " fragments with <nUm> { slanted equal to or less - than } m z ≤ <nUm> , suggesting here trinuclear or even trinuclear precursors . 
A series of Cp'(C5H5)ZrCl12 and Cp2'ZrCl12 precatalysts ( cp' = C5Me4H , C4Me4P , C5Me5 ) together with C10Cl12H10Zr has been investigated in terms of steric and electronic variations and their catalytic activities in combination with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) towards the polymerization of ethylene are compared . the changes in the steric environment were evaluated on the basis of the structural data available and supplemented by theoretical structural studies on the semiempirical ( ZINDO , EHMO ) and density functional ( DF ) level . the x-ray structures of (C5Me4H)2ZrCl2 ( 3 ) and (C4Me4P)(C5H5)ZrCl2 ( 4 ) have been determined ( <nUm> : orthorhombic , cmcm , a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> c = <nUm> A ̊ , z = <nUm> ; <nUm> : monoclinic , P21 / c , a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> A ̊ β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> . 91Zr NMR data for the above series has been measured and is correlated to changes in the HOMO-LUMO gap available from electronic structure calculations . under mostly homogeneous polymerization conditions , at very low zirconium concentrations the order of the catalytic activity found for ethylene polymerizations is C10Cl2H10Zr > (C5Me4H)(C5H5)ZrCl2 > (C5Me5)(C5H5)ZrCl2 > (C4Me4P)(C5H5)ZrCl2 > (C5Me4H)2ZrCl2 > (C5Me5)2ZrCl2 > (C4Me4P)2ZrCl2 , which for the most part is inversely proportional to the steric demand of the ring ligands in the metallocene precatalysts except for the phospholyl systems . the lower activities of the phospholyl vs. the tetra- and penta-methylcyclopentadienyl compounds might imply an electronic effect such that the electron withdrawing phosphorus substituent decreases the activity , although further studies are needed to clarify this situation . emphasis is placed on the control of the polymerization conditions and evaluation of the time - activity profiles . At higher zirconium concentrations an increased precipitation of polyethylene takes place during the course of polymerization and results in a transfer to the heterogeneous phase with a diffusion controlled reaction rate thereby invalidating any activity - comparing studies . 
the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with magnesium and tBuC2SiMe3 in tetrahydrofuran yields the first zirconocene complex with an alkyl substituted alkyne without additional phosphine ligands Cp2Zr(THF)(tBuC2SiMe3) <nUm> . that complex is stable at room temperature and was characterized by its IR and NMR spectra . the spectroscopical data of <nUm> were compared with those of the well known complex of that type Cp2Zr(THF)(Me3SiC2SiMe3) <nUm> to study the influence of different sterical and electronical influences of the substituents ( tBu and SiMe3 ) upon alkyne complexation . the chemo- and regio-selectivity of complex <nUm> was studied in a hydrogen transfer reaction and in reactions with carbon dioxide and acetone . the results show mostly a kinetically favored reaction at the Si - substituted C - atom of the complexed alkyne , giving the b-SiMe3-product , which rearranges into the thermodynamically more stable a-SiMe3 - substituted products . In contrast to titanocene in the case of zirconocene complexes coupling reactions of RC ≡ CSiMe3 ( r = SiMe3 , tBu ) could be realized . 
carbonylation of dimethylzirconocene , followed by treatment with zirconocene dihydride , benzyl chloride and then methyllithium , gave the (e2-acetaldehyde)zirconocene dimer ( 9 ) as a mixture of trans- and cis-isomers isolated in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio under kinetic control and in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio under thermodynamic control , respectively . complexes trans-9 / cis-9 were treated with carbon monoxide to give the rans-10 / cis-10 monoinsertion products , and with isonitriles RNC ( r = CH2SiMe3 ( a ) , CMe3 ( b ) ) to give the mono- and bis-insertion product trans- and cis-11(a , b ) and <nUm> ( a , b ) , respectively . complex 12a was characterized by x-ray diffraction . In all cases the trans / cis stereochemical information was predominantly retained in the products , which indicates that dimetallic pathways are favoured in these insertion reactions of the metallatricyclic (e2-aldehyde)metallocene dimers . 
successive treatment of triallylamine with zirconocene chloride hydride and germanium tetrachloride affords 1-aza-5-germa-5-chlorobicyclo[3.3.3]undecane , which is converted to the 5-organo derivatives by the reaction with grignard or lithium reagents . the organo groups showed higher reactivities toward stille - type coupling than the corresponding organotributylgermanes . 
BC18F15 reacts with the (e2-acetaldehyde)zirconocene dimer ( 4 ) by hydride transfer from the methyl group of a C2H4O ligand to boron . one of the metallaoxirane moieties of the dizirconium complex is then opened to give the salt [ (e2-CH3CHO)ZrCp2 · ( CH2 = CHO)ZrCp2]+[HB(C6F5)3]-(6) that was isolated with an <nUm> % yield . 
propylene was polymerized in the presence of the cation bis(O-acetyl-(R)-mandelate) ( 1+(S) ) of (S)-ethylenebis[4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-e5-indenyl]zirconium and ( 1+(R / S ) ) of a mixture of diastereomers . under the same experimental conditions the polymers obtained with the latter exhibit abundant non-homosteric methyl 13C NMR pentads as well as 2,1-and 1,3-misinsertion resonances ; these stereo - and regioirregularities are absent in the poly(propylenes) formed by the enantiomeric 1+(S) . the stereoselectivity of catalysis by <nUm> ( r / S ) can be significantly raised either by reducing its concentration , lowering the polymerization temperature , or immobilizing it in a silica support ; the stereoselectivity of catalysis by 1(S) is not similarly affected . these results are consistent with the interchange of polymer chains of opposite b-carbon configuration bound to different chirality metal centers of the racemic mixture causing steric inversions . In the case of catalysis by 1(S) , the same process does not introduce stereoerror because the growing chains are of the same configuration . maximum isotactic specificity of an ansa - zirconocene precursor is obtained either with a pure enantiomer of the precursor or with a racemic mixture of the zirconium complex which is adequately immobilized on a support . 
four possible structures of C2 - symmetric bis(fluorenyl)zirconium complexes are presented . three bis(fluorenyl)zirconocene complexes have been prepared and tested for the polymerization of propylene and ethylene . rac / meso-Dichloro[e10-(1,2-ethanediyl)bis (7H-benzo[c]fluoren-7-ylidene)zirconium ( <nUm> / <nUm> * ) seems to be the most active polymerization catalyst for ethylene . 
the reaction of (e5-C5H5)2Zr{P(SiMe3)2}2 with C4NiO4 yields the heterodinuclear phosphido-bridged complex (e5-C5H5)2Zr{m-P(SiMe3)2}2Ni(CO)2 ( 1 ) . <nUm> was characterised spectroscopically and by x-ray structure determination . the central four - membered NiP2Zr ring is slightly puckered ( dihedral angle between planes P2Zr / NiP2 = <nUm> ° ) . the Zr-P bond lengths are equivalent ( Zr-P1 <nUm> , Zr-P2 <nUm> Å ) , as are the Ni-P bond lengths ( Ni-P1 <nUm> , Ni-P2 <nUm> Å ) . the long Zr ⋯ Ni distance of <nUm> Å indicates the absence of a metal - metal bond . the heterodinuclear phosphido- and arsenido-bridged complexes (e5-C5H5)2Zr{m-E(SiMe3)2}2M(CO)n [ e = P ; M(CO)n = C2NiO2 ( 1 ) or C4MoO4 ( 2 ) ; and e = As , M(CO)n = C4CrO4 ( 3 ) ] react rapidly with methylaluminoxane , yielding catalytically active complexes which rival the known cationic systems for the polymerization of ethylene . 
the first tin - bridged zirconocenes [ C7H10Sn 2]Zr[N(CH3)2]2 ( 3 ) and Sn{(C5H4)2Zr{N(CH3) 2]2}2 ( 4 ) have been obtained from tetrakis(dimethylamido)zirconium ( 1 ) and the CH-acidic ligands C12H16Sn ( 2a ) and C20H20Sn ( 2b ) , respectivily . the ansa - zirconocene <nUm> is formed in quantitative yield , <nUm> in <nUm> % yield . the bi- and trimetallic complexes <nUm> ( SnZr ) and <nUm> ( SnZr2 ) polymerize ethylene more efficiently than the well - known silicon - bridged analogue of <nUm> ( Si instead of Sn ) . 
chiral ansa - zirconocene complexes with a trimethylene link between the Si bridge atom and an a-position of each C5 ring ligand were prepared ; two representatives , with i-propyl and t-butyl groups as b-substituents , were structurally characterized . the properties of these complexes with respect to MAO - activated propene polymerization were studied in comparison with those of their Me2Si - bridged analogs . the t-butyl-substituted spirosilane complex gives a polymer with relatively high content of 3,1-insertions . these increased regioirregularities appear to be associated with decreased coordination gap aperture and increased lateral extension angles of the spirosilane - bridged zirconocene complexes ; this notion is supported by a molecular - mechanics analysis of alternative olefin - insertion transition states . 
one unbridged and three bridged zirconocene complexes , each of them bearing a cyclopentadienyl , fluorenyl , a-olefin and a PMe <nUm> ligand have been prepared and characterized by <nUm> H , <nUm> C and <nUm> P NMR spectroscopy . these model compounds illustrate the mechanism of olefin coordination and insertion at the active sites of syndiospecific homogeneous catalysts for the polymerization of propylene and 1-butene . 
the 1,2-di-tert-butylcyclopentadienyl anion ( 1 ) has been used to prepare 1,1',2,2'-tetra-tert-butyltitanocene dichloride ( 5 ) , 1,1',2,2'-tetra-tert-butylzirconocene dichloride ( 6 ) , and 1,1',2,2'-tetra-tert-butyluranocene dichloride ( 7 ) . the bent metallocene structures of 5-7 have been confirmed by x-ray crystallography , and illustrate that the 1,2-di-tert-butylcyclopentadienyl ligands are arranged with all four tert-butyl groups in the open part of the wedge between the two canted cyclopentadienyl rings , but that steric interactions between the substituents afford a conformationally dictated C2 symmetry for the molecules . In solution compounds <nUm> and <nUm> exhibit NMR spectra consistent with a facile dynamic process involving exchange between tert-butyl sites that are inequivalent in the solid state . the nature of this site exchange is discussed , and comparisons are made with related metallocene dichlorides of group <nUm> metals . 
the synthesis of inflate derivatives of titanocene and zirconocene from the corresponding dimethyl complexes and triflic acid ( HOTf ) is described . comproportionation of Cp2M(OTf)2 with Cp2MX2 gives Cp2M(OTf)X ( m = Ti , x = Cl , F , me ; m = Zr , x = Cl , me , BH4 ) . Cp2TiMe(OTf) reacts with ROH ( r = me , Me3Si or Me2tBuSi ) to give Cp2TiOR(OTf) . Cp2TiMe(OTf) and Cp2TiOSiMe3(OTf) react with H2O to give the oxo-bridged dimer (Cp2TiOTf)2(m-O) . the triflate in Cp2TiX(OTf) ( x = Cl , F , me , OSiMe3 ) is substituted by -OSiMe3 to give compounds Cp2TiX(OSiMe3) . Cp2Ti(OMe)OR ( r = me , SiMe3 ) could not be obtained . 
the title complex <nUm> = [{O(Me2SiC9H6)2}ZrCl2] ( C9H6Si = 2-silylated indenyl group ) has been prepared in a way slightly different from that published recently by rausch and coworkers ( J. organomet . chem. , <nUm> ( 1995 ) <nUm> ) . In contrast to the earlier report , the 1H NMR spectra of <nUm> in C6D6 and CD2Cl2 reflect clearly the presence of both rac-2 and meso-2 ( ca. <nUm> : <nUm> ) . from toluene , <nUm> crystallizes as a racemic mixture ; rac-2 : monoclinic ; space group P21 / c , a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> pm ; β = <nUm> ° ; R1 = <nUm> ( wR2 = <nUm> ) . the high - resolution 1H NMR spectrum of rac-2 does not match with the crystal structure : most probably , rapid ( on the NMR time scale ) racemization takes place down to at least <nUm> ° C . 
the methylzirconocene cation [ cp <nUm> CHZr <nUm> ( THF ) + BPh <nUm> - ] reacts with cp <nUm> Zr(Cl)(C ≡ C-R ) reagents ( 5a-c , r = -CH <nUm> Ph,-CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> ,-CH <nUm> ) to yield the dinuclear metallocene cations [ ( cp <nUm> Zr ) <nUm> (m-Cl)(m-e <nUm> : η <nUm> -RCCCH <nUm> ] + ( 6a-c ) ( with BPh <nUm> - anion ) that contain a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom . complex 6b was characterized by x-ray diffraction . the activation energy of the degenerate rearrangement of 6c was determined by temperature dependent dynamic <nUm> H NMR spectroscopy ( DG ‡ ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol - <nUm> ). 
2,2'-Bis[(4,7-dimethyl-inden-1-yl)methyl]-1,1'-binaphthyl and [2,2'-bis[(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroinden-1-yl)methyl]-1,1'-binaphthyl]titanium and -zirconium dichlorides have been synthesized from 2,2'-bis(bromomethyl)-1,1'-binaphthylene . 2,2'-Bis(bromomethyl)-1,1'-binaphthylene was alkylated with the lithium salt of 4,7-dimethylindene to yield 2,2'-bis[1-(4,7-dimethyl-indenylmethyl)]-1,1'-binaphthylene (S)-(-)-9 . the lithium salt of <nUm> was metalated with either titanium trichloride followed by oxidation or zirconium tetrachloride to give titanocene dichloride (S)-(+)-10 and zirconocene dichloride <nUm> . the known complexes ansa-[2,2'-bis[(1-indenyl)methyl]-1,1'-binaphthyl]titanium and -zirconium dichlorides were formed and hydrogenated to ansa-[2,2'-bis[(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroinden-1-yl)methyl]-1,1'-binaphthyl]titanium and -zirconium dichlorides <nUm> and <nUm> or to ansa-[2,2'-bis[(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroinden-1-yl)methyl]-5,5',6,6',7,7',8,8'-octahydro-1,1'-binaphthyl]titanium dichloride <nUm> whose solid state structure was determined by x-ray crystallography . complex <nUm> adopts a C1 - symmetrical conformation in the solid state , but is conformationally mobile in solution , exhibiting C2 - symmetry in its room temperature NMR spectra . 
the complex Cp2ZrMe(C6H4C ≡ CSiMe3 ) ( 4 ) has been synthesized by reaction of Cp2ZrMeCl and C7H4Li ≡ CSiMe3 ( generated in situ from reaction of nBuLi with BrC7H4 ≡ CSiMe3 at <nUm> ° C ) . thermolysis of <nUm> in THF afforded an unsaturated , organometallic polymer [ Cp2Zr(C6H3C = CSiMe3)]n ( 7 ) in ca. <nUm> % yield ( mw / Mn = <nUm> / <nUm> ) . polymer <nUm> was investigated as a synthon for other unsaturated polymers . it reacts with hydrochloric acid to form a new phenylene-1,1-vinylene polymer [ -C( = CHSiMe3)-1,4-C6H4-]n ( 8 ) , and with sulfur dichloride to give poly(1-trimethylsilyl-2-benzo[b]thiophene) ( 9 ) . thermolysis of two similar compounds , Cp2ZrMe(C6H4C ≡ C2H3 ) ( 5 ) and Cp2ZrMe(C6H4C6H4C ≡ CSiMe3 ) ( 6 ) , did not give polymers . 
the use of ' cation - like ' metallocene combination catalysts ( Cp'2MCl2-2BuLi-B(C6F5)3 ; cp' = e5-cyclopentadienyl , or substituted e5-cyclopentadienyl ; m = Ti , Zr , Hf , U ) for dehydropolymerization of silanes significantly improves the polymer molecular weight . for example , under the same conditions a Cp(C5Me5)ZrCl2-2BuLi catalyst gives Mn = <nUm> , while a Cp(C5Me5)ZrCl2-2BuLi-B(C6F5)3 gives Mn = <nUm> . the influence of various factors ( steric and electronic effects of the cyclopentadienyl ligands , the nature of the metal , temperature , solvent , concentration and structure of silane ) on the build-up of polysilane chains are systematically analyzed . 
attempts at polymerizing methacrylate using metallocenes are reported . polymerization is successful using ferrocene in a ketone solution , but not in benzene or without a solvent . ketones are effective in the order : methyl ethyl ketone < cyclohexanone < cycloheptanone . carbon tetrachloride has an accelerative effect on the polymerization in benzene and methyl ethyl ketone solutions , but no effect in cyclohexanone solution . some binary systems , which consist of ferrocene and higher valence compounds such as cobalt trisacetylacetonate , are effective redox initiators . cobaltocene polymerizes methyl methacrylate in the presence of carbon tetrachloride ; zirconocene dichloride induces polymerization of methyl methacrylate in a cyclohexanone solution ; whereas neither nickelocene nor titanocene dichloride are effective . styrene and acrylonitrile were not polymerized by the metallocenes examined . 
six kinds of heterogeneous catalysts were prepared by supporting iPr(Flu)(Cp)ZrCl2 ( 1 ) and Cp2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) on Al2O3 , Cl2Mg and O2Si , and propene polymerization was conducted with these supported catalysts using a common alkylaluminium , AlC3H9 , as cocatalyst . the <nUm> Al2O3 and <nUm> Cl2Mg catalysts gave highly syndiotactic polypropylene whereas the <nUm> Al2O3 and <nUm> Cl2Mg catalysts gave atactic polypropylene in fairly good yields . In contrast , the O2Si - supported catalysts were found to be inactive for propene polymerization . 
A full , two - level factorial experimental design with temperature and concentrations of zirconocene dichloride and methylaluminoxane as variables was employed to study the polymerization of ethylene . rate of polymerization and molecular weight data were used to develop a kinetic model and estimate the kinetic parameters . the polymerization rate was continuously recorded from a semi-batch reactor and molecular weights were measured at the end of each experimental run . the analysis of the data suggests the presence of two kinds of active species . one kind of species is produced from the other via a pseudo-first-order reaction . 
non-bridged zirconocene complexes activated with methylalumoxane can polymerize monoalkenes to high polymers with very high activity . the main control of molecular weight in these systems is due to b-H transfer from the growing chain , the effect becoming very remarkable in the case of substituted ethylene monomers and with increasing temperature . this work is mainly devoted to test the real capacity of the subject catalyst to produce structurally controlled oligomers from ethylene or ethylene / a-olefin mixtures in good yield by investigating the influence of different reaction parameters . on the basis of the relevant results obtained , conditions were identified favouring the cooligomerization of ethylene with propylene and higher a-olefins versus the formation of high molecular weight macromolecules . the role of reaction conditions ( catalyst , cocatalysts , temperature , pressure , structure of comonomer and presence of hydrogen ) on products structure and yield is discussed with reference to previously proposed chain propagation and chain transfer mechanisms . 
the ab initio method at the hartree - fock level has been used on two zirconocene systems , the unbridged Cp2ZrCH+ <nUm> and the bridged (Si(CH3)2)Cp2ZrCH+ <nUm> compounds . for each complex the insertion of an ethylene molecule has been followed from reactant to product through the corresponding transition states . the calculated activation energies are of the order of magnitude of those obtained experimentally , explaining the higher activity found for the unbridged catalytic complex compared to the bridged . the geometries are in agreement with other studies and comparable with those derived by crystallographic methods . the a-agostic interaction observed in the reactants as well as in the transition states and resulting products confirms that the brookhart - green mechanism is followed for the polymerization reaction .

the zirconocene p-complex of 3-methyl-1,2-butadiene(1,1-dimethylallene) can not be prepared by simple ligand substitution due to rapid coupling of the initally formed complex with the unreacted allene . this problem was circumvented by generating the allene complex by b-hydrogen elimination from a pre-formed sigma complex . this appears to be a potentially general way to prepare allene complexes of zirconocene if the allene precursor has no cis-vinyl hydrogen . this method has been successfully used to prepare zirconocene complexes of 3-methyl-1,2-cycloheptadiene , 3-methyl-1,2-cyclohexadiene and 4-phenyl-1,2,3-cyclohexatriene . attempts to prepare a complex of 3-methyl-1,2-cyclopentadiene failed . selected reactions of two of these cumulene complexes and their coupling products are reported .

A novel C (i) symmetric zirconocene dichloride CpCp'ZrCl2 ( cp = CH , cp ' = 1-neomenthyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl ) was prepared which gave better enantioselectivity , is cheaper to make , catalytically more active , and recoverable . 
pyridine-pendent siloxane polymers containing a backbone modified with a zirconocene moiety were synthesized through the hydrolysis-condensation reaction of the mixed precursor solutions of the b-trimethoxysilylethyl-2-pyridine sol in liquor medium and the zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) dissolved in tetrahydrofurane . this polymer , in terms of the polyzirconocenesiloxane-2-pyridine ( PZSP ) , was then evaluated for use as thin coating films ( thickness , <nUm> - <nUm> mm ) , which provides excellent protection of aluminum ( Al ) alloys against ClNa - caused corrosion . the PZSP films deposited by simple dip - withdrawing coating methods to Al displayed the impedance of > <nUm> Ω cm2 after exposure for <nUm> days in <nUm> N ClNa solution at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> h salt - spray resistance . 
A new synthesis of homochiral vinyl phosphonates starting from 1-alkynes is described. , the title compounds were obtained in good yields by the reaction of chiral 2-chloro-1,3,2-oxa2aphospholidin-2-one ( 1 ) with the “ ate ” - complexes of vinyl alanes. , the latter were prepared by zirconocene dichloride catalyzed hydroalumination of 1-alkynes with diisobutyl aluminum hydride ( DIBAH ) . 
this communication deals with a brief description of a synthetic procedure and structural characterization of a new class of coordination compounds of titanium and zirconium with sulphur - containing organic moieties derived by the condensation of heterocyclic ketones and thiosemicarbazide . on the basis of various physicochemical and spectral studies , viz. , UV , IR , 1H and 13C NMR , a trigonal bipyramidal and octahedral geometries have been suggested for Cp2M(Tscz)Cl and Cp2M(Tscz)2 ( where m = Ti(IV) or Zr(IV) and TsczH = ligand molecule ) type of compounds , respectively . finally , attempts have been made to establish a correlation between biological activity and the structures of the resulting products on the basis of different constituents and chemical phenomenon . 
plasma desorption mass spectra of a zirconocene and two ferrocenyl phenyl plumbanes have been obtained in both positive- and negative - ion modes with a linear time - of - flight instrument . for molecular weight determination of the ferrocenes the positive - ion mass spectra exhibit radical molecular ions with high abundance . the zirconocene compound shows no molecular ion at all , but shows a [ m cl]+ ion . the positive - ion mass spectra in particular provide detailed structural information . In the case of the ferrocenes the negative - ion mass spectra show fragment ions which give information complementary to the positive mode . samples have been prepared by the electro9spray technique , by spin - deposition on nitrocellulose as support and on 3-(3-pyridyl)acrylic acid as matrix . In addition , the potential of a reflecting time - of - flight instrument with a higher mass resolution for the molecular ion and lead isotope region of the ferrocenes has been demonstrated . the isotopic pattern of the m{radical dot}+ ion and pb+ ion obtained in the reflector mode for an electrosprayed and nitrocellulose spin - deposited sample was compared with the theoretically calculated pattern . an excellent correlation was found for the nitrocellulose deposition technique . 
the carbonyl silanimine complex Cp2Zr(e2-Me2SiNtBu)(CO) ( 2 ) has been prepared by ligand substitution on the phosphine derivative , Cp2Zr(e2-Me2SiNtBu) ( PMe3 ) ( 1 ) and by generation of the alkyl derivative Cp2Zr(CH2SiMe3) ( NtBuSiMe2H ) under a carbon monoxide atmosphere . most aspects of the spectroscopic properties and structural parameters are consistent with the formulation of <nUm> as a zirconium ( IV ) metallacycle , containing a NSiZr three - membered ring and a linear , terminal carbonyl ligand . however , the carbonyl stretching frequency for <nUm> is observed at <nUm> cm-1 in the infrared , much lower than expected for a zirconium ( IV ) complex , and indeed , lower than any other zirconocene carbonyl . ZINDO molecular orbital calculations indicate that the origin of this anomalously low stretching band is donation of electron density into the CO p* orbital directly from an orbital on the adjacent silicon center , i.e. s-p* back - bonding . consistent with this picture , the formally non-bonding Si / 3.C distance in <nUm> ( <nUm> Å ) is much longer than a typical single bond ( ca <nUm> Å ) , but in the range observed for delocalized organic p-ligands bonded to silicon . although the bond between the silicon and carbonyl ligand is not fully formed in the ground state of <nUm> , thermolysis in the presence of PMe3 yields the five - membered metallacycle cyclo-Cp2Zr[OC(PMe3)SiMe2NtBu] ( 3 ) , resulting from CO insertion into the SiZr bond and formation of a cyclic silaacyl , followed by attack of phosphine at the electrophilic acyl carbon . 
cyclopolymerization of nonconjugated dienes provides a route to a number of stereochemically complex poly(methylene-1,3-cycloalkanes) . the stereochemistry of these polymers derives from both tacticity and cis / trans stereochemistry of the carbocyclic rings . A unique feature of isotactic polymers with a predominance of trans rings is that they contain no mirror elements of symmetry and are thus chiral by virtue of their main - chain stereochemistry . the enantioselective cyclopolymerization of 1,5-hexadiene in the presence of optically active precursors such as (-)-(R)-ethylene-bis(tetrahydroindenyl) zirconium (R)-binaphtholate ( [a]435 = <nUm> ° ) and a methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) co-catalyst yields optically active poly(methylene-1,3-cyclopentane) ( PMCP ) with a molar optical rotation [Ph]28405 of + <nUm> ° ( c = <nUm> , CCl3H ) . since the enantioface selectivity of the chiral zirconocene catalyst with propene is known , the absolute stereochemistry of the polymer can be tentatively assigned if an analogous enantioface selectivity with 1,5-hexadiene is assumed . the enantioselective cyclopolymerization of symmetrical dienes requires both a high enantioface selectivity for olefin insertion and a high diastereoselectivity for olefin cyclization in order to obtain a chiral macromolecular architecture . 
metallocene sulfides [Cp2M(m-S)]2 ( I , m zr4+ ; II , m hf4+ and cp = cyclopentadienyl ) have been synthesized . I and II show charge transfer absorption in the visible region . FT - raman , raman and IR spectra of these compounds are reported for the first time . the MS stretching bands have been assigned with the help of a pre-resonance effect . the approximate normal coordinate analysis of the coordination skeleton ( d2h symmetry ) aids the detailed assignment in the low frequency spectral region . force constants of MCp and MS stretching imply that the bond order of HfL is higher than that of ZrL . 
metallocenes in combination with methylalumoxane as cocatalyst form extremely active catalysts for olefin polymerization and have become a research topic of growing interest in recent years . meanwhile a great number of symmetric and chiral zirconocenes have been synthesized to give totally different structures of isotactic , syndiotactic , stereoblock , or isoblock polymers . the isotactic sequence length of polypropylene is influenced by the nature of the ligands of the metallocenes . it has become possible to polymerize cyclic olefins like cyclopentene , norbornene , or dimethanooctahydronaphthalene with different chiral zirconocenes without any ring opening reaction . the crystalline polycycloalkenes show extremely high melting points which are between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C . copolymers of cyclo-alkenes with ethene are amorphous and transparent with a glass transition temperature between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C and they can be used as materials for optical discs and fibers . 
the nature and distribution of radioactive species resulting from ( ng ) neutron - capture reactions in the metal atoms of zirconocene dichloride and molybdocene dichloride were investigated . retention values of <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> % were obtained for zr-95 , zr-97 and mo-99 respectively . b-Transformation in 95Zr-zirconocene dichloride and 99Mo-molybdocene dichloride led to approximately <nUm> % of the respective daughters nb-95 and tc-99m being retained at the same molecular form as the parent . 
A series of (e5-C5H4R)2ZrCl2 ( r = H , me , et , iPr , tBu , SiMe3 , Me2Ph , ) complexes have been used in combination with ethylalumoxane to copolymerise ethene with a-olefins ( C5C14 ) under constant conditions ( P = 9-12 bar ; T = 50-80 ° C ) . activity decreased substantially for olefin > C8 . variations of the 1-hexene concentration ( (CpEt)2ZrCl2 as catalyst ) revealed rate enhancement at a 1-hexene / ethylene ratio of <nUm> . copolymer incorporation was low ( < <nUm> % ) as detected by melting points and 13C NMR spectroscopy . A statistically designed approach ( <nUm> factorial ) was used to investigate the influence of P,T and [1-hexene] on copolymer formation with (CpR)2ZrCl2 ( r = H , tBu ) . complex interaction between the variables was detected but the results ( r = tBu ) were dominated by [1-hexene] . 
the microstructure in terms of molecular mass distribution ( MMD ) and chemical comonomer distribution ( CCD ) of linear low density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) is greatly influenced by the catalytic system and process conditions . furthermore , the 1-olefin insertion in the polymer chain can be distinguished between intramolecular and intermolecular distribution . to investigate the intermolecular CCD and the MMD , four LLDPEs ( ethylene-1-butene copolymers ) from different catalytic systems based on Ti Cl2Mg catalysts , a zirconocene complex and a vanadium compound , are studied . the microstructure of the whole polymers and of their fractions are examined by size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , and 13C NMR analysis . further information about CCD is also obtained by DSC analysis on the whole samples by applying a particular thermal treatment , named thermal fractionated crystallization ( TFC ) , based on isothermal crystallization of the polymers from the melt at fixed temperatures . the results obtained with the different analytical techniques show that the examined polymers have a very distinct microstructure depending on the catalyst type . 
binuclear zirconocene cartons are observed by 1H - NMR in C6D6 solutions containing BC18F15 and an excess of a zirconocene dimethyl complex . the CH3 - bridged cation [((C5H5)2ZrCH3)2(m-CH3)]+ , solvent- separated from the anion H3C-B(C6F5)3 / - , is present in equilibrium with C12H16Zr and the mononuclear ion pair [ ( C11H13Zr / +***H3C-B(C6F5)3 / - ] ; in more concentrated solutions , a binuclear ion pair [ ((C5H5)2ZrCH3)2(m-CH3)+***H3C- BC18F15 / - ] is the dominant species . similar equilibria are observed in C6,D6 solutions containing BC18F15 and C18H26Zr , C14H20SiZr or rac-(CH3)2Si(indenyl)2Zr(CH3)2 . complexes with sterically more demanding ligands , such as C22H36Zr or rac-(CH3)2Si(2-methyl benz[e]indenyl)2Zr(CH3)2 do not form any binuclear species under these conditions . In the catalyst system rac- (CH3)2Si(indenyl)2Zr(CH3)2 / Bu3NH+B(C6F5)4 / - , activities for the polymerization of propene increase with excess of the dimethyl zirconocene complex . this effect is due in part to a sacrifice of some dimethyl zirconocene for the removal of impurities from the catalyst system and in part to a stabilization of the catalyst in the form of the binuclear cation [((CH3)2Si(indenyl)2ZrCH3)2(m-CH3)]+ . the latter appears to act , in the presence of propene , as a source of the mononuclear cation [(CH3)2Si(indenyl)2ZrCH3(C3H6)]+ , rather than as a polymerization catalyst by itself . 
upon irradiation of a C2 - symmetric rac - isomer of an ansa - zirconocene dichloride , an interconversion into the C ( s ) - symmetric meso-form is observed until a photostationary state between the two diastereomers is reached . the final rac / meso-proportion and the interconversion rate depend on the structure of the different metallocenes . results of a-olefin polymerization catalyzed by [ Me2Si(2-Me-4,6-(i)Pr2 Ind)2]ZrCl2 rac and meso , respectively , and methylalumoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst are reported . In propene polymerization the rac - diastereomer shows the higher activity whereas in pentene , hexene , and octene polymerization the meso-isomer is significantly more active . for all polymers a lower molecular weight is found using the meso-diastereomer as catalyst . 
A review of recent advances in early transition metal metallacycle - mediated coupling of C . C p-bonds is presented . discussion is focused on bond - forming processes stemming from a sequence of metal- . π complex formation followed by carbometalation of a second p-system and spans developments in intra- and intermolecular chemistry . the purpose of this review is to provide the reader with a glimpse of the growing power that this mode of chemical reactivity has in organic synthesis and , as such , contains relevant examples showcasing the utility of the reactions presented to address challenging problems in chemical synthesis , including applications in the context of acyclic stereocontrol , fatty acid , carbocycle , and heterocycle synthesis . overall , the reader is expected to gain an appreciation of the present scope and limitations of early transition metal metallacycle - mediated bond construction in organic synthesis . 
hydrozirconation of alkenes and alkynes gave functionalized alkanes and stereodefined functionalized alkenes under mild conditions in high yields . for this purpose , commercially provided or in situ generated cp <nUm> ClHZr ( schwartz reagent ) is frequently used . the bulky zirconocene moiety is the critical factor for this big success . it leads to the high regioselectivity during hydrozirconation , and it also contributes to good functional group tolerance by sheltering the reactive point . the alkyl and alkenylzirconium complexes subsequently react with electrophiles to form various CC(X) or CC(X) bonds . to obtain higher or diverse reactivity , transmetalation can be employed to produce widespread synthetic applications . 
A large number of caryophyllene - type sesquiterpenoids have been isolated from nature . many of them show a wide range of biological and pharmacological activities . recently , as highly oxygenated caryophyllene - type sesquiterpenoids , pestalotiopsin A and structurally related natural products such as pestalotiopsin B and C and taedolidol have been isolated from pestalotiopsis sp . these natural products are characterized by their highly distorted bi- to pentacyclic structures , all including a gem-dimethylated cyclobutane ring as one constituent . recently , the first asymmetric total synthesis of both enantiomers of pestalotiopsin A was completed by the authors and coworkers , thereby clarifying the previously unknown absolute stereochemistry of this natural product . these total syntheses were achieved by the following notable synthetic concepts : ( 1 ) chiral auxiliary - based symmetric synthesis of the functionalized cyclobutane derivatives through the lewis acid - catalyzed [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition between dimethyl ketene diethyl ketal and propiolamide equipped with the oppolzer 's camphorsultam and ( 2 ) an intramolecular Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi cross-coupling mediated by a Cr (II) / catalytic Ni (II) system for high - yielding nine - membered ring formation . In this chapter , the authors also summarize their synthetic approaches toward pestalotiopsin A and related caryophyllene - type sesquiterpenoids , reported so far by procter and coworkers and paquette and coworkers . the procter group has utilized the I2Sm - mediated reductive 4-exo-trig cyclization for the efficient construction of the polysubstituted cyclobutane moiety . the paquette group has demonstrated the effectiveness of the zirconocene - mediated ring contraction strategy for access to the enantiomerically pure multiply functionalized cyclobutane moiety . the highlights of their synthetic endeavors aimed at the total synthesis of pestalotiopsin A are discussed in this chapter . 
the UV / visible absorption spectra of rac-Et(Ind)2ZrC12 , rac-Et(Ind)2ZrMeC1 , rac-Et(Ind)2Zr(Me)2 , and the [rac-Et(Ind)2ZrMe-C2H4]+ complex , have been simulated by using the TDDFT technique within the adiabatic approximation and by using several basis sets and XC functionals . hybrid XC functionals ( B3LYP , B3P86 and mPW1PW91 ) turn out to reproduce fairly well the essential features of the experimental spectra which originate from ligand to metal charge transfer transitions . the comparison between the simulated and recorded UV / visible absorption spectra appears therefore as a promising technique for assigning the structure of reaction intermediates in zirconocene polymerization . 
P = N-P = S linkages placed in some layers within dendritic architectures allow the grafting of several types of functional groups at site and depth specific places in the internal layers of phosphorus containing dendrimers . these functional groups are either organic derivatives ( allyl , propargyl , isothiocyanate , amine , aldehyde , azide , crown - ether ) or metallic derivatives ( gold chloride , anionic zwitterionic zirconocene ) . furthermore , the dendrimeric architecture is flexible enough to allow the growing of new dendrimers inside the internal voids of the initial dendrimer .

this paper describes ethylene polymerization using four kinds of zirconocene with different substitutionary groups in cp ring as catalysts and aluminoxane as cocatalyst . their polymerization activities and me of resultant polyethylene were compared . it was found basically that in tp = <nUm> ° C and Al / Zr = <nUm> , polymerization activities were of the following order : A2 > B2 > A1 > B1 [ A1 : ( CH2 double bond CH-CH2-CH2-Cp)2ZrCl2 ; B1 : ( CH2 double bond CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-Cp)2ZrCl2 ; A2 : { CH2 double bond C(CH3)-CH2-Cp}2ZrCl2 ; B2 : { CH3(CH3)-C double bond CH-CH2-Cp}2ZrCl2 ] . polymerization activities were affected greatly by polymerization conditions . the influences of catalyst concentrations on polymerization activities were discussed . the possible effect mechanism of different substitutionary groups in cp ring on polymerization activities was investigated . 
propylene polymerization and propylene / 1-octene copolymerization were studied using rac-Me2SiInd2ZrCl2(1) / MAO or rac-Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 / ( MAO + TIBA ) as catalyst ( methyl aluminoxane , MAO ; AliBu3 , TIBA ) . the structure distribution of the polymers was characterized by temperature gradient extraction fractionation or precipitation fractionation , as well as by DSC analysis of the thermal segregated samples . by comparing the structure distribution of polypropylene and propylene-1-octene copolymer synthesized by <nUm> / MAO and <nUm> / ( MAO + TIBA ) , it is found that adding TIBA in the catalyst system increase the blockiness of the polymer chain , especially in the copolymerization system . it is assumed that , when iso-butyl is incorporated in the aluminoxane , ion pair of the active center and the aluminoxane counter ion may exist in different states that show different catalytic behaviors , resulting in the formation of polymers with block structure . 
A novel carrier of ultradispersed diamond black powder ( UDDBP ) was used to support metallocene catalyst . Al2O3 was also used as carrier in order to compare with UDDBP . supported catalysts for ethylene polymerization were synthesized by two different reaction methods . one way was direct immobilization of the metallocene on the support , the other was adsorption of MAO onto the support followed by addition of the metallocene . four supported catalysts Cp2ZrCl2 / UDDBP , Cp2ZrCl2 / Al2O3 , Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO / UDDBP and Cp2ZrCl2 / Al2O3 / MAO were obtained . the content of the zirconium in the supported catalyst was determined by UV spectroscopy . the activity of the ethylene polymerization catalyzed by supported catalyst was investigated . the influence of Al / Zr molar ratio and polymerization temperature on the activity was discussed . the polymerization rate was also observed . 
qualitative investigations of the mechanisms of photochemical decomposition of diphenylpermethyltitanocene and zirconocene have been made . reductive elimination as well as homolytic cleavage of metal-carbon 0-bonds are the two major pathways for photodecomposition of the diphenylpermethylmetallocenes . when benzene-d6 was used as the solvent for photolysis of diphenylpermethyltitanocene , biphenyl-d0 and biphenyl-d5 were found in a ratio of <nUm> / <nUm> , indicating that reductive elimination was the much more favorable process . but in the case of diphenylpermethylzirconocene , biphenyl-d0 and biphenyl-d5 were found in a ratio of <nUm> / <nUm> , indicating that the homolytic photocleavage of the 0-bonds was predominant . In the presence of carbon monoxide , moderately large amount of the dicarbonylpermethylmetallocenes were found , suggesting that the permethylmetallocenes were the intermediates . the discovery of pentamethylcyclopentadiene and 2,3,4,5-tetramethylfulvene in the recovered solvent indicated further photodecomposition of permethylmetallocene . consequently another intermediate , [(C5Me4CH2)M] , is proposed . an oligomeric material was found to be the major metal containing product after the photolyses . 
the reaction of dimethylzirconocene with 2R,3R-diethyltartrate proceeds with evolution of two equivalents of methane and yields the chiral diethyltartratozirconocene dimer <nUm> . the analogous reaction between Cp2Zr(CH3)2 and 2S,3S-diethyltartrate furnishes ent-2 in almost quantitative yield . complex <nUm> contains a dimetallatricyclic framework ( tetraoxadizirconatricyclo[5.3.0.02,6]decane ) in solution as well as in the solid state . complex <nUm> was characterized by x-ray diffraction . it crystallizes in space group P21 with cell parameters a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> and rw = <nUm> . In solution the tartratozirconocene dimer <nUm> undergoes an intramolecular automerization reaction ( DG ‡ intra ( <nUm> K ) ≈ <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ) which probably proceeds via a ten - membered metallacyclic intermediate or transition state . A cross-over experiment between the enantiomeric complexes <nUm> and ent-2 showed the activation barrier for intermolecular exchange of mononuclear dioxazirconacyclopentane units Cp2ZrOCH(E)CH(E)O ( ECO2C2H5 ) leading to equilibration with the isomeric dinuclear tartratozirconocene complex meso-2 to be at DG ‡ inter ( <nUm> K ) ≈ <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 . complex meso-2 shows NMR spectra compatible with a static ten - membered dimetallamonocyclic ring structure . the reaction of dimethylzirconocene with meso-dimethyltartrate yields the (meso-dimethyltartrato)zirconocene dimer <nUm> ( two isomers , 4a and 4b in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio , both of which possess dynamic dimetallatricyclic structures in solution ( DG ‡ intra ( <nUm> K ) ≈ <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( 4a ) ; DG ‡ intra ( <nUm> K ) ≈ <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( 4b ) ; DG ‡ inter ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( 4a--4b ) . crystallization from methylene chloride gives single crystals of the isomeric (meso-dimethyltartrato)zirconocene dimer 5a which contains a monocyclic ten - membered ring structure . complex 5a crystallizes in space group P21 / c with cell parameters a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° ; z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> and rw = <nUm> . 
the amino-functionalized metallocene (C5H4CH(Me)NMe2)2ZrCl <nUm> , [(CpN)2ZrCl2] was synthesized by salt metathesis of Cl4Zr and <nUm> equiv. of C5H4CH(Me)NMe2Li . the metallocene was obtained in good yield as a mixture of rac and meso diastereomers as established by NMR spectroscopy . the addition of <nUm> equiv. of n-BuLi to the metallocene (CpN)2ZrCl2 produced a co-catalyst system which was active , at a <nUm> mol % loading , in the dehydropolymerization of PhSiH3 to poly(phenylsilane) , P2Si . the P2Si was obtained as a <nUm> : <nUm> linear - cyclic mixture ( mw = <nUm> , Mn = <nUm> ) as established by GPC analysis ; 29Si{1H} NMR spectroscopy revealed an atactic polymer microstructure . 
the synthesis and characterization of an edge - bridged half - open zirconocene , Zr(C5H5)(dmch)(PMe3)2 ( dmch = dimethylcyclohexadienyl ) , are described . As expected , the Zr-C bond distances for the dmch ligand are significantly shorter than those for the CH ligand . the compound readily incorporates <nUm> equiv. of alkyne , with loss of the PMe3 ligands , leading to a zirconacyclopentadiene complex , so that the dmch ligand has remained intact . 
the highly electrophilic borane BC18F15 reacts with n-octadecanol ( n-C18H37OH ) and n-octadecanethiol ( n-C18H37SH ) to form equilibrium mixtures of reactants and the <nUm> : <nUm> adducts (n-C18H37EH)B(C6F5)3 ( e = O , S ) ; equilibrium constants for adduct formation are determined . the adducts are deprotonated by 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene ( proton sponge ) to form the salts [C10H6(NMe2)2H][(n-C 18H37O)B(C6F5)3 ] and [C10H6(NMe2)2H][(n-C 18H37S)B(C6F5)3 ] , respectively , and by Cp2ZrMe2 to give methane and , apparently , the unstable zirconium complexes [Cp2ZrMe][(n-C18H37E)B(C6F 5)3 ] . the alcohol , alkoxide , thiol and thiolate systems are characterized in solution by 1H , 19F , 13C(1H) and 11B NMR spectroscopy and in the solid state by FAB mass spectrometry , and it is also shown that proton sponge can coordinate in monodentate fashion to BC18F15 . 
sixteen asymmetric dinuclear ansa zirconocene complexes bearing cyclopentadienyl , indenyl or fluorenyl ligands and their ligand precursors have been synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy . after activation with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , the complexes behave like dual site catalysts and produce polyethylenes with bimodal or broad molecular weight distributions in homogeneous and heterogeneous media . 
A boron - bridged amido-cyclopentadienyl ligand was recently shown to form constrained - geometry titanium - complexes that are capable of olefin polymerisation . here , the synthesis of the corresponding amido-indenyl ligand e1-C9H7B(NiPr2)N(H) ph ( C9H7 = indenyl ) ( 2a / 2v ) and its allyl-vinyl isomerisation are discussed . deprotonated 2a reacts with Cl4Zr to give the strongly distorted zirconocene - type complex [ zr{e <nUm> : e1-C9H6B(NiPr 2)NPh}2 ] ( 3 ) in a <nUm> : <nUm> reaction . all compounds have been characterised by multinuclear NMR methods and structures of both the ligand 2a and the complex <nUm> have been confirmed by x-ray diffraction . 
the new terminal zirconocene - organophosphanido complexes [Cp2Zr(Cl){P(H)Dmp}] ( 1 ) and [Cp2Zr{P(H)Dmp}2] ( 2 ) ( dmp = 2,6-Mes2C6H3 ) bearing the sterically demanding ligand dmp have been prepared and structurally characterized . A flattened pyramidal geometry for the phosphorus atom of <nUm> and a shortened Zr-P bond length of <nUm> Å provide evidence for moderate Zr-P p-bonding . compound <nUm> , however , displays both pyramidal and planar phosphorus atoms . the corresponding Zr-P bond lengths of <nUm> and <nUm> Å , in conjunction with the phosphorus geometries , indicate that one phosphanido ligand is engaged in substantial p-bonding to the zirconium center while minimal , if any , of such interactions are present for the other phosphanido ligand . the solid state structures and 31P NMR spectra for <nUm> and <nUm> are very different than previously reported [Cp2Zr(Cl){P(H)Mes*}] and [Cp2Zr{P(H)Mes*}2] ( mes* = 2,4,6-(t)Bu3C6H2 ) which carry the related sterically demanding group mes* . comparisons to other structurally characterized zirconocene(IV) and hafnocene(IV) complexes having terminal phosphanido ligands suggest that upon increasing the steric congestion at the phosphorus atoms greater π interactions with the metal centers are afforded if such steric interactions do not prevent achieving proper alignment of the PR2 group for optimal M-P p-bonding .

A zirconocene-ethylene complex reacted with propargylic ethers to give allene derivatives in good yields via b-alkoxide elimination . deuterolysis of the reaction mixture revealed that the final product after elimination still had a zirconium-carbon bond . coupling of styrene and propargylic ethers was mediated by Cp2ZrBu2 ( negishi reagent ) to give phenethyl allene derivatives . b-Alkoxide elimination from zirconacyclopentadienes bearing two a-CH2OMe groups was also observed . one CH2OMe group was easily eliminated . elimination of the second CH2OMe group was dependent on its structure .

the kinetics of calcite ( CCaO3 ) crystallization on calcite in the presence of titanocene , zirconocene , vanadocene , hafnocene dichlorides and ferricenium salts was investigated by the constant composition technique . the rates of crystal growth measured in the presence of metallocene complexes at concentrations <nUm> - <nUm> × 10-5 mol dm-3 were drastically reduced by 27-66 % , possibly through adsorption onto the active sites of crystal growth . kinetics analysis suggested a surface diffusion controlled spiral growth mechanism . 
gem-Difluoroolefins with a wide range of substituents are readily synthesized from commercially available 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl p-toluenesulfonate , via a pathway that comprises the following two processes : ( i ) a boron - mediated alkylation leading to gem-difluorovinylborane , and ( ii ) subsequent direct functionalizations via gem-difluorovinylcopper . this methodology provides a general one - pot synthesis of unsymmetrically disubstituted difluoroolefins by the introduction of difluorovinylidene unit as an ambiphile ( CF2C-+ ) . a-Nonsubstituted difluorovinylzirconocene and -zinc generated in situ from 2,2-difluorovinyl p-toluenesulfonate opens a complementary way to the synthesis of monosubstituted gem-difluoroolefins bearing unsaturated carbon substituents . these difluorovinylmetals ( B , Cu , Zr , Zn ) are all remarkably thermostable against b-elimination in spite of the absence of electron - withdrawing groups , and are therefore easy to handle and react readily . 
the reactions of the organic - soluble (trimethylsilyl)arylaminosilanetriol RSi(OH)3 ( r = (2,6-i-Pr2C6H3)NSiMe3 ) ( 1 ) with titanocene dichloride and zirconocene dichloride in dimethoxyethane as the solvent leads to the formation of acyclic and cyclic siloxanes [RSi(OH)2(OTiCp2CI)] ( 2 ) and [RSi(OH)(OZrCp2)O]2 ( 3 ) , respectively . the molecular structures of the new products <nUm> and <nUm> have been established by means of their analytical and spectral data . further , in each case the solid - state structure of the compounds has been determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction studies . the el mass spectral data reveal the presence of higher molecular weight compounds in the gas phase corresponding to the bicyclic or cubic structures of <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . 
A force field model for ansa - zirconocene complexes is constructed , which represents each C atom of the C5 - ring ligands as being bonded directly to the metal center , rather than by way of the C5 - ring centroids . this e5- model , which describes coordination geometries by mutual repulsions of the C5 - ring and halide ligands , has no adjustable equilibrium or force - constant parameters for any of the angles at the Zr center . nevertheless , vibrational frequencies and structural parameters are reproduced for a series of simple and Me2Si - bridged zirconocene dihalide complexes with an accuracy comparable to that of the more complex centroid model . strong steric distortions , revealed by crystal structure determinations in a series of tert-butyl- substituted ansa - zirconocene dibromide and diiodide complexes , are likewise reproduced with remarkable accuracy by the e5-force field model . 
A series of <nUm> metallacyclic zirconocene complexes has been synthesized by the reaction of o-phenyl-substituted zirconocene dichloride complexes with two equivalents of n-butyllithium via CH bond - activation reactions on the phenyl ring . after activation with methyl aluminoxane , these metallacycles are up to five times more active ethylene polymerization catalysts than the original metallocene dichloride complexes similarly activated .

upon thermolysis in aromatic hydrocarbon solvents diarylzirconocenes undergo successive replacement of their s-bonded ligands by aryl groups from the solvent . analysis of the product mixture by photochemical degradation to biphenyls reveals that intermediate aryne zirconocene complexes are formed which then react with the solvent with CH bond fission and formation of new CZr bonds .

the formation of an adduct between a dihydrogen and a d0 species of the general type (C5R5)2Zr(R')2 ( R,R' H or CH3 ) is suggested to involve a process analogous to that in CO adduct formation , and is studied by an extended huckel molecular orbital analysis . back donation into s* H orbitals arises from high - lying MR' bonding orbitals and determines the stability of alternative adduct geometries . two isomeric H adducts can interconvert by an intramolecular hydrogen shift . with D2 , this reaction sequence leads to hydrogen isotope exchange . the transition state of this reaction mode contains a three - centre ( H ⋯ H ⋯ H)- ligand configuration with bonding properties similar to those of an allyl ligand ; it does not involve an oxidative change in the charge on the metal nor generation of a positively charged , protonic hydrogen species by heterolytic H cleavage . the term ' direct hydrogen transfer ' is proposed for this type of elementary reaction . for H - induced alkane elimination from group IV metallocene alkyl derivatives , an analogous reaction mechanism , involving formation of a H adduct and a subsequent intramolecular hydrogen shift toward the alkyl ligand , is predicted to proceed with moderate activation energies .

the volatile products resulting from the solid - state thermal decomposition of the dimethylmetallocenes Cp2M(CH3)2 ( m = Ti , Zr , Hf ) have been characterized by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry . analogous studies utilizing Cp2Ti(CD3)2 have provided evidence for the various degradative pathways involved in these thermolysis processes . 
hydrogenolysis of ( M(CH3)2 ) ( m = Zr , Hf ) bonds gives new racemic and optically active substituted zirconocene and hafnocene dihydrides A : (RCp)2MH2 ( m = Zr , Hf ; r = me , Me2CH , Me3C , PhCH2 ) and B : (R*Cp)2MH2 ( m = Zr , Hf ; R* = MeCHEtCH2 , PhCHEtCH2 ) , R*CpCpHfH2 R* = PhCHCH3 ) . substitution of hydridic hydrogens by halogens , mobile hydrogen compounds , addition with unsaturated derivatives are studied . the A and B type complexes are good catalysts in hydrogenation of alkenes ; the B type complexes give only poor asymmetric induction in catalytic reduction of prochiral alkenes .

the rate of hydrogenolytic alkane liberation from permethylzirconocene neopentyl halide compounds , (C5(CH3)5)2Zr(X)CH2C(CH3)3 , x = F , Cl , Br ) , is greatly reduced if the ring ligands are interconnected by an ethylene bridge , as in C2H4(C5(CH3)4)2Zr(X)CH2C(CH3)3 . hydrogenolysis of the corresponding permethylzirconocene neopentyl hydride compounds ( x = H ) , on the other hand , is too fast for kinetic measurements at room temperature , even with the ethylene-bridged derivative . these observations , and the inverse kinetic isotope effect observed for reaction with D2 , are interpreted with the assumption that H - induced alkane liberation from permethylzirconocene alkyl halides proceeds via an indirect ring - mediated hydrogen transfer reaction which is feasible only with freely rotating ring ligands ; hydrogenolysis of permethylzirconocene alkyl hydrides , on the other hand , apparently occurs without such limitation , by direct H - to - alkyl hydrogen transfer . 
derivatisation of racemic ethylene-bridged bis(4,5,6,7tetrahydro-1-indenyl)-titanium and -zirconium dichlorides with o-acetyl-r-mandelic acid affords diastereomers which can be separately crystallised . crystal and molecular structures of these diastereomers reveal different chelate ring conformations in the crystalline state . the separated diastereomers have been converted , via their dimethyl derivatives , into the corresponding titanocene and zirconocene dichloride enantiomers , the optical purity of these enantiomers has been demonstrated by their reconversion into the acetyl-r-mandelate derivatives . 
diphenylmetallocene complexs (RCp)2ZrPh2 ( 4a , 4b : RH , CH3 ) react with the phosphorous ylide Ph3PCHCH3 ( 5 ) at <nUm> ° C to yield six - membered metallocyclic ylides (RCp)2ZrCH2CHP(Ph)2(C6H4) ( 8a,8b ) plus two equivalents of benzene . the reaction presumably proceeds through a thermally generated ( e2-benzyne ) zirconocene intermediate which takes up <nUm> to form a metallocene ylide (RCp)2Zr(Ph)C(CH3)PPh3 ( 6 ) . b-Hydride elimination and readdition followed by ortho-metallation then leads to the six - membered metallacycle . complexes <nUm> have a stable chiral ground state geometry as judged by NMR spectroscopy . the presence of a distorted Cp2Zr ( phospha - allyl ) moiety is suggested to explain theobserved characteristic spectroscopic features of the metallacyclic ylides <nUm> .

A possible mechanism for the formation of bis(butadiyne) complex of Ni ( 8 ) is also presented . correlation diagrams constructed for the conversion of the radialene type structure to that of the bis(butadiyne) complex show that it is allowed for both Ti and Ni .

the ansa - metallocene complexes C <nUm> H <nUm> )(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> R)ZrC l <nUm> [ r = me ( 4 ) , t-Bu ( 5 ) ] were prepared by the reaction of the corresponding ligands with n-BuLi and MCl <nUm> *2THF , respectively . the molecular structures of <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined by the x-ray diffraction method . complexes 2-5 in combination with MAO were studied as catalysts for ethylene polymerization and all the germyl-bridged zirconocene catalysts show high activities at relative high temperatures . this indicates that the germyl-bridged zirconocene systems show thermally stable catalyst systems for polymerization of ethylene . 
the synthesis and x-ray characterization of ansa - metallocene dichloride titanium and zirconium complexes of the type [Me2Si(e5-C5H2(SiMe3)2)2]MCl2 ( m = Zr ( 1 ) Ti ( 2 ) ) are reported . the complexes have been tested for ethylene polymerization . 
novel metallacyclic zirconocene complexes were prepared by reacting o-alkenyl substituted zirconocene dichloride complexes with two equivalents of n-butyllithium . the factor determining the reaction course and the structure of the respective metallacycle formed is the chain length of the alkenyl group . after activation with methylaluminoxane the metallocene dichloride complexes and the derived metallacyclic derivatives are excellently suited for ethylene polymerization . 
reactions of the lithium salts of 3-substituted indenes <nUm> , <nUm> with ZrCl4(THF)2 gave two series of nonbridged bis (1-substituted)indenyl zircogone dichloride complexes . fractional recrystallization from THF- petroleum ether furnished the pure racemic and mesomeric isomers of [ ( e5-C9H6-1-C(R1)(R1 = R2 = CH3 , n = <nUm> , rac-1a and meso-1b : R1 = CH3 , R2 = C2H5 ; n = <nUm> or O , rac-2a and meso-2b ) , respectively , complex 1a was further characterized by x-ray diffraction to have a C2 symmetrically racemic structure , where the six - member rings of the indenyl parts are oriented laterally and two o-CH3O-C6H4-C(CH3)2-substituents are oriented to the open of the metallocene ( ind : bis-laterral , anti ; substituent : bis-centra , syn ) . the four zirconocene complexes are highly symmetrical in solution as characterized by room temperature 1H - NMR , however 1H-1H NOESY of meso-1b shows that some of the NOE interactions arise from the two separated indenyl parts of the same molecule , which can only be explained well by taking into account the torsion isomers in solution . 
2,2'-bis-(indene-2-yl)-biphenyl-Zirconium dichloride ( biph[2-Ind]2ZrCl2 ) supported on silica and in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) cocatalyst was studied by FT - raman spectroscopy . even though the transition metal was present at a concentration down to <nUm> wt. % , useful FT - raman spectra were obtained . the aim of this work was to correlate spectral features to such typical catalyst properties like Al / Zr ratio and catalytic yield ( CY ) . the raman spectra contain signals due to the co-catalyst and the catalyst . catalyst signals due to Zr-Cl , Zr - CH3 and Zr - other ligand ( e.g. cp or Biph-2-Indene ) bonds as well as ligand specific signals were identified using literature data , model compounds and ab - initio quantum chemical calculations of the vibrational spectra . an excellent correlation was found between the intensity ratio of the peaks at <nUm> and <nUm> cm-1 and the Al / Zr ratio . A fairly linear correlation was found between the signal intensity due to M-CH3 bonds and the catalytic yield ( kg PE per mmole Zr ) for a series of samples of different Al / Zr ratios and different catalytic yields . 
In response to a recent paper concerning the formation of a putative arene complex , ° C , we present data showing that this reaction leads in fact to a mixture of [(Cp2*ZrMe)2(m-Me)][B(C6F5)4] and [ Cp2*ZrMe ⋯ BC24F20 ] , while NMR signals attributed to e-arene coordination of triphenylethane are due to unreacted CPh3+ ( cp* = e-C5Me5 ) .

cyclization of 1,3,6-heptatrienes <nUm> with cp <nUm> ZrBu <nUm> ( negishi reagent ) furnished a mixture of trans- and cis-zirconacyclopentanes that after hydrolysis afforded a mixture of isomeric dimethylcyclopentenes <nUm> and <nUm> in ca. <nUm> : <nUm> ratio . an attempt to isomerize the mixture of zirconacyclopentanes by stirring the reaction for <nUm> h resulted , after hydrolysis , in rather surprising formation of cis- dimethylcyclopentenes <nUm> with high selectivity . this is the first example of trans to cis isomerization of zirconacyclopentanes . further reaction of the intermediate zirconacyclopentanes with various electrophiles and a plausible reaction mechanism of the trans to cis isomerization are presented .

group <nUm> metallocene mono- and bis-s-alkynyl complexes of the type L <nUm> M(s-C ≡ CR ) and L <nUm> M(s-C ≡ CR ) <nUm> with m = titanium and zirconium in the oxidation states + <nUm> and + <nUm> and L = cp ( η <nUm> -cyclopentadienyl ) and cp* ( η <nUm> -pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ) are important compounds for stoichiometric and catalytic C-C single bond coupling and cleavage reactions . detailed investigations show five - membered metallacyclocumulenes L <nUm> m(e <nUm> -1,2,3,4-RC <nUm> r ) as the key intermediates in both reactions of a C-C single bond cleavage of different 1,4-substituted 1,3-butadiynes RC ≡ C-C ≡ CR to alkynyl groups and the opposite reaction of C-C single bond formation starting from alkynyl groups under the formation of 1,4-substituted 1,3-butadiynes . depending on different metals m and ligands L , coupling or cleavage is favoured . combination of both reactions offered the first C-C single bond metathesis in homogeneous solution , which is photocatalyzed and titanocene - mediated . it proceeds via titanocene-mono-alkynyl complexes , which are interesting species also for other stoichiometric and catalytic C-C coupling reactions . some similarities regarding the σ - to - π conversion exist between the coupling of the alkynyl groups at titano- and zirconocenes to complexed 1,3-butadiynes on one side and the coupling of phenyl groups at chromium to complexed diphenyl on the other side . 
by the reaction of silyl anions with group <nUm> metallocene dichlorides , a number of new group <nUm> oligosilyl compounds have been synthesized . the silyl residues employed include the popular tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl group and sterically more encumbered derivatives . for the cases of the tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl group both the mono and the disilylated products were obtained . 
the synthesis and polymerization behavior of four new asymmetric ansa -metallocenes containing a 2,7-disubstituted fluorenyl moiety and an indenyl moiety is reported . three of the four catalysts , dichloro[e5-1-indenyl(1-methylethylidene)-[2,7-bis- (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-e5-9-fluorenyl]zirconium ( 11 ) , dichloro[e5-1-indenyl(1-methylethylidene)-[2,7-bis- (2,6-dimethylphenyl)-e5-9-fluorenyl]zirconium ( 12 ) , and dichloro[e5-1-indenyl(1-methylethylidene)-[2,7-bis- (2-methylphenyl)-e5-9-fluorenyl ] zirconium ( 13 ) were highly active for the polymerization of both ethylene and propylene when activated with excess methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . dichloro[e5-1-indenyl(1-methylethylidene)- [2,7-dibenzyl-e5-9-fluorenyl]zirconium ( 14 ) was poorly active for the polymerization of ethylene and was therefore not evaluated as a propylene catalyst . the activities for propylene polymerizations with catalysts 11-13 increased as the size of the substituents around the ligand framework increased , following the trend <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> . molecular weights of the polypropylenes decreased as the temperature was increased . the molecular weight data follows the same trend ( <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> ) as the activity data , wherein the largest substituents gave rise to the highest molecular weights .

the reaction of Cl4Zr with four equivalents of the 6,6-dimethylcyclohexadienyl anion ( 6,6-dmch- ) in the presence of PMe3 leads to the <nUm> electron zr(6,6-dmch) 2(PMe3)2 . this complex was found to undergo a coupling reaction with two equivalents of PhCH = NPh , such that the couplings involved the two termini of the same dienyl ligand , yielding a formal zr(e5-dienyl)(e3-allyl) (p-amide)2 complex . both metal complexes have been structurally characterized . 
using 1H- and 13C - NMR spectroscopies , cationic intermediates formed by activation of L2ZrCl2 with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) in toluene were monitored at Al / Zr ratios from <nUm> to <nUm> ( L2 are various cyclopentadienyl ( cp ) , indenyl ( ind ) and fluorenyl ( flu ) ligands ) . the following catalysts were studied : (Cp-R)2ZrCl2 ( r = me , 1,2-Me2 , 1,2,3-Me3 , 1,2,4-Me3 , me4 , me5 , n-Bu , t-Bu ) , rac-ethanediyl(Ind)2ZrCl <nUm> , rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 , rac-Me2Si(1-Ind-2-Me)2ZrCl2 , rac-ethanediyl(1-Ind-4,5,6,7-H4)2ZrCl2 , (Ind-2-Me)2ZrCl2 , Me2C(Cp)(Flu)ZrCl <nUm> , Me2C(Cp-3-Me)(Flu)ZrCl2 and Me2Si(Flu)2ZrCl2 . correlations between spectroscopic and ethene polymerization data for catalysts ( Cp-R ) 2ZrCl2 / MAO ( r = H , me , 1,2-Me2 , 1,2,3-Me3 , 1,2,4-Me3 , me4 , me5 , n-Bu , t-Bu ) and rac-Me2Si(Ind)2 Cl2Zr were established . the catalysts (Cp-R)2 Cl2Zr / AlMe3 / CPh3+ B(C6F5)4- ( r = me , 1,2-Me2 , 1,2,3-Me3 , 1,2,4-Me3 , me4 , n-Bu , t-Bu ) were also studied for comparison of spectroscopic and polymerization data with MAO - based systems . complexes of type (Cp-R)2ZrMe+-Me -- Al ≡ MAO ( IV ) with different [Me-MAO]- counteranions have been identified in the (Cp-R)2ZrCl2 / MAO ( r = n-Bu , t-Bu ) systems at low Al / Zr ratios ( 50-200 ) . At Al / Zr ratios of 500-1000 , the complex [L2Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2] +[Me-MAO]- ( III ) dominates in all MAO - based reaction systems studied . ethene polymerization activity strongly depends on the Al / Zr ratio ( Al / Zr = 200-1000 ) for the systems (Cp-R)2 Cl2Zr / MAO ( r = H , me , n-Bu , t-Bu ) , while it is virtually constant in the same range of Al / Zr ratios for the catalytic systems (Cp-R)2ZrCl2 / MAO ( r = 1,2-Me2 , 1,2,3-Me3 , 1,2,4-Me3 , me4 ) and rac-Me 2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO . the data obtained are interpreted on assumption that complex III is the main precursor of the active centers of polymerization in MAO - based systems . 
zirconocene dichloride complexes with substituents containing aliphatic end groups at the aromatic ligands react with two equivalents of n-butyllithium to give metallacyclic zirconocene complexes via aliphatic CH - activation reactions . As well as o-alkenyl substituted zirconocene dichloride complexes with terminal aliphatic groups as zirconocene dichloride complexes with purely aliphatic substituents are suitable for the synthesis of such metallacycles . In combination with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , these metallacycles are excellent catalysts for ethylene polymerization . their activities can be three and a half times higher than the activities of the corresponding zirconocene dichloride educts . the catalyst <nUm> / MAO is able to produce <nUm> kg PE g-1 Zr h ( <nUm> ° C , pentane solution , <nUm> bar ethylene pressure ) . 
the reactions of Cp2ZrX2 ( x = Cl , Br , or I ) with AlH4Li or AlH3 in the presence of catalytic amounts of transition metal compounds afford the ZrIII-Al hydride complexes [(Cp2Zr)2(m-H)](m-H) 2AlX2 ( 1 ) . complexes <nUm> were isolated as crystal solvates with either benzene or benzene and 1,4-dioxane of compositions [(Cp2Zr)2H](H)2AlCl2 *C6H6 ( 2 ) , [(Cp2Zr)2H] (H)2AlBr2*C6H6 ( 3 ) , [(Cp2Zr)2H](H)2AlBr2* C4H8O2*C6H6 ( 4 ) , and [(Cp2Zr)2H](H)2AlI2 *2C6H6 ( 5 ) and their structures were studied by x-ray diffraction analysis . molecules <nUm> contain the six - membered AlH3Zr2 ring as the central fragment , in which the metal atoms are linked by hydride bridges . the bonding models for <nUm> are considered and the reasons for stability of <nUm> are discussed . 
zirconocene and bisphosphine nickel chemistry developed in our labs and directed towards the derivatization and synthesis of polycyclic aromatic carbon compounds is reviewed . complexes with the formula Cp2ZrMe(e1-PAC) ( PAC = anionic polycyclic aromatic carbon ligand ) eliminate methane to produce zirconacycles and yne complexes . treatment of the zirconacycles with L2NiX2 ( L = phosphine , x = Cl , Br ) in the presence of alkynes results in metallacycle transfer to nickel and cycloaddition of the alkyne . the resulting polycyclic aromatic carbon compounds contain an additional ring . the nickelacycles may also be accessed by oxidative addition of ni(0) to polycyclic aromatic dihalides followed by reduction . the application of this chemistry to the step - growth synthesis of single - walled carbon nanotubes is proposed . 
the synthesis , characterization and catalytic activity of zirconium complexes containing bulky pentaarylcyclopentadienyl ligands are reported . the monocyclopentadienyl 12-electron complex , trichloropentaphenylcyclopentadienylzirconium(IV) , C <nUm> ph <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( I ) , has an unusual monomeric structure in the solid state and has short Zr - ligand distances suggesting that the complex has significant lewis acidity . the phenyl rings adopt a propeller arrangement in the solid state ; VT <nUm> H - NMR measurements of the analogous trichloro(tetraphenyl- m -tolylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium(IV) ( II ) indicate that there is rapid rotational motion of the phenyl rings . the lewis acidity of this complex is manifested in its ability to catalyze the [4+2] cycloadditions of acrolein and methyl acrylate to cyclopentadiene . the sandwich complex , C <nUm> ph <nUm> CpZrCl <nUm> ( III ) , has more typical Zr - ligand distances , but has a more parallel arrangement of the two cyclopentadienyl rings and does not display the reactivity shown by I and II . 
density - functional theory has been used to study the first few steps of ethene polymerization with the single - site catalyst Cp2ZrCH3 + ( biscyclopentadienyl methyl zirconium cation ) . insertion of the first monomer yields a g-agostic product Cp2ZrC3H7 + which can transform into a more stable b-agostic conformation with an activation barrier of <nUm> kJ mol-1 . the interaction of the b-agostic structure with a second monomer leads to chain termination ( front - side attack ) or insertion ( back - side attack ) with barriers of about 35-40 kJ mol-1 . A more likely step appears to be insertion directly into the g-agostic Cp2ZrC3H7 + , to form the g-agostic product Cp2ZiC5H11 + with a barrier of only <nUm> kJ mol-1 . 
the reactions of 2-indanone or 3,4-diphenylcyclopent-2-enone with pyrrolidine and N,N'-dimethylethylenediamine respectively lead to the corresponding 2-aminoindenes and 1-amino-3,4-diphenylcyclopentadienes , whose lithium salts can be reacted with Cl4Zr to generate the corresponding moisture - sensitive aminozirconocene dichlorides . the x-ray crystal structure of di-(2-N-pyrrolidine-e5-indenyl)zirconium dichloride was determined , in which the zirconocene exists exclusively as a racemic - mixture , whereas the meso-rotamer is not present . the ( indenyl ) carbon-nitrogen bond lengths range from <nUm> to <nUm> pm , which is indicative of considerable multiple bond character .

In each of these compounds the HC ≡ C building block is e2-coordinated to a C3CoO3 fragment . treatment of complexes 3a , 4b , <nUm> or <nUm> with ClH ( aq ) produces [Zr]Cl2 ( 1 ) and 2a or 2b [ reaction of <nUm> or <nUm> with ClH ( aq ) ] or [Zr]Cl2 ( 1 ) and [ e2-HO(CH2)2C ≡ CH]Co2(CO)6 ( 12a ) or ( e2-HOCMe2C ≡ CH)Co2(CO)6 ( 12b ) [ reaction of <nUm> or <nUm> with ClH ( aq ) ] . the solid state structures of compounds [Zr](Cl)[O(CH2)2C ≡ CH ] ( 3a ) , (Cl)[Zr](m-OCH2C ≡ CCH2O)[Zr](Cl) ( 5 ) and [Zr]{[e2-OCMe2C ≡ CH]Co2(CO)6}2 ( 11b ) are reported . 3a crystallizes in the rhombic space group pnma with cell constants a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> pm , V = <nUm> × <nUm> pm3 and z = <nUm> . crystals of <nUm> and 11b are monoclinic . compound <nUm> : space group pc with a = <nUm> , b - <nUm> , c - <nUm> pm , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> × <nUm> pm3 and z = <nUm> . compound 11b : space group P21 / n with a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> pm , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> × <nUm> pm3 and z = <nUm> . 
A convenient new one - pot synthesis makes accessible CH2 - and CHR - bridged ligand precursors of the general formula C13H9-n,R'nCHRC5H5 ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ; r = H , alkyl ; R' = H , alkyl , hal ) . from these the syndiospecific zirconocene catalysts (C13H8-nR'nCHR-C5H4)ZrCl2 ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ; r = H , me ; R' = H , Br ) for the polymerization of propylene can be prepared . 
bis(propynyl)zirconocene ( 6a ) reacts with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane to yield the carbon-carbon coupled Cp2M( m-RC4R)B(C6F5)3 betaine product 4a ( m = Zr , r = CH3 ) . A variety of differently substituted analogs was prepared ( m = Zr , r = n-butyl , phenyl , cyclohexyl ; m = Ti , r = CH3 ; m = Hf ; r = CH3 , phenyl , SiMe3 ) . these complexes <nUm> are chiral due to the presence of a rather stable propeller - like R-B(aryl)3 conformation . the activation barrier of the intramolecular enantiomerization process of many examples of this series of complexes was determined by dynamic 1H NMR spectroscopy , with DG ‡ values ranging from ca. <nUm> to <nUm> kcalmol-1 , depending on the substitution pattern . complex 4a reacts with 2,6-dimethylphenylisocyanide to yield the methylenecyclopropene derivative <nUm> that was characterized by x-ray diffraction . 
the coupling of enantiomerically enriched 2,2'-dilithio-1,1'-binaphthyl with various annulated cyclopentenones or 2-indanone proves to be a facile route for the preparation of a series of annulated bis(cyclopentadienes) or bis(indenes) bridged at a symmetrical cyclopentadienyl position . the six-or seven - membered annulated bis(tetrahydroindene) <nUm> or bis(hexahydroazulene) <nUm> ligands could readily be converted to titanium or zirconium dichloride complexes . owing to the symmetry of the ligands , only a single C2 - symmetrical isomer of the metallocene dichloride could form . although the faces of the cyclopentadienyl moieties are homotopic , the chiral bridge enforces a chiral conformation of the metallocene complexes . the bis(indenyl) <nUm> or five - membered annulated bis(tetrahydropentalene) <nUm> ligands could not be metalated . unbridged 2-methyl and 2-phenyl substituted tetrahydropentalenes <nUm> and <nUm> were prepared and could readily be converted to titanium dichloride complexes . 
A series of polyelement substituted cyclopentadienyl and indenyl boranes and arsanes containing Me3Si- , Me3Sn-was synthesised ; (C5H4SiMe3)BX2 ( <nUm> , x = Cl ; <nUm> , x = Br ) and (C9H6SiMe3)BX2 ( <nUm> , x = Cl ; <nUm> , x = Br ) were obtained by Si / B exchange reaction in a low yield when x = Cl and in a moderate yield when x = Br , whereas Flu(SiMe3)2 does not react with BBr3 at all . PhB(C5H4SiMe3)2 ( 6 ) and PhB[C5H3(SiMe3)2]2 ( 7 ) were synthesised using appropriate thallium cyclopentadienides in high yields , <nUm> % and <nUm> % respectively . more bulky indenyl derivatives TrsB(C9H7)2 ( <nUm> , trs = (Me3Si)3C- ) , PhB(C9H6SiMe3)2 ( 9 ) , Ph2B(C9H6SiMe3) ( 10 ) were prepared by metathesis reactions of lithium indenides with boron halides in high yields . A subsequent transmetallation of C9H6(SnMe3)2 with PhBCl2 followed by addition of Cl4Zr gave (e-5-C9H6SnMe2Cl)2ZrCl2 ( 11 ) in the form of one of two possible diastereomers in high yield . C9H6(SiMe3)SnMe3 reacts with BCl3 to give the appropriate bis-indenyl derivative , that was easily converted to the ansa - zirconocene complex [MeB(e5-C9H6)2]ZrCl2 ( 12 ) . the sterically demanding bis-indenyl ligand <nUm> underwent direct deprotonation by t-BuLi , affording [TrsB(e5-C9H6)2]ZrCl2 ( 13 ) by in situ reaction with Me3SnCl and Cl4Zr . indenylarsanes AsC27H21 ( 14 ) , t-BuAs(C9H7)2 ( 15 ) , C9H7AsMe2 ( 16 ) and (C9H6SiMe3)AsMe2 ( 17 ) were synthesised by reactions of lithium indenides with asenic halides in good to excellent yields . all these compounds were characterized by analytical and spectroscopic data ( NMR , MS ) . <nUm> and <nUm> exist as complex isomeric mixtures with the arsenic atom in the allylic position of the indenyl ring ; the crystal structure of a meso form of <nUm> was determined by x-ray diffraction methods . <nUm> consists of two isomers with a vinylic ( 17a ) and an allylic ( 17b ) Me3Si substituent . stannylation of <nUm> by Me3SnNEt2 led exclusively to the diallylic derivative (C9H6AsMe2)SnMe3 ( 18 ) in quantitative yield . the latter was readily converted to a polymeric , half - sandwich indenyl zirconocene [e5-(C9H6AsMe2)ZrCl3]n ( 19 ) in high yield . further reaction of <nUm> with cp * Li resulted in the formation of a new arsano substituted bent metallocene complex [e5-(C9H6AsMe2)-e5-(C5Me5)]ZrCl2 ( 20 ) in good yield . 
ansa - zirconocenes , me <nUm> X(Cp)(3-TolInd)ZrCl <nUm> [ x = C ( 7 ) , Si ( 8 ) ; cp = η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> ; tol = p-C <nUm> H <nUm> CH <nUm> ] and me <nUm> Si(Cp)(2-TolInd)ZrCl <nUm> ( 9 ) , have been prepared by the reactions of ClZr <nUm> with the corresponding dilithiated ligands in diethyl ether at - <nUm> ° C . the molecular structure of complex <nUm> has been determined by a single crystal x-ray diffraction study . propylene polymerization has been studied for complexes <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . complex <nUm> reveals the highest catalytic activity of <nUm> kg PP / ( mol zrh atm ) and the highest molecular weight of <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> among the three catalysts . complex <nUm> produces atactic polypropylene ( PP ) , whereas <nUm> and <nUm> afford PP with a weak syndiotacticity at low temperature . 
the reaction of ClZr <nUm> with 2equiv . of MeLi to form me <nUm> ClZr <nUm> followed by in situ metalation of me <nUm> ClZr <nUm> with the corresponding ansa - ligands , produces the respective ansa-dimethylzirconocene complexes , o-Xyl(Ind) <nUm> ZrMe <nUm> [ 1b , ind = η <nUm> -1-indenyl , o-Xyl = C <nUm> H <nUm> ( CH <nUm> ) <nUm> <nUm> ] , 2-Bn(Ind) <nUm> ZrMe <nUm> [ 2b , 2-Bu = ( -CH <nUm> CH = CHCH <nUm> - ) ] , Et(Ind) <nUm> ZrMe <nUm> ( 3b ) , and me <nUm> Si(Ind) <nUm> ZrMe <nUm> ( 4b ) in high yields . treatment of 1b-3b with ClH affords ansa-dichlorozirconocene complexes , 1a-3a , in quantitative yields . synthesis of ansa-dimethylzirconocene via me <nUm> ClZr <nUm> is more efficient than that via cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( cp <nUm> = ansa - ligand ) in the conventional methods . 
zirconocene dichloride was reacted with either 2,6-di-tert-butyl-or 2,6-diisopropyl phenol to form bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl) zirconium(IV) monochloride complexes <nUm> and <nUm> respectively . A bisphenoxy derivative of Cp2ZrCl2 , <nUm> , was formed , when sterically less demanding 2,6-dimethyl phenol was utilized . the ability of the complexes <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> in ethylene polymerization with MAO as cocatalyst was examined . polymer analysis indicates that , regardless of which complex was used , only one kind of catalytically active metal center is formed and polymer properties resemble those obtained with the Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO system . the solid state structure of bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl) zirconium(IV) 2,6-di-tert-butyl-phenoxy monochloride ( 1 ) is reported . 
the five - coordinate zirconocene dichloride PhP(CH2CH 2-e5-C5H4)2ZrC12 ( 3 ) , containing a tethered bis(cyclopentadienyl)-phosphine ligand , was prepared by treating a tetrahydrofuran solution of ZrC14(thf)2 with Li2[PhP(CH2CH2C5H4)2] . an x-ray crystal structure analysis confirmed the phosphorus atom to be coordinated to the zirconium metal center . dissolution of <nUm> in wet methanol followed by evaporation of the solvent yielded the crystallographically characterized cationic chloroaqua complex [PhP(CH2CH2-e5-C5H4)2ZrC1(H2O)]+ as the chloride salt ( 4 ) . treatment of an aqueous solution of <nUm> with excess thiocyanate gave a good yield of the bis(isothiocyanato) complex PhP(CH2CH2-e5-C5H4)2Zr(NCS)2 ( 7 ) , the structure of which was confirmed by x-ray crystallography . 
the zirconocene diacetylide (e5-C5HMe4)2Zr(e 1-CCSiMe3)2 ( 1 ) is reduced by potassium in toluene to give the paramagnetic tweezer complex [ (e5-C5HMe4)2Zr(e 1-CCSiMe3)2]-K+ ( 2 ) . the presence of Zr (III) follows from the ESR spectrum of <nUm> ( g = <nUm> , aZr = <nUm> mT ) . the x-ray crystal structures show that the bite angle of tweezer arms of <nUm> ° in <nUm> is diminished to <nUm> ° in complex <nUm> . the potassium cation is embedded between the acetylide arms , <nUm> Å away from the bite angle plane , at the Zr-K distance of <nUm> Å . 
new dicyclopentadienyl iminoacyl zirconium complexes have been prepared and characterized by NMR spectroscopy . the reaction of [Zr{(SiMe2)2(e5-C5H3)2}Me2] with CNR ( r = 2,6-Me2C6H3 , t-Bu ) yields [Zr{(SiMe2)2(e5-C5H3)2}Me(e2-CMeNR)] ( r = 2,6-Me2C6H3 , t-Bu ) , which reacts with a stoichiometric amount of water to give the m-oxo dimers [Zr{(SiMe2)2(e5-C5H3)2}(e2-CMeNR)]2(m-O) ( r = 2,6-Me2C6H3 , t-Bu ) . the chloro neophyl complex [Zr{(SiMe2)2(e5-C5H3)2}Cl(CH2CMe2Ph)] and other b-hydrogen containing zirconium chloro alkyls [Zr{(SiMe2)2(e5-C5H3)2}CIR] ( r = et , n-Pr , i-Pr ) react with CN(2,6-Me2C6H3) to yield the related chloro iminoacyl complexes [Zr{(SiMe2)2(e5-C5H3)2}Cl{e2-CRN(2,6-Me2C6H3)}] ( r = et , n-Pr , i-Pr ) , whereas no reaction was observed when CN(t-Bu) was used . all the new iminoacyl complexes were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and the x-ray molecular structure of [Zr{(SiMe2)2(e5-C5H3)2}Cl{e2-C(i-Pr)N(2,6-Me2C6H3)}] was studied by diffraction methods to prove the expected ' inside ' coordination of the iminoacyl nitrogen atom . 
the synthesis and characterization of two new silicon-carbon bridged ansa - bis(fluorenyl) and ansa-bis(octahydrofluorenyl) zirconocene complexes , (Flu-CH2-SiMe2-Flu)ZrCl2 ( 3 ) and (FluH8-CH2-SiMe2-FluH8)ZrCl2 ( 4 ) is reported . complex <nUm> , in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , forms an active catalyst system for homogeneous polymerization of ethylene . the molecular structure of <nUm> reveals a large Centroid-Zr-Centroid angle ( <nUm> ° ) and an unusually small Cl-Zr-Cl angle ( <nUm> ° ) . the Zr-C bond distances range from <nUm> to <nUm> Å . 
the reaction of zirconocene dichloride , Cp2ZrCl2 , and bis(indenyl) metal dichloride , Ind2MCl2 ( m = Zr , Hf ) , with one and two equivalents , respectively , of indenyl or fluorenyl lithium leads to sterically crowded complexes with three or four potential p-ligands ( <nUm> : Cp2Zr(Ind)Cl ; <nUm> : Cp2Zr(Ind)2 ; <nUm> : Ind3ZrCl ; <nUm> : Ind3HfCl ; <nUm> : Ind2Zr(Flu)Cl ) . compound <nUm> was characterized by an x-ray structure analysis . 
A novel method for the preparation of heterogeneous metallocene catalysts is described that can be applied for the polymerization of olefins starting with homogeneous metallocene complexes . for this purpose zirconocene dichloride complexes have been prepared containing alkenyl or alkynyl substituents . these complexes can be activated with methyl alumoxane ( MAO ) and then are incorporated as comonomers into the formed polyolefin chain . the homogeneous metallocene catalysts become self - immobilizing under the reaction conditions and the further formation of the polyolefin is then catalyzed heterogeneously . 
bimetallic Zr-Re complexes with bridging C5H4PPh2 ligands ( henceforth abbreviated as cp' ) are accessible from the mononuclear zirconocene dichloride Cp'2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) and reactive rhenium complexes . the attempted synthesis of a cationic complex from <nUm> and [Re(CO)3(NCMe)3]BF4 resulted in the formation of the zirconium - free compound [ ReCl(CO)3(C10H10(PPh2) <nUm> ) ] ( 2 ) . <nUm> is apparently formed by cleavage of the Cp'-Zr bonds followed by intramolecular diels - alder addition . the compound was fully characterized including an x-ray crystal structure determination of the CDCl3 solvate ( triclinic , space group P1 ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> pm , b = <nUm> pm , c = <nUm> pm , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> × <nUm> pm3 , z = <nUm> ) . <nUm> and the highly reactive ' salt ' [Re(CO)5FBF3] give the mono-bridged ionic complex [Cp'Cl2Zr(m-Cp')Re(CO)5]BF4 ( 3 ) . the doubly cp' - bridged complex [Cp'2Cl2ZrReCl(CO)3] ( 4 ) may be obtained from <nUm> and either [Re(CO)5Cl] or , more cleanly , [Re2(m-Cl)2(CO)6(THF)2] . reaction of <nUm> with a stoichiometric amount of AlH4Li gives the bridging hydride complex [Cp'2ClZr(m-H)ReH(CO)3] ( 5 ) . from <nUm> and NaSMe the analogous methyl thiolate complex <nUm> was obtained in an NMR tube experiment . reduction of <nUm> using sodium amalgam produces the dark blue - green complex [Cp'2ClZr-Re(CO)3] ( 7 ) which contains a direct Zr-Re bond . addition of ClH across this polar metal - metal bond gives two isomeric hydrides [Cp'2Cl2ZrReH(CO)3] ( 8a , b ) in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio and with fac and mer coordination geometries around rhenium , respectively . 
zirconocene compounds having ether bonds at the substituent of cyclopentadienyl ligand , [ e5-C5H4(CH2) nOCH2CH2OCH2CH3 ] 2ZrCl2 ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) and [ e5-C5H4CH2CH 2OCH2CH3]2ZrCl2 , were prepared and tested for ethylene polymerization catalysts with methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst . the presence of oxygen atom close to the metal center drastically reduced the polymerization activity . it increased as the distance between zirconium and oxygen atom increased and showed a maximum when n was <nUm> . 
A series of titanocene and zirconocene dichlorides was synthesized bearing ligands that contain a ( chiral ) ether group linked by an ethylene spacer group to the cyclopentadienyl ring . surprisingly , the chiral zirconocenes (e5-C5H4CH2CH2OR)2ZrCl2 with r = isobornyl and menthyl do not show ziegler - natta activity . this is probably caused by attack of the cocatalyst (MeAlO)n on the side chains , causing immobilization of the catalyst . intramolecular coordination of the side chains is provoked by converting the dichlorides to the more lewis-acidic mono and bis triflate complexes . the coordination of the ether chain depends on the size of the terminal group in the chain . In the achiral derivative (e5-C5H4CH2CH2OMe)2Zr(O3SCF3)2 there is a rapid equilibrium between species with one and two intramolecularly - coordinated ether side chains . the monotriflate complex ( e5-C5H4CH2CH2Oisobor nyl)2ZrCl(O3SCF3) decomposes rapidly , because ether coordination results in facile C-O bond cleavage and liberation of camphene . accordingly , the bistriflate ( e5-C5H4CH2CH2Oisobor nyl)2Zr(O3SCF3)2 could not be synthesized . the chiral triflate complexes (e5-C5H4CH2CH2OR)2Zr(O3SCF3)2 with r = menthyl and fenchyl are active diels - alder catalysts , although no optical induction was observed , probably because the chiral ether handles are not sufficiently coordinated during catalysis . 
A series of zirconocene complexes of formula cp <nUm> ZrMe 2-n L n where cp = C <nUm> H - <nUm> , me = methyl , L = pyrazolyl , bis(N,N'-phenylformamidinato) , or substituted aryloxide and n = <nUm> , were synthesized by reaction of cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> and cp <nUm> ZrMe <nUm> with LiL or HL , respectively . the structures of cp <nUm> Zr(2,6-OC <nUm> H <nUm> me <nUm> ) <nUm> , cp <nUm> Zr(2,4,6-OC <nUm> H <nUm> me <nUm> ) <nUm> and cp <nUm> ZrMe{CH(NC <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> } were determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction . the complexes demonstrate appreciable activity for ethylene polymerization when used as cocatalysts with methylaluminoxane and dimethylanilinium tetrafluorophenylborate . 
the synthesis and characterization of three siloxy-substituted zirconocene complexes rac- and meso-ethylenebis[1-(tert-butyldimethylsiloxy)indenyl]zirconium dichlorides ( 3a,3b ) and rac-ethylenebis[1-(tert-butyldimethylsiloxy)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl]zirconium dichloride ( 4 ) are reported . the molecular structures of 3b and <nUm> have been determined and reveal that 3b crystallizes in a chiral staggered meso-conformation , whereas <nUm> adopts the expected C2 symmetric bent metallocene structure with indenyl-forward conformation of the ligand backbone . In both complexes 3b and <nUm> the intramolecular oxygen-chlorine distances ( <nUm> - <nUm> Å ) are close to the sum of their van der waals radii ( <nUm> Å ) . 
the synthesis and characterization of 1- and 2-triisopropylsiloxy substituted bis(indenyl) zirconocenes is reported . the molecular structures of rac-[ethylenebis(2-(triisopropylsiloxy)-1-indenyl)]zirconium dichloride ( 6 ) and rac-[ethylenebis(2-(triisopropylsiloxy)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)]zirconium dichloride ( 8 ) have been determined and reveal that complex ( 6 ) crystallizes in the indenyl-forward ( π ) conformation while ( 8 ) adopts the indenyl-backward ( Y ) conformation . 
an ansa - zirconocene complex having a vicinally di-tert-butyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand , me <nUm> Si(C <nUm> H <nUm> )(C <nUm> H <nUm> -3,4-t-Bu <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> ( 1 ) , has been synthesized and characterized by x-ray diffraction ( orthorhombic , space group : pbca , a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , V = <nUm> Å <nUm> , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , r w = <nUm> ) . complex <nUm> has a very much twisted structure due to its steric repulsion . In solution , however , the two tert-butyl groups are magnetically equivalent even at <nUm> ° C , indicating very fast oscillation of the bridged cyclopentadienyl unit with respect to the metal center . complex <nUm> and nonbridged zirconocene dichlorides with tert-butyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl ligands , ( C <nUm> H <nUm> -t-Bu ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( 2 ) , ( C <nUm> H <nUm> -1,2-t-Bu <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( 3 ) and ( C <nUm> H <nUm> -1,3-t-Bu <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( 4 ) , have been employed as methylaluminoxane (MAO)-activated catalysts for polymerization of 1-hexene under high pressure conditions ( 100-750 MPa = ca . 1000-7500 atm ) . comparison with some non and methyl-substituted metallocenes are also discussed . 
the ethylene-bridged pseudo-Cs symmetric ansa - zirconocene complexes , (1-fluorenyl-2-cyclopentadienylethane)zirconium dichloride ( 5a ) and (1-fluorenyl-2-tetramethylcyclopentadienylethane)zirconium dichloride ( 5b ) , were synthesized and their molecular structures have been determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction studies . the complex 5a is very active toward propylene polymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , affording polypropylene with good syndiotacticity . In comparison with the known syndiotactic polypropylene catalytic system iPr(fluorenyl)(cyclopentadienyl)ZrCl2 / MAO , 5a / MAO system is better in thermal stability , higher in activity and lower in syndiotacticity under the identical polymerization conditions . on the other hand , 5b / MAO system shows low activity and produces nearly atactic polypropylene with low molecular weight , which could be attributed to the increased electron density and steric bulkiness around the metal center . 
dehydrogenative coupling of phenylgermane catalyzed by cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> or Cp*CpZrCl <nUm> used in conjunction with n BuLi ( two equivalents ) gives partially network polyphenylgermanes of high molecular weights ( m w = <nUm> - <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> ) in moderate yields . resulting polyphenylgermanes are soluble in common solvents and a typical sample displays λ max at <nUm> nm in UV absorption and shows T d5 of <nUm> ° C in the thermogravimetric analysis . 
the implication of titanocene and zirconocene complexes in phosphinine chemistry is reviewed . two approaches to polyfunctional phosphinines using dimethyltitanocene as starting precursor have been developed so far . the first one involves the thermal rearrangement of 1-alkynyl-dihydrophosphetes . the second relies on the reactivity towards alkynes of 1,3,2-diazaphosphinines which are obtained by a metal transfer reaction from the corresponding diazatitanacycle . (2-Phosphininyl)-halogenozirconocene complexes , prepared by insertion of zirconocene into the carbon - halogen bond of 2-halogenophosphinines , have found interesting applications in the synthesis of a-functionalized compounds and 2,2'-biphosphinines upon reaction with electrophiles and nickel(0) complexes , respectively . another important development of their chemistry is provided by the synthesis of monomeric and dimeric phosphabenzyne-zirconocene complexes . preliminary investigations have shown that their reactivity closely mimics that of their carbon counterparts . various molecules such as polar alkynes , aldehydes , ketones , nitriles , phosphine sulfides , insert into the carbon-zirconium bond of these complexes to give a wide range of annelated metallacycles which can be subsequently transformed into functional phosphinines upon acidic hydrolysis . 
the dipropargylic derivatives of Si , Ge , P , 1a-c , react with the zirconocene entity ' Cp2Zr ' and give the intermediate bicyclocomplexes 2a-c characterized by 1H and 31P - NMR . the electrophilic addition of H+ , br2 leads to the corresponding exo dienic metallacyclopentanes <nUm> . the cyclozirconation reaction with hetero-diallylic compounds 5a-d gives the metallacyclopentanes 7-15 , after reaction with different electrophiles such as H+ , Cl3P , PhPCl2 , Ph2PCl or Ph2PCl(BH3) , br2 . the cyclozirconation reaction of diynes is stereoselective and leads to the E,E - exocyclic dienes whereas the selectivity of cyclozirconation of dienes depends on the substituents on the heteroatom . 
chiral silicon bridged yttrio- and lanthanidocene chlorides [ MeRSi(C <nUm> H <nUm> )(C <nUm> me <nUm> )LnCl ] <nUm> ( r = et ( a ) , ph ( b ) ; ln = Y ( 4a , b ) , La ( 5a , b ) , Sm ( 6a , b ) , Lu ( 7a , b ) ) and zirconocene dichlorides [ MeRSi(C <nUm> H <nUm> )(C <nUm> me <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> ] ( r = et ( 8a ) , ph ( 8b ) ) were synthesized . compounds 4-7 react with sodium acetate yielding the corresponding monomeric acetates [ MeRSi(C <nUm> H <nUm> )(C <nUm> me <nUm> )LnO <nUm> CMe ] ( r = et ( a ) , ph ( b ) ; ln = Y ( 9a , b ) , La ( 10a , b ) , Sm ( 11a , b ) , Lu ( 12a , b ) ) . all compounds were characterized by elemental analysis , <nUm> H and <nUm> C{ <nUm> H } - NMR spectroscopy , and by mass spectrometry . single crystal x-ray structure determinations show a dimer for 6a and a monomer for 8a . the zirconocenes 8a , b are active catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene and propylene in the presence of methylalumoxane ( MAO ) . 
the palladium - catalyzed coupling of 1,2-diiodobenzene with indenylzinc complexes obtained from indene , 4-methylindene , 4,7-dimethylindene and hydrindancene gave 1,2-bis(1-indenyl)benzenes in 29-45 % yield . new phenyl-bridged ansa - bis(indenyl)titanium and -zirconium dichlorides were obtained from these ligands in good yield either by addition of Cl3Ti or Cl4Zr to their lithium salts ( 61-92 % yield ) or by addition of Zr(NMe2)4 to the neutral ligands ( 59-67 % ) . In each case the zirconium tetraamide metalation gave very high dl-selectivity . the n-BuLi / Cl4Zr metalation of the phenyl-bridged unsubstituted indene gave a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio of dl- to meso- while placing substituents at the 4,7- and 5,6-positions led to <nUm> : <nUm> selectivity in favor of the dl-isomer . the n-BuLi / Cl3Ti metalation gave between <nUm> : <nUm> and <nUm> : <nUm> selectivity . the solid state structure of [1,2-bis(1-indenyl)benzene]dichlorozirconium ( dl-6a ) was obtained by x-ray analysis . 
methylzirconocene cation [Cp2ZrCH3+] ( 2 ) adds readily to (butadiene)zirconocene to yield the dimetallic cationic complex [ (Cp2Zr)(m-CH3)(m-butadiene)(ZrCp2) + ] ( 4 ) ( both cations with CH3B(C6F5)3- ( a ) or B(C6F5)4- ( b ) counteranion ) . the spectroscopic analysis indicates the presence of a C2 - symmetrical bridging mode of the transoid m-e2:e2 - conjugated diene ligand . treatment of 4a with Cp2Zr(CH3)Cl results in the formation of the m-chloro-bridged system [ (Cp2Zr)2(m-Cl)(m-C4H6) + ] ( 4d ) , that yields [ (Cp2Zr)2(m-CC-CH3)(m-C4H 6)+ ] ( 4e ) upon treatment with propynyl lithium . 
C2 - symmetric rac-ethylene-1,2-bis(e5-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)-zirconium dichloride (EBTHI)ZrCl2 ( rac-1 ) reacts with the lithium amides of 2,6-dimethylaniline , aniline and 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoroaniline to yield the corresponding rac-ethylene-1,2-bis(e5-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)-zirconium bis(monoarylamido) complexes (EBTHI)Zr(NHR)2 ( rac-3a-c ) . these new bisamides represent potential chiral versions of the known Cp2Zr(NHR)2 derivatives which are active hydroamination catalysts . 
C10F2H10Ti and C10F2H10Zr were found to be rapidly converted into catalytically - active species for the dehydrocoupling of silanes upon treatment with PhSiH3 or H2MeSiSiMeH2 . 
two kinds of fluorenyl containing zirconocene catalysts , supported on polymethylsiloxane micro gels and on silica , were prepared and applied for ethylene polymerizations using methylaluminoxane as cocatalyst . the observed activities were comparable with those of the corresponding silica supported catalysts . the average molecular weights of the obtained polymers differ from those of the corresponding homogeneous catalysts as from those of the silica supported systems . 
In order to further our study of the bis(2-methylbenz[e]indenyl)zirconium dichloride catalyst system , we have synthesized the analogous tetrahydro-2-methylbenz[e]indene ligand ( 4 ) . In the process of synthesizing <nUm> , we have found that the structural isomer tetrahydro-2-methylbenz[f]indene ( 5 ) is also formed . this has been confirmed by the synthesis of a series of dimethyl ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) , methyl-phenyl ( 8 ) , and titanium trichloride derivatives ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) of the parent indenes <nUm> and <nUm> . the new ligand systems <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were converted to the analogous unbridged zirconocene dichloride complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> . the precursors were then activated with either methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( trityl ) and used as catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene and propylene . all zirconocene complexes were highly active for the polymerization of ethylene , and in some cases produced crystalline polypropylene at lower polymerization temperatures . 
the polymethylene bridged dinuclear zirconocenes [ (CH2)n (C5H4)2][(C9H7)ZrCl 2]2 ( n = <nUm> ( 10 ) , <nUm> ( 11 ) , <nUm> ( 12 ) , <nUm> ( 13 ) ) have been synthesised by treating not only the respective disodium salts of the ligands with two equivalents of C9Cl3H7Zr in THF , but also the distannylated derivatives of the ligands with two equivalents of C9Cl3H7Zr in toluene . all complexes are characterised by 1H- and 13C - NMR and mass spectrometry and elemental analysis . it turned out that the values of dd = [dd-dp] , the chemical shift difference between the distal ( dd ) and proximal ( dp ) protons , for the produced dinuclear compounds ( <nUm> for <nUm> and <nUm> , and <nUm> for <nUm> and <nUm> ) were smaller than the dd values of the known polysiloxane bridged dinuclear compounds . the chemical shifts of the bridgehead carbons in these complexes are about <nUm> ppm shifted downfield with respect to the other two resonances at cyclopentadienyl ring ( <nUm> and <nUm> ppm , respectively ) . In order to investigate the catalytic properties of the dinuclear complexes and mononuclear metallocenes , ethylene polymerisation has been conducted in the presence of MMAO . the most important feature is that the polymethylene bridged dinuclear metallocenes represent enormously improved activities compared with the activities from the corresponding mononuclear metallocene as well as the polysiloxane bridged dinuclear zirconocenes . In addition , the influence of both the nature and length of the bridging ligand upon the reactivities of the dinuclear metallocenes has also been observed . 
treatment of a variety of bis(alkynyl)metallocenes Cp2M(-C ≡ C-R)2 ( m = Ti , Zr , Hf ; r = CH3 , n-C3H7 , n-C4H10 , cyclo-C6H11 ) with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane yields the metallocene(m,-RC4R)borate betaines <nUm> . these seem to be in an endothermic equilibrium with their methylenecyclopropene derived isomers - by means of an intramolecular alkyne insertion reaction - which are very effectively trapped by the reaction with tert-butylisocyanide to yield the complexes <nUm> that exhibit a methylenecyclopropene derived s-ligand framework . the zirconocene compounds 6a ( r = CH3 ) , 6c ( r = n-C3H7 ) , 6d ( r = n-C4H9 ) , and 6e ( r = cyclo-C6H11 ) were characterized by x-ray crystal structure analyses . the hydrolysis of 6a , 6c and 6d gave the respective metal free systems <nUm> that exhibit a pronounced cyclopropenylium-borate-betaine character . 
the title complexes Me4Si2(1-C5H3-3-tBu) 2MCl2 ( m = Ti , <nUm> ; m = Zr , <nUm> ) have been prepared by reaction of Li2Me4Si2(C5H3-3- tBu)2 with MC14*2THF in refluxing THF . rac / meso ratio of about <nUm> / <nUm> was obtained for the titanocene complex <nUm> . but for the zirconocene <nUm> , only meso isomer was obtained . the crystal structures of meso-1 and meso-2 were determined . their catalytic properties for ethylene polymerization have also been studied with MAO as a cocatalyst . 
reactions of hydroxyl , ether and carbonyl functionalized alkenes with methylaluminoxane prepared in toluene-d8 ( MAO ) and zirconocenedichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) were investigated by 1H- and 13C - NMR spectroscopy at <nUm> ° C . the <nUm> alkenes studied bear a terminal C = C bond separated by 7-9 ( -CH2- ) units from the heteroatom moiety . intramolecular connectivities in mono ( alkene ) , bi ( alkene and MAO ) and tri ( alkene , MAO and Cp2ZrCl2 ) component mixtures were determined by 2D HSQC , HMBC , ROESY and NOESY NMR techniques . the five studied alkenols formed aluminium alkoxides with MAO even in the case of a substantial steric hindrance around the OH group . zirconocene enhanced the formation of aluminium alkoxides . decomposition to free alkenol was observed only for the straight chain alkenol ( 10-undecen-1-ol ) . the OTMS derivatives formed dimers of the type CH2 = CR1R2 along with methyl derivatives , CH2 = C(Me) ( r ) and (Me)CH = CH ( r ) , in the presence of MAO and Cp2ZrCl2 . 10-Undecenyl methyl ether and methyl decenoate remained mainly as a free comonomer in the presence of MAO or MAO / Cp2ZrCl2 , though a transient coordination of the former to MAO was deduced . unsaturated species Me2C = CH-Al-X and CH2 = C4H7 = C(t-Bu)O-Al-X ( x = MAO oligomer ) were formed in the reaction of t-butyl undecenoate or 2,2-dimethyl-11-dodecen-3-one with MAO or MAO / Cp2ZrCl2 . interaction of the CH2 = CH part of the functionalized alkenes with zirconocene was not observed . A possible coordination of the C = C bond to MAO was observed only for the sec alkenols . 
redox properties of the substituted zirconocene dichlorides : (C5H5-nMen)2 Cl2Zr ( n = 0-5 ) , [C5H5-n(SiMe3)n] 2ZrCl2 ( n = 0-3 ) , [C5Me4(SiMe3)](C5HMe 4)ZrCl2 and two ansa - analogues Me2Si(C5H4)2ZrCl2 and Me2Si[C5H2(SiMe3)2] 2ZrCl2 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry on a mercury electrode in tetrahydrofuran . In the (C5H5-nMen)2ZrCl2 ( n = 0-4 ) compounds , standard electrode potential ( e ° ) of the one - electron uptake shifts to more negative values by <nUm> V per one methyl group . A deviation from this linear dependence to a less negative e ° is observed for (C5Me5)2ZrCl2 . this effect is attributed to the steric hindrance between rotating C5Me5 ligands which tends to decrease the angle between the cyclopentadienyl ring planes ( φ ) and consequently , the energy difference between MO frontier orbitals . In the trimethylsilylated compounds , the net effect of SiMe3 is negligible , giving virtually the same value of e ° for n = 0-3 . In m-SiMe2 - bridged ansa - compounds the difference in e ° of <nUm> mV corresponds to the negative shift of <nUm> mV per one SiMe3 group . owing to the rigid angle φ , this shift can be tentatively accounted for the electronic effect of the SiMe3 groups . In the non-ansa - compounds , the negative shift due to the electronic effect of SiMe3 groups is assumed to be roughly compensated by a positive shift resulting from a sterically controlled diminution of φ . 
A series of complexes Si2Me4L2ZrCl2 ( L = ind ( 1b ) , 2-Me-Ind ( 2b ) , 3-SiMe3-Ind ( 3b ) and Ind-H4 ( 4 ) ) was prepared . the syntheses of 1b , 3b and <nUm> gave predominantly the meso-isomers , whereas a <nUm> : <nUm> meso : rac mixture was obtained for 2b . x-ray analysis of meso-3b revealed large steric hindrance on the metal center ( cp ° -Zr-Cp ° is <nUm> ° ) . the <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of meso-2b and rac-2b ( activated with MAO ) produced a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of elastic atactic and isotactic polypropylene with low activity . 
recent labeling experiments have detected stereoerrors in the isotactic polymerization of propene with zirconocenium catalysts , which are characterized by a deuterium transfer from the polymer chain to a methyl group . using Cp2Zr-iso-butyl+ as a model system , two alternative mechanisms leading to the observed products are investigated using fully nonlocal levels of density functional theory ( DFT ) . the direct hydrogen transfer starting from a g-agostic intermediate requires an overall activation relative to the b-agostic resting state in excess of <nUm> kJ mol-1 and can be excluded . the sequential mechanism involves a ( i ) b-elimination to yield an initial iso-butene p-complex ; ( ii ) a subsequent internal rotation of this p-complex ; and ( iii ) reinsertion of the olefin into the Zr-H bond via two consecutive formations of b-agostic interactions , with maximum relative energies along this path between <nUm> and <nUm> kJ mol-1 ( depending on functional and basis sets employed ) . the subsequent steps are the reverse of the first three steps and can lead to an inverted iso-butyl complex with migrated deuterium . although certain barrier heights are somewhat sensitive to the density functional employed ( BP86 vs. B3LYP ) , the sequential mechanism is much more favorable energetically . loss of olefin from the intermediate p-complex is endothermic by 104-114 kJ mol-1 and should therefore not occur . 
reaction of phenyl magnesium bromide with the a,b-unsaturated ketone 3-methyl-2,3,4,5,6,7-hexahydroind-8(9)-en-1-one , followed by an aqueous work-up , generates the pro-chiral tetra-substituted cyclopentadiene , 1-phenyl-3-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindene , cp ‡ H , a precursor to the e5-cyclopentadienyl ligand in ( cp ‡ )2Fe and [ ( cp ‡ )Fe(CO)]2(m-CO)2 . both complexes were generated as mixtures of rac - ( RR and SS)- and meso-(RS) - isomers , and in either case pure meso-isomer was isolated by crystallisation and characterised by single crystal x-ray structure , both molecules having crystallographic ci symmetry . reduction with Na / Hg cleaves meso-(RS)-[(Cp ‡ )Fe(CO)]2(m-CO)2 and the resulting mixture of (R)- and (S)-[(Cp ‡ )Fe(CO)2]- anions reacts with MeI to give racemic ( cp ‡ )Fe(CO)2Me , which was characterised by the x-ray crystal structure . the cp ‡ ligand is more electron donating than ( e-C5H5 ) as revealed by the reduction potential of the ( cp ‡ )2Fe+ / ( cp ‡ ) 2Fe couple , e ° = <nUm> V ( vs. Ag AgCl ) . reaction of LiCp ‡ with Cl4Zr yields the zirconocene dichloride [ Zr(Cp ‡ )2Cl2 ] as mixture of rac- and meso-isomers , from which pure rac - isomer is obtained as a mixture of RR and SS crystals by recrystallisation . the reaction of rac - [ Zr(Cp ‡ )2Cl2 ] with LiMe gives rac - [ Zr(Cp ‡ )2Me2 ] . the structures of RR - [ Zr(Cp ‡ )2Cl2 ] and rac - [ Zr(Cp ‡ )2Me2 ] have been determined by x-ray diffraction . the structural studies reveal the influence of the bulky substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand on the metal-Cp ‡ distances and other metric parameters .

the P-H functionalised phosphinoalcohol 1-PH(Tipp)-2-OH-cyclo-C6H10 ( tipp = 2,4,6-Pri3C6H2 ) reacts with [Cp2ZrMe2] with elimination of methane to give exclusively the mono-substituted product [Cp2Zr(Me)(cyclo-1-O-2-PH(Tipp)-C6H10)] ( 1 ) , even at elevated temperature . <nUm> reacts with [Mo(CO)5(NMe3)] to give the heterodinuclear complex [ Cp2Zr(Me)(cyclo-1-O-2-PH(Tipp){Mo(CO)5}-C 6H10 ) ] ( 2 ) . the borane adduct [ Cp2Zr(BH4)(cyclo-1-O-2-PH(Mes)(BH3)-C 6H10 ) ] ( <nUm> , mes = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2 ) was obtained from [Cp2Zr(BH4)2] and 1-PH(Mes)-2-OH-cyclo-C6H10 in boiling hexane . 1-3 were characterised spectroscopically ( 1H , 13C , 31P , 11B ( for <nUm> ) , MS , and IR ) . A crystal structure determination of the RC,RC,RP / SC,SC,S P isomer of <nUm> was obtained . the complexes 1-3 were studied in the catalytic polymerisation of ethylene and propylene by activating them with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst . 
the unsymmetrical substituted zirconacyclopentadienes obtained by selective intramolecular cross-coupling of two different alkynes on zirconocene are used to prepare new unsymmetrical C - substituted phosphole compounds . the x-ray structures of a phosphole and its related sulfide are presented . 
the oligomerization of ethylene catalyzed by Cp2ZrL2 ( L = Cl , me , OC6H4-Me-p ) with ethylaluminoxane or Et3Al as cocatalyst ( Al / Zr = <nUm> , <nUm> ° C , C2H4P = <nUm> MPa ) afforded not only common chain oligomers but also a cyclic oligomer , methylenecyclopentane . the selectivity of methylenecyclopentane reached <nUm> % under optimal conditions . the addition of C5H5N to the catalytic system of Cp2ZrCl2 / Et3Al was capable of further improving the selectivity of methylenecyclopentane to <nUm> % . 
the homogeneous homopolymerization of propene was conducted with the two catalyst precursors Me2Si(Ind)2ZrBz2 ( 1 ) and Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2ZrBz2 ( 2 ) and triphenylmethyltetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate [C(CH3)3][B(C6F5)4] ( 3 ) as cocatalyst . after synthesizing the dibenzyl compounds from their dichloride derivatives the catalyst system ( 1 ) / ( 3 ) was optimized in respect to the catalyst / cocatalyst ratio and the amount of tri(isobutyl) aluminum ( TIBA ) . the polymerization behavior of the catalyst system ( 2 ) / ( 3 ) is investigated using a central composite experimental design . In this design the dependence of the polymer properties on temperature , catalyst and monomer concentration are modeled . the dibenzyl compound ( 2 ) shows extremely high catalytic activities of <nUm> <nUm> kg PP / molZr h molp . the polymers produced with this catalyst exhibit very high melting points and molecular weights . 
four supported metallocenes prepared by the sol - gel method were tested by ethylene homopolymerization and in ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization . the effects of A1 / Zr ratio , polymerization temperature and cocatalysts were evaluated . catalyst A2 , produced by TEA and MAO treatments showed the highest activity ( <nUm> × <nUm> kg PE / mol Zr h-1 ) among the tested systems at A1 / Zr = <nUm> . A2 showed thermal stability on polymerization performed at a temperature as high as <nUm> ° C . all the systems exhibited activity in the presence of common alkylaluminum ( TMA , TEA , TIBA ) . comonomer effect was observed in the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene , where the comonomer incorporation is about <nUm> mol % . SAXS measurements of the employed xerogel suggested a weakly branched polymeric texture . metal content in the resulting polymers showed extremely low levels of Zr . 
positron lifetime measurements are reported for linear poly(a-olefin)s from polypropylene to poly-1-eicosene polymerised using zirconocene catalyst . for comparison a low density polyethylene was also studied . four lifetimes are resolved , the longest of them ( t4 ) is attributed to o-Ps annihilation from free - volume holes in the amorphous phase and is used to estimate the mean volume of these holes . it is observed that the hole size increases with increasing separation between the measuring temperature ( T = <nUm> K ) and the glass transition temperature tg , estimated with differential scanning calorimetry . among the poly(a-olefin)s the average hole volume is the largest in poly-1-dodecene ( <nUm> nm3 , tg = <nUm> K ) and the lowest in polypropylene ( <nUm> nm3 , tg = <nUm> K ) . A method for estimation of the glass transition temperature tg from the experimental hold volumes is proposed . from comparison of amorphous and crystalline densities the fractional free volume was calculated . from this the number of holes was estimated to be <nUm> - <nUm> nm-3 . the effect of exposure of the polymers to positron radiation from the source on the o-Ps annihilation parameters was also studied . while lower poly(a-olefin)s show a more or less pronounced exponential decrease of the o-Ps intensity I4 as a function of time , a slight increase is observed in higher poly(a-olefin)s . possible reasons for this behaviour are discussed . 
copolymerization of propylene and cyclopentene ( CPE ) was carried out using as a catalyst isospecific rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) , rac-dimethylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 2 ) , rac-dimethylsilylenebis(2-methylindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 3 ) , or syndiospecific diphenylmethylene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 4 ) with methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst . isospecific zirconocene catalysts 1-3 produced copolymers having narrow molecular weight distribution , while syndiospecific catalyst <nUm> effected propylene homopolymerization . microstructures of the copolymers were studied by 13C NMR and distortionless enhancement of polarization transfer ( DEPT ) spectroscopy . CPE was found to be incorporated in the copolymer preferentially via 1,2-insertion mechanism in the copolymerization with the catalyst <nUm> . the catalyst <nUm> and <nUm> gave copolymers containing CPE units formed by either 1,2-insertion or 1,3-insertion mechanism . the proportion of 1,3-insertion units increased with increasing CPE content in the copolymers . the isomerization reaction from 1,2-insertion to 1,3-insertion CPE units was discussed on the basis of kinetic parameters . 
the effect of Al content on MAO - modified silicas was evaluated on catalyst activity , on polymer properties and on residual metal content in the resulting polyethylenes . MAO - modified silicas were prepared by impregnating MAO toluene solutions in concentration range between <nUm> and <nUm> wt % Al / O2Si . commercial MAO - modified silica ( witco ) containing <nUm> wt % Al / O2Si was used for comparative reasons . the resulting modified - silicas were employed as supports for grafting (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 . using external MAO as cocatalyst ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) no difference in catalyst activity was observed . nevertheless , for Al / Zr = <nUm> , catalyst activities were shown to be higher for supported zirconocene systems containing <nUm> - <nUm> wt % Al / O2Si range . according to DSC analysis , one Tm peak was detected for polymer obtained with catalyst prepared with <nUm> wt % Al / O2Si ( <nUm> ° C ) , but two Tm peaks were observed for polymers obtained with catalysts prepared with <nUm> wt % Al / O2Si ( <nUm> and <nUm> ° C ) and <nUm> wt % Al / O2Si ( <nUm> and <nUm> ° C ) . 
A computational study of the ethylene-styrene copolymerization with rac-ethylenebis(tetrahydroindenyl)MCl2 [ m = Ti , Zr ] systems using DFT methods is presented . the complexation , coordination and insertion energies for ethylene and styrene monomers as well as for the styrene-ethylene copolymerization steps into the catalytic active site models [Et2(IndH4)2]MCH3 + [ m = Ti , Zr ] were calculated . the goal of this study is to examine the influence of the metal atom [ Ti , Zr ] on the copolymerization activity . it could be concluded that zirconocene catalyst is much more active than the titanocene based catalyst . this could be explained by the higher steric congestion around the Ti as compared to the Zr complex . furthermore , it was found that the primary styrene insertion gives rise to complexes in which the active sites are blocked by the phenyl ring in both metal atoms , so that only the secondary insertion of the styrene is possible . these facts might help to clarify the already published experimental results . 
copolymers of styrene and a styrene derivative having a Cs symmetrical ligand moiety were synthesized and used as the carrier for the synthesis of supported - type zirconocene catalysts . propene polymerization was conducted using the resulting catalyst together with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , which gave syndiotactic polypropene . the productivity of the polymer - supported catalyst ( <nUm> kg PP ( mol zr)-1 for <nUm> h ) was , however , very low compared to that of the corresponding homogeneous catalyst ( <nUm> kg PP ( mol zr)-1 for <nUm> min ) . 
an isospecific heterogeneous zirconocene catalyst was prepared by supporting rac-Cl2SiInd2ZrCl2 on Cl2Mg using an impregnation method . polymerization of propene was conducted over this combined with methylalumoxane as co-catalyst . it was found that the catalyst displayed a fairly high activity to give highly isotactic polypropene at <nUm> ° C . with an increase in the polymerization temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C , the activity increased monotonically accompanied by a decrease in isospecificity . 
stereospecific polymerization of propylene was carried out with rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) ( 1 ) , rac-dimethylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconiurn dichloride ( rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) ( 2 ) and isopropylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( i-Pr(Cp)(Flu)ZrCl2 ) ( 3 ) combined with trialkyl-aluminum ( AIR3 : r = C2H5 , i-C4H9 ) / triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( Ph3CB(C6F5)4 ) ( 4 ) . In isospecific polymerization with <nUm> and <nUm> , the molecular weight of polypropylenes decreased with increase in the molar ratio of AlEt3 ( et = C2H5 ) / Zr , whereas , an effect of AliBu3 ( iBu = i-C4H9 ) concentration on molecular weight was not observed . the microstructures of resulting polypropylenes were studied by 13C n.m.r . and an increase in the molar ratio of ethyl end groups ( derived from chain transfer to AlEt3 ) to n-propyl end groups ( derived from b-hydrogen transfer ) was observed with increase in the molar ratio of AlEt3 / Zr ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) . the chain transfer reactions by both AlEt3 and AliBu3 were also detected in syndiospecific polymerization with <nUm> . the molar ratio of alkyl ( r ) end groups ( derived from chain transfer to AIR3 ) to n-propyl end groups was higher in the polypropylene obtained with AlEt3 than that obtained with AliBu3 . the relative constants ktrA / kp ( ktrA = rate constant of chain transfer to AIR3 , kp = rate constant of propagation ) were determined by kinetic study . 
several types of commercial and developmental aluminoxanes were studied in the semi-batch polymerization of ethylene using bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) . high temperature gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) measurements of polyethylene ( PE ) formed using various types of aluminoxanes approximated flory 's most probable distribution from a single site - type with PE mw / mns approaching <nUm> for polymerization temperatures ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C . the structure and type of aluminoxane co-catalyst were found not to influence the molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) of PE although to influence the activity of the Cp2ZrCl2 catalyst . In general , modified methylaluminoxanes ( MMAOs ) and methylaluminoxanes ( MAOs ) were found to have similar activities , whereas isobutylaluminoxane ( IBAO ) gave a very low activity in the polymerization of ethylene . increasing isobutyl content in the aluminoxane co-catalyst led to a continual decrease in catalyst activity . increasing aluminium / zirconium ( Al / Zr ) molar ratio , by increasing the MAO concentration , led to increasing catalyst activity up to a maximum activity at an Al / Zr molar ratio of <nUm> . like the structure and type of the aluminoxane co-catalyst , the Al / Zr molar ratio was found not to influence the PE MWD . mixing in additional trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) with MAO was found not to alter the MWD but gave lower activity at similar Al / Zr molar ratios than that from MAO itself . 
we report an experimental investigation on long chain branching ( LCB ) in ethylene slurry polymerization with bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) / modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) using a semi-batch reactor . the effects of the reaction temperature , pressure , MMAO concentration , and catalyst feeding method on the long chain branching density ( LCBD , number of branches per <nUm> carbons ) , polymer molecular weight , and shear thinning property ( I10 / I2 ) were systematically examined . the slurry polymerization process , with its associated polymer - rich phase and the partitioning of active sites , favors the LCB formation via an in situ copolymerization of ethylene macromonomers generated by b-hydride elimination and chain transfer to monomer . increasing the temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C reduced the LCBD from <nUm> to <nUm> , while increasing the pressure from <nUm> to <nUm> psig reduced the LCBD from <nUm> to <nUm> . the LCB polyethylenes showed enhanced shear thinning properties , with melt flow index ratios ( I10 / I2 ) in the range of <nUm> - <nUm> . the feeding sequence of reactants also had a significant effect on the LCB formation . it was observed that feeding ethylene monomer before zirconocene catalyst produced polyethylenes having much higher LCBD than feeding catalyst before monomer.We report an experimental investigation on long chain branching ( LCB ) in ethylene slurry polymerization with bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) / modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) using a semi-batch reactor . the effects of the reaction temperature , pressure , MMAO concentration , and catalyst feeding method on the long chain branching density ( LCBD , number of branches per <nUm> <nUm> carbons ) , polymer molecular weight , and shear thinning property ( I10 / I2 ) were systematically examined . the slurry polymerization process , with its associated polymer - rich phase and the partitioning of active sites , favors the LCB formation via an in situ copolymerization of ethylene macromonomers generated by b-hydride elimination and chain transfer to monomer . increasing the temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C reduced the LCBD from <nUm> to <nUm> , while increasing the pressure from <nUm> to <nUm> psig reduced the LCBD from <nUm> to <nUm> . the LCB polyethylenes showed enhanced shear thinning properties , with melt flow index ratios ( I10 / I2 ) in the range of <nUm> - <nUm> . the feeding sequence of reactants also had a significant effect on the LCB formation . it was observed that feeding ethylene monomer before zirconocene catalyst produced polyethylenes having much higher LCBD than feeding catalyst before monomer .

hydrogenolysis is a commonly used method to control the molecular weight or size of polymers obtained by ziegler - natta and related metallocene catalysts . however , the precise mechanism governing these controlling processes is still unknown . it is most accepted that the insertion of hydrogen molecule into the metal - alkyl bond of the catalyst active species competes favorably against the ethylene insertion . thus , the newly formed hydride complex would react with an incoming ethylene starting a new polymer chain . ab initio calculations at the B3LYP / LANL2DZ level of theory have been performed to calculate the reaction profile of both ethylene and hydrogen insertions into the metal-carbon bond of a zirconocene catalyst system . it has been observed that the activation barrier for the hydrogen molecule insertion is lower than that in case of the ethylene insertion ( <nUm> vs <nUm> kcal / mol ) , supporting the idea of a favored hydrogenolysis process controlling the molecular weight of the polymers . In addition , the ethylene insertion into the hydride complex formed after hydrogenolysis was also studied . No barrier for this reaction has been found , indicating that the initiation of a new chain is an easy step from both thermodynamic and kinetic points of view . the energetic data obtained in the present work provide a reasonable explanation for some experimental facts such as broadening of polymer molecular weight distributions and the early consumption of hydrogen present in the ethylene polymerization .

In the presence of 3-10 mol % of Cu ( l ) salts such as CuBr*S me2 or CCuN , alkylzirconocenes add readily to a,b-unsaturated ketones , aldehydes , and sulfones . the reaction yield is sensitive to the presence of lewis acids and bases . steric hindrance as well as a broad range of functional groups are tolerated in the conjugate addition process . unsaturated n-acyl oxazolidinones give high diastereoselectivities for the formation of the new asymmetric carbon . the resulting zirconium enolates can be used for tandem aldol addition reactions to aldehydes . depending on the type of copper salt used , slow or fast formation of copper mirror occurs , but no intermediate copper species is detected spectroscopically . therefore , a mechanism involving enone complexation by the lewis-acidic zirconocene followed by inner - sphere transfer of the alkyl substituent to chelated Cu ( l ) is proposed . 
A new total synthesis of a-himachalene , a sesquiterpene isolated from essential oil of a himalayan cedar ( cedrus deodara loud),has been achieved . it is based on a sequence involving the [2+2] photoaddition of a cyclic enone with a silyl enol ether , followed by a radical - induced ring expansion of the resulting fused cyclobutanol ; the [2+2] photoaddition of cyclohexenone with 1-methyl-2-trimethylsiloxy-1-cyclopentene in benzene , followed by a treatment of the resulting photoadducts with acid gave a stereoisomeric mixture of 2-hydroxy-6-methyltricyclo[5.4.0.02,6]undecan-8-one(33 % ) accompanied by a product ( <nUm> % ) from a retroaldol reaction of an isomeric photoadduct . the former was transformed into 8-tert-butyldimethylsiloxy-6-methyltricyclo[5.4.0.02,6] undecan-2-ol via <nUm> steps . irradiation of the hypoiodite generated from this protected fused cyclobutanol in benzene resulted in a b-scission of the ring fusion bond to give a mixture of functionalized bicyclo[5.4.0]undecanes , which was transformed into cis-6,6-dimethyl-8-hydroxybicyclo[5.4.0]undecane-2-ones via <nUm> steps . its methylenation by a wittig reaction , followed by oxidation of the resulting 2-methylenebicyclo [.5.4.0]undecan-8-ol , gave the corresponding bicycloundecan-8-one . its ethoxycarbonylation , followed by reductive deoxygenation with zirconocene chloride hydride ( Cp2ZrHCl ) , gave ethyl 6,6-dimethyl-2-methylenebicyclo[5.4.0]undec-8-ene-9-carboxylate . the synthesis of (+-)-a-himachalene was achieved by transforming the ethoxycarbonyl group into a methyl group by the standard method ; the a,b-unsaturated ester was reduced into the corresponding alcohol with lithium alminium hydride . A reduction of the mesylate of the resulting alcohol with lithium triethylborohydride gave (+-)-a-himachalene . 
A convenient diastereoselective synthesis of d-erythro- and l-threo-sphingosine derivatives is described . L-Serine - derived aldehyde ( garner 's aldehyde ) ( 2 ) was treated with 1-alkenyl-zirconocene chlorides ( 3 ) in the presence of Br2Zn in THF to give the natural erythro-(anti-) isomers with high diastereoselectivity ( anti / syn = 12-20 : <nUm> ) . In contrast , reaction of <nUm> with 1-alkenyl-ethyl-zinc , prepared from <nUm> and Et2Zn , in CCl2H2 gave the unnatural threo-(syn-) isomers predominantly ( anti / syn = 1:12-15 ) . 
for the purpose of exploring a new reaction of acylzirconocene chloride as an acyl anion donor , Cu (I) - catalyzed cross-coupling and conjugate addition reactions of acylzirconocene chloride were studied . the coupling reaction with allylic or propargylic halides efficiently proceeded to yield b,g-unsaturated ketone or allenyl ketone derivatives , respectively . the conjugated addition reaction to a,b-enones was carried out in the presence of <nUm> equiv. of BF3*OEt2 giving 1,4-diketone compounds .

readily available (butadiene)zirconocene and -hafnocene complexes react with various metal carbonyls to form metallacyclic metal oxycarbene complexes . the p-allyl species Cpa2MOC[M'Ln]C4H6 ) ( m = Zr , Hf ) can often be obtained crystalline . the bimetallic carbene complexes exhibit a rather short OC(carbene) bond distance indicating a pronounced metal acyl complex character . carbene complex formation between (s-trans-e4-butadiene)zirconocene and CpCO(CO)2 or C5O4PV , respectively is reversible . the equilibrium can be shifted towards the carbene complex side by reducing the electron density at the carbene ligand bearing metal or by using the hafnium instead of the zirconium containing butadiene metallocene reagent . five - membered benzannelated zirconium oxycarbene complexes CP2ZrOC[W(CO)5](C6H4) were obtained by CC - coupling from thermally generated (1,2-didehydrobenzene)zirconocene and C6O6W . this carbene complex is an oligomer in the solid state as revealed by x-ray diffraction . monomeric units are linked together via intermolecular COWZr bonds . this zirconium oxycarbene complex acts as an organometallic lewis acid in solution . it reversibly coordinates organic carbonyl compounds . zirconium oxycarbene complexes CP2Zr(OR)C(Ph)W(CO)5 react readily with several non-stabilized phosphorus ylides to produce zirconium enolates CP2Zr(OR)C(Ph)CHR which can be used as carbon nucleophiles in syn-selective aldol condensation reactions . the (butadiene)zirconocene derived metallacyclic zirconium oxycarbene complexes CP2ZrOC[M(CO)5](C4H6) ( m = Cr , Mo , W ) act as carbon nucleophiles at the Zr - bound substituted p-allyl ligand . ketones or aldehydes are CC - coupled regioselectively to the allyl-CH2 terminus to form chiral nine - membered metallacyclic products . 
bis(e <nUm> -cyclopentadienyl)chloro(4-oxoferrocenebutanoyloxy)zirconium(IV) , η <nUm> -Cp <nUm> ZrCl(OCOCH <nUm> CH <nUm> COFc ) ( cp = C <nUm> H <nUm> , fc = C <nUm> H <nUm> ,FeC <nUm> ,H <nUm> ) , has been synthesized by reaction of zirconocene dichloride with sodium 4-oxoferrocenebutanoate and has been characterized by elemental analysis , PMR and IR spectroscopy . the x-ray crystal structure of the title complex was determined using <nUm> independent reflections with I > 3s(I) . the complex crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2 <nUm> / c with four monomeric molecules in a cell of dimensions a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> Å <nUm> , d calc = <nUm> g cm <nUm> and m(K α ) = <nUm> cm <nUm> . the structure has been solved by direct methods and refined by fourier and full - matrix least - squares methods to a conventional r = <nUm> . the carboxyl group in this complex is a bidentate ligand and the atoms , Zr , Cl , O(2) , O(3) , C(4) and C(3) lie in a quasi-mirror plane . 
Cpo2ZrCl2 ( cpo = e5-C5EtMe4 ) reacts with LiPHCy ( cy = cyclohexyl ) with the formation of CPo2ZrCl(PHCy) ( 1 ) . compound <nUm> undergoes insertion of CS2 or PhNCS into the Zr - P bond , yielding Cpo2ZrCl(e2-S2CPHCy) ( 2 ) and Cpo2ZrCl{e2-SC(PHCy)NPh} ( 3 ) . compounds 1-3 were characterized spectroscopically ( IR , NMR , MS ) and crystal structure determinations were carried out on <nUm> and <nUm> , showing an e2-bonding mode of the SC(PHCy)NPh ( S , N ) ligand in the latter . 
the novel [ e5:e 1-(2-diphenylphosphinoethyl)cyclopentadienyl]trichlorozirconium ( IV ) <nUm> has been prepared via (2-diphenylphosphinoethyl)(trimethylsilyl)cyclopentadiene <nUm> . the structures of an adduct of <nUm> with tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) 3b ( two crystal modifications ) and of an ionic complex derived from <nUm> and Cl4Zr { [ e5:e1-(C5H4CH 2CH2PPh2)ZrCl]2(m-Cl) 3}+2[(ZrCl4) 2(m-Cl)2]2- <nUm> have been determined by an x-ray analysis . the x-ray and NMR data prove the existence of a Zr-P intramolecular coordination in <nUm> both in solid state and in non-solvating media within a broad range of temperatures . In THF solution the flexible equilibrium between adducts of <nUm> with one ( 3b ) and two ( 3c ) molecules of THF has been observed by variable - temperature NMR spectroscopy . the synthetic route to the simplest unsymmetrically ligated zirconocene ( e5-C5H4CH2 CH2PPh2)(e5-C5H 5)ZrCl2 <nUm> derived from <nUm> has also been elaborated . 
metal contents in polymerization catalysts were comparatively determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) , x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) and x-ray fluorescence ( XRF ) spectroscopy . catalysts were prepared by grafting metallocene onto bare silica or onto silica chemically modified with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . catalysts were compressed as self - supporting pellets ( RBS and XRF ) , or mounted on adhesive copper tape ( XPS ) . the proximity of the mass of the atomic nuclei did not allow resolution by RBS of the signals corresponding to Zr and Nb , nor Si and Al in catalyst systems such as (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 / Cp2NbCl2 / MAO / OSi <nUm> . on the other hand , Zr , Nb , Si and Al lines were completely resolved in an XRF spectrum . for supported metallocenes on bare silica , XPS measurement was ca. <nUm> % higher than that obtained by RBS . silica - supported zirconocene showed good agreement in Zr content determination by XRF and RBS . 
an in situ supporting method was applied to newly synthesized [(CH2)5(C5H4)2][(C9 H7)ZrCl2]2 catalyst and other commercial catalysts , and its effects on the polymerization characteristics of these catalysts were examined through reaction experiments . the changes in the molecular weight distribution varied depending on the metallocene catalyst while the changes in the catalytic activity , average molecular weight and the melting point showed the same trend . the reason for the decrease in the molecular weight with in situ supporting was discussed in relation to the co-catalysts . the polymerization characteristics of each catalyst also varied according to the alkyl aluminum , and so it is important to select a proper co-catalyst or a combination of co-catalysts to obtain a desired polymer product from each metallocene catalyst supported by in situ method . 
oligomerization of propylene catalyzed by Cp2ZrCl2 / ethylaluminoxane or / Et3Al at low Al / Zr ratios and high temperature regioselectively afforded trimeric carbocyclic products , 1,1,3-trimethylcyclopentane and 1,1,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentane , along with C6 and C9 chain olefins . the product distribution was affected by the reaction temperature , the pressure of propylene , the ratio of Al / Zr and the reaction time . the combined selectivity of two five - membered cyclic products attained <nUm> % under the optimized condition . the pathway of regioselective cyclo-trimerization of propylene to substituted cyclopentanes is discussed . 
novel methodology was developed for preparation of isospecific metallocene catalysts for olefin polymerization that are tethered on silica surfaces with covalent bonds . A racemic ansa - zirconocene complex that has a Si-Cl moiety on its bridge was immobilized on O2Si by the reaction of the Si-Cl anchor with Si-OH on the solid surface . the prepared solid catalyst was found to be effective for isospecific propene polymerization ( catalyst A ) . pretreatment of silica surfaces with Me3SiCl improved the catalyst performance ( catalyst B ) . an ansa - zirconocene complex with a BH group reacted with " vinyl-coated " silica gel to afford another immobilized catalysts ( catalyst C ) . this catalyst achieved satisfactorily high catalytic activity and high isotacticity in its produced polypropene .

A new RIS model was developed for erythro di-isotactic polynorbornene that included long - range steric interactions that are needed to properly model its conformation . these interactions were included by extracting RIS states from an approximate energy state map for the heptamer of this polymer . the RIS model predicted a novel helix - kink conformation for this polymer in which helices were occasionally disrupted by a backbone kink and a value of approximately <nUm> for the exponent 'a ' from the Mark-Houwink-Sakurada equation at the θ condition . these RIS results were consistent with independent single chain monte carlo simulations and were also used to generate bulk periodic structures of this polymer . the results of these simulations compare well to both experimental viscometry and wide angle x-ray diffraction results for two polymer samples synthesized using Pd and zirconocene homogeneous polymerization catalysts . these results indicated that the likely stereochemical configuration for polymers produced using these catalysts is the erythro di-isotactic form . they also suggested that polymers of similar structure such as cis poly(t - butyl acetylene ) may also adopt this kink - helix conformation .

addition of small amounts of ethylene or hydrogen leads to significant productivity increase in propylene polymerization catalyzed by fluxional bis(2-arylindenyl)zirconocenes . to test if this phenomenon is related to the reactivation of dormant species formed as a result of regioirregular propylene insertions , we have reinvestigated the regioregularity of these catalysts . approximately <nUm> - <nUm> mol % of 2,1-misinsertions were found in polymers synthesized by these catalysts . the presence of these regioirregular insertions could account for the ethylene and hydrogen effects observed but does not rule out formation of other catalyst dormant sites .

four metallocene catalysts were prepared using two indenyl-containing aerogels as supports , treated under different conditions ( triethylaluminum ( TEA ) , methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and butyllithium ) . the catalysts were characterized by complementary spectroscopic techniques : ultraviolet - visible spectroscopy ( UV - vis ) , x-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy ( XPS ) , matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization time - of - flight mass spectroscopy ( MALDI-TOF-MS ) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and electron probe microanalysis ( EPMA ) . the highest metal content ( <nUm> mmol Zr / g-cat . ) was achieved in the case of xerogel treated with TEA prior to metallocene synthesis . after MAO leaching , such content is reduced to <nUm> mmol-Zr / g-cat. , exhibiting the highest activity in ethylene polymerization among the four developed catalysts . A relationship between catalyst activity and binding energy of Zr 3d(5 / <nUm> ) core level could be evidenced . the most active catalyst system showed a better Zr distribution , being the catalyst grain covered by aluminum cocatalyst . depth profile monitoring by XPS measurements showed that , in fact , MAO leaches the zirconocene low binding energy species , being deposited in the uttermost surface of the grains . 
eight zirconocene dichloride complexes are described that contain an alkyl or silylalkyl substituent with a fluorenyl end group on the cyclopentadienyl ring . also , a bridged cyclopentadienyl indenyl metallocene complex with a fluorenyl terminated alkyl substituent is reported . these complexes were activated with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) and used for catalytic ethylene polymerization . 
the synthesis and characterization of <nUm> new , unbridged metallocene dichloride complexes of the type (L)(Ind)ZrCl2 ( L = o-phenylalkyl substituted cyclopentadienyl or 1-phenylsilyl substituted indenyl ; ind = indenyl ) and (L')(Flu)ZrCl2(L ' = 1-benzyl substituted indenyl or 2-benzyl substituted indenyl ; flu = fluorenyl ) are reported . after activation with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) , these complexes are highly active catalysts for homogeneous ethylene polymerization . the influence of various substituents on the catalyst activities and the polymer properties are discussed . 
ethylene polymerization was carried out by using the zirconocene catalysts supported on MCM-41 ( or Al-MCM-41 ) , which had a uniform hexagonal array of linear channels constructed with a honeycomb - like silica matrix , and about <nUm> Å d-spacing . the zirconocene catalysts supported directly on silicious MCM-41 ( Cp2ZrCl2 / MCM-41 ) did not show any activity in ethylene polymerization . on the other hand , the activities of the zirconocene catalysts supported directly on Al-MCM-41 ( Cp2ZrCl2 / Al-MCM-41 ) were comparable to those of homogeneous zirconocenes , and much higher than the activities of those supported on Al-MCM-41 modified by methylaluminoxane ( Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO / Al-MCM-41 ) . the lewis acidity in Al-MCM-41 seemed to play an important role for anchoring the zirconocenes , such that lower value of Si / Al ratio resulted in higher catalytic activity . modification with MAO must have reduced the role of acidity . the difference in the catalytic activity among the supported zirconocenes was discussed through the surface species models on the interaction between zirconocene and lewis acids in Al-MCM-41 .

1H and 13C NMR studies of the reactions between two b-alkyl-substituted aluminoxanes obtained from the in situ reaction between Al(i-Bu)3 , Al(i-Oct)3 and H2O with two metallocenes Cp2ZrCl2 and cp2 / (*)ZrCl2 ( cp = cyclopentadienyl , and cp(*) = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ) have been performed . the b-branched aluminoxanes were obtained from the in situ reaction between Al(i-R)3 and H2O at Al / H2O molar ratio of <nUm> ( r = i-Bu ( TIBAO ) , r = i-Oct ( TIOAO ) ) . A comparison of the Cp2ZrCl2 and cp2 / (*)ZrCl2 reactivity with MAO , as the reference point for aluminoxanes , as well as with their parent aluminum alkyls AlMe3 ( TMA ) , Al(i-Bu)3 ( TIBA ) , and Al(i-Oct)3 ( TIOA ) has been made . cp2 / (*)ZrCl2 , because of steric hindrance , is less reactive than Cp2ZrCl2 towards all aluminium compounds considered . the cp2 / (*)Zr-i-BuCl and cp2 / (*)Zr-i-OctCl produced appear to be more stable than Cp2Zr-i-BuCl and Cp2Zr-i-OctCl due to the cp* steric hindrance , which inhibits b-hydrogen eliminations . the lower reactivity of cp2 / (*)ZrCl2 along with the higher stability of the zirconium alkyls produced has allowed us to produce evidence of the greater capacity of TIOAO with respect to TIBAO for yielding alkylated ion pairs . these results explain the polymerization activities yielded by metallocenes when combined with the above aluminoxanes , that is , the Cp2ZrCl2 activity only with MAO , and the high polymerization activities of substituted metallocenes when b-alkyl-substituted aluminoxanes are used as cocatalysts .

all - electron DFT ( B3LYP ) calculations with a split - valence basis set of double- and triple-x quality have been used to study the reaction paths of the first and second step insertion as well as of the s-bond metathesis for the reaction of acetylene with (C5H5)2ZrCH3+ . geometry optimizations of the reactants , intermediates , transition states and products were carded out without symmetry constraints . the nature of the particular points on the potential energy surfaces was verified by the analytical calculation of the hessian matrices . the relative electronic energies are corrected for ZPVE , entropic and thermal contributions , and correspond to the gibbs free energies ( DDG298 ) . it is shown that the propagation step of acetylene polymerization is a facile process from kinetic and thermodynamic point of view , and that the investigated insertion reactions are kinetically and thermodynamically favoured over the s-bond metathesis reaction . the calculated energetics and structures of either reaction are compared with available theoretical and experimental data of relevant complexes of group ill and IV transition metals .

effects of heterogenization parameters on compositional and catalytic properties of Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 supported on silica modified with MAO were evaluated using data on metal loading , catalyst activity in ethylene-propylene copolymerization , and polymer properties . the supported catalysts were prepared according to a <nUm> factorial design for multivariate analysis . the parameters studied were : MAO concentration in impregnation , Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 concentration in grafting , and immobilization temperature for both metallocene and organoaluminum . the grafting solution was monitored by UV - VIS spectroscopy , while the resulting catalyst systems were characterized by inductively - coupled plasma - optical emission spectroscopy ( ICP - OES ) , diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy ( DRIFTS ) , and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) . At high statistical significance , both MAO and Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 concentrations during preparation affected the determination of the final A1 / Zr ratio on silica . the catalyst systems were tested in ethylene-propylene copolymerizations using external MAO as cocatalyst . relationships were observed between ( i ) catalyst activity and the binding energy of Zr 3d5 / <nUm> electrons and ( ii ) Al / Zr ratio on silica and the average ethylene incorporation . the polymer samples presented narrow molecular weight distribution , but according to differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , and cross-fractionation chromatography ( CFC ) data , catalyst systems with given Al / Zr ratios might yield different crystallites , suggesting a plural distribution of chemical composition . 
this work presents the results of theoretical and experimental characterization of supported (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 on organosilanes pre-treated O2Si . several possibilities are analyzed and considered as an attempt to explain the observed zirconocene loadings , catalyst performance in ethylene polymerization and resulting polymer properties of these supported zirconocenes . the effect of silica pre-treatment with Ph3SiCl , Me3SiCl and Me2HSiCl on the immobilization of (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 was modeled . the main considered aspects were the role of the surface concentration of the organosilanes , the presence or absence of residual chlorine and the possibility of interactions between the organosilanes and the zirconocene . all these facts might afford different surface species at the impregnation step prior to the MAO activation during the polymerization reaction . 
the different elementary steps in the racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 activation process by commercial methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) are studied by UV - VIS spectroscopy technique and correlated with hexene polymerization kinetics . after monomethylation of the zirconocene dichloride ( λ = <nUm> nm ) , abstraction of Cl ligand by MAO at low Al : Zr ratios ( Al : Zr = <nUm> ) yields tight ion pairs , [racEt(Ind)2ZrMe]+ , [MAOCl]- with an absorption band centered at λ = <nUm> nm , inactive towards hexene polymerization . addition of MAO in large excess ( Al : Zr = <nUm> ) is therefore required to form active species identified as TMA separated ion pairs , [ racEt(Ind)2Zr+ (m-Me)2AlMe2 ] , [ MAO ∼ cl]- ( λ = <nUm> nm ) . the activation of racEt(Ind)2ZrMe2 by MAO reveals much easier and is complete at low Al : Zr ratios ( Al : Zr = <nUm> ) , yielding directly active ion pairs [racEt(Ind)2ZrMe]+ , [MAOMe]- , absorbing at λ = <nUm> nm . these data underline the negative role of [MAOCl]- as a counter-anion in the activation process of zirconocene dichloride precursor for olefin polymerization . In the same conditions , the use of TMA - depleted MAO allows the direct formation , at low Al : Zr ratio , of active tight ion pairs λ = <nUm> nm ) . 
the activation process by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) of various zirconocene precursors of the type racEt(Ind)2ZrX2 , with different extractable x ligands ( x = Cl , me , NMe2 , CH2Ph ) , was investigated both by means of UV - VIS spectroscopy and through hex-1-ene polymerization kinetics . the different elementary steps yielding olefin polymerization active species , i.e. methylation and cationization of the transition metal could be readily discriminated . unlike racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 precursor for which high amount of MAO ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) is required to form catalytic species active towards olefin polymerization , the complete activation of other racEt(Ind)2ZrX2 tested ( with x = me , NMe2 , CH2Ph ) is readily achieved at relatively low Al / Zr ratios ( Al / Zr = 40-50 ) . the corresponding zirconocenium species exhibit different catalytic activity according to the nature of the extracted x ligand , showing the important role of the formed [MAO-X]- counter-anion in the activation process and more particularly , its ability to still coordinate with the metal center and compete with the incoming olefin . 
A series of supported metallocene catalysts were prepared by immobilizing (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 and Cp2NbCl2 on bare and on MAO - modified silica . both metallocenes were sequentially grafted on silica under different combinations . metal loading ( Zr , Nb and Al ) was determined by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy ( XRF ) . final metal content was shown to be dependent on passivation of silica with MAO , and on the grafting sequence . higher metal contents ( <nUm> wt. % Nb / O2Si and <nUm> wt. % Zr / O2Si ) were achieved when the metallocene was grafted onto MAO - modified silica . Cp2NbCl2 derivatives were not active in polymerizing ethylene using MAO as co-catalyst ( Al / Nb = <nUm> ) . all the systems containing zirconocene derivatives showed high catalyst activity . nevertheless , higher activities were achieved immobilizing (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 on silica that was previously modified with MAO and Cp2NbCl2 . some immobilization protocols led to catalyst systems which were even more active than the homogenous counterpart . effects of support structure and chemical modification on the catalyst performance are presented and discussed . 
the directed oligomerization of propene and 1-hexene was carried out with a series of CP'(C5H5)ZrCl2 and Cp'2ZrCl2 pre-catalysts ( cp' = C5HMe4 , C4Me4P , C5Me5 , C5H4tBu , C5H3-1,3-tBu2 , C5H2-1,2,4-tBu3 ) together with C10Cl2H10Zr . oligomers in the molar mass range 300-1500 g / mol for propene and 200-3000 g / mol for 1-hexene were synthesized at <nUm> ° C . the majority of oligomer molecules contain a double - bond end group . oligomer characterization was carried out by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) , 1H and 13CNMR . vinylidene double bonds ( from b-hydrogen elimination ) are solely found for the tert-butyl-substituted zirconocenes and for most of the unsymmetrical methyl-substituted Cp'(C5H5)ZrCl2 systems ( except cp' = phospholyl ) . with (C4Me4P)(C5H5)ZrCl2 and with the symmetrical methyl-containing Cp'2ZrCl2 pre-catalysts , also vinyl end groups ( from b-methyl elimination ) are observed in the case of oligopropenes . the vinylidene / vinyl ratio depends on the ligand and the vinyl content increases from C5HMe4 ( <nUm> / <nUm> ) over C4Me4P ( <nUm> / <nUm> ) to C5Me5 ( <nUm> / <nUm> ) . the phospholyl zirconocenes and (C5HMe4)2ZrCl2 also exhibit chain - transfer to aluminum thereby giving saturated oligomers . 
heterogeneous metallocene catalysts avoid reactor fouling in olefin polymerisations . for technical use the metallocene catalysts must be fixed on carriers . silica is one of the favoured inorganic carriers . but the activities of heterogeneous metallocene catalysts on silica in ethylene and propylene polymerisation are often lower than those of comparable homogeneous catalyst systems . we tested the clay minerals kaolin and montmorillonite as inorganic carriers for the polymerisation of ethylene and propylene with commercially available titanocenes and zirconocenes and also with new types of titanocenes . the heterogeneous catalysts on kaolin were less active in ethylene polymerisation as comparable homogeneous catalysts and they were not active in propylene polymerisation . In contrast the heterogeneous catalysts on montmorillonite are often more active in ethylene or propylene polymerisation than comparable homogeneous systems . As cocatalysts trimethylaluminium ( AlMe3 , TMA ) and triisobutylaluminium ( Al(iBu3) , TIBA ) were used for heterogeneous polymerisations . As catalysts commercially available titanocenes and zirconocenes and also four titanocenes with unusual structures were tested which lang et al. had synthesised . the high activities in ethylene or propylene polymerisations with montmorillonite may be due to the special structure of the montmorillonite carrier . 
we treated silica with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane , BC18F15 , to create borane - functionalized support , SiO2-B(C6F5)3 which was then used as a support and co-catalyst for the in situ activated dichloro-zirconocene ( Cp2ZrCl2 / TIBA ) and dimethyl-zirconocene catalyst systems ( Cp2Zr(CH3)2 ) for ethylene polymerization . the surface modifications of SiO2-B(C6F5)3 was investigated by SEM - EDX , FTIR and XPS to determine the distribution of fluorine and boron atoms on the silica surface as a measure of the presence of BC18F15 and interaction with the siloxane groups of the silica support . catalytic performances are presented in the form of ethylene consumption rate profiles . the results show that the independent of the time dedicated to the in situ activation of the metallocene , all pre-activated systems showed activity decay . In contrast , the in situ activated systems either showed little or no activity decay . the presence of TIBA was adequate to make an active MAO - free catalyst system . the pre-activated and in situ activated metallocene systems produced polyethylene with slightly different molecular weights ( MWs ) and molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) . MWDs were quite narrow ∼ <nUm> . the bulk density of polyethylene product is highest for the in situ activated metallocenes , but there is no difference between the products of dichloro- and dimethyl-zirconocenes . pre-activated and in situ activated catalysts show no reactor fouling . 
A series of aryl-substituted tetramethylcyclopentadienyl zirconocenes (C5Me4C6H4X-4)Cp' MCl2 [ CP' = CH , x = H ( 5 ) , me ( 6 ) , Cl ( 7 ) or OMe ( 8 ) ; cp' = ind , x = H ( 9 ) , me ( 10 ) or Cl ( 11 ) ; cp' = 2-Ph-Ind , x = H ( 12 ) ] and (C5Me4C6H4X-4)2 Cl2Zr [ x = H ( 13 ) , me ( 14 ) , Cl ( 15 ) ] , with different substituents at the 4-position of phenyl , have been prepared by the reaction of the corresponding ligands ( C5Me4HC6H4X-4 ) [ x = H ( 1 ) , me ( 2 ) , Cl ( 3 ) or OMe ( 4 ) ] with n-BuLi , Cl4Zr and Cp'Li or with n-BuLi and Cl4Zr . ethylene polymerization with these complexes in combination with MAO has been studied . the electron donor ( me ) at the 4-position of phenyl led to an increase in catalytic activity while the electron - withdrawing group ( Cl ) and the strong π donor ( OMe ) led to its decrease . complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> exhibited very high activities , but 13-15 showed much lower activities due to the bulky steric effect . the molecular structure of <nUm> has been determined by x-ray diffraction . the relationship between structures of catalysts and catalytic activities were discussed . 
the behavior of two differently prepared methylaluminoxanes ( MAOs ) on the activation process of racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 for olefin polymerization was studied . contrarily to commercial product , the two MAOs used are characterized by a low content of free trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) . MAO-A was prepared by pumping off the TMA contained in commercial MAO , whereas MAO-B was obtained by thermal treatment of TMA with benzophenone . the different elementary steps in the zirconocene activation process depending on the amount and nature of added MAO ( commercial and modified ones ) were investigated by UV / visible spectroscopy . In all cases , monomethylation of racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 rapidly takes place after addition of small amounts of MAO . then , abstraction of the second chloride of the metallocene occurs upon addition of larger amounts of MAO ( Al / Zr < <nUm> ) leading to the formation of highly active catalytic species for hexene polymerization . this is characterized by a bathochromic shift of the zirconocene absorption band . the role of TMA is clearly pointed out by comparing the modified MAO / zirconocene systems with the one based on commercial MAO . the influence of structure and composition of MAO on the activation process is also clearly underlined by the very different amounts of activator needed to get metallocene active species in the presence of commercial and modified cocatalysts . 
A series of zirconocenes differing in the coordination sphere , namely (R)ZrCl2 ( r = (MeCp)2 , (i-BuCp)2 , (n-BuCp)2 , rac - Et(Ind)2 and rac - Et(IndH4)2 ) were immobilized on silica grace <nUm> pretreated at <nUm> K under vacuum . the highest metal loading , determined by rutherford 's backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy , was achieved with rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 . the steric effect played by the ligands on the cyclopentadienyl ring was seen to influence on the grafted content : less Zr was immobilized on silica using n-Bu as ligand , as compared to the zirconocene that uses me as ligand . nevertheless , this catalyst was the most active both in homogeneous and supported copolymerizations . copolymers were characterized with respect to their molecular weights , polydispersity ( mw / Mn ) , crystallinity , comonomer incorporation and melting temperature . 
mono , di and tetranuclear ansa zirconocene complexes have been synthesized and characterized . after activation with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) these catalysts were used for the homogeneous and heterogeneous polymerization of ethylene . the properties of the catalysts and the produced polymers were compared . the multinuclear catalysts show a different performance than the corresponding mononuclear derivatives . the tetranuclear catalysts have the lowest activities because of steric crowding . 
five new hetero - bimetallic metallocene complexes were synthesized by the reaction of RCpTiCl3 and a Si - bridged zirconocene complex in refluxing toluene . they were all well characterized . these complexes activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) are highly active catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene . the molecular weight ( mw = 28,957-124,089 ) and the molecular weight distribution ( MWD = <nUm> - <nUm> ) of the polymer generated from the bimetallic catalytic system were higher than that obtained by Cp2ZrCl2 . 
A theoretical study of Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO system is presented based on density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations performed with gaussian basis - sets . the MAO cocatalyst was modeled as a small finite section of the most probably species in solution . the geometry of the cation - counterion forming the ionic - pair active site was fully optimized and its electronic structure was examined in terms of the natural bond orbital ( NBO ) population analysis . In this way the ionic - pair interaction can be related to the electronic charge changes around the zirconium cation . the results indicate the formation of a stable ionic - pair and the redistribution of charge in the cation complex and counterion . the latter was concluded by mapping the charge density difference . the laplacian of charge density confirm the ionic interaction of the metallocene / MAO system . 
A newly synthesized catalyst , a pentamethylene bridged dinuclear zirconocene [ CH2 (C5H4)2][(C9H7)ZrCl 2]2 ) , and its in situ supported catalyst were tested in a ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization and their performance was compared with those of Cp2ZrCl2 and rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 . when homogeneous [ CH2 (C5H4)2][(C9H7)ZrCl 2]2 catalyst was used in the copolymerization , its activity decreased with comonomer incorporation ( a negative comonomer effect ) and it produced copolymer with a lower comonomer content than other catalysts , both of which were ascribed to the steric effect of the [ CH2 (C5H4)2][(C9H7)ZrCl 2]2 catalyst . with in situ supported catalysts , the activity did not change much with the increase of 1-hexene content in contrast to the homogeneous catalysts . In situ supported catalysts produced copolymers with higher content of 1-hexene and lower melting point and crystallinity . the changes in the molecular weight and its distribution of the copolymer with in situ supporting were significant and dependant on the nature of the catalyst . 
A series of <nUm> dissymmetric dinuclear ansa zirconocene complexes and their ligand precursors have been synthesized and characterized . after activation with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , these catalysts polymerize ethylene with different productivities and polydispersities in homogeneous and heterogeneous media . the tendencies of these series are shown . 
In the present work Et(IndH4)2ZrCl2 was immobilized on silica previously modified with different chemical compounds , namely Cl3OV , Cl4Sn , Bu3SnH , Me2SiHCl , polymethylhydrosiloxane ( PMHS ) and such systems were compared to methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) pretreated systems . Bu3SnH - modified silica led to the highest zirconocene grafted content . Zr 3d5 / <nUm> binding energy determined by x-ray spectroscopy ( XPS ) was shown to increase for Et(IndH4)2ZrCl2 supported on silica modified with Cl3OV , MAO and Bu3SnH , suggesting the generation of more electron deficient surface species . all systems were shown to be active in ethylene-propylene copolymerization , presenting higher activity than those prepared by grafting the zirconocene on bare silica . aging test with MAO - mediated systems showed that the catalyst bearing <nUm> wt. % Al / O2Si kept its catalyst activity at least for <nUm> months after preparation . 
the homopolymerization of ethylene was investigated using the catalysts of (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 supported on PMHS - modified silicas ( PMHS = polymethylhydrosiloxane ) . the effect of the amount of the organosilane polymer on the metallocene grafted content was studied in loadings of PMHS from <nUm> to <nUm> wt. % Si / O2Si , in which the grafted Zr content was from <nUm> to <nUm> wt. % Si / O2Si . the metal contents were determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) , while the catalyst stepwise preparation was monitored by diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy ( DRIFTS ) . the chemical environment of the zirconocene surface species were further probed by x-ray spectroscopy ( XPS ) and the metal distribution was studied by electron probe microanalysis ( EPMA ) . these catalyst systems produced polyethylenes with a narrow molecular weight distribution using methylaluminoxane as co-catalyst , and their catalyst activities were three times greater than the one obtained with (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 supported on the bare O2Si . effects of the support structure and the chemical modification on the catalyst performance are presented and discussed . 
A series of supported catalysts were prepared by combining ( nBuCp ) 2ZrCl2 and Cp2ZrCl2 sequentially grafted on silica in different ratio ( <nUm> : <nUm> and <nUm> : <nUm> ) and immobilization order . catalyst systems were characterized by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) , diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy ( DRIFTS ) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and electron probe microanalysis ( EPMA ) . grafted metal content remained comprised between <nUm> and <nUm> wt. % Zr / OSi <nUm> . all the systems were shown to be active in ethylene homopolymerization having methylaluminoxane as co-catalyst . catalyst activity was shown to be dependent on the metallocene nature , but not on the addition order or molar ratio . the highest activity was achieved with cp 2ZrCl2 / (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 ( <nUm> : <nUm> ) catalyst system ( ca. <nUm> kg PE ( mmol zrh)-1 ) . resulting polymers were characterized by GPC and DSC . In spite of bearing two catalyst centers , no bimodality was observed in the resulting polymers . 
the stereotacticities of a series of polypropylene polymer chains produced with different categories of structurally characterized ansa- zirconocene and hafnocene procatalysts in homogeneous catalysis have been determined by statistical analyses of the methyl pentad signal intensity distributions of their 13C NMR spectra . the polymers microstructural characteristics have been contrasted with the intramolecular parameters of the discrete metallocene molecules obtained from single crystal x-ray diffractions and different 1H NMR measurements . for the first category , by contrasting the polymerization behavior of zirconocene - hafnocene pairs the origin of the stereospecificity differences have been discussed in terms of heavy atom electron configuration , lanthanoid shell contraction and relativistic effects operative on elements belonging to the sixth row of the periodic table . for the second category the observed changes in polymerization behavior for a pair of zirconocene based catalysts with ligand modification of irrelevant steric control have been correlated to the electron density redistribution on different aromatic carbons and the consequent change in flexibility of the catalyst framework , increase of the haptocity of M-C5 bonding and variation of the frontier orbital shape and diffusivity . for the third category , pairs of syndio- and isotactic specific ansa - zirconocene and hafnocenes have been selected in which the organic ligands are constructed with the same aromatic moieties joined with different bridges . the observed catalytic changes have been correlated to combined steric and electronic factors altering orbital energies and hybridizations . finally , by introducing a fourth category , the Hf effect is demonstrated by comparing the catalytic olefin activities of two non-bridged hafnocene- zirconocene pairs . 
ethylene , propylene and 1-butene polymerization kinetics have been investigated in the presence of <nUm> zirconocene and ethylalumoxane derivatives with various molecular masses and a molar ratio of Al / Zr = 23-26 . it was found that zirconocene activity in combination with ethylalumoxanes with molecular weight MW = <nUm> ( an oligomer with -[OAl(C2H5)]- unit number equal to <nUm> ) increases in series : Cp(Acac)2ZrCl < (Fulv)2Cp,Zr,Cl2 < Cp,ZrMe2 < (Fulv)2Cp2Zr2(O)Cl2 < (Ind)2ZrCl2 < (t-Bu2Cp)2ZrCl2 < Cp2ZrCl2 < (t-BuCp)2ZrCl2 < (MeCp)2ZrCl2 < (i-PrCp)2ZrCl2 , where fulv - fulvalene . with methylalumoxane ( MW = <nUm> , ( -[OAl(CH3)]- unit number <nUm> ) the following series of zirconocene activity was established : (MeCp)2ZrCl2 < (EtCp)2ZrCl2 < (PrCp)2ZrCl2 < ( BuCp2ZrCl2 < (i-PrCp)2ZrCl2 < ( cyclo- HexCp)2ZrCl2 . 
all - electron RHF and RMP2 ab initio calculations with split valence basis sets of double- and triple-z quality have been used to study reaction paths for the reaction of acetylene ( 1 ) with the model compounds Cl2ZrH+ ( 2 ) and CCl2H3Zr / + ( 3 ) . At the RMP2 / / RHF level the acetylide - complex formation reaction is calculated to have a barrier of <nUm> ( 2 ) , <nUm> ( 3 ) kcal / mol with respect to complexed acetylene and to be <nUm> ( 2 ) , <nUm> ( 3 ) kcal / mol exothermic with respect to free acetylene . the transition states are four - membered cycles . the calculated energy barriers are greater than the theoretical values obtained for s-bond metathesis of acetylene with Cl2ScR and Cp2ScR ( r = H , CH3 ) . the calculated energetics of the metathesis reaction path are compared with the theoretical values determined for the alternative insertion reaction of acetylene into Zr-H and Zr-C σ bonds . the insertion reactions are kinetically and thermodynamically favoured over the corresponding metathesis reactions . 
the copolymerization of ethylene and 1,5-hexadiene was investigated under high pressure of <nUm> bar using a zirconocene catalyst in the presence of methylaluminoxane . the concentration of the diene was varied over a wide range including the homopolymerization of both ethylene and 1,5-hexadiene . from the amount of polymer formed per unit of time and the catalyst feed the productivity was determined . the resulting polymers were analyzed by DSC , GPC , IR- and 13C-NMR-spectroscopy to evaluate the average molecular weights together with the polydispersity , the crystallinity , the melting point and the structure . the catalyst exhibits a good ability for copolymerization and cyclopolymerization of 1,5-hexadiene in which a predominance of trans ring formation was observed . 
the isoselective propene polymerization using the homogeneous Me2Si(Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst system was investigated . the influence of the concentrations of metallocene and MAO activator on polymerization kinetics and microstructure of the resulting polymer was studied . catalyst activity was found to be independent of zirconocene concentration and only a function of total MAO concentration . polypropene microstructure was not affected by either MAO or zirconocene concentration . the polymerization behavior is compared to that of Me2Si(2-Me Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO . A model is presented to account for the equilibria present in the polymerization medium . this model takes into account the interactions between metallocene cation and excess MAO , thus explaining the influence of MAO concentration on catalyst activity in propene polymerization . 
A modified extended huckel method ( EHMO ) , which includes core - core repulsion terms , was used to study a propylene polymerization heterogeneous catalyst by modeling the adsorption of the ansa - metallocene ethylen-bisindenylzirconium dichloride ( C20Cl2H17Zr from now on EtInd2ZrCl2 ) on O2Si surfaces . the adsorption was considered to occur at two faces of O2Si ( with geminal and isolated OH 's ) and at two different temperatures for O2Si pretreatment ( <nUm> and <nUm> ° C ) . taking into account that the interaction with Al compounds is considered as a way to improve the catalyst performance , specially with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , a local model of aluminoxane ( AlO ) was added to Si-O bond with the subsequent metallocene adsorption . the results show that AlO improves the zirconocene adsorption on O2Si modeled at <nUm> ° C while it inhibits that process at <nUm> ° C . 
the c(s)- and c(2v)-symmetric doubly dimethylsilylene-bridged zirconocene complexes (Me2Si)2{e5-C5H2-4-CHMe2{e5C5H-3,5-(SiMe3)2}ZrCl2 , 6a , and (Me2Si)2{e5C5H-3,5-(CHMe2)2)2ZrCl2 , 6b , have been synthesized by reaction of corresponding dilithio ligand salts with Cl4Zr in CCl2H2 . when activated with methyl aluminoxane , C ( s ) - symmetric zirconocene 6a catalyzes the polymerization of propylene ( liquid propylene , <nUm> ° C ) to yield a syndiotactic polymer of mw = <nUm> and rrrr % = <nUm> . by contrast , c(2v)-symmetric zirconocene 6b displays a low activity and affords an atactic polymer . 
displacement of the anion H3C-B(C6F5)3 from the zirconocene contact - ion pair [ (C5H5)2Zr(CH3)+ *** (m-H3C)-B(C6F5)3- ] by a series of phosphines and formation of a bisphosphine complex by uptake of a second phosphine ligand have been studied by NMR methods in C6D6 solutions . evidence is presented that associated , outer - sphere ion pairs [(C5H5)2Zr(CH3)(PR3)]+ H3C-B(C6F5)3- predominate at zirconocene concentrations up to ca. <nUm> mM ; higher aggregates become apparent at higher zirconocene concentrations . equilibrium constants for the formation of mono- and bis-PMe3 complexes have been determined ; the latter are found to be highly sensitive to steric perturbations . these data , together with density - functional estimates for reaction enthalpies , lead to the following qualitative conclusions with regard to olefin coordination in zirconocene - based polymerization catalysts : ( i ) the olefin substrate displaces the borate anion only from a small equilibrium fraction of the zirconocene alkyl cations present ; ( ii ) the predominant fraction of the resulting zirconocene alkyl olefin cation remains in an outer - sphere association with the counteranion ; ( iii ) mutual displacement of olefin and counteranion from the Zr center is slow compared to typical olefin insertions ; ( iv ) uptake of a second olefin under formation of a cationic zirconocene alkyl diolefin complex is rather unlikely even at elevated olefin concentrations . 
the ( conjugated diene ) group <nUm> metallocenes la-d ( diene - butadiene , isoprene ; metallocene = CP2Zr , Cp2Hf , MeCp2Zr ) add BC18F15 to yield the metallacyclic m *** F-C bridged metallocene-borate-betaine complexes 3a-d . these add one equivalent of acetylene to give the chiral metallacyclic insertion products 5a-d that can be described as either intramolecular ion - pair type complexes involving interaction of the negatively polarized terminal -CH = CH-CH2-[B] group of the resulting s-ligand system with the positively polarized metallocene moiety of the dipolar betaine product or r2-internal alkene metallocene complexes , respectively , as it is revealed by a comparison with the related acyclic THF - addition products <nUm> and <nUm> . propyne inserts unselectively into the terminal Zr-C bond of the complexes 3a-c . In each case a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of the regioisomers 6a-c ( methyl at C2 ) and 7a-c ( methyl group at Cl ) is obtained . 
the behavior of (C2B9H11)M(NEt2)2(NHEt2) [ m = Ti ( 1 ) , Zr ( 2 ) ] mono-dicarbollide complexes in olefin and styrene polymerisation has been investigated . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> , when activated by MAO ( Al / m = <nUm> to <nUm> ) , polymerise ethylene with good activity . surprisingly , <nUm> can also be activated with small amounts of triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA , Al / Zr = <nUm> to <nUm> ) . the ethylene polymerisation activity of the <nUm> / TIBA catalyst ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> atm , toluene-chlorobenzene ) is greater than that reported for the CpZrX3 / MAO catalysts but lower by about one or two orders of magnitude than zirconocene - MAO systems ( e.g. Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO , rac-(ethylene-bis-l-idenyl)ZrCl2 / MAO ) . the GPC ( gel permeation chromatography ) curve of the polyethylene sample obtained with <nUm> / TIBA catalyst ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> atm , toluene-chlorobenzene ) is bimodal indicating that at least two species are active in this system and one is more active than the other . the <nUm> / MAO system ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> atm , toluene-chlorobenzene ) slowly polymerises propylene to atactic polymer . under the same experimental conditions 1-pentene does not polymerise at all . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> , activated with MAO , produce syndiotactic polystyrene ( sPS ) with very low activity . attempts to copolymerise styrene with ethylene by the <nUm> / MAO and <nUm> / MAO systems afforded a mixture of the two homopolymers . 
ethene / 1-octene and ethene / 1-butene copolymerization using various methylaluminoxane - activated metallocene catalysts , e.g. silylene-bridged substituted bisindenyl zirconocene systems and halfsandwich titanocene , was performed at <nUm> ° C in toluene . the influence of the ligand substitution on comonomer incorporation , catalyst activity , molar mass , molar mass distribution , degree of polymerization and copolymerization parameters was investigated in ethene / 1-octene copolymerization at constant comonomer ratio and in ethene / l-butene copolymerization as a function of varying ethene / 1-butene feed mass ratios . In ethene / 1-octene copolymerization the highest comonomer incorporation was achieved with MAO - activated Me2Si(Me4Cp)(N-tert-butyl)TiCl2 catalyst . best performance in terms of comohomer incorporation combined with high catalyst activity and molar mass was found for silylene-bridged bisindenylzirconocenes , where 2-methyl substitution promoted high degree of polymerization and benzannelation accounted for improved catalyst activity , comohomer incorporation and randomness of comonomer incorporation . In ethene / 1-butene copolymerization at high 1-butene feed content silylene-bridged substituted bisindenyl systems showed polymerization characteristics similar to that of ethene / 1-octene copolymerization . the influence of 2-methyl substitution on activity and comohomer incorporation was significant only at low 1-butene feed content . storage tooduli and glass transition temperature of the poly(ethene-co-l-butene) copolymers decreased with increasing 1-butene content . 
A novel dinuclear ansa - zirconocene catalyst ( m-C12H8{[SiPh(Ind)2]ZrCl2}2 ) ( I ) was prepared by a wurtz coupling reaction between two equivalent of bisindenylphenylchlorosilane and one equivalent of 4,4'-dibromobiphenyl in THF at reflux temperature for <nUm> h , followed by a successive reaction with Cl4Zr · 2THF in THF at <nUm> ° C . polymerization of ethene was conducted in a <nUm> cm3 glass reactor equipped with a stirrer at <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> ° C using MAO or Ph3C[B(C6F5)4] as cocatalyst and toluene as the solvent . the catalyst ( I ) gave linear polyethene with a broader molecular mass distribution ( MMD ) in a much higher yield as compared to the corresponding mononuclear catalyst derived from [Ph2Si(Ind)2]ZrC12 ( II ) . the apparent activity increased monotonously from <nUm> ° C up to <nUm> ° C . the replacement of MAO with Ph3C[B(C6F5)4] gave polyethene with a higher molecular weight . 
four newly synthesized bridged bisindenyl zirconocenes which are derivatives of known structures have been tested in polymerizations of liquid propylene with methylaluminoxane as cocatalyst . they include two asymmetric and two binuclear systems which are suitable for isotactic polymerization . surprising differences from the behavior of similar systems ( regiospecificity , chain termination ) are found and discussed . 
the polymerization of propylene was studied with a series of dinuclear early transition metal zirconocene - late transition metal complexes bridged by phosphido and arsenido moieties of general formula [(e5-C5H4R'')2Zr{m-ERR'}2M(CO)(n)] ( e = P , r = r ' = SiMe3 , r '' = H , m = Mo , n = <nUm> ( 1 ) ; e = P , r = r ' = SiMe3 , r '' = H , m = Ni , n = <nUm> ( 2 ) ; e = As , r = r ' = SiMe3 , r '' = H , m = Cr , n = <nUm> ( 3 ) ; e = P , r = H , r ' = 2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2 , r '' = me , m = Mo , n = <nUm> ( 4 ) ; e = P , r = H , r ' = 2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2 , r '' = me , m = Cr , n = <nUm> ( 5 ) ) , as well as with the corresponding monometallic zirconocene precursor complexes of the type [(e5-C5H4R'')2Zr(ERR')2] ( e = P , r = r ' = SiMe3 , r '' = H ( 6 ) ; e = P , r = H , r ' = 2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2 , r '' = H ( 7 ) ) and [(e5-C5H4Me)2Zr(ERR')Cl] ( e = P , r = H , r ' = 2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2 ( 8 ) ) . the active cationic species were generated treating the complexes with an excess of methylalumoxane ( MAO ) . the catalytic activity was found to be strongly dependent on temperature and catalyst / MAO ratio . 
supported catalysts for ethylene polymerization have been prepared by interaction of CP2ZrX2 ( cp = e5-C5H5 , x = Cl or CH3 ) with silica chemically modified by C3ClH9Si ( TMCS ) or trialkylaluminium compounds AlR3 ( r = C2H5 ( TEA ) and (i)C4H9 ( TIBA ) ) . the interactions between the modificators and the silica surface have been examined by 1H solid - state MAS NMR spectroscopy , DRIFTS and chemical analysis . the Cp2Zr(CH3)2 / O2Si - TMCS catalyst showed a fairly high activity in ethylene polymerization ( 30-300 kg PE(mol zr*h*bar)-1 ) even in the absence of any cocatalysts specially added . the addition of the cocatalyst ( MAO or TIBA ) led to a further increase in the activity of the supported catalysts . polyethylene obtained with the C3H6P2Zr / O2Si - TMCS catalyst without any cocatalyst consisted of uniform polymer particles of a spherical shape replicating that of the silica particles , whereas the shapeless aggregates of finely dispersed polymer particles similar to those usually obtained with homogeneous systems were produced with the same supported catalyst in the presence of the MAO cocatalyst . 
A series of heterogeneous catalyst systems was prepared by the immobilization of bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride , (nBuCP)2ZrCl2 , on silica supports activated at different temperatures . silica dehydroxylation was evaluated in terms of retained metal loading and activity in ethylene homopolymerization . characterization of the catalyst systems was accomplished by rutherford back - scattering spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy . the highest metal loading ( <nUm> wt. % Zr / O2Si ) was achieved with silica treated under vacuum at room temperature ( <nUm> K ) , but the catalyst showed only a minor polymerization activity which may be attributed to a large number of inactive Zr - support bidentate species formed at a high surface density of OH in silica . IR spectroscopic data show that , regardless of support activation temperature , a significant number of isolated OH groups remains after zirconocene fixation . the presence of bulky ligands in the catalyst molecule seems to prevent the remaining OH groups from reacting with additional metallocene complexes , keeping the metal loading around <nUm> wt. % Zr / O2Si for silica activated between <nUm> and <nUm> K . high polymerization activity observed for the system based on <nUm> K - activated silica suggests a role for these OH groups in the generation of active alkylated species when methylaluminoxane and trimethylaluminum ( contained in MAO itself ) are added at the beginning of the polymerization reaction . IR analysis shows that TMA , which is a less sterically demanding compound than MAO , can effectively access the remaining OH groups consuming them thoroughly . practically all the prepared systems presented activity in ethylene polymerization with MAO as cocatalyst , the highest activity ( <nUm> x <nUm> PEg mol-1 Zr h-1 ) having been obtained with silica dehydroxylated at <nUm> K . 
IR spectroscopy has been used to study the interaction of silica with two methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) samples differed by trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) content and with TMA . MAO and TMA have been shown to react with silica in a different way . whereas TMA interacts with terminal hydroxyl groups of silica via the prototysis reaction , MAO mainly adsorbs on the surface hydroxyl groups of silica without noticeable protolytical reaction with them . when silica is treated with commercial grade MAO with significant TMA content , the silica surface hydroxyl groups mainly interacts with TMA and MAO adsorbs on the surface of O2Si / TMA sample . lewis acidic sites ( LAS ) of silica , modified with TMA and MAO samples differed by TMA content , have been investigated by IR spectroscopy ( CO adsorption as probe molecule at <nUm> K ) . two types of LAS were found on the surface of silica modified with MAO and TMA : LAS of moderate strength ( v(CO) = 2204-2212 cm-1 ) and weak LAS ( v(CO) = <nUm> cm- <nUm> ) . the concentration of these acidic sites was estimated . by anchoring of Cp2ZrCl2 on silica , modified with TMA and MAO , the corresponding catalysts O2Si / TMA / Cp2ZrCl2 and O2Si / MAO / Cp2ZrCl2 were prepared and tested at ethylene polymerization . some correlations between the amount and strength of surface LAS of supports , catalysts composition and their activity are discussed . it is proposed that the surface active species are formed at zirconocene interaction with the most strong LAS . 
the system EtInd2ZrCH+ / <nUm> is parallel with SiO(*) / <nUm> MAO- was studied theoretically by means of an extended huckel method ( EHMO ) for the propylene adsorption . the adsorption of the different forms of olefins was evaluated on the active site formed by metallocene and silica , in presence or not of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . In this way , it is possible to appreciate the important function of MAO when the active site is modeled considering all components . according to these results the presence of MAO avoids the adsorption of some forms of propylene . 
metallocene complexes of group <nUm> metals are playing an increasingly important role in olefin polymerisation catalysis . this contribution surveys several aspects of the chemistry of metallocene catalysts that are being pursued in our laboratory at present , namely the application of half - sandwich complexes as catalysts for high - molecular weight elastomeric polypropene , unusual C-H activation reactions of zirconium half - sandwich complexes , the development of 14-electron borole complexes as neutral analogues of cationic [Cp2ZrR]+ catalysts , and the heterogenisation of MAO - free zirconocene catalysts on borate - functionalised silica . 
A new mechanism is proposed to explain the occurrence of primary- growing-chain-end epimerization , and the structure and frequency of olefinic end groups arising from primary b-hydride transfer , in low molecular weight isotactic polypropylenes produced with C2 - symmetric zirconocenes . this mechanism , based on the reversible formation of a zirconocene allyl dihydrogen complex , accounts for both loss of catalyst stereospecificity and decrease of polypropylene molecular weights observed by lowering [propylene] , and accommodates a number of previous and new experimental observations . inter alia : ( i ) the formation of internal vinylidene unsaturations ; ( ii ) the increase of catalyst activity induced by H addition ; ( iii ) the observed deuterium scrambling in the [1-D]propylene and [2-D]propylene polymerizations recently reported by brintzinger . this new mechanism is discussed in the light of the polymerization results from two MAO - activated catalysts : rac- C2H4(Ind)2ZrCl2 and the novel , highly regiospecific rac-Me2C(3-t-Bu- Ind)2ZrCl2 . 
ethylene polymerization was conducted with bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) and racdimethylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 2 ) combined with trialkylaluminum ( AlR3 ; r = methyl ( me ) , ethyl ( et ) , isobutyl ( iBu ) ) / triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( Ph3CB(C6F5)4 ) or tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane ( BC18F15 ) to study the effect of cocatalysts on polymerization rate ( r(p) ) . when AlMe3 was used , no activity or very low activity was observed with both zirconocenes regardless of the borane compounds used . the replacement of AlMe3 to AlEt3 or AliBu3 with 1-AlR3 / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 caused polymerization and induction time was observed to reach the maximum r(p) . especially in the case of using AlEt3 , it took about <nUm> min to show the activity . when BC18F15 was used , AlEt3 was not effective but AliBu3 gave the highest activity among all the combinations of AlR3 and the borane compounds . In the case of polymerization with <nUm> using Ph3CB(C6F5)4 , high activity was observed with both AlEt3 and AliBu3 without any induction period . when BC18F15 was used instead of Ph3CB(C6F5)4 , very low activity was observed with AlEt3 . on the other hand , high activity was observed with AliBu3 , and the maximum r(p) was found at the beginning of the polymerization . the effect of AlR3 on the formation of active species was discussed based on these results . 
A novel class of heterogeneous ethylene polymerization catalysts , derived from homogeneous metallacyclic zirconocene complexes is described . these complexes can be activated with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) and used for ethylene polymerization . the polymerization reaction begins homogeneously , but the homogeneous metallacycles self - immobilize during the polymerization process . subsequent olefin polymerization is therefore heterogeneously catalyzed . this method of heterogeneous olefin polymerization is compared with a homogeneous and an alternate heterogeneous polymerization technique .

the metallocene (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 was grafted on partially dehydroxilated commercial silica ( grace <nUm> ) whose surface had been chemically modified by wet impregnation of an organosilane ( Ph3SiCl , Me3SiCl , or Me2SiHCl ) aiming at supported catalyst systems with well spaced a-olefin polymerization active centers . final Zr loadings were determined by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( RBS ) , and modifications at the silica surface after each preparation step were monitored by in situ FT-IR spectroscopy . these catalyst systems produced polyethylenes with narrow molecular weight distribution when methylaluminoxane was used as cocatalyst , with twice the activity of (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 supported on bare O2Si . effects of support structure and chemical modification on catalyst performance are presented and discussed .

the kinetics of methane liberation during polymethylalumoxane ( MAO ) interaction with zirconocenes Cp2ZrCl2 , Ind2ZrCl2 , Me2SiCp2ZrX2 , Me2SiInd2ZrX2 , and Me2SiCp*N'BuZrX2 ( x = Cl , me ) , were studied in a wide range of metallocene concentration ( <nUm> x 10-3-1 x 10-5 mol / l ) and Al / Zr ratio ( 100-24 <nUm> ) at the narrow range of MAO concentrations ( <nUm> - <nUm> mol / l ) . the reaction of methane liberation follows apparent first order on zirconium . the total methane yield is suggested to be determined by active aluminum species present in MAO , so that [CH4](proportional to ) being ~ <nUm> [Al] both in reactions of MAO self - condensation and those catalyzed by dissolved zirconocenes . comparison of the kinetic parameters of the reaction derived in the presence of zirconocenes shows considerable increase in both specific initial rates of methane liberation and the specific methane yield ( per mole of zirconium ) at metallocene concentration lower than <nUm> x 10-4 mol / l . multiple regeneration of metal-carbon ( M-C ) bonds was revealed . according to the data of analysis of the effect in terms of dissociative equilibrium , the active species that catalyze the reaction of condensation of MAO are cationic particles . it has been demonstrated that the kinetic parameters of the reaction were also sensitive to the nature of zirconocene .

1-Butene was selectively dimerised with a high yield to 2-ethyl-1-hexene using a zirconocene / MAO catalyst . 2-Ethyl-1-hexene was further etherified with methanol to a novel tertiary ether compound , 3-methoxy-3-methyl heptane . ( C ) <nUm> elsevier science B.V. 
the reaction of a-zirconated phosphorus compounds <nUm> and <nUm> with methyl propiolate or dimethylacetylene dicarboxylate gives rise to stable zwitterionic zirconocene - ate complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> in which the zirconium atom is linked exclusively to carbon atoms . 
dialkylzirconocenes react with molybdenum or tungsten hexacarbonyl and iodine or NBS to form cyclopentadiene molybdenum or tungsten tricarbonyl iodine or bromide . 
the synthesis , characterization and x-ray structures of two zirconium complexes of the bulky pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl ligand , cp PRO , are reported . the monocyclopentadienyl <nUm> electron complex , cp PRO ClZr <nUm> ( I ) , has an unusual monomeric structure in the solid state and has short Zr - ligand distances . the lewis acidity of this complex is manifested in its ability to catalyze the [4+2] cycloadditions of methyl- and ethylmethacrylate to cyclopentadiene . the sandwich complex , cp PRO CpZrCl <nUm> ( II ) , has more typical Zr - ligand distances , but has a more parallel arrangement of the two cyclopentadienyl rings . 
two new C1 - symmetric zirconocenes of the type [ me 2C(3-RCp)(Flu)]ZrCl2 bearing a phenyl ( ph ) or a cyclohexyl ( cHex ) substituent on the cyclopentadienyl ring were synthesized . copolymerizations of ethene and styrene were carried out using these catalysts and compared to the results obtained with the methyl- and tertbutyl-substituted as well as with the unsubstituted system . by the introduction of the phenyl substituent both the activities and the molar masses could be increased whilst the styrene incorporation was comparable to that achieved with the unsubstituted system . In the case of the alkyl substituted systems ( r = me , tertBu , cHex ) the styrene incorporation is decreased drastically and molar masses and activities are also strongly effected . 
the effects of support calcination temperature , an important catalyst synthesis parameter , on the overall performance of the supported catalyst [ silica ES70 - nBuSnCl3 / MAO / (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 ] , polymerizing ethylene without separately feeding the MAO cocatalyst , were studied . the silica was calcined at <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> ° C for <nUm> h. nBuSnCl3 was used to functionalize the silica . ethylene was polymerized using the synthesized catalysts at <nUm> bar ( g ) in hexane for <nUm> h . No reactor fouling was observed . free - flowing polymer particles with bulk density ( <nUm> - <nUm> g / ml ) and a fairly spherical morphology similar to that of the catalyst particles were obtained . also , the particle size distribution of the polymer resembled that of the catalyst . therefore , the replication phenomenon from catalyst to polymer took place . the narrow PSD span ( 1.41 ) indicates that the resulting polyethylenes are suitable for various mixing - intensive polymer applications . the MAO cocatalyst - free ethylene polymerization instantaneously formed a polymer film around the catalyst particle , which coated / immobilized the catalyst constituents ; this is how leaching was in situ prevented which favored heterogeneous catalysis to occur . the catalysts showed fairly stable polymerization kinetics . the catalyst activity , as a function of the silica calcination temperature , varied as follows : <nUm> ° C > <nUm> ° C > <nUm> ° C > <nUm> ° C . this finding has been explained considering the relevant surface chemistry phenomena . the calcination temperature did not significantly affect the bulk density and the PDI ( <nUm> ≤ PDI ≤ <nUm> ) of the resulting polyethylenes . the low PDI substantiates the retention of single - site catalytic behavior of the experimental supported catalysts . 
four dinuclear alkylidene-bridged zirconocene complexes were synthesized applying hydrozirconation reaction of a,o-dienes with the " schwartz ' reagent " and tested for the polymerization of ethylene . the polyethylenes obtained with alkylidene-bridged dinuclear complexes showed higher molecular weights mw and polydispersities revealing that more catalytically active species exist in the polymerization system . 
silica gels modified by MgO , HLiO , and HNaO , i.e. , O2Si / MgO , O2Si / HLiO , O2Si / HNaO , respectively , were examined as solid supports in the ethylene and propylene polymerization reactions using dimethylsilylene-bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( SHIZ ) as the catalyst and i-Bu3Al as the co-catalyst . all three were found to be equally effective for the former reaction , whereas activity was discrete for the latter reaction , with the order being O2Si / MgO > O2Si / HLiO > O2Si / HNaO . for the O2Si / MgO combination which showed the highest performance , BET and STEM studies indicated that Mg was evenly distributed in the silica gel . acid - base measurements of all three solids indicated that O2Si / MgO had strongly acidic sites whereas the other two did not , and in addition , O2Si / HNaO had strongly basic sites whereas the remaining two had only weakly basic spots . these results suggested that the presence of weakly nucleophilic anionic sites is essential for high reactivity and that strongly acidic sites enhance the reactivity . 
the immobilization of Cp2ZrCl2 was performed by entrapment within the binary oxide O2Si - O3W using a non-hydrolytic sol - gel route . the catalyst and oxide matrix were characterized by complementary techniques ( rutherford backscattering spectrometry , ultraviolet - visible diffuse reflectance and infrared transmission spectroscopy , differential pulse voltammetry , adsorption - desorption of N , and x-ray diffraction ) . the catalyst performance in terms of catalytic activity and polymer properties was evaluated by ethylene polymerization . catalyst characterization suggested that the entrapped complex exhibited lower Zr electronic density than the corresponding unsupported metallocene . the polymerization results also revealed that this low Zr electronic density is optimized in terms of complex activation with low MAO concentration ( low [ Al / Zr ] ratio ) and reactivity . this fine tuning results in a catalyst system that is active with a low [ Al / Zr ] ratio and that achieves high catalytic activity . the results demonstrate that the entrapping method allows the generation of a catalyst system in which part of the activation process is attributed to the support . In this sense , the support may partially play MAO functions by stabilizing the active catalytic species . 
catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene , which contain rac-Me 2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( BCl2ISZr ) bound to methylalumoxane - pretreated O2Si supports ( O2Si / MAO / BCl2ISZr ) , were studied with respect to leaching of zirconocene and MAO into heptane solutions caused by triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) . the latter is found to solubilize surface - bound MAO and zirconocene components , such that the Al content in the solid catalysts is reduced by 15-40 wt % and their Zr content by 50-60 wt % . consequently , ethylene polymerization with such TIBA - containing catalyst systems occurs both on the surface of the solid catalyst and in the solution phase . polymerization in solution is favored by high MAO contents in the O2Si carrier . polymerization in solution leads to polyethylene ( PE ) products with lower molecular masses than polymerization on the support surface ; this is the main cause of formation of PE with bimodal molecular mass distribution when ethylene is polymerized with O2Si / MAO / BClISZr <nUm> catalysts co-activated by TIBA . it is proposed that the co-activator TIBA interacts with surface - bound MAO to modify MAO in such a manner that it becomes soluble in aliphatic hydrocarbons and capable of solubilizing some active zirconocene component . 






A new scaffold consisting of a carbocycle and a substituted imidazoline in an orthogonal arrangement was synthesized as a potential specific inhibitor of glycosidases . the spirobicycloimidazoline , (5R,6R,7R,8R)-8-(hydroxymethyl)-2-phenyl-1,3-diazaspiro[4.4]non-1-ene-6,7-diol , was synthesized from methyl 2-O-p-methoxybenzyl-3,4-di-O-benzyl-a / b-d-gluco-6-enopyranoside via (1R,2S,3S,4R,5S)-3,4-bis(benzyloxy)-2-(4-methoxybenzyloxy)-5-vinyl-cyclopentanol . the ring contraction of the 6-enopyranoside in the presence of zirconocene equivalent ( ' cp <nUm> Zr ' ) reagent gave exclusively the corresponding cyclopentanol without cleavage of the PMB protecting group . In the course of the study , a new a-mannosidase inhibitor , (1R,2R,3R,5R)-5-amino-3-hydroxymethyl-cyclopentane-1,2-diol , was also discovered . 
calcosilicate ( CAS-1 ) was used for the first time as an effective carrier for simultaneous immobilization of a dual - functional catalytic system consisted of iron - based bis(imino) pyridyl complex ( O ) and zirconocene compound ( C ) to form heterogeneous catalyst precursor ( CAS - <nUm> / O / C ) . the a-olefins formed form O - catalyzed ethylene oligomerization copolymerized in situ with ethylene to linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) under the catalysis of C in CAS - <nUm> / O / C upon addition of cocatalysts as described hereafter . instead of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , triethylaluminum ( TEA ) was employed to activate the copolymerization reaction with high catalytic activities and smooth kinetic process . experimental results reflected that the selectivity for lower a-olefins was improved due to the confinement effect of the layered structures of CAS-1 , hence greatly increasing the incorporation rate of a-olefins into LLDPE main chains and the branching degree accordingly during the in situ copolymerization of a-olefins and ethylene . the layered structure of CAS-1 endowed the resultant LLDPE with improved thermal stability in addition to higher molecular weights ( Mn ) . 
the LLDPE / Al2O3 nanocomposites synthesized by the in situ polymerization with dried - modified methylaluminoxane ( d-MMAO ) / zirconocene catalyst were investigated . first , after vacuum heated the Al2O3 nanofiller , the d-MMAO as the cocatalyst was impregnated onto it . then , ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization was carried out with the presence of different amounts of d-MMAO / Al2O3 in a <nUm> mL semi-batch stainless steel autoclave reactor . after filtration , the obtained LLDPE nanocomposite was characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) / energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy ( EDX ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) . it was found that the polymerization activity strongly depended on the [Al]dMMAO / [Zr]cat ratios . the addition of Al2O3 nanofiller apparently resulted in increased melting temperature and molecular weight of LLDPE without any change in molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) . 
the bimodal MCM-41 - supported zirconocene / dMMAO catalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity for ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization compared to the unimodal one . the higher activity can be attributed to lesser support interaction . the copolymer having broader MWD was obtained with the bimodal support without any significant changes in MW and polymer microstructure as seen by 13C NMR . 
In this present study , the use of silica and zirconia as a support for zirconocene / MAO catalyst for copolymerization of ethylene / 1-olefin ( 1-hexene , 1-octene , and 1-decene ) was investigated . first , MAO as the cocatalyst was impregnated onto the support . then , copolymerization of ethylene / 1-olefin was performed . it was found that the use of zirconia support showed promising activities compared to those of the silica . increased activities can be attributed to higher amount of [Al]MAO present on the zirconia support coupled with strong interaction between the osupport - alcocatalyst linkage . In addition , the use of zirconia also resulted in higher degree of 1-olefin insertion and decreased Tm of copolymers produced . 
here , the copolymerization of ethylene / 1-octene with zirconocene / dMMAO catalyst using different pore sized silica - based supports was investigated . it revealed that the large pored silica [ O2Si ( LP ) ] exhibited the highest polymerization activity due to both highest amount of available active sites present along with the moderate interaction between dMMAO and the support . the strong interaction between dMMAO and the support as proven by TGA analysis apparently resulted in dramatically decreased polymerization activity for the bimodal pored silica - alumina [ Si-Al ( BP ) ] . the copolymers produced were further characterized by means of DSC and 13C NMR . although they exhibited the similar triad distribution , the degree of 1-octene insertion was different . 
air - stable zirconocene bis(perfluorooctanesulfonate)s [ Cp2Zr(OPf)2 , OPf = C8F17O3S ] showing high lewis acidity and high thermal stability was prepared by reacting Cp2ZrCl2 with AgOPf , and examined as a catalyst for acylation reactions . it was found that in the acetylation of various alcohols , phenols , thiols , and amines by equimolar of acetic anhydride , Cp2Zr(OPf)2 exhibits high activity and selectivity to desired products under mild and solvent - free conditions . In the acylation of 2-phenylethanol across various acylating reagents , it also shows good catalytic efficiency . In a test of ten cycles , Cp2Zr(OPf)2 shows little loss of activity . the results afford a general and efficient method for the acylation of alcohols , phenols , thiols , and amines using zirconium bis(perfluorooctanesulfonate) as catalyst . 
zirconocene bis(perfluorobutanesulfonate) [ Cp2Zr(OSO 2C4F9)2*2H2O ] was successfully synthesized by treatment of Cp2ZrCl2 with AgC4F9O3S , and was found to have the nature of air - stability , water tolerance , high thermal stability and strong lewis acidity . this complex showed high catalytic efficiency for the synthesis of a-aminophosphonates via kabachnik - fields reaction of aldehydes / ketones , amines and diethyl phosphite under mild and solvent - free conditions . furthermore , it can be reused without loss of activity in a test of five cycles . compared with our previously reported complex of Cp2Zr(OSO 2C8F17)2*3H 2O*THF , this complex showed better catalytic activity . 

the synthesis of Zr-SBA-15 materials from zirconocene dichloride as metal precursor has been investigated . these materials can be prepared with a high loading of zirconium while preserving good mesoscopic ordering . Zr-SBA-15 materials display acid properties which have revealed to confer high catalytic activity in the transesterification of crude palm oil with methanol for biodiesel synthesis , achieving yields to FAME over <nUm> % in a batch reactor under the following reaction conditions : <nUm> ° C , <nUm> h , methanol to oil molar ratio <nUm> : <nUm> and using <nUm> wt. % catalyst loading referred to oil . furthermore , Zr-SBA-15 materials display excellent stability in palm oil transesterification , being fully regenerated by calcination at <nUm> ° C after at least eight consecutive reaction runs . the incorporation of titanium , molybdenum and tungsten as doping metals produces slightly promotion of the acidity of Zr-SBA-15 materials , though this is not translated into higher catalytic activity . 
the efficient catalytic dehydropolymerization of phenylsilane by homogeneous zirconocene bissilanolates ( [ { ( c-C 5H <nUm> ) 7Si 8O 12O } 2Zr(e 5- C 5H <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 1a ) ; [ { ( c-C 5H <nUm> ) 7Si 8O 12O } 2Zr(e 5-C 5H 4Bu ) <nUm> ] ( 1b ) [ { ( c-C 5H <nUm> ) 7Si 7O <nUm> ( OSiMe 3)O 2}Zr(e 5-C 5H <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 4 ) ; [ { ( me 3CO ) 3SiO } 2Zr(e 5-C 5H <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 5 ) ) and chlorosilanolates ( [ { ( c-C 5H <nUm> ) 7Si 8O 12O}ZrCl(e 5-C 5H 4Bu ) <nUm> ] ( 2 ) ; ( [ { ( c-C 5H <nUm> ) 7Si 7O 9O 3}Zr 2Cl(e 5-C 5H <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 3a ) ; [ { ( c-C 5H <nUm> ) 7Si 7O 9O 3}Zr 2Cl(e 5-C 5H 4Bu ) <nUm> ] ( 3b ) ) has been demonstrated . the presence of at least one silanol ligand in the zirconocene moiety was found essential for high catalytic performance . solid state structure of complex 1a was determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . A series of nine zirconocene - siliceous catalysts were prepared by grafting of zirconocene moiety onto silica using three general methods : ( a ) reaction of [ ( η 5-C 5H <nUm> ) 2ZrCl <nUm> ] with silica in the presence of NEt <nUm> ; ( b ) reaction of [ ( η 5-C 5H <nUm> ) 2ZrMe <nUm> ] with silica ; ( c ) reaction of solely [ ( η 5-C 5H <nUm> ) 2ZrCl <nUm> ] with silica . supported catalysts were characterized by ICP-MS , FT-IR , TGA and selected examples by XPS analysis . those catalysts prepared by method ( a ) and ( b ) were found efficient in the phenylsilane polymerization although a higher Zr / monomer ratio had to be used in comparison with homogeneous analogues . the low concentration of residual silanol groups in supported catalysts was found essential for their high catalytic performance . advantageous reusability of supported catalysts was demonstrated using OSi <nUm> / cp 2ZrCl <nUm> / NEt 3(5.8) . the catalytic performance was retained in three consecutive cycles producing polymers with almost identical properties . 
the compelling advantages of synchrotron radiation ( SR ) in charge density studies of coordination complexes are described and illustrated with a number of recent synchrotron studies , ordered according to the atomic number of the metal atom involved ( Cr , Fe , Cu , Zr , Mo , Th ) . the review concludes with two studies of the Cu - containing extended solids Cu2O and the high - temperature superconducting phase Ba100Cu150O349Y50 , done with very high energy synchrotron radiation of about <nUm> keV ( ∼ <nUm> Å ) , very much beyond what is available at conventional x-ray sources . 
this review summarises attempts that have been made to quantify and separate steric and electronic factors associated with zirconocene - type catalysts in the olefin polymerisation reaction . the use of cone and solid angles , measurement of molecular spaces ( coordination gap aperture , obliquity angle and lateral extension angle ) , the taft steric parameter as well as a number of theoretical methods ( ab initio hartree fock , QSAR , 3D-QSAR and paired interacting orbitals ) as approaches to the quantification of ligand size is discussed . attempts to associate these measures with catalyst activity are reviewed . 
pentalene bridged zirconocene / methylaluminoxane catalysts are described as useful for the polymerization of ethene , propene , and co-polymerizations with norbornene . they show a high thermostability up to polymerization temperatures of <nUm> ° C . polyethylenes with molecular masses of <nUm> million g / mol are obtained at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> g / mol at more than <nUm> ° C . the molecular mass distribution varies between <nUm> and <nUm> because of the steric isomers of the pentalene ligand . some of the complexes are active for the polymerization of propene . similar to ansa cyclopentadienyl-fluorenyl complexes , the tacticity of the produced polypropylenes can be changed from syndiotactic to isotactic by substitution of the cyclopentadienyl ring . 
6-Dialkylaminofulvenes add a variety of RLi reagents to form (dialkylaminoalkyl)cyclopentadienides [ C <nUm> H <nUm> C r <nUm> r ce : glyph() N r ′ <nUm> ] Li , which exhibit oligomeric chain structures in the solid state . transmetallation yields the corresponding titanocene or zirconocene derivatives that often show interesting intramolecular CH activation reactions . phosphide anion addition to 6-alkyl-fulvenes yields the analogous phosphinoalkyl-Cp reagents and subsequently their group <nUm> metallocene complexes . deprotonation of 6-dialkylamino-6-alkylfulvenes generates enamino-substituted cp - ligands . their metal complexes undergo intramolecular mannich reactions to yield C <nUm> - bridged ansa - metallocene products . treatment of 6-dimethylaminofulvene with ArHLiN reagents leads to amine exchange and opens a synthetic route to " CpCN " MX <nUm> " constrained geometry " catalysts . LiNHR addition to some 6-alkylfulvenes represents an alternative entry to this important class of compounds . the corresponding " CpCP " MX <nUm> systems are derived from the analogous LiPHR addition reaction . many typical reactions of the new fulvene - derived metal complexes are presented and discussed . 
In this account [3]- and [5]cumulene complexes of group <nUm> metallocenes that form five - membered metallacycles are described . these complexes have a " triple bond " despite their five - membered ring structure , showing that they are regarded as 1-metallacyclopent-3-ynes . the molecular structures show their strained alkyne character . these complexes react with transition metals to form alkyne - coordinated bimetallic complexes . they also receive electrophilic attack by protons and boranes resulting in M-C bond cleavage . when a [3]cumulene couples with an alkyne on the metal , the reaction produces seven - membered metallacycloalkynes that have a strained structure showing an interaction between the " triple bond " and the metal center . hexapentaenes , [5]cumulenes , form conjugated 1-metallacyclopent-3-ynes . the aryl-substituted [5]cumulene complex was reduced by alkali metal to give dianionic species that reacted with protons to give 1-metallacyclopent-3-ene , a cycloalkene , and with iodomethane to give 1-metallacyclopenta-2,3-diene , a cycloallene . the hexapentaene with tert-butyl groups reacts with zirconocene to form an e2-p - coordinated complex in the presence of trimethylphosphine , although it gave a 1-metallacyclopent-3-yne in the absence of the phosphine . the former was transformed into the latter by addition of a phosphine , and vice versa by removing the phosphine , showing a " haptotropic " shift . 



here , we revealed the effect of particle size of the nanoscale O2Si on catalytic and characteristic properties of LLDPE / nano-SiO2 composites synthesized via the in situ polymerization with a zirconocene / MAO catalyst . In the experiment , O2Si ( <nUm> and <nUm> nm ) was first impregnated with MAO . then , copolymerization of ethylene / 1-hexene was performed in the presence of nano-SiO2 / MAO to produce LLDPE / nano-SiO2 composites . it was found that the larger particle exhibited higher polymerization activity due to fewer interactions between O2Si and MAO . the larger particle also rendered higher insertion of 1-hexene leading to decreased melting temperature ( Tm ) . there was no significant change in the LLDPE molecular structure by means of 13C NMR . 



this work describes the influence of the modification of the ClMg 2(THF)2 and Cl2Mg magnesium supports with the AlEt2Cl , MAO , AlEt3 , AlMe3 , and AlEt 2Cl alkylaluminium compounds on heterogenisation of the bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium(IV) dichloride Cp2ZrCl2 catalyst . it was found that only the MgCl2(THF)2 support modified with AlEt2Cl gave the heterogeneous catalyst . on the contrary , application of a magnesium carrier modified by AlEt3 , AlMe3 , and MAO compounds only results in a homogeneous zirconocene catalyst . 
the heterogeneous bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium(IV) dichloride catalyst of the composition MgCl2(THF) / (AlEt2Cl)0.34 / (Cp2ZrCl2)0.01 as determined by FTIR , XRD , and AAS analyses was synthesised and , after activation by MAO , applied for ethylene polymerisation . the catalyst turned out to be stable and more active than those magnesium supported catalysts already known from the literature . the polyethylene produced has a relatively high molecular weight ( mw > <nUm> g / mol ) , a narrow and monomodal molecular weight distribution ( MWD = <nUm> ) , a bulk density of about <nUm> g / dm3 , and monomodal particle size distribution . application of a ternary al(i - bu)3 / MAO / B(C 6F5)3 activator decreased the amount of MAO needed and increased catalyst activity , but did not change the reaction mechanism . 
the electrochemical synthesis and characterisation of poly(methyl vinylsilane ) and a series of poly(methyl vinylsilane-co-metallocenes ) network polymers are described in detail . this class of polymers are not accessible through wurtz coupling reaction and are however prepared by electro-reduction of dichloro methyl vinylsilane in a non-aqueous system using aluminum electrodes in a single compartment cell . these polymers have been characterised using UV , FTIR , XRD , SEM and NMR spectral techniques . cyclic voltammetric studies of the above polymers reveal their conducting behavior . these polymers show optical properties as explained from the results . polymers of this type are proposed as potential soluble precursors for CSi and metal doped CSi materials . 
unbridged bis-substituted-indenyl zirconocene complexes , [ ( 2,4-Me 2Ind)2ZrCl2 , met-1 ; ( 2,4,6-Me 3Ind)2ZrCl2 , met-2 ] , were supported on silica and montmorillonite carriers ( resulting in silica - supported catalysts MS-1 and MS-2 , and montmorillonite - supported catalyst MT-1 ) . ethylene polymerization by homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts showed high activity , affording polyethylenes with high molecular weight . the catalytic activity and the molecular weight of the polymer were improved using the heterogeneous systems . the activities for the ethylene / 1-hexene copolymerization by heterogeneous systems were lower than those using homogeneous systems , however , the comonomer was incorporated efficiently into polymer in both the homo- and the heterogeneous systems , and moreover , the microstructure of the copolymer derived from the heterogeneous catalysts showed different characteristics from those resulting from the homogeneous systems . the rErH values of the heterogeneous catalysts ( <nUm> for MS-1 and <nUm> for MS-2 ) , are quite different from those of their homogeneous analogues ( <nUm> for met-1 and <nUm> for met-2 ) . 
4,4'-Bis(methylene)biphenylene bridged homodinuclear titanocene ( 3 ) and zirconocene ( 4 ) have been synthesized by treatment of CpTiCl3 and CpZrCl3 · DME with Na2[C5H4CH2C6H4-p-C6H4CH2C5H4] , respectively , in THF and characterized by 1H NMR and element analysis . after activation with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) , these catalysts were used for the homogeneous polymerization of ethylene . the influences of reaction conditions , such as temperature , time , catalyst concentration and molar ratio of MAO / cat . on ethylene polymerization were investigated in detail . the catalytic activities of <nUm> and <nUm> are more than three times higher than that of the phenyldimethylene bridged homodinuclear metallocene of titanocene ( 5 ) and zirconocene ( 6 ) , respectively , and also twice higher than that of Cp2TiCl2 / MAO and Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO , respectively . however , the catalytic activity of <nUm> is nearly half as high as that of <nUm> , which reached <nUm> × <nUm> g PE / mol cat h . the molecular weight of polyethylene increases simultaneously with prolongation of polymerization time . GPC spectra show that <nUm> and <nUm> produce polyethylene with broad molecular weight distribution ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) . the high melting points of the products ( 131-134 ° C ) indicate that the polyethylene formed is highly linear and highly crystalline . 
copolymerizations of ethylene with 1,3-butadiene in the presence of catalytic systems based on C2 - symmetric zirconocenes rac - ( CH 3)2Si(2-R-4-R'-1-indenyl)2ZrCl <nUm> ( where r = CH3- or H and R' = C6H 5- or H ) are compared . the chemical nature and the relative amount of constitutional comonomer units from butadiene ( 1,4-trans , methylene-1,2- cyclopentane and methylene-1,2-cyclopropane ) are strongly affected by the bulkiness of the substituent on the indenyl ligands . the unsubstituted indenyl zirconocene system rac-(CH3)2Si(indenyl) 2ZrCl2 / methylalumoxane ( MAO ) inserts 1,3-butadiene leading to both cyclopentane and 1,4-trans units , whereas exclusively cyclopentane constitutional units are obtained from rac-(CH3)2Si(2- methyl-1-indenyl)2ZrCl2 / MAO . the catalytic system rac-(CH3)2Si(2-methyl-4-phenyl-1-indenyl) 2ZrCl2 / ( MAO ) is able to incorporate about <nUm> % of butadiene units into polymer chains and to form up to <nUm> % of cyclopropane units . an unusual insertion mechanism for conjugated diolefins , that involves a butadiene e2 primary coordination and insertion leading to formation of cycloalkane units , is largely predominant for all used catalytic systems . mechanistic studies and DFT calculations indicate that the chemoselectivity of the reaction depends on the bulkiness of the substituents on the indenyl ligands of catalyst .

In the case of the phases prepared by the sol - gel method , recovery results were comparable to those observed for LC-18 . experiments using OZr <nUm> and O2Zr / O2Si phases led to lower recovery results . 
silica was chemically modified with zirconocenes , namely Cp2ZrCl2 , (MeCp)2ZrCl2 , (iBuCp)2ZrCl2 and (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 by grafting . hybrid silica bearing surface indene groups was synthesized by the sol - gel method , followed by metallation with ZrCl4s2THF . according to RBS measurements , metal content was <nUm> - <nUm> wt % Zr / O2Si for the grafted systems and <nUm> wt % Zr / O2Si for the phase prepared by the sol - gel method . the solid phases were evaluated in the adsorption / preconcentration of organochloride ( hexachlorobenzene , lindane , heptachlor , heptachlor epoxide , dieldrin and endrin ) pesticides from aqueous solution . for comparative reasons , commercial LC-18 phase was also evaluated . analyte concentration was monitored by GC - ECD . for the grafted phases , the coordination sphere around the metal center seems not to influence the adsorption / desorption properties of these phases vis-a-vis the studied analytes . recoveries results for both analytes were comparable to those observed in the case of LC-18 in the case of the phases prepared by the sol - gel method . experiments using O2Zr and O2Zr / O2Si phases led to lower recovery results . 
In this present study , the linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) was synthesized via ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization with the zirconocene / MMAO catalyst by in situ impregnation of different silica ( OSi <nUm> ) supports . the OSi <nUm> supports used were small - pored ( SP ) and large - pored ( LP ) sizes with and without Ga modification . it was found that the SP - OSi <nUm> support exhibited higher polymerization activity ( ~ <nUm> times ) than that obtained from the LP - OSi <nUm> one . this can be attributed to the lower amount of MMAO being present inside the SP - OSi <nUm> support resulting in higher content of MMAO at the external surface . the higher activity in ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization was also found with the supported catalyst having Ga modification onto both SP - and LP - OSi <nUm> supports . the results demonstrated that the introduction of Ga may improve ability of supports to immobilize metallocene catalyst . based on 13C NMR measurement , it indicated that all synthesized polymers were typical LLDPE having random distribution of comonomer . 
ethylene polymerization was carried out using highly active metallocene catalysts ( cp 2ZrCl <nUm> and cp 2TiCl <nUm> ) in combination with methylalumoxane .

the reaction of o-alkenyl substituted zirconocene dichloride complexes with two equivalents of n -butyllithium is strongly influenced in the presence of alkenes and alkynes . metallacyclic zirconocene complexes of novel structures are obtained . the additives alkenes and alkynes compete with the o-alkenyl substituents and the intermediate 1-butene for the formation of a metallacyclic structure . the reaction of o-alkenyl substituted zirconocene dichloride complexes with two equivalents of ethyllithium and n -hexyllithium gives analogous reactions and metallacycles as with n -butyllithium .

the reaction of phenylalkyl substituted zirconocenedichloride complexes with two equivalents of n-butyllithium gives metallacyclic zirconocene complexes . In this reaction aromatic CH bonds can be activated in unbridged and bridged metallocenedichloride complexes even if the corresponding phenyl rings contain halogen substituents such as fluorine or chlorine . after the activation with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , all the metallocene complexes prove as attractive catalysts for ethylene polymerization reactions . because of their lewis basicity the halogen substituents fluorine or chlorine have a strong influence on the molecular weights of the produced polyethylenes . metallocene complexes with chloro substituents in the ortho positions of the phenyl rings produce bimodal polyethylenes . 
ethylene polymerization studies have been carried out with novel precatalysts of the type : [ ( e5-C13 H8)-X(t-BuOC6H12)Me-(e5- C5H4)]ZrCl2 [ x = C [1a] , Si [2a] ] , [ (e5-C13H8)-XMe2- ( e5-(t-BuOC6H12C5 H3 ) ) ] Cl2Zr [ x = C [3a] , Si [4a] ] in the presence of excess methylalumoxane ( MAO ) to compare their catalytic activity and to delineate the effect of the 6-t-butoxyhexyl functionality on ethylene polymerization . the precatalysts [1a] and [2a] with the bridge functionality showed higher activity in ethylene polymerization than the corresponding complexes [3a] and [4a] which have it on the cp ring moiety . on the other hand the silyl bridged complexes [2a] and [4a] produced a higher molecular weight polyethylene than the carbon - bridged one , regardless of the location of functional group . 
A novel half - sandwich Zr(IV) complex [ e5:e 1-N-C5(CH3)4 CH2CH2N(CH3)2]ZrCl <nUm> ( 6 ) together with zirconocene dichlorides [ e5-C5(CH3)4 C4H10N ] [e5-C5(CH3)5] Cl2Zr ( 4 ) and [ e5-C5 C3H8 N(CH3)2]2ZrCl2 ( 5 ) have been prepared . complex <nUm> has been isolated and characterized in three different forms , namely , as an adduct with THF 6a , an adduct with tetrahydrothiophene 6b , and a solvent - free form 6c . molecular structures of complexes <nUm> , 6b , and 6c have been established by x-ray diffraction analysis . complex 6c has been shown to be a monomeric solvent - free half sandwich Zr(IV) complex . the dynamic behavior of complex 6a in a non-solvating medium ( an equilibrium between 6a and 6c along with a degenerate interconversion of the Zr-Ccp-CH2- CH2-N(CH3)2-(Zr) pseudo-five-member metallacycle ) have been studied by the variable - temperature 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy . the activation parameters for the degenerate five - member cycle interconversion have been elucidated . 
four series of reactions were explored that are aimed at the development of a functional group chemistry at the sensitive bent metallocenes of the group <nUm> metals . first , we have tested and employed the olefin metathesis reaction . two [ C5H4-(CH2)n-CH = CH2]2ZrCl2 complexes ( with n = <nUm> and n = <nUm> ) were treated with the Cl2(PCy3)2 r = CHPh catalyst in dilute solution . intramolecular metathesis took place readily with liberation of ethene to yield the corresponding ansa - metallocene complexes [ C5H4- (CH2)n-CH = CH - ( CH2 ) n-C5H4]ZrCl2 that were isolated in ca. <nUm> % ( n = <nUm> , trans-CH = CH- ) or ca. <nUm> % ( n = <nUm> , cis-CH = CH- ) yield . intermolecular olefin metathesis could also be effected using either a first or a second generation grubbs catalyst to metathetically couple a variety of (L)Cl2M(C5H4-CH2 CH = CH2 ) - type titanium or zirconium complexes to yield the respective dimetallic products . alkenyl substituents were attached at the ligand stage at the indenyl 2-positions by means of a nickel - catalyzed cross-coupling reaction . transmetallation eventually gave the bis(2-alkenylindenyl)ZrCl2 complexes . photolysis of three examples of this type of complexes ( with 1-alkenyl substituents being methyl , cyclohexyl , or phenyl ) resulted in a very efficient intramolecular [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition to yield the respective substituted cyclobutylene-bridged ansa -metallocenes . these complexes were MAO activated to give very active homogeneous metallocene catalysts for , e.g. , ethene / 1-octene copolymerization . the corresponding (s-trans-butadiene)-ansa-zirconocene complexes feature a pronounced C-H / phenylene p-interaction that probably helps to stabilize the s-trans-diene complex relative to its s-cis - isomer . deprotonation of 7-dialkylaminofulvenes provides an easy access to enamino-cyclopentadienides . transmetallation under carefully controlled conditions gave the respective bis(enamino-C5H4) Cl2Zr complexes . their treatment with a catalytic amount of a lewis acid ( Cl4Ti ) or a bronsted - acid ( [HNMe2Ph+][BPh4-] ) led to a rapid intramolecular mannich - type carbon-carbon coupling reaction that gave novel , very rigid C3 - bridged , -NR2 functionalized ansa - metallocene systems . the analogous , readily performed mannich - coupling reaction starting from 1,1'-diacetylferrocene and a variety of secondary amines provided an interesting and useful novel entry to [3]ferrocenophane systems . catalytic hydrogenation of the unsaturated bridge followed by additional functionalization opened a novel pathway to ferrocenophane - based chelate ligands ( some optically active ) for stereoselective catalytic transformations . eventually , examples of direct attack of the electrophilic boranes BC6F5 <nUm> or BC12F10H , respectively , to the cp rings of bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconacyclopentadienes are described , leading to novel types of cp - borylated group <nUm> metallocene complexes . 
the regioselectivity of the coupling reactions of the internal acetylenic derivative Ph2P-C ≡ C-SiMe3 ( 2 ) and the benzyne complex [ Cp2Zr(e2- C3H2 ) ] ( 1 ) resulted preferentially in the formation of the zirconaindene metallacycle with the metal a-carbanions stabilized by the trimethylsilyl group . we have been able to structurally characterize the two regiosomers . the unusual acute Zr-C-P angle and the short Zr-P distance revealed that a significant lewis - base / lewis - acid s-P-Zr interaction occurs in the a-phosphino zirconaindene metallacycle . addition of HCl*Et2O on the cyclic a-silyl zirconindene complex led to competition reactions between ( i ) the nucleophilic attack of the lone pair of the phosphino group followed by P-C cleavage to form Ph2PH and Ph-C ≡ C-SiMe3 ( 7 ) and ( ii ) protonolysis of the Zr - CSi bond to give the z-vinyl silyl phosphino product Ph2PC(Ph) = C(H) SiMe3 ( 8 ) . when the lone electron pair of the phosphino group is engaged intramolecularly with the metal center to achieve the stable 18-electron configuration protonolysis reaction on the Zr-C bonds to give the z-vinyl silyl phosphino product Ph2PC(H) = C(Ph)SiMe3 ( 9 ) is the unique process observed . protonolysis reaction on the complexes prepared in situ from the addition of <nUm> and zirconocene like reagents " [Cp2Zr] " gave Ph2PH , H-C ≡ C-SiMe3 , and Ph2PC(H) = C(H)SiMe3 ( 18 ) which resulted from the competitive P-C and Zr-C bond cleavage processes of the transient alkyne complex Cp2Zr(e2-Ph2 P-C ≡ C-SiMe3 ) ] ( 14 ) .

methylene-bridged ansa - metallocene complexes bearing substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ( cp ) and fluorenyl ( flu ) moieties , namely methylene[9-(2,7-di-tert-butyl)fluorenyl ( 2-(1,3-dimethylcyclopentadienyl)]zirconium dichloride ( 1a ) and its analogue , methylene [ ( 9-(2,7-di-tert-butyl)fluorenyl ( 2-(1-methyl-3-phenyl)cyclopentadienyl ) ]zirconium dichloride ( 2a ) , have been prepared from (2,7-di-tert-butyl)-9-prop-2-ynyl-9H-fluorene ( 2 ) . this procedure includes the use of 3-bromo-1-propyne which affords the methylene bridging unit by way of an intermolecular pauson - khand reaction in which norbornadiene and a pendant alkyne cyclize to form a ring that later becomes a substituted cyclopentadienyl group . ethylene-norbornene ( E-N ) copolymerization was then carried out using these new complexes ( 1a and 1b ) in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as a cocatalyst ; these activities can be compared to that of isopropylene[9-fluorenyl-cyclopentadienyl]zirconium dichloride ( 3a ) . the activity of catalyst 1a was comparable to that of 3a but much higher than that of 2a . In addition , 1a shows higher norbornene insertion performance , and gives an E-N copolymer with a higher glass transition temperature ( tg ) than 2a under identical conditions ; both 1a and 2a give a lower tg polymer than 3a does . 
the (butadiene)zirconocene system is characterized by the occurence of two isomers , (s-cis-)- and ( s-trans-e4-C4H 6-)ZrCp2 . out of this equilibrium , (butadiene)zirconocene has successfully been employed as a stoichiometric reagent in organic and organometallic synthesis and as a precursor for the generation of active homogeneous ziegler - natta catalyst systems . (Butadiene)zirconocene was the first mono-nuclear metal complex for which the s-trans-e4 - conjugated diene coordination mode was established . meanwhile a variety of additional examples from metals throughout the periodic table was found . the (butadiene)zirconocenes have found use as valuable reagents in organic and organometallic synthesis , for which various representative examples are described . they have also found extensive use as precursors for the generation of very active and sometimes very selective homogeneous metallocene ziegler - natta olefin polymerization catalysts . the employment of the dipolar zirconocene(butadiene) / BC18F15 addition products in mechanistic studies has revealed important aspects of the reaction course taken in the carbon-carbon coupling reaction sequences at this important class of catalysts . several specific examples are described in this article . 
meso- and rac - diastereomers of the Me-Ph-cyclopentadienyl-disubstituted zirconocene and tetramethyldisiloxane - bridged ansa - metallocene dichlorides ( m = Zr , Hf ) have been isolated by transmetallation of their lithium salts to MCl4 and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction methods . the zirconocene dichlorides activated with MAO are active catalysts for ethene and propene polymerization . the non-vicinal methyl-phenyl-substituted zirconocene dichlorides meso-and rac-[Zr{e5-(1-Ph-3-Me-C 5H3)}2Cl2 ] and [ zr(e 5-C5H5){e5-(1-Ph-3-Me-C 5H3)}Cl2 ] have been isolated by transmetallation of the lithium salt Li(1-Ph-3-Me-C5H3) to ZrCl4(THF)2 and [ Zr(e5-C5H 5)Cl3 • DME ] ( DME = dimethoxyethane ) , respectively . similar transmetallation of the lithium salt Li2[(Me-Ph-C 5H2SiMe2)2O ] to MCl4 gave the ansa - metallocenes [ M{e5-(Me-Ph-C5H 2SiMe2)2O}Cl2 ] ( m = Zr , Hf ) for which the meso- and rac - diastereomers were separated . the dimethyl and dibenzyl derivatives of these metallocenes were also prepared and the structure of all of these compounds determined by NMR spectroscopy . the molecular structure of rac-[Zr{e5-(2-Me-4-Ph-C5H2SiMe 2)2O}Cl2 ] was determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction methods . the activity of the dichlorometallocenes / MAO catalysts for ethene and propene polymerization was evaluated .

A number of related examples of this condensation reaction at the intact group <nUm> bent metallocene framework is described , using different amino-substituents and Ti , Zr and Hf systems . three examples of the unsaturated ansa - metallocene systems were characterized by x-ray diffraction . In a few cases it was possible to isolate the open ( enamino-Cp ) 2ZrCl <nUm> complexes . In the case of , e.g. , ( piperidinoethenylcyclopentadienyl ) 2ZrCl <nUm> ( 13c ) treatment with a catalytic quantity of the lewis acid ClZr <nUm> or the bronsted acid [PhNMe2H+][BPh4-] resulted in a clean conversion to the respective mannich condensation product , here the ansa - metallocene complex 4c . the strongly electrophilic borane HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> did not catalyze the CC - coupling reaction under the applied reaction conditions but added cleanly to the enamino-CC double bond of , e.g. , 13c to yield a cyclic nitrogen donor - stabilized hydroboration product ( 19 ) . 
deprotonation of di(3-methylindol-2-yl)phenylmethane ( L 2H <nUm> ) or 2-methoxyphenyldi(3-methylindol-2-yl)methane(L2'H2) with two equivalents of nBuLi , followed by reactions with cp 2TiCl <nUm> or cp 2ZrCl <nUm> yielded complexes Cp2TiL2(1),Cp2TiL2'(2),Cp2ZrL2(3)andCp2ZrL2'(4) . compounds 1-4 were characterized by NMR spectroscopy , and compounds <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were further analyzed by x-ray crystallography and elemental analysis . the molecular structures of <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> illustrate that chelating di(3-methylindol-2-yl) methanes have a structural relationship to coordinated bis(pyrazolyl)borates . 
the phenyltrihydroborate complexes , cp 2ZrCl{(m-H) 2BHPh } , <nUm> , and cp 2Zr{(m-H) 2BHPh } <nUm> • ( <nUm> / <nUm> toluene ) , <nUm> , were prepared from the reactions of cp 2ZrCl <nUm> with one and two moles of BHLi 3Ph . the Zr-H-B bonds in <nUm> are stable under vacuum at <nUm> ° C for hours without significant decomposition . an inductive effect has been proposed for this strong interaction . this hydrogen bridge bond can be broken upon reacting with the lewis base N(C 2H <nUm> ) <nUm> to produce ( C 2H <nUm> ) <nUm> N • BH 2Ph and the zirconium hydride compound cp 2ZrH{(m-H) 2BHPh } , <nUm> . compound <nUm> also can be prepared from the reaction of cp 2ZrHCl with BHLi 3Ph . the reaction of <nUm> with the lewis acid B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> is solvent dependent , the metathesis product cp 2ZrCl{(m-H) 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> } , <nUm> , was formed in the toluene solution , whereas the ionic complex [ cp 2ZrCl(OEt 2)][HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , <nUm> , was isolated from the ether solution . the reaction of titanocene dichloride , cp 2TiCl <nUm> , with BHLi 3Ph produced a 17-electron , paramagnetic complex , cp 2Ti{(m-H) 2BHPh } , <nUm> . single crystal x-ray structures of <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were also determined . A coplanar structure of the four bridge hydrogens in <nUm> was observed . 
the meso- and rac - like isomers of bis{e5-(1-benzyl)indenyl} zirconium dichloride ( 5 ) , bis{e5-(1-para-methoxybenzyl)indenyl} zirconium dichloride ( 6 ) , bis{e5-(1-para-fluoro-benzyl)indenyl} zirconium dichloride ( 7 ) and bis{e5-(1-phenylethyl)indenyl} zirconium dichloride ( 8 ) were synthesized and isolated . solid - state structures of meso- and rac - like <nUm> were determined by x-ray structure analysis . polymerization properties of the methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) activated diastereomers of complexes 5-8 were studied in ethene polymerizations under different monomer concentrations . the rac - like isomer of 1-phenylethyl-substituted <nUm> / MAO showed significantly higher activity than the 1-benzyl substituted analogs 5-7 / MAO . In addition , rac - <nUm> / MAO behaves like a single center catalyst producing polyethene with narrow molar mass distribution ( <nUm> - <nUm> ) , while diastereomers of 5-7 / MAO produce polymers with molar mass distributions varying from <nUm> up to <nUm> . the rac and meso-like isomers of 5-7 / MAO have different response on the monomer concentration . quantum chemical calculations suggest a strong interaction between the benzyl substituent and the electron deficient zirconium center . the phenyl metal coordination energies depend on the electronic properties of the para-substituent . In <nUm> / MAO , due to the ethyl spacer , the coordination does not have a significant role and therefore much higher activity and single center polymerization behavior is observed . 
the reaction of the ansa - zirconocene meso-[C2H 4(4,7-Me2Indenyl)2]ZrMe2 with BC18F15 afforded , besides the expected ion pair with outward MeB(C6F5)3- anion , also a minor isomer ( molar fraction <nUm> ) with the bulky methylborate anion in the inward site . 2D 1H EXSY experiments revealed exchange between the two isomers , at T > <nUm> K , through the migration of the MeB(C 6F5)3- anion between outward and inward sites . the presence of free BC18F15 fastened the exchange , suggesting BC18F15 attack on the zirconium bound methyl ligand of the two ion pairs . 
novel zirconocene complexes ( 1-Biph-3,4-Me2Cp ) 2ZrCl2 ( 3 ) , (C5Me5)(1-Biph-3,4- Me2Cp)ZrCl2 ( 4 ) , and (C5H5)(1-Biph- 3,4-Me2Cp)ZrCl2 ( 5 ) containing a 1-biphenyl-3,4- dimethylcyclopentadienyl ligand ( 2 ) have been prepared and their solid state structures were characterized by x-ray diffraction method . the crystal structure of <nUm> revealed a racemic , C2 - symmetric nature in the solid state . In ethylene polymerization , they all afforded high - density polyethylene with very high activity . especially , the catalytic properties of <nUm> were most marked in terms of both polymerization activity and molecular weight of polyethylene among them . they also showed good activity on the polymerization of propylene , but afforded nearly atactic , amorphous polypropylenes with a little higher [mmmm] methyl pentad values by <nUm> and <nUm> than that by the most active <nUm> under the given reaction conditions . 
characteristics of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) polymerization using oscillating zirconocene catalysts , (2-Ph-Ind)2ZrX2 ( x = Cl , <nUm> ; x = me , <nUm> ) , mixtures of rac- and meso-zirconocene diastereomers , (SBI)ZrMe2 [ <nUm> , SBI = Me2Si(Ind)2 ] and (EBI)ZrMe2 [ <nUm> , EBI = C2H4(Ind)2 ] , as well as diastereospecific metallocene pairs , rac-4 / Cp2ZrMe <nUm> ( 5 ) and rac - <nUm> / CGCTiMe2 [ <nUm> , CGC = me 2Si(Me4C5)(t-BuN) ] , are reported . MMA polymerization using the chloride catalyst precursor <nUm> activated with a large excess of the modified methyl aluminoxane is sluggish , uncontrolled , and produces atactic PMMA . on the other hand , the polymerization by a <nUm> / <nUm> ratio of <nUm> / BC18F15 or <nUm> / Ph3CB(C 6F5)4 is controlled and produces syndiotactic PMMA . mixtures of diastereomeric ansa - zirconocenes <nUm> or <nUm> containing various rac / meso ratios , when activated with BC18F15 , yield bimodal PMMA ; this behavior is attributed to the meso-diastereomer that , in its pure form , affords bimodal , syndio-rich atactic PMMA . for MMA polymerization using diastereospecific metallocene pairs , rac - <nUm> / <nUm> and rac - <nUm> / <nUm> , the isospecific catalyst site dominates the polymerization events under the conditions employed in this study , and the aspecific and syndiospecific sites are largely nonproductive , thereby forming only highly isotactic PMMA . 
(Butadiene)zirconocene is observed to exist as an equilibrium mixture of ( s-cis- ) and (s-trans-e4-C4H6)ZrCl <nUm> isomers . the system adds a variety of unsaturated organic reagents to form metallacyclic (allyl)metallocene products . In some cases , a second equivalent of a reagent is taken up , which forms the basis of a variety of useful template coupling reactions of butadiene at the bent metallocene framework . the lewis acid BC18F15 adds to (butadiene)zirconocene and to a great variety of butadiene complexes of ansa - metallocenes and related systems to give zwitterionic metallocene- butadiene-borate betaines . most of these systems are active homogeneous ziegler - natta olefin polymerization catalysts , that do not require additional activation . catalyst activities are often in a similar range to those observed for other catalyst activation procedures used in this chemistry . In the case of the (butadiene)metallocene / BC18F15 systems we can often observe the first olefin insertion step . this feature was utilized to carry out a variety of mechanistic studies of the essential carbon-carbon coupling steps that take place at such bent metallocene catalyst systems . even reactions with the functionalized monomer methylmetacrylate could be followed in this way . some chelate ligand late metal systems were also included in these studies . however , these systems mostly behaved differently , even in cases where some structural similarities were observed . 
benz[f]indenyl zirconium complexes have been successfully synthesized and characterized . their catalytic activities were evaluated for the polymerization of ethylene . the complexes combined with MAO can be highly active single site catalysts , which display activities comparable with that of the cp 2ZrCl2 / MAO system and provide very high molecular weight polyethylenes . the melting point of the polymers indicates the formation of linear polyethylene . 
treatment of zirconocene dichloride [ e5-C 5(CH3)4CH2CH2N(CH 3)2][e5-C5(CH3) 5]ZrCl2 ( 1 ) with amalgamated magnesium in THF results in cleavage of a C-H bond in one of the methyl groups of the CH3N <nUm> fragment yielding [ e5:e2(C,N)-C 5(CH3)4CH2CH2N(CH 3)CH2][e5-C5(CH 3)5]ZrH ( 2 ) . an analogous reduction of [ e5-C5(CH3)4CH 2CH2N(CH3)2]2ZrCl <nUm> ( 4 ) proceeds similarly only in the presence of great excess of C3H9P , otherwise no identifiable products are formed . heterogeneous reaction of the hydride complex <nUm> with ClH4N in THF produces the corresponding chloride complex [ e5 : e2(C,N)-C5(CH3)4CH 2CH2N(CH3)CH2][e5- C5(CH3)5]ZrCl ( 3 ) , with the Zr - CH2 bond retained . the molecular structures of compounds <nUm> and <nUm> were established by x-ray diffraction analyses . 
reaction pathways for the formation of zirconocene phosphinidene complex Cp2Zr(PR3)PR from Cp2ZrCl2 and HLi and LiPRH and its reactivity to 1,2-dichloroethane are explored with density functional theory using model structures that are devoid of substituents . after the initial Cp2Zr(Cl)PH2 is generated with HLiP <nUm> reaction with HLi is likely to eliminate ClH in a single step to give directly the 16-electron complex Cp2ZrPH , which is stabilized by the H3P phosphine ligand . the intermediate formation of a phosphine hydride complex , Cp2Zr(H)PH2 resulting from hydride substitution , is unlikely both on the basis of unfavorable reaction energies and calculated 31P NMR chemical shifts that indicate that such a species can not have been observed experimentally . it is likely that a diphosphine complex , Cp2Zr(PH2)2 , results on using an excess of the lithium phosphide , which on H - transfer gives directly the phosphine - stabilized phosphinidene complex . the reactivity of this species is dominated by the release of its stabilizing phosphine ligand to give a highly reactive 16-electron phosphinidene complex , Cp2ZrPH , which reacts with 1,2-dichloroethane after coordination to one of the chlorine atoms in two asynchronous metathesis steps to the three - membered phosphirane ring . In this process , Cl2Zr is reformed enabling its recycling to regenerate the phosphinidene complex . this study highlights the special reactivity of the 16-electron Cp2ZrPH and suggests that related complexes may be generated similarly , thereby expanding the synthetic potential of these nucleophilic reagents . 
fluorofluorenes [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octafluoro-9-(pentafluorophenyl)-9H- fluorene ( OFPF ) , 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octafluoro-9-(2,4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-9H- fluorene ( OFTF ) , and 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octafluorofluorene ( OFF ) ] react with sodium hydride or with lithium alkyls to give fluorofluorenyl anions which have been characterized in solution by <nUm> F NMR spectroscopy . OFPF is deprotonated by ethylenediamine , by HMPT and by 1,7-diazo-bicyclo(5,4)-undec-7- ene ( DBU ) , as shown by <nUm> H and <nUm> F NMR spectrometry . the new compound [ rac-ethylene-bis(e <nUm> -4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl ) ] diallylzirconium(IV) ( ZRAL ) , as prepared from [ rac-ethylene- bis(e <nUm> -4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)]dichloridezirconium(IV) and allylmagnesium chloride , undergoes allyl abstraction with OFPF , CPh <nUm> [ B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , and B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> forming zirconium - containing cations , as established by <nUm> H and <nUm> F NMR spectrometry . toluene / pentafluoroanisole solutions of the fluorinated anions , in combination with ZRAL , catalyze the polymerization of ethylene , with an activity comparable to that of MAO or CPh <nUm> [ B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , a remarkable increase of activity being observed with the ZRAL / OFPF system . 
Bis-(1,2-(RMe <nUm> OSi ) <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> complexes with r = me-(5a) , iPr-(5b) and tBu-(5c) have been synthesised in good yields and characterised . compounds 5a-c are the first synthesised examples of multi-siloxy-substituted cyclopentadienyl metallocenes . the siloxy-substituents have a for siloxy substituted metallocenes unique steric arrangement , with one almost in the same plane , and the other nearly perpendicular to the plane of the cyclopentadienyl ligand of the zirconocene . the ethylene / 1-hexene co-polymerisation activity using methylalumoxane as co-activator gives low activities , with compound 5c ( <nUm> kg(PE) / g(Zr) / h ) being the most active . 
methodology is described for the preparation of a rigid C 2-bridged zirconocene catalyst system where the C2 - bridge is embedded in a spirane scaffold . the ligand was prepared from 3,4-dihydro-2H-fluoren-1(9H)-one . initially , the oxo group was converted into a spirocyclobutanone function . further conversion to a fulvene was followed by regio- and stereoselective saturation to provide the ligand cis-2- (cyclopentadienyl)-1',2',3',4'-tetrahydro-9H- spiro[cyclobutane-1,1'-fluorene] . the ligand was dilithiated and reacted with zirconium tetrachloride to provide the corresponding ( e5- cyclopentadienyl)-spiro[cyclobutane-1,1'-(e5-fluorenyl)] zirconium dichloride complex . the structure of the zirconocene dichloride has been established by crystal x-ray analysis . 
the recent finding that the powerfully electrophilic zirconocene equivalent known as " Cp2Zr " is capable of transforming vinyl furanosides and pyranosides into enantiomerically pure , highly functionalized cis-2-vinyl cyclobutanols and cyclopentanols has been extended in a number of directions . the synthetic potential of this methodology is illustrated by the variety of carbocycles that can be produced , ranging from cyclobutanones , a carbacyclic nucleoside , cyclooctane polyols , and medium - ring carbohydrate mimics . many of the key transformations are evaluated in terms of transition state energetics . 
an improved synthesis of <nUm> and <nUm> is described that allows access to these complexes in multigram quantities necessary for catalytic applications . the crystal structures of <nUm> and <nUm> are compared and the conformational preferences of the ligands , that are important for catalytic applications , are discussed . complex <nUm> was evaluated as a catalyst for carbomagnesation reactions . 
metallocene alkyl cations for polymerization of olefins possess two active sites involved in migratory insertion . site epimerization , with an inversion at the metal atom , is considered to be one of the major causes for break - down of the alternating propagation model , resulting in stereoerrors whenever the two catalytic sites have substantially different enantioface selectivities . density functional theory has been used to determine the intrinsic reaction coordinate that connects the optimized minima and transition states of inversion in the parent ansa - zirconocene [{H2C(Cp)2}Zr-Pr]+ ( Pr = n-propyl ) . these calculations yield a three - step reaction path for site epimerization . starting from the pyramidal b-agostic complex , an activated rotation around the Zr-Pr bond first produces an a-agostic conformation . continued rotation leads to an equivalent second a-agostic intermediate and then finally to the inverted b-agostic complex . the second step is rate - determining and proceeds through a planar three - coordinate transition state . In the case of [{H2C(Cp)2}Zr-iBu]+ ( iBu = iso-butyl ) , the situation is more complicated , because there are several interconvertible a- , b- and g-agostic intermediates , but the rate - limiting step is again an inversion process connecting two different a-agostic conformers with the alkyl group on opposite enantiosides . for both ansa - zirconocene catalysts , the computed free - energy barriers for epimerization are around 11-12 kcal / mol and almost independent of temperature , while those for insertion increase with temperature due to the entropic cost of association . according to the computational results for the isolated catalysts , insertion remains favored over epimerization for the experimentally relevant temperature range in the n-propyl case , whereas both processes are competitive in the iso-butyl case . inclusion of bulk solvent effects by a continuum solvation model does not affect the results much , while explicit consideration of a coordinating counterion causes larger changes . the present model calculations on the role of site epimerization should thus be most relevant for propene polymerization with non-coordinating counterions . 
the dialkyl complexes , [ Zr { r ( H ) C ( e5 - C5 me4 ) ( e5 - C5 H4 ) } R2' ] ( r = pri , R' = me ( 2a ) , CH2Ph ( 3a ) ; r = bun , R' = me ( 2b ) , CH2Ph ( 3b ) ; r = but , R' = me ( 2c ) , CH2Ph ( 3c ) ; r = ph , R' = me ( 2d ) . 
synthesis of rigid ansa - zirconocene precatalyst systems with a C2 - bridge embedded in a spirane scaffold is described . fulvenes were key intermediates in regio- and stereoselective preparation of the appropriate spirane ligands . substitution in the cyclopentadienyl group in the ligand was effected by fulvene methodology . the zirconocenes were active precatalysts for the polymerisation of propene when activated with MAO . the structure of the parent zirconocene dichloride has been verified by x-ray crystal analysis . 
A series of chiral ansa - zirconocene ester enolate complexes incorporating C2- or Cs - symmetric ligands , including neutral rac - (EBI)ZrCl[OC(OiPr){double bond , long}CMe2 ] ( 1 ) , rac - (EBI)Zr(OTf)[OC(OiPr){double bond , long}CMe2 ] ( 2 ) , rac - (EBI)Zr(OTf)[OC(OMe){double bond , long}C(Me)CH2C(Me2)C(OiPr){double bond , long}O ] ( 3 ) , [Me2C(Cp)(Flu)]ZrMe[OC(OiPr){double bond , long}CMe2 ] ( 4 ) , and cationic [Me2C(Cp)(Flu)]Zr+(THF)[OC(OiPr){double bond , long}CMe2][MeB(C6F5)3]- ( 5 ) , have been synthesized . within the neutral C2 - ligated zirconocene ester enolate series , the chloride derivative <nUm> is inactive toward any methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) additions , the methyl derivative rac - (EBI)ZrMe[OC(OiPr){double bond , long}CMe2 ] adds cleanly only <nUm> equiv. of MMA , and the triflate derivative <nUm> can add either <nUm> equiv. of MMA to form the single - MMA - addition product <nUm> or multiple equivalents of MMA to form P(MMA) . unlike the Cs - ligated methyl cation [Me2C(Cp)(Flu)ZrMe]+ , which is inactive for MMA polymerization under various conditions , the Cs - ligated ester enolate cation <nUm> is moderately active for polymerization of MMA and N,N-dimethylacrylamide at ambient temperature ; the resulting P(MMA) has a high molecular weight of Mn = <nUm> <nUm> Da but a low syndiotacticity of [rr] = <nUm> % , and the polymerization conforms to a chain - end control mechanism . 
group <nUm> metallocene complexes can form adducts or condensation products with a variety of typical biogenic molecules . In this account , examples are presented and discussed for the reactions of zirconocene or titanocene complexes with suitably protected / deprotected carbohydrate derivatives . some methodological developments are shown for the attachment of aminoacid or peptide derived functional groups at the cp - rings of the group <nUm> bent metallocenes . eventually , the reactions of methylzirconocene- and methyltitanocene cations with a series of short oligopeptides are discussed that lead to the formation of primary kO - adducts followed by O,N,O - chelate complex formation with methane evolution . the dynamic features of some such systems are discussed . 
A mixture of tertiary alkyl halide and 2-methylene-1,3-dithiane was treated with butylmagnesium bromide in the presence of a catalytic amount of zirconocene dichloride . the reaction resulted in alkylative dimerization to yield the corresponding vic - bis(dithiane) . the reaction would proceed as follows . A single electron transfer from low - valent zirconocene to alkyl halide would generate the corresponding alkyl radical . the radical adds to 2-methylene-1,3-dithiane to afford the corresponding radical stabilized by the two sulfur atoms . A couple of the stable radicals finally undergo dimerization . 
the effect that a solvent has on reactions of Cp2Zr{(m-H)2BHR}2 and Cp2ZrH{(m-H)2BHR} ( r = CH3 , ph ) with BC18F15 has been studied . from the reaction in benzene the metathesis product Cp2Zr{(m-H)2B(C6F5)2}2 , <nUm> , was isolated . In the case of diethyl ether , different hydride abstraction products , including [Cp2Zr(OEt2){(m-H)2BHPh}][HB(C6F5)3] , <nUm> , [Cp2Zr(OEt2){(m-H)2BHCH3}][HB(C6F5)3] , <nUm> , [Cp2Zr(OEt2){(m-H)2BH2}][HB(C6F5)3] , <nUm> , and [Cp2Zr(OEt)(OEt2)][HB(C6F5)3] , <nUm> , were isolated depending on the starting zirconocene complex . the diethyl ether molecules of 3-6 are weakly coordinated to Zr and displaced in THF solution . isolation of <nUm> and <nUm> is attributed to their fast precipitation from the reaction mixture , which prevented further reactions from occurring . In addition to the hydride abstraction , a hydride metathesis was also involved in the formation of <nUm> . time - elapsed 11B NMR studies indicate that <nUm> and <nUm> are the intermediates on the pathway to <nUm> and <nUm> . the molecular structures of 2-6 were determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . 
reaction of alkynyllithium with zirconocene dichloride in the presence of quinones afforded zirconoenediynes in good yields . treatment of the zirconoenediyne with p-chloranil in the presence of ClCu afforded 1,1,4,4-tetraethynyl-1,3-diene in good yield . In the presence of ClCu and / or Pd(PPh3)4 , the zirconoenediynes could be transformed into various enediyne derivatives through coupling reaction with electrophiles . 
the chiral , terpenoid - substituted yttrocene [(e5-neomenthylCp)2Y{o-C6H4CH2NMe2}] ( 1 ) can be prepared via facile arene elimination starting from [Y(o-C6H4CH2NMe2)3] . compound <nUm> retains a C1 - symmetric structure in solution on the NMR time scale , due to tight binding of the amine donor . the (-)-phenylmenthyl-substituted complexes [(e5-(-)-phenylmenthylCp)2Y(m-Cl)2Li(OEt2)2] ( 5 ) and [(e5-(-)-phenylmenthylCp)2YN(SiMe3)2] ( 6 ) were prepared via salt metathesis . reaction of Cl3Y with the planar chiral (1-neomenthylindenyl)lithium predominantly produced a single , C2 - symmetric , racemic - like diastereomer . the x-ray crystal structure analysis confirmed that [(e5-(+)-NMInd)2Y(m-Cl)2Li(Et2O)2] ( 7 ) represents the same p-S , p-S metallocene diastereomer and adopts a very similar conformation as observed by erker in his zirconocene complexes . complex <nUm> reacts with LiN(SiMe3)2 to form [(e5-(+)-NMInd)2YN(SiMe3)2] ( 8 ) with retention of configuration . complexes <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> showed moderate to good catalytic activity in asymmetric hydroamination / cyclizations of aminoalkenes , but enantioselectivities were limited to a maximum of <nUm> % ee for the sterically most hindered catalyst <nUm> . the indenyl complex <nUm> is prone to protolytic loss of an indenyl ligand at low ( ≤ <nUm> % ) catalyst loading , if sterically undemanding aminoalkene substrates are applied . 
formal [3+2] cycloaddition reactions between the bis-sulfonium zirconocene - ate dimer { A figure is presented } 1a and methylpropiolate , benzaldehyde and carbon disulfide afforded stable zwitterionic phosphonium zirconocene - ate complexes 2-4 , respectively , with two orthocondensed five - membered heterocycles . x-ray crystal structure of <nUm> has been determined . elemental chalcogens ( S , Se , Te ) gave rise also to a new variety of five - coordinate zirconium(IV) complexes ( 5-7 ) by a formal [3+1] cycloaddition reaction . In these bicyclic zirconates , sulfur is included in a five - membered ring while the second chalcogen is in a four - membered one . 
the unimolecular isomerization mechanism from a secondary <nUm> → <nUm> propene unit promoted by the prototype zirconocene system H2SiCp2Zr+(P) ( P = polymeryl chain ) has been investigated by using density functional theory calculations ( B3LYP ) for both gas and solvent phases . the typical route occurring through b-hydrogen elimination to the metal , olefin rotation around the metal center and olefin reinsertion into the metal hydrogen bond has been calculated by using QM / MM calculations with the ONIOM model in the presence of the counterion CH3 B(C6 F5)3- and compared to the alternative intramolecular reversible formation of a zirconocene allyl dihydrogen complex . our calculations show that the alternative route remains energetically less accessible , at least for the prototype metallocene system used here . 
the reactions of the bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)methylzirconium cation ( 1 ) with four imines have been studied in the gas phase by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry . reactivity of the bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)methylzirconium cation is governed by the availability of a labile hydrogen in the corresponding imine . the products observed differ from those that might be expected in analogy with earlier work on ketones , aldehydes and alkenes ( e.g. , zirconocene e3-enolate and e3-allyl complexes ) : azomethyne / benzylidene species are found instead of enamines ; however , the general reaction mechanism resembles that proposed for ketones and alkenes . an elimination reaction leading to final products was shown to be preceded by a fast migratory insertion / deinsertion equilibrium for alkyl-substituted imines . such an equilibrium is not possible for aryl-substituted imines due to lack of lability of the aryl groups and thus only methane elimination was observed for these imines . 
A unique p-conjugative interaction pattern was experimentally revealed in the doubly acetylide - bridged binuclear group <nUm> metallocene complexes , which was involved in C-C coupling / cleavage reactions of acetylides and s-alkynyl migrations . to elucidate how this multi-center bonding network affects the structural and reaction properties of these complexes , density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations and molecular orbital ( MO ) analysis were carried out on the electronic structure and s-alkynyl migration mechanisms of the doubly acetylide - bridged binuclear Zr complexes , (L2Zr)2(m-C{triple bond , long}CH)2 ( L = cp , Cl ) . the B3LYP calculations suggested that the doubly [s,p] acetylide - bridged complex C2h-(L2Zr)2(m-C{triple bond , long}CH)2 was produced by the reaction of L2Zr(C{triple bond , long}CH)2 with L2Zr through a C2v-(L2Zr)2(m-C{triple bond , long}CH)2 intermediate followed by an isomerization process . In particular , the isomerization of c2h- or C2v-(L2Zr)2(m-C{triple bond , long}CH)2 is almost thermoneutral through a low barrier of <nUm> - <nUm> kcal / mol . the MO walsh diagram revealed that the two isomers have a very similar six-center-six-electron bonding network . the coplanar p-conjunctive interaction by the electron donating and back - donating interactions between the metal centers and acetylide ligands significantly stabilizes the doubly acetylide - bridged binuclear group <nUm> metallocene complexes and the isomerization transition state . 
the ansa-bis(cyclopentadiene) compounds , Me2Si(C5HPh4)(C5H4R) ( r = H ( 2 ) ; but ( 3 ) ) , have been prepared by the reaction of C5HPh4(SiMe2Cl) ( 1 ) with C5H5Na or Li(C5H4But) , respectively , and transformed to the di-lithium derivatives , Li2{Me2Si(C5Ph4)(C5H3R)} ( r = H ( 4 ) ; but ( 5 ) ) , by the action of n-butyllithium . the ansa - zirconocene complexes , [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Ph4)(e5-C5H3R)}Cl2] ( r = H ( 6 ) ; but ( 7 ) ) , were synthesized from the reaction of Cl4Zr with <nUm> or <nUm> , respectively . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> have been tested in the polymerization of ethylene and compared with their methyl-substituted analogues , [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H3R)}Cl2] ( r = H ( 8 ) ; but ( 9 ) ) . whilst <nUm> and <nUm> are catalytically active , the tetraphenyl-substituted complexes <nUm> and <nUm> proved to be inactive in the polymerization of ethylene . this phenomenon has been explained by DFT calculations based on the reaction intermediates in the polymerization processes involving <nUm> and <nUm> , which showed that the extraction of a methyl group from the zirconocene complex to form the cationic active specie is endothermic and therefore unfavourable . 
the reactions of the metallocene dichlorides [(e5-C5H5)2MCl2] , m = Ti and Zr , with the 1,4-di-tert-butyl-1,4-diazabuta-1,3-diene radical anion ( lithium complex ) in diethyl ether reveal a reactivity difference within the series , yielding [(C5H5)TiCl{(t-BuNCH)2}] and [(C5H5)2Zr{(t-BuNCH)2}] through the elimination of C5H5Li and / or ClLi , respectively . we report the x-ray crystal structures of these complexes , and discuss their reactivity patterns and solution fluxional properties . 
from the reaction of super hydride ( LiBEt3H ) with 6-(4-methoxyphenyl) fulvene ( 1a ) , 6-(2-fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl) fulvene ( 1b ) , and 6-(4-N,N-dimethylaminophenyl) fulvene ( 1c ) lithiated cyclopentadienide intermediates ( 2a-c ) were synthesised . these intermediates were then transmetallated to zirconium with Cl4Zr to give benzyl-substituted zirconocenes bis-[(4-methoxybenzyl)cyclopentadienyl] zirconium(IV) dichloride ( 3a ) , bis-[(2-fluoro-4-methoxybenzyl)cyclopentadienyl] zirconium(IV) dichloride ( 3b ) and bis-[(4-N,N-dimethylaminobenzyl)cyclopentadienyl] zirconium(IV) dichloride ( 3c ) . all three zirconocenes were characterised by single crystal x-ray diffraction and preliminary in vitro cell tests were performed with the zirconocene derivatives on the LLC-PK cell line in order to determine their cytotoxicity . zirconocenes 3b and 3c did not show cytotoxicity up to a concentration of <nUm> mM , while 3a exhibited an C50I value of <nUm> mM against LLC-PK . 
syntheses of rac / meso-{PhP(3-t-Bu-C5H3)2}Zr{Me3SiN(CH2)3NSiMe3} ( rac-3 / meso-3 ) and rac / meso-{PhP(3-t-Bu-C5H3)2}Zr{PhN(CH2)3NPh} ( rac-4 / meso-4 ) were achieved by metallation of K2[PhP(3-t-Bu-C5H3)2] · <nUm> THF ( 2 ) with Zr{RN(CH2)3NR}Cl2(THF)2 ( where r = SiMe3 or ph , respectively ) using ethereal solvent . these isomeric pairs were characterized by 1H , 13C{1H} , and 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy ; rac-3 and rac-4 were also examined via single crystal x-ray crystallography . the structures of rac-3 and rac-4 are notable in the tendency of the cyclopentadienyl rings towards e3 coordination . while isolated samples of rac-3 / meso-3 and rac-4 / meso-4 slowly isomerize in tetrahydrofuran-d8 to equilibrium ratios , the isomerization rate for <nUm> is more than 15-fold greater than that for <nUm> . In addition , equilibrium ratios are rapidly reached when isolated samples of rac-3 / meso-3 and rac-4 / meso-4 are exposed to tetrabutylammonium chloride in tetrahydrofuran-d8 solvent . we propose that a nucleophile ( either chloride or the phosphine interannular linker ) brings about dissociation of one cyclopentadienyl ring , thus promoting the rac / meso isomerization mechanism . 
new metallocene dichlorides [ e5-(1,4-Me2-2,3-Ph2-C5H )2TiCl2 ] ( 2 ) , [ e5-(1,4-Me2-2,3-Ph2-C5H )2ZrCl2 ] ( 3 ) and [ e5-(1,4-Me2-2,3-Ph2-C5H )e5-(C5H5)ZrCl2 ] ( 4 ) were prepared from lithium salt of 1,4-dimethyl-2,3-diphenylcyclopentadiene ( 1 ) and [TiCl3(THF)3] , [ZrCl4] and [e5-(C5H5)ZrCl3(DME)] , respectively . compounds 2-4 were characterized by NMR spectroscopy , EI-MS and IR spectroscopy , and the solid state structure of <nUm> was determined by single crystal x-ray crystallography . the catalytic systems <nUm> / MAO and <nUm> / MAO were almost inactive in polymerization of ethylene at 30-50 ° C , however , they exhibited high activity at temperature <nUm> ° C . the catalyst formed from <nUm> and excess of MAO was practically inactive at all temperatures . 
2,4,5-Tri(t-butyl)-1,3-diphospholyl sodium salt ( 2a ) and 3,5-di(t-butyl)-1,2,4-triphospholyl sodium salt ( 3a ) react with Cl4Zr and CpZrCl3 to form (e5-2,4,5-tri(t-butyl)-1,3-diphospholyl)ZrCl3 ( 4 ) , Cp(e5-2,4,5-tri(t-butyl)-1,3-diphospholyl)ZrCl2 ( 5 ) , and Cp(e5-3,5-di(t-butyl)-1,2,4-triphospholyl)ZrCl2 ( 6 ) in the complete absence of water , respectively . surprisingly , bent sandwich complex <nUm> exhibits the NMR spectroscopic characteristics of a hindered ring ligand rotation but the cyclopentadienyl ligand of <nUm> rotates freely in the NMR time scale in spite of the superior space demand of its 2,4,5-tri(t-butyl)-1,3-diphospholyl ligand . this contradiction is discussed on the basis of an attractive interligand P-C interaction between homo- and heterocyclic p-ligands , which is stronger for <nUm> . water even in trace amounts present in the reaction mixture changes the course of the reactions completely . No zirconium p-complexes are accessible this way , but only oligo- or polycyclic organophosphorus compounds . compound 3a and Cl4Zr form the asymmetric tricyclic P6(t-BuC)4H2 isomer <nUm> with two p{double bond , long}C double bonds as a dimer of 1,2,4-triphosphol . it is accompanied by small amounts of ClH addition product <nUm> , where one of the p{double bond , long}C double bonds is eliminated . compound <nUm> contains six , and <nUm> eight stereogenic centers , but both form one pair of enantiomers each only . A single stereoisomer of P6(t-BuC)4H2 cage <nUm> is formed if (1-trimethylstannyl)-3,5-di(t-butyl)-1,2,4-triphosphol 3b is used as the P3(t-BuC)2 source in combination with Cp*ZrCl3 in the presence of trace amounts of water . compound <nUm> is a meso-compound , which is composed by dimerization of either two homochiral units of (R)-3,5-di(t-butyl)-1,2,4-triphosphol 3cR or by two units of its s-enantiomer 3cS . No trace of cyclic addition products has been identified , which would represent the heterochiral combination of enantiomers 3cR + 3cS . P2- and P3 - zirconocene dichloride derivatives <nUm> and <nUm> have been tested as ziegler - natta alkene oligomerization catalysts . both are catalytically active with 1-hexene as the substrate , but can not compete with the activity of the phosphorus - free original catalyst Cp2ZrCl2 . 
zirconocene and titanocene bis(perfluorooctanesulfonate)s were synthesized . In contrast to the corresponding triflates and perchlorates , these compounds are air- and water - stable . they were proved to be ionic on the basis of conductivity measurements and x-ray analysis , allowing these complexes to be stored for months . the strong lewis acidity of these cationic metallocene species , which was proved by ESR study , enabled catalytic glycosylation .

reaction of Sn[(N(C6H3iPr2-2,6)(SiMe3)]2 and [{Sn(N(C6H3iPr2-2,6)(SiMe3)(m-Cl)2] with di-n-butyl-dicyclopentadienylzirconium yielded the trimetallic a carbene - like complex {[(N(C6H3iPr2-2,6)(SiMe3)](n-Bu)Sn}2Cp2Zr . the oxidation of {[(N(C6H3iPr2-2,6)(SiMe3)](n-Bu)Sn}2Cp2Zr by oxygen gives the five - membered dioxadistannazirconacyclic complex {[(N(C6H3iPr2-2,6)(SiMe3)](n-Bu)Sn}2O2Cp2Zr . 
new ansa - zirconocene complexes with amino ( 8-11 ) and alkoxy ( 12 ) substituents attached to the e5-bonded indenyl fragment have been synthesized by the reaction of Cl4Zr with the appropriate dilithium salt in toluene . In addition to HRMS , NMR spectroscopy , and elemental analysis , all new metallocenes have been characterized by single crystal x-ray analysis . crystallographic analysis showed that heteroatom substituents , especially those in the 3-position on the indenyl ligand , have a substantial effect on the structure of metallocenes leading to an increase in the gap aperture in those complexes . slippage of the indenyl fragments toward e3-bonding was found to correlate with the electron donating ability of the substituent in the 3-position , being larger for amino than alkoxy substituents . based upon the amount of slippage , 3-amino-substituted indenyl complexes bear strong resemblance to a fluorenyl complexes . 
the alkenyl substituted fulvene compound , (C5H4){double bond , long}CMe(CH2CH2CH{double bond , long}CMe2 ) ( 1 ) , reacts with one equivalent of LiMe to give the lithium derivative Li{C5H4(CMe2CH2CH 2CH{double bond , long}CMe2 ) } ( 2 ) . the reaction of <nUm> with Me2Si(C5Me4H)Cl gave the ansa - ligand precursor Me2Si(C5Me4H)(C5H <nUm> ( CMe2CH2CH2CH{double bond , long}CMe2 ) ) ( 3 ) , which after the subsequent reaction with <nUm> equivalents of LiBun yielded the dilithium salt Li2{Me2Si(C5Me4) ( C5H3(CMe2CH2CH2CH{double bond , long}CMe2 ) ) } ( 4 ) . the alkenyl-substituted zirconocene complex [ Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4) ( e5-C5H3(CMe2CH2CH 2CH{double bond , long}CMe2))}Cl2 ] ( 5 ) was synthesized by the equimolar reaction of <nUm> and Cl4Zr . <nUm> was characterized by spectroscopic methods and by single crystal x-ray diffraction studies . the zirconocene compound <nUm> has been tested as a catalyst in the polymerization of ethylene at different temperatures and Al : Zr ratios , and also in the co-polymerization of ethylene and 1-octene , observing modest co-monomer incorporations . In addition , the cytotoxic activity of <nUm> was tested against tumour cell lines 8505C anaplastic thyroid cancer , A253 head and neck tumour , A549 lung carcinoma , A2780 ovarian cancer and DLD-1 colon carcinoma . complex <nUm> showed the best cytotoxic activity on A2780 ovarian cancer ( C50I value of <nUm> ± <nUm> mM ) . this represents the highest reported cytotoxic activity of a zirconocene complex on A2780 ovarian cancer . In addition , the cytotoxic activities of <nUm> , have been compared with those obtained using cisplatin . 
In the literature most of the dehydrogenation reactions of alkanes are described as CH activation reactions of cyclooctane . the best results of CH activation reactions have been found for the reaction of MAO activated metallocene complexes and cyclooctane at temperatures over <nUm> ° C . the application of ansa amido functionalized half sandwich compounds of the type Ind'Si(Me)2NtBuMCl2 ( ind' = monosubstituted indenyl ) ; m = Ti , Zr , Hf ) for CH and CC activation reactions is completely unknown in the literature . In contrast to the dehydrogenation reactions of cyclooctane and the metallocene complexes of the group <nUm> metals , where the zirconocene complexes give higher TONs than the titanocene complexes the ansa amido functionalized titanium complexes give more than two times higher TONs than the corresponding Zr or Hf complexes . the ansa amido functionalized ligand increases the TONs for the Ti complexes and decreases the TONs of the Zr complexes . In contrast to the metallocene complexes , the ansa amido functionalized dichloride complexes of Ti show also a higher activity than the corresponding Zr complexes . it is known that the photolysis of organometallic titanium , zirconium and hafnium ( IV ) compounds can give M(III) radicals . the formation of the active Ti metal centre is easier than in the case of the corresponding Zr and Hf metal compounds . 
A new and facile method is presented for the synthesis of zirconocene carboxylate compounds , in which zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) is dissolved in <nUm> m aqueous ClH solution and the requisite ligand is dissolved in an organic solvent . five such compounds [ Cp2ZrCl(m2-O',O''C- C6H5 ) ] ( 1 ) , [ Cp2ZrCl(m2-O',O''C- C6Cl2H3 ) ] ( 2 ) , [ Cp2Zr(m2-O',O''C- C6H3(OH)Cl)2 ] ( 3 ) , [ Cp2Zr(m2-O',O''C- C6H3(OH)(NO2))2 ] ( 4 ) , and [ Cp2Zr(m2-O',O''C- C6H(OH)Cl3)2 ] ( 5 ) have been obtained by this method . the effect of pH on the stability of Cp2ZrCl2 in <nUm> m ClH solution has been investigated by UV / vis spectrophotometry and 1H NMR spectrometry . the results showed that the aqueous Cp2ZrCl2 solutions became less stable with increasing pH , liberating cyclopentadiene . accordingly , at higher pH ( ∼ <nUm> ) , two trinuclear zirconium monocyclopentadienyl compounds , [ (CpZr)3(m2-O',O''C-C 6H3Cl2)3 (m3-OH)(m2-OH)3 ] C7Cl2H3O2 ( 6 ) and [ (CpZr)3(m2-O',O''C-C 6H4Cl)3(m3-OH) (m2-OH)3]Cl2*CH2 Cl (7),were obtained . all compounds 1-7 have been characterized by FT-IR , 1H NMR spectra and elemental analysis . In all of the compounds , the aromatic acid acts as a bidentate ligand in coordinating to the zirconium ; both chelating and bridging modes are observed . x-ray crystallographic studies on <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> have revealed that the geometries at zirconium are distorted octahedral in <nUm> and <nUm> , and distorted trigonal - bipyramidal in <nUm> . 
the catalytic activities of the highly fluorous systems formed by the zirconocene(IV) complexes [Zr{e5-C5H4SiMe2C2H4RF}2Cl2] ( RF = C6F13 ( 4a ) , C10F21 ( 4b ) ) or [Zr-{e5-C5H3(SiMe2C2H4C6F13)2}2Cl2] ( 5a ) and MMAO in toluene have been studied and compared with analogous nonfluorous systems generated from [Zr{e5-C5H4SiMe3}2Cl2] and [Zr{e5-C5H5}2Cl2] . although less active than the reference systems , the fluorous catalysts are stable over prolonged polymerization times , giving rise to polymers with similar molecular weights to those obtained with [Zr{e5-C5H4SiMe3}2Cl2] . 
additive effects of diisobutylaluminum hydride ( DiBAL-H ) was studied in copolymerization of propylene and 1,3-butadiene with a series of C 2-symmetric ansa - bis(indenyl)zirconocene derivatives , i.e. , rac-dimethylsilylbis(2-methyl-4-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 4Ph ) , dichloride , rac-dimethylsilylbis(2-methyl-benzoindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( bz ) , rac-dimethylsilylbis(2-methyl-indenyl) zirconium dichloride ( 2Me ) , rac-dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1-Ind ) , rac-ethylenebis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( et - ind ) , activated by modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) . without DiBAL-H , the activity of the copolymerization decreased in the following order , 2Me > 1-Ind > et - ind > 4Ph ≈ bz , whereas butadiene content decreased in the following order , 4Ph > bz ≥ et - ind ≥ 1-Ind > 2Me ≈ <nUm> mol % . the addition of DiBAL-H affected the activity but hardly changed the butadiene content . the copolymer obtained without DiBAL-H contained the butadiene units of 1,2-insertion ( 1,2-BD ) and 1,4-insertion ( 1,4-BD ) . the addition of DiBAL-H decreased the amount of 1,4-BD and produced hydrogenated 1,4-BD in the 4Ph and bz systems accompanied by the increase of the copolymerization activity . the additive effect of other alkylaluminums was investigated in the bz system , and DEAL-H was found to show the similar effects with DiBAL-H . the 13C NMR analysis of the polymer terminated with deutrated methanol indicated the hydroalumination of 1,4-BD in the bz system . hydroxyl groups can be also introduced by oxidative cleavages of the Al-C bonds . 
the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with 3,5-dicholorosalicylic acid in a CH2Cl2-Et2O system containing ClH ( <nUm> mol L-1 ) , gives a cage half - sandwich cyclopentadienyl- zirconocene compound , [ (CpZr)6(m-O2C-C 6H2Cl2-2-O)9(OH2) 3]*H2O ( 1 ) . the crystal structure of <nUm> shows a twisted tripyramidal prism cage structure with one water molecule in the cage 's cavity . In the cage , the dianionic , substituted salicylate ligands adopt a bridging chelate m2-(O , O' , O'' ) coordination mode . the cage half - sandwich cyclopentadienyl-zirconium compound , [ ( CpZr ) <nUm> ( m-O2C-C6H2Cl 2-2-O)9 (OH2)3]*H 2O ( 1 ) , was synthesized and characterized . the x-ray diffraction analysis shows that a dianionic , substituted salicylate ligand adopts a bridging chelate m2-(O , O' , O'' ) coordination mode and the twisted tripyramidal prism cage structure with one water molecule in the cage 's cavity . 
asymmetric alkylmethyl zirconocene derivatives were readily synthesised from Cp2ZrCl(CH3) , and the appropriate alkyllithium reagent . the alkyl groups contain a silyl functionality on the b-position . these asymmetric dialkyl zirconocenes were successfully activated by B(C 6F5)3 , selectively abstracting the methyl group . the clear difference in the 13C NMR resonances , due to the alkyl groups on the cationic zirconocene made it possible to conclude that selective activation of this class of compounds was possible . 
friedel - crafts cycloalkylation of fluorene with 1,4-dichlorobutane has been studied in different conditions . this reaction allows to obtain the product of exhausting fluorene alkylation , hexadecahydrotetrabenzo[a,c,d,f]fluorene - perspective e5 ligand . the simplest zirconocene has been synthesized and its structure has been confirmed by x-ray diffraction analysis . the molecule of this compound possesses skewed conformation of metallocene fragment with the phenylene moiety of fluorenyl ligand oriented towards the front side of metallocene wedge . 
cp - functionalized monotroticenes [ ( e7-C7H 7)Ti(e5-C5H4E) ] ( <nUm> , e = ph 2SiCl ; <nUm> , e = tBu2SnCl ; <nUm> , e = I ) and bitroticenes [ (e7-C7H7)Ti(e5-C 5H4)]2E' ( <nUm> , E' = PPh ; <nUm> , E' = BN(SiMe3)2 ; <nUm> , E' = Cp2Ti ) were prepared by salt elimination metathesis between the monolithiated troticene [ (e7-C7H7)Ti(e5-C 5H4Li)]*pmdta ( 1b ) ( pmdta = N,N',N' , N'',N''-pentamethyldiethylene-triamine ) and the appropriate electrophile . the troticenyl-substituted zirconocene monochloride [ (e7-C7H7)Ti(e5-C 5H4ZrClCp*2 ) ] ( cp* = e5-C5Me5 ) ( 8 ) and hafnocene ethoxide [ (e7-C7H7)Ti{e5-C 5H4Hf(OEt)Cp2 } ] ( cp = e5-C 5H5 ) ( 11 ) , and the heterobimetallic m-oxo complexes [ (e7-C7H7)Ti(e5-C 5H4MCp2)]2O ( <nUm> , m = Zr ; <nUm> , m = Hf ) were obtained instead of the expected zircona- and hafna[1]troticenophanes by reaction of the dilithiated troticene [ ( e7-C7H 6Li)Ti(e5-C5H4Li)]*pmdta ( 1a ) with [Cp2MCl2] ( m = Zr , Hf ) or [ cp* 2ZrCl2 ] in stoichiometric amounts . these compounds were characterized by single crystal x-ray diffraction analyses and , in the case of <nUm> , <nUm> , 5-7 , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> , also by elemental analyses and 1H , 13C and 119Sn NMR spectroscopy . exposure of the troticenyl organotin chloride <nUm> to moisture resulted in its partial hydrolysis and formation of the organostannoxane - bridged bitroticene <nUm> , while palladium - catalyzed negishi C-C cross-coupling reaction between the troticenylzinc chloride [ ( e7-C7H7 ) Ti(e5-C5H4ZnCl) ] ( 13 ) and the iodotroticene <nUm> or iodobenzene ( PhI ) led to the fulvalene complexes [ ( e7- C7H7)Ti(e5-C5H 4)]2 ( 14 ) and [ ( e7-C7H 7)Ti(e5-C5H4Ph) ] ( 15 ) . compound <nUm> displays an unsymmetrical structure with the troticenyl fragments cis with respect to the Sn-O-Sn core , whereas compound <nUm> is centrosymmetrically trans oriented . 
the energies of formation and the heterolytic dissociation energies for the ion pairs cp' 2ZrMe +A - ( active sites in olefin polymerization ) in the presence of al- and B - containing activators including low-molecular-weight ones X(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ( x = Al , B ) and a number of models for Al - sites in polymethylaluminoxane ( MAO ) were obtained from DFT calculations . the reaction mechanisms were thoroughly studied and the energy characteristics of the reactions of the ion pairs cp' 2ZrMe +A - with ethylene molecule ( cp' = η 5-C 5H <nUm> , η 5- C 5Me <nUm> , A - = MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> - , MeAl(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> - , and [ ( C 6F <nUm> ) 3Al-Me- Al(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - or three models for anions in MAO - containing systems [Me-AOTMA] - , [Me-2AOTMA] - , [Me-3AOTMA] - , AOTMA = me 2AlO(Al 2Me <nUm> ) ) were calculated . heterolytic dissociation energy ( energy needed for complete separation of counterions ) is found to be a crucial parameter which determines the energy characteristics of the polymerization reaction . we propose that the involvement of the second and third lewis acid Al - sites in the formation of the ion pair could explain why high Al : Zr ratios ( > <nUm> for Al(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> and ≫ <nUm> for MAO ) are necessary for a high catalytic activity of zirconocenes , whereas for B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> an equimolar B : Zr ratio is quite sufficient . 
the reaction of a series of dimethyl zirconocenes [ me 2Si(Cp) 2ZrMe <nUm> , <nUm> ; cp t-bu 2ZrMe <nUm> , <nUm> ; cp n-bu 2ZrMe <nUm> , <nUm> ; ind 2ZrMe <nUm> , <nUm> ; cp me4 2ZrMe <nUm> , <nUm> ; cp 2ZrMe <nUm> , <nUm> ] with [ HNMe 2Ph][B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] was investigated by means of NMR spectroscopy . it was found that protonolysis of a Zr-Me group occurred generating a coordinative vacancy at the metal center and methane . cations coming from 1-4 dimethyl precursors bound NMe 2Ph , liberated from the protonation process , and formed zirconaaziridinium ion pairs { [ me 2Si(Cp) 2Zr(e 2-CH 2NMePh)][B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , <nUm> ; [ cp t-bu 2Zr(e 2-CH 2NMePh ) ] [ B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , <nUm> ; [ cp n-bu 2Zr(e 2-CH 2NMePh)][B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , <nUm> ; [ ind 2Zr(e 2-CH 2NMePh)][B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , <nUm> } , reasonably as a consequence of CH activation of one me group of coordinated NMe 2Ph and methane elimination . the intramolecular / interionic structures and dynamics of 7-10 ion pairs were investigated by 1H , 13C and 19F 1D-and 2D - NMR techniques . the reactions of <nUm> and <nUm> ion pairs with 2-methyl-1-heptene afforded stable diastereoisomeric ion pairs bearing a five - member azametallacycle . 
the guanidines (HNi-Pr)2CNAr ( Ar = 4-t-BuC6H <nUm> <nUm> , 4-BrC6H4 <nUm> and 2,4,6-Me3C 6H2 <nUm> ) have been used in the synthesis of the lithium salts [Li{i-PrN(HNiPr)CNAr}(THF)]2 4-6 and [ Li2{(Ni - Pr ) 2CNAr } ] 7-9 . complexes [ Zr{k2,N,N'-(Ni-Pr) (NAr)CNH(i-Pr)}2Cl2 ] ( Ar = 4-t-BuC6H <nUm> <nUm> , 4-BrC6H4 <nUm> , 2,4,6-Me3C 6H2 <nUm> ) , which contain an asymmetrical monoanionic guanidinate ligand coordinated to the zirconium atom , were obtained by protonolysis of 1-3 in the presence of NEt3 or by a metathesis reaction of 4-6 with Cl4Zr . the zirconocene complexes [ Zr(e5-C5H5)2{k 2,N,N'-(Ni-Pr)(NAr)CNH(i-Pr)}Cl ] ( Ar = 4-t-BuC 6H4 <nUm> , 4-BrC6H4 <nUm> , 2,4,6-Me 3C6H2 <nUm> ) and [ Zr(e5-C 5H5)2{k2,N,N'-(Ni-Pr) 2CNAr } ] ( Ar = 4-t-BuC6H4 <nUm> , 4-BrC 6H4 <nUm> , 2,4,6-Me3C6H2 <nUm> ) were synthesized by metathesis reactions of the corresponding lithium salts and Zr(e5-C5H5)2Cl2 . complexes 16-18 exhibit dynamic behavior in solution and this was studied by variable - temperature NMR experiments . the molecular structures of <nUm> and <nUm> were determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . 
reactions between trimethylaluminum and selected zirconocene and hafnocene polymerization catalysts have been computationally studied at the MP2 / TZVP level of theory . dichloride precatalyst alkylation and the subsequent activation by ligand abstraction with trimethylaluminum were explored as a function of the catalyst structure . the alkylation reactions were found to proceed via two alternative routes depending on the structure of the catalyst . concerning the activation of the alkylated precatalyst , interaction between trimethylaluminum and metallocene weakens the metal - ligand s-bond , hence facilitating olefin uptake to some extent . modification of the chemical environment of the lewis-acidic Al site towards environments likely present in methylaluminoxane further facilitates the reaction , supporting the critical role of methylaluminoxane in catalyst activation . 
the paper is devoted to a study of the reaction of terminal alkene cycloalumination by AlEt3 catalyzed with neomenthylindenyl zirconium complexes (p-S)(p-S)-bis[e5-[1-[(1S,2S,5R)-2-isopropyl-5- methylcycloh-exyl]indenyl]]zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) or (p-S)-(e5- cyclopentadienyl)[e5-[1-[(1S,2S,5R)-2-isopropyl-5- methylcyclohexyl]indenyl]]zirconium dichloride ( 2 ) . it was shown that alkene and catalyst structures , as well as solvent , affect the overall yield and enantiomeric excess of the reaction product - 3-alkylsubstituted aluminacyclopentanes . the reaction of terminal alkenes with AlEt3 , catalyzed by complex <nUm> , in hydrocarbon solvents gives predominantly s-enantiomers of cyclic organoaluminum compounds with enantiomeric excess up to <nUm> % . complex <nUm> shows smaller stereoinduction effect and provides r-enantiomers of aluminacyclopentanes with 6-26 % ee . the effectiveness of selenium - containing derivatizing reagent (R)-2-phenylselenopropanoic acid for the enantiomeric excess estimation in b-alkyl-1,4-butanediols obtained from cyclic organoaluminum compounds was shown . 
air - stable binuclear complex of bis(methylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium perfluorooctanesulfonate ( 1a ) was successfully synthesized by the reaction of (CH3Cp)2ZrCl2 with C8F 17SO3Ag . the compound 1a was characterized by different techniques and found to have the nature of air - stability , water tolerance , thermally - stability and strong lewis-acidity . In addition , its solubility was higher than that of our previously reported uninuclear zirconocene bis(perfluorooctanesulfonate) . it showed high catalytic efficiency in the friedel - crafts acylation of alkyl aryl ethers and the mannich reaction and could be reused . 















two different supported zirconocene , that is , bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 , catalysts were synthesized . each catalyst was used to prepare one ethylene homopolymer and one ethylene-1-hexene copolymer . catalyst active center multiplicity and polymer crystallization kinetics were modeled . five separate active center types were predicted , which matched the successive self - nucleation and annealing ( SSA ) peak temperatures . the predicted crystallinity well matched the differential scanning calorimetric ( DSC ) values for a single avrami - erofeev index , which ranged between <nUm> and <nUm> for the polymers experimented . the estimated apparent crystallization activation energy ea did not vary with cooling rates , relative crystallinity α , and crystallization time or temperature . therefore , the concept of variable / instantaneous activation energy was not found to hold . ea linearly increased with the weight average lamellar thickness lwav DSC - GT ; and for each homopolymer , it exceeded that of the corresponding copolymer . higher ea , hence slower crystallization , was identified as a pre-requisite to attain higher crystallinity . crystallization parameters were correlated to polymer backbone parameters , which are influenced by catalyst active center multiplicity . 
the silica - supported MAO was in situ- and ex situ immobilized with zirconocene catalyst to produce ethylene copolymers . the in situ catalytic system exhibited higher activities compared with the ex situ one . the ethylene / 1-hexene ( EH ) copolymerization showed the highest activities for both catalytic systems . 13C NMR revealed that the copolymers produced in all systems were random copolymers . In addition , the in situ system resulted in narrow molar mass distributions ( MMD ) for all copolymers indicating a uniform catalytic site present . 
the present study revealed the effect of different O2Ti nanoparticles employed on catalytic and characteristic properties of LLDPE / O2Ti nanocomposites synthesized by the in situ polymerization with zirconocene / dMMAO catalyst . it was found that the presence of rutile phase in titania apparently resulted in decreased activities due to low intrinsic activity of active sites being present . based on 13C NMR results , all LLDPE / O2Ti samples exhibited the random copolymer having different degree of 1-hexene insertion . the highly dispersion of titania can enhance the degree of 1-hexene insertion resulting in decreased crystallinity . 

In the present study , the nanoSiO2 and nanoZrO2 were used as the fillers for linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) nanocomposites . In fact , the LLDPE nanocomposites were synthesized via the in situ polymerization of ethylene / 1-octene with a zirconocene / MAO catalyst in the presence of the fillers . the LLDPE - nanocomposites were further characterized by means of TEM , DSC , 13C NMR and XPS . it was found that productivity increased more when the nanoZrO2 filler was applied . the similar distribution for both fillers was observed by TEM . based on the 13C NMR results , it appeared that the LLDPE nanocomposites obtained from both fillers were random copolymer . In particular , the resulted binding energy and elemental concentration at surface obtained from XPS measurement were further discussed in more details . 

the controlled radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate initiated by the ferrocene - zirconocene dichloride-benzoyl peroxide system was found to occur as a living radical process with an increased concentration of sindio-triads in the resulting poly(methyl methacrylate ) . 




comparative theoretical analysis of optimized geometries and electronic structures of Cp2ZrCl2 / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) system and its interactions with a third component was performed . the additive studied was a lewis acid compound : AlCl3 . density functional theory ( DFT ) , that included exchange and correlation effects , was employed with gaussian basis sets . additive enhances the cocatalyst lewis acid character and , indirectly , it modifies the electrophilicity of Zr atom . by comparing the geometrical structure and charge distribution of the site with and without AlCl3 it is possible to understand the reasons of polymerization performance improvement . previous experimental results for these systems have showed a notable increase in ethylene and propylene polymerization activity . 
In this paper , an electrochemical study of the metallocene / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and metallocene / trimethylaluminium ( TMA ) species is presented . the metallocenes used were [ (CH3)2Si(Cp) 2ZrCl2 ] and [(Cp)2ZrCl2] . the evaluation of the metallocene / MAO and metallocene / TMA systems was based on the analysis of the redox potentials of the solutions with different Al / Zr molar ratios using acetonitrile as solvent . the results obtained for Al / Zr ratios lower than <nUm> , suggested that in presence of TMA or MAO , the formed monomethylated species are [(L)ZrIV(CH3)Cl] , L = cyclopentadienyl (Cp)2 or (CH3)2Si(Cp) <nUm> . for Al / Zr molar ratios higher than <nUm> , the results obtained in TMA presence are in agreement with the formation of the species [ (L)Zr IV(CH3)(m-CH3)Al(CH3) 2]+ , while in MAO presence the ionic pair , [ (L)Zr IVCH3]+[MAOCl]- , is formed . there 's a general agreement that these are active species in olefin polymerization . 
functionalized metallocene precursors ( BrMe2SiC 5H4)CpZrBr2 ( 1 ) , ( BrMe2SiC 5H4)2ZrBr2 , ( 2 ) ( Br 2MeSiC5H4)2ZrBr2 ( 3 ) , and [1,3-(BrMe2Si)2C5H3] 2ZrBr2 ( 4 ) were immobilized on partially dehydroxylated silica ( PDS ) and screened for ethylene polymerization in slurry reactions conducted in toluene using methylalumoxane ( MAO ) as the cocatalyst . the effects of metallocene precursor structure , catalyst immobilization method , and catalyst loading are presented in terms of catalytic activity , polymer molecular weight distribution , and stability of the catalysts toward leaching . 
the catalytic cyclo-oligomerization of ethene by metallocene complexes Cp2ZrCl2 with Et3Al as cocatalyst in the presence of Mg - containing third - components is described . under optimal conditions ( Cp2ZrCl2 / Et3Al / Et2Mg = <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> , <nUm> ° C , C2H4P = <nUm> MPa ) the reaction afforded <nUm> % of cyclic oligomers , including exo-methylenecyclopentane ( <nUm> % ) and a small amount of methylcyclopentane ( <nUm> % ) , 1-methyl-1-ethylcyclopentane ( <nUm> % ) and vinylcyclohexane ( <nUm> % ) , along with usual open - chain alkenes . when the p-ligand was changed to e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl and indenyl ( ind ) or Cp2TiCI2 was used in place of cp 2ZrCl2 , the selectivity of exo-methylenecyclopentane dropped dramatically to 1-8 % . In contrast , the catalytic reactions by post-metallocene complexes L2ZrCl2 ( L2 = salen , salphen ) under identical conditions generated open - chain alkenes exclusively . A zirconacyclopentane mechanism is proposed to explain the products formed in cyclo-oligomerization of ethene . 
this work presents a 23-1 factorial planning designed to evaluate the effect of some parameters of the metallocene immobilization route in the ethylene polymerization . the highest ethylene polymerization activity was observed for the catalyst synthesized using TMA as modifier agent , in the inverse addition order , and impregnation temperature of <nUm> ° C . these results indicated that the immobilization route played an important role on the catalysts performance . UV - vis DRS results suggested the formation of MAO - like species on the silica surface . these species may be formed from the reaction of TMA either with water adsorbed on the support or OH groups of the silica surface . DSC analyses indicated that the crystallinity of these polymers varied as a function of the catalytic activity , the more active catalysts producing polymers with higher crystallinity . the obtained polymers presented melting point around <nUm> ° C , typical of commercial polyethylene . 
this work presents the results of homopolymerization of ethylene using an hybrid system (nBuCp)2ZrCl2-Cp2ZrCl <nUm> , supported on silica . the catalytic systems were analyzed by RBS , DRIFTS and EXAFS and polyethylenes ( PE ) by GPC and DSC . the catalytic activities and the polymer properties showed dependence on the different ratio used (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 / Cp2ZrCl2 at the preparation step . theoretical studies permit us to conclude that the metallocenes interact with the surface in different ways . depending on the addition order and the molar ratio between both metallocenes , distribution and nature of active species would be different . possibility of binuclear active sites with different propagation and termination constants is analyzed and discussed . EHMO calculations allow us to conclude that Cp2ZrCl <nUm> has a strong affinity by AIS plane , whereas ( nBuCp ) 2ZrCl2 shows similar affinity for both silica planes . 
the influence of the concentration of CPh3+B(C 6F5)4- as the activator for metallocene polymerisation catalysts has been quantified . whereas typically a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio of activator and metallocene dialkyl is employed , in line with the expected stoichiometry of alkyl abstraction , significant increases in the productivity of some - but not all - propene polymerisation catalysts have been found . the effect is particularly marked for catalysts with more open structures , such as the constrained - geometry complex ( C5Me 4SiMe2NBut)TiCl2 , where the activity could be increased by about an order of magnitude . most catalysts show an optimum CPh3+ / Zr ratio , beyond which further increases of [CPh3+] has no effect . while some zirconocenes reach activities of up to <nUm> × <nUm> g PP ( mol zr)-1 [ C 3H6]-1 h-1 ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> bar ) , other , typically less active zirconocenes do not show a trityl response at all . possible reasons for this effect are discussed . 
homoleptic and mixed a-zirconium phosphonates ( ZrPs ) a-Zr(O3PR)2 ( r = me , bun , bui , hex , oct and ph ) and a-Zr(O3PR1) 2-x(O3PR2)x were readily prepared in high yields from zirconyl choride and the corresponding phosphonic acids in suitable solvent mixtures under hydrothermal conditions at low fluoride concentrations . they form crystalline aggregates consisting of platelets from ca. 10-20 monolayers thickness , with well - defined surface structures . impregnation with Cp2ZrCl2 by sublimation or slurry methods provided the first examples of PZr - supported alkene polymerization catalysts . crystal morphology and interlayer spacing are unaffected by the impregnation process . solid - state NMR spectroscopy provides evidence for the integrity of the adsorbed metallocene structure . covalent attachment of Cp*ZrCl3 to functionalized ZrPs of the type a-Zr(O 3PR1)1.8(O3PCnH 2nOH)0.2 is similarly possible . the new catalysts polymerize ethene with good to excellent activities under mild conditions , even at remarkably low methylalumoxane / zirconocene ratios of <nUm> : <nUm> . the polymer is obtained as free - flowing particles , which reflect the morphology of the catalyst supports . 
the reactivity of Cp2ZrCl2 towards partially dehydroxylated silica was evaluated and the effects of chemical modification of this silica were studied . different modified silicas were prepared by reaction of the original partially dehydroxylated silica with silicon ethers , EtOSiMe3 and (Me3Si)2O , or a silazane , ( me 3Si)2NH . the resulting materials were activated with MAO and the catalytic systems were evaluated in ethylene polymerization . the different reactions were monitored by FT-IR spectroscopy . the catalysts were characterized by elemental analysis as well as by infrared and UV - vis spectroscopy . grafting of organosilanes occurs by reaction with reactive siloxane bridges . the new SiR3 groups formed on the surface react with Cp2ZrCl2 to form volatile ClSiMe3 and oxo zirconium species . these latter species are active , after the addition of MAO , in ethylene polymerization . the effects caused by changing the nature of the modifier in the grafting reaction with the metallocene , as well as the catalytic activities of the resulting materials , are presented and discussed . 
IR spectroscopy has been used to study the interaction of silica with PhNEt <nUm> ( N ) and B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ( B ) and subsequent interaction of the support OSi <nUm> / [ N + B ] with dimethylzirconocene me 2Si(2-Me-Ind) 2ZrMe <nUm> ( " Zr " ) . the data were obtained on the composition of the surface compounds appeared at both stages of catalyst synthesis . it has been shown that ( B ) and ( N ) interact with OH groups of silica to form ionic pair [ HNR <nUm> ] +[(C 6F <nUm> ) 3BOSi ] - ( IP-1 ) . cation fragment of this pair contains highly reactive NH bond with a.b. at <nUm> cm <nUm> . it has been found that NH groups in a part of IP-1 complexes react with neighboring OH groups of silica by hydrogen bonding that gives complexes IP-2 . it has been shown that " Zr " complexes interact both with complexes IP-1 and IP-2 . As " Zr " reacts with IP-1 , zirconium ionic complexes IP-3 containing ZrMe bond are formed on silica . these complexes are suggested to be the precursor of the polymerization active sites . the reaction of " Zr " with IP-2 , most likely , produces surface zirconium compound containing no ZrMe bonds and inactive for propylene polymerization . IR spectroscopy has been used to study the interaction of silica with PhNEt <nUm> ( N ) and B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ( B ) and subsequent interaction of the support OSi <nUm> / [ N + B ] with dimethylzirconocene me 2Si(2-Me-Ind) 2ZrMe <nUm> ( RL 2ZrMe <nUm> ) . the data were obtained on the composition of the surface compounds appeared at both stages of catalyst synthesis . 
the catalytic properties of ( r XPh ) 2C(Cp)(Flu)MCl <nUm> complexes ( r x = Cl , F or CF <nUm> ; m = Zr or Hf ) in propylene polymerization were studied . the results showed dependences of stereospecificity and polymerization activity on the substituent on phenyl group . when r x is CF <nUm> , the activity is <nUm> times of that of the complex with no substituent at <nUm> atm propylene pressure and is extremely high at <nUm> MPa propylene pressure . the CF <nUm> group increased the regioirregular insertion during polymerization to produce partially crystalline s-PP . when r x is halogen , the obtained polymer has higher melting point than that obtained from the complex with no substituent . 
the meso ansa zirconocene with dimethylsilyl bridge , activated by methylalumoxane , catalyses the ethylene polymerization , producing ethyl-branched polyethylene . with respect to the polymers obtained with the previously investigated meso zirconocenes , we have found higher branching amount and lower molecular weight . the rapid b-H transfer from the growing chain to the coordinated monomer could account for both these features of the polymer . the investigation on the structural parameters of the complex , through x-ray diffraction analysis , and on the electrophilicity of the cationic center , through NMR experiments , suggests , as a possible rationalization of this behavior , the obstruction in the inward site . 
silica-poly[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate-co-4-vinylpyridine ] inorganic - organic hybrid ( SMV ) has been synthesized , and by loading zirconocene catalyst on the carrier , novel zirconocene supported catalyst has been made and tested for ethylene polymerization . the silica monomer ( SM ) is prepared by coupling reaction of hydroxyl group of silica surface with 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate ( MPS ) and then , SMV is synthesized by copolymerization of SM with 4-vinylpyridine . the formation of SM and SMV has been confirmed by FTIR , solid - state 13C NMR , XPS , and elemental analysis ( EA ) . loading Cp2ZrCl2 on SMV resulted in the zirconocene supported catalyst . ethylene polymerization data demonstrate that the SMV supported catalyst has higher activity than the SM supported one and yields polyethylene with much higher molecular weight than that produced by the corresponding homogeneous zirconocene catalyst . 
UV / vis in diffusion reflection mode ( DRS ) and DRIFT spectroscopy have been used to study the surface zirconocene species formed at the interaction of Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 and Me2Si(Ind) 2ZrMe2 complexes with the MAO / O2Si support . effect of additional activation of these catalysts with TIBA has been studied as well . structure of type [Me2Si(Ind)2ZrMe] +[MeMAO]- ( C ) is formed at the reaction of me 2Si(Ind)2ZrMe2 complex with MAO / O2Si ( a.b. at <nUm> nm in UV / vis spectra ) . interaction of this complex with TIBA results in the formation of new structure ( d ) with a.b. at <nUm> nm in UV / vis spectra . the surface species of different composition and structures are formed at interaction of Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 complex with MAO / O2Si . the ratio between these species depends on the zirconium content in the Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO / OSi <nUm> catalysts . according to the DRIFTS data ( CO and ethylene adsorption ) and ethylene polymerization data these catalysts contain active ZrMe bonds but activity of these catalysts at ethylene polymerization is low . interaction of Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO / OSi <nUm> with TIBA leads to the formation of the new cationic structure of type ( d ) with a.b. at <nUm> nm in UV / vis spectra and great increasing of activity at ethylene polymerization . 
under atmospheric pressure , nano-polyethylene fibres were prepared via in situ ethylene extrusion polymerization , with MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) catalytic systems , respectively . the effects of the geometrical structures and surface properties of MCM-41 and SBA-15 on the morphology of the resultant polyethylene , catalytic activity and polymerization rate were investigated and compared in various polymerization conditions . the possible formation mechanism of nano-polyethylene fibres with MCM-41 and SBA-15 supported Cp2ZrCl2 as catalyst was discussed . 
In the presence of hydrogen and of (R,R)-ethylenebis tetrahydroindenyl zirconium dichloride activated by methylalumoxane , the styrene can be fully converted into low molecular weight compounds . the kinetic picture of the hydrooligomers formation is made complicated by the irregular regiochemistry of the styrene insertion . however the study on the effect of the feed composition on the products composition allows inferring mechanistic hypothesis and optimizing the formation of the chiral product , (R)-1,3-diphenylbutane . the subsequent functionalization of this molecule , without loss of chirality , discloses the potentiality of such kind of catalytic system for the synthesis of optically active synthones . 
the new ansa - complexes (R-Ph)2C(Cp)(Ind)MCl2 ( r = CF3 , F , Cl ; m = Ti , Zr or Hf ) were synthesized from the reaction of dilithium salt of the corresponding ligands with appropriate group <nUm> metal halides . they were tested for ethylene homopolymerization and copolymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) at various ethylene pressures and temperatures . In the case of zirconocenes , complexes <nUm> ( r = CF3 ) and <nUm> ( r = Cl ) demonstrated much higher catalytic activity than complexes <nUm> ( Ph2C(Cp)(Ind)ZrCl2 ) and <nUm> ( r = F ) in ethylene polymerization . the same trend was observed in titanocenes and hafnocenes . the electronic and geometric effects of substituents at the phenyl group on the polymerization activity were easily noticed . for the ethylene / 1-hexene or 1-octene copolymerization , <nUm> also showed the highest catalytic activity , and the copolymers from complex <nUm> possessed the highest 1-hexene and 1-octene contents . 
the reactivity of the silyl ether - substituted zirconocene [ Zr{e5-C5H4(CH2) 3OSiMe3}(e5-C5H5) Cl ] ( 1 ) towards dehydroxylated silica was evaluated and comparative studies with respect to the unmodified analogue [ Zr(e5-C5H5)2Cl <nUm> ] ( 2 ) were performed . the different reactions were monitored by FT-IR spectroscopy . the resulting materials were activated with MAO and the catalytic systems were evaluated in ethylene polymerization . the catalysts were characterized by elemental analysis as well as by FT-IR and UV - vis spectroscopy . In addition to the classical reaction between zr{single bond}Cl bonds and acidic silanol surface groups , grafting of complex <nUm> occurs to some extent by reaction between the silyl ether group and reactive siloxane bridges on the silica surface . In contrast , complex <nUm> , as one would expect , only reacts through the zr{single bond}Cl groups . supporting zirconocene <nUm> on MAO - modified silica gives rise to a more efficient catalyst . the effects caused by these different grafting reactions , as well as the catalytic activities of the resulting materials , are presented and discussed . 
mixtures consisting of zirconocene difluorides C p'2 Zr F ( cp' = substituted or nonsubstituted e5-cyclopentadienyl ) as pre-catalysts and diisobutylaluminumhydride i-Bu2AlH as activator were found to be active catalysts in the room - temperature hydrodefluorination ( HDF ) of fluorinated pyridines . evaluation of these systems established rac - (ebthi)ZrF2 ( 1 ) and Cp2ZrF2 ( 3 ) together with i-Bu2AlH as active catalysts in the room - temperature hydrodefluorination ( HDF ) of pentafluoro-pyridine . the active species for the conversion were the actually formed hydrides [rac-(ebthi)ZrH(m-H)]2 ( 2 ) and [Cp2ZrH(m-H)]2 ( 4 ) . the results we obtained ( rt , <nUm> h , turn over number <nUm> ) showed a significantly better performance compared to other investigations published before for this HDF reaction . 
the ansa - indene compound {1-Me2Si(3-C9H6Et)2} ( 1 ) was prepared by alkylation of the unsubstituted ansa - indene . this compound was converted , by reaction with nBuLi , to the dilithium compound [Li2{1-Me2Si(3-C9H5Et)2}] ( 2 ) . ansa - zirconocene [Zr{1-Me2Si(3-e5-C9H5Et)2}Cl2] ( 3 ) was prepared by the reaction of Cl4Zr with <nUm> in ether / toluene at <nUm> ° C . the molecular structure of meso-3 was determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction studies . the ansa - zirconocene <nUm> exhibits a greater activity in ethylene polymerization than reference complexes such as [Zr{1-Me2Si(e5-C9H6)2}Cl2] and [Zr{1-C2H4(e5-C9H5)2}Cl2] and , in addition , it maintained a reasonable level of activity after <nUm> h of contact with MAO solution . furthermore , the different elementary steps in the activation process of ethylene polymerization for substituted complexes [Zr{1-Me2Si(3-e5-C9H5R)2}Cl2] ( r = et <nUm> , me <nUm> , nPr <nUm> and nBu <nUm> ) by commercial methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) have been studied by UV - vis spectroscopy . addition of MAO in large excess ( [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> ) at <nUm> ° C yields a previously unreported intermediate in the activation process of metallocenes ; this intermediate has an absorption band centered at λ = <nUm> nm . we report here the influence of the type of catalyst , ring substitution , type of cocatalyst and addition of THF on the activation process of these metallocenes . 
heterogeneous zirconocene catalysts were prepared with an unconventional method by grafting mesoporous silica SBA-15 fiber with Cl4Zr in gas or liquid phase and subsequently with lithium salt of cyclopentadiene ( cp ) or indene ( ind ) . In order to obtain a better understanding of the bonding modes of the zirconium and the ligands , the ZrClx / O2Si and ZrClxL / O2Si were now for the first time characterized by several techniques , including elemental analysis , FTIR spectroscopy , 1H MAS NMR and 13C CP MAS NMR . the results verify the e5-bonding of the ligands to the metal center , which in turn was discovered to be both mono- and bifunctionally bonded to the silica . the catalysts were tested in ethylene polymerization , in which they yielded polyethylene with moderate activities . 
the group <nUm> ansa - metallocene complexes with chiral substituent bearing cyclopentadienyl ligands , [ M{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e 5-C5H3{CHRR'})}Cl2 ] ( r = pri , R' = me ( 9 ) ; r = pri , R' = ph ( 10 ) ; r = but , R' = me ( 11 ) ; r = but , R' = ph ( 12 ) ; m = Zr ( a ) , Hf ( b ) ) , were synthesized by the reaction of the dilithium compounds , Li2{Me2Si(C5Me4)(C5 H3{CHRR'} ) } ( r = pri , R' = me ( 5 ) ; r = pri , R' = ph ( 6 ) ; r = but , R' = me ( 7 ) ; r = but , R' = ph ( 8 ) ) , with the tetrachloride salts of the transition metal . the molecular structures of 11a and 12a have been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies . the catalytic behaviour of 9-12 in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene has been studied . isotactic polypropylene with [mmmm] pentads of the order of <nUm> % were obtained with the C1 symmetric ansa - zirconocene catalysts .

heterogeneous olefin polymerisation catalysts were prepared by combining zirconocene with a series of purely siliceous and Al - containing MCM-41 supports with different Si / Al ratios , using simplified and improved versions of the well - known direct impregnation and " MAO pre-treatment " methods . the catalysts were tested in ethylene polymerisation . analysis of polymerisation activities and kinetic profiles led to a rationalisation on the effect of support Si / Al ratios and methods used for catalyst preparation over the catalytic behaviour for ethylene polymerisations . polymers were characterised by scanning electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry . A mechanism is proposed to associate the formation or absence of fibrous morphology with polymerisation activities . 
an MCM-41 has been modified by grafting several zirconocene complexes to give new materials potentially active in the polymerization of a-olefins . these materials have been activated by the cocatalyst MAO , to generate the catalysts MCM - <nUm> / metallocene / MAO ( metallocene = [Zr(e5-C5H5)2Cl2] ( 1 ) , [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}Cl2] ( 2 ) and [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H3But)}Cl2] ( 3 ) ) . the resulting functionalized ordered mesoporous silica samples ( 1-3 ) were tested as catalysts in the polymerization of ethylene and compared with both the homogeneous system analogues and the functionalized silica derivatives SG / metallocene / MAO ( SG = silica gel ; metallocene = [Zr(e5-C5H5)2Cl2] ( 4 ) , [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}Cl2] ( 5 ) and [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H3But)}Cl2] ( 6 ) ) . the metallocenes <nUm> and <nUm> have been characterized by 13C-CP MAS NMR and 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy . the structure and surface properties of MCM-41 / [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}Cl2] and MCM-41 / [Zr{Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5-C5H4)}Cl2] / MAO systems have been studied by x-ray diffractometry , nitrogen adsorption - desorption isotherms measurement and thermogravimetry . the grafting of the metallocene complexes , activation with MAO and subsequent polymerization reaction have been followed by an FT-IR " in situ " study . scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy have been used to show the morphology of the heterogeneous catalysts as well as the resulting polyethylene obtained . 
ethylene polymerization using catalysts derived from activation of zirconocene aluminohydride complexes , supported on silica , pretreated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , is described . the novel catalyst compositions were compared to those using conventional zirconocene dichloride complexes and characterized by SEM / EDX and DRIFT spectroscopy . supported catalysts were prepared which featured various surface Al : Zr ratios . when using excess MAO as both activator and scavenger , the catalysts containing the most Zr per g of support gave rise to the most active formulations ; the high activities in the presence of excess MAO are due , in part , to catalyst leaching prior to and / or during polymerization . when tri-isobutylaluminum ( TIBAL ) was used as scavenger , the supported catalysts that featured a higher surface Al : Zr ratio had higher activity than those prepared at the lower Al : Zr ratios . the activity of the aluminohydride complexes was significantly higher than that of the corresponding dichloride complexes , when activated by MAO while the in the presence of TIBAL , there was little difference in performance between the two catalyst precursors . 
several Ga-MCM-41 materials , prepared using different synthesis and template removal procedures , were used for the immobilisation of Cp2ZrCl2 by a direct impregnation method . supports were carefully characterised by XRD , N adsorption , ICP - AES , AAS , XPS and FTIR ( using pyridine as probe molecule for acid sites ) , in order to assess their structural features , chemical composition ( bulk and surface ) and surface acidity properties . supported catalysts were tested for the polymerisation of ethylene , using methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst / activator . the relationships established between concentration / strength of acid sites of Ga-MCM-41 and the catalytic performance of zirconocene dichloride supported in these materials demonstrate that the behaviour of the catalytic systems analysed in this paper is compatible with existing models for the interaction of single - site olefin polymerisation catalysts with other inorganic acidic oxides . 
zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) supported on montmorillonite K-10 , which has previously been shown to be an efficient catalytic system for olefin polymerization , was found to be comparable to the highly activated homogeneous combination of Cp2ZrCl2 and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , and more reactive than the originally reported homogeneous catalytic system of Cp2ZrCl2 / Me3Al in the methylalumination reaction of an aryl substituted terminal alkyne . examination of solvent effects in the ethylalumination reaction using Cp2ZrCl2 supported on montmorillonite K-10 , O2Si / HLiO , and O2Si / MgO , indicated that the anionic counterpart of the actual catalytically active zirconocenium cation is highly delocalized , thus suggesting that the actual active zirconocenium cation is only very weakly coordinating with the anionic moiety . this accounts for the high activity of systems using solids such as co-catalysts and as supporting materials in olefin polymerization in general . 
this paper presents a study of the effects of different treatments on the polymerization activity of modified clays as cocatalysts . to achieve this goal , an intercalating cation was introduced into two smectites and these clays were then modified with trimethyl aluminium . the results for ethylene polymerization , when a zirconocene complex was used as catalyst , and the structure analysis , allow us to obtain interesting deductions about the generation mode of the active species . all active materials employed as support activators presented aluminium in a pentahedral environment together with acidic hydrogen atoms . these two features were detected only after TMA treatment and they seem to be crucial elements in active cocatalyst generation . moreover , a material without structural aluminium displayed the best activity pointing to the new aluminium species generated in the solid matrix as the determining factor for the activity . we proposed a synergic effect between lewis acid aluminium centres and acidic bronsted protons that generate the AlHOSi groups that activate the zirconium compound . 



the reaction of the edge - bridged open zirconocene , Zr(6,6-dmch)2(PMe3)2 ( dmch = dimethylcyclohexadienyl ) with two equivalents of PhC2SiMe3 leads to a <nUm> + <nUm> + <nUm> ring construction , resulting in a 4.3.1 bicyclodecadienyl skeleton . the resulting complex , with e3-allyl , e4-diene , and e5-dienyl coordination , has a formal <nUm> electron configuration , and contains close contacts between the metal center and two lengthened C-C bonds , indicative of weak agostic interactions . 
A new chiral ansa - metallocene catalyst , namely rac-dimethylsilyl-bis(2,4,6- trimethyl-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) , has been synthesized and used as a catalyst for isospecific polymerization of propylene , with methyl aluminoxane ( MAO ) as the cocatalyst . the influences of polymerization temperature ( T p ) on the polymerization activity , polypropylene ( PP ) microstructure and polymer properties are investigated , and the results are compared with rac-dimethylsilyl-bis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride congener ( 2 ) under identical conditions . <nUm> / MAO has a very high activity for propylene polymerization at 50-70 ° C and <nUm> atm propylene pressure . A beneficial feature of catalyst <nUm> is its higher stability at elevated temperature than <nUm> . At tp = <nUm> ° C , the novel catalyst shows a great improvement in terms of stereoregularity , with [mmmm] = <nUm> % and Tm = <nUm> ° C , while <nUm> displays [mmmm] of <nUm> % and Tm of <nUm> ° C under the same conditions . the regiospecificity of <nUm> / MAO is also better than <nUm> / MAO .

the reaction of phenylvinylboron chloride ( 11 ) with allylethylamine afforded (N-allyl-N-ethylamino)vinylphenylborane ( 12 ) which on treatment with <nUm> mol % grubbs catalyst gave 1-ethyl-2,5-dihydro-2-phenyl-1H-1,2-azaborole ( 13 ) . the reaction of <nUm> with LDA in ether gave lithium 1-ethyl-2-phenyl-1H-1,2- azaborolide ( 14 ) , which was silylated with Me2SiCl2 to afford <nUm> . reaction of <nUm> with CpLi followed by LDA and then Cl4Zr gave bridged compound <nUm> . the reaction of <nUm> with <nUm> followed by LDA and then Cl4Zr gave the bridged complex <nUm> . the reaction of <nUm> with Cp*ZrCl3 gave <nUm> . the x-ray crystal structures of <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> show that they closely resemble the corresponding zirconocene dichlorides . on activation with excess methylaluminoxane <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> form active catalysts from the polymerization of ethylene .

the synthesis , characterization and reactivity of novel carbometalla[2]ferrocenophanes (e-C5Me4)Fe(e- C5H4)CH2ER2 ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) ( e = Pb , r = ph or e = Zr , r = ( e-C5H5 ) ) are reported . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> were prepared by the reaction of the dilithiated species (e-C5Me4)Fe(e-C5H4Li)CH 2Li · xTMEDA with the appropriate dichlorodiorganoplumbane or dichlorozirconocene in low yields ( ca. <nUm> % ) . the Pb species <nUm> was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR , and MS , however it could not be cleanly separated from pentamethylferrocene . moreover , it was found that the C-Pb bonds of <nUm> underwent facile cleavage , and under ambient light or at room temperature , <nUm> decomposed to Pb2Ph6 and pentamethylferrocene . compound <nUm> , on the other hand , was stable and readily purified ; this species was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR , UV - vis , MS , and elemental analysis . single crystal x-ray diffraction studies of this compound revealed the presence of a moderate degree of ring - tilt with a value of α = <nUm> ° ( a negative value is used to denote tilting away from the bridging elements ) , and a potentially moderate degree of strain due to a large b(Zr) of <nUm> ° ( angle between Cp'(Fe) plane and ipso-Cp'-Zr bond ) . attempted thermal ring - opening polymerization ( ROP ) of <nUm> resulted only in decomposition and attempted transition metal - catalyzed and photolytic ROP were also unsuccessful . the reaction of <nUm> with ClH · Et2O resulted in cleavage of the C-Zr bonds , and led to the formation of pentamethylferrocene . 
ES-MS of dilute solutions of (bcep)ZrCl2 ( 1 ) ( bcep = PhP(CH2CH2-e5-C5H4)2 ) in acetonitrile - water indicates the presence of three species in solution : [(bcep)Zr(H2O)2]2+ ( 2 ) , [{(bcep)Zr(m-OH)}2]2+ ( 3 ) , and the singly deprotonated form of dimer <nUm> , [{(bcep)Zr}2(m-O)(m-OH)]+ ( 4 ) . In aqueous solutions , reactivity studies investigated largely by 31P NMR spectroscopy support the presence of <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> . one equivalent of fluoride was found to react immediately with <nUm> , but slowly with <nUm> and <nUm> , to give the monofluoro complex [(bcep)ZrF]+ which was isolated as the BPh4- salt . addition of aqueous sodium sulphate gave insoluble crystals of the sulfato complex (bcep)Zr(SO4) which was characterised by x-ray crystallography . addition of acids HX ( x = Br , NO3 , HO4S , CHO3 ) to aqueous solutions of <nUm> gave species observed by ES-MS corresponding to [(bcep)ZrX]+ . 
reactions of phenylethynyl lithium with substituted cyclopentenones gave the corresponding pendant phenylethynyl substituted cyclopentadienes . subsequent deprotonation and transmetallation with TiCl4*2THF , ClZr <nUm> , and Cp1ZrCl3 yielded the alkyne - functionalized metallocene complexes [C5Me4(CCPh)] 2MCl2 [ m = Ti ( 1 ) , Zr ( 2 ) ] , Cp1[C 5Me4(CCPh)]ZrCl2 ( 3 ) , and Cp1[C 5H2R'2(CCPh)]ZrCl2 [ R' = me ( 4 ) , ph ( 5 ) ] . these complexes were fully characterized by 1H NMR , 13C NMR , MS spectra , and elemental analysis . the molecular structure of <nUm> was determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . ethylene polymerization was studied with these complexes in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . 
four zirconium complexes with pendant aryloxy groups attached to the metallocene moiety by ethyl or hexyl spacers have been synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic methods and HR-MS or elemental analysis . the solid state structure of bis[{6-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)hexyl}cyclopentadienyl] zirconium dichloride was determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction . the prepared complexes were tested as catalyst precursors in the polymerization of ethylene upon activation with MAO . the results showed a marked effect of the spacer length on the catalytic activity , while only a minor effect of the substitution on the aryl group , which affected its steric properties . 
dimethylsilylene bridged 3,4-dimethylcyclopentadienyl / amido titanium and zirconium complexes , namely [ Me2Si(C5Me2H 2)(tBuN)]MCl2 ( m = Ti , Zr ) , were synthesized by the reactions of the dilithium salt of the ligand with the corresponding inexpensive metal precursors TiCl4(THF)2 and ClZr <nUm> , respectively . these complexes were characterized by spectroscopic techniques and single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . In addition , the obtained complexes exhibited high catalytic activities in the polymerization of ethylene and copolymerization of ethylene / 1-octene , and afforded PE and poly(ethylene-co-1-octene)s with high molecular weights . especially , the dimethyl-Cp substituted constrained geometry complex ( CGC ) , [ me 2Si(C5Me2H2)(tBuN) ] Cl2Ti exhibited a higher incorporation ratio of 1-octene at <nUm> C compared to the tetramethyl-Cp substituted CGC , [ Me2Si(C 5Me4)(tBuN)]TiCl2 , which was judged by the density and 13C NMR analysis of the obtained copolymer . this is presumably due to the steric and electronic effects of the two vicinal methyl groups in [ Me2Si(C5Me2H2)( tBuN)]MCl2 during the (co)polymerization and specifically , no agostic interactions available in the propagation and termination steps of the (co)polymerization . 
the ansa indenyl ligand precursors C3H5 2(C9H6R)2 ( r = me ( 7 ) , et ( 8 ) , Pr ( 9 ) ) have been prepared by the reaction of the corresponding lithium indene , Li(C9H6R-1) ( r = me ( 4 ) , et ( 5 ) , Pr ( 6 ) ) , with 1,3-dibromopropane . compounds 7-9 were converted , by the reaction with butyllithium , to the dilithium compounds , Li2{CH2CH 2CH2(C9H5R-3)2 } ( r = me ( 10 ) , et ( 11 ) , Pr ( 12 ) ) . the three carbon atom bridge ansa - bis(indenyl)zirconium complexes , [ Zr{CH2CH2CH2(e5- C9H5R-3)2}Cl2 ] ( r = me ( 13 ) , et ( 14 ) Pr ( 15 ) ) were synthesized from the reaction of 10-12 with zirconium tetrachloride . compounds 13-15 have been tested as homogeneous catalysts in the polymerization of ethylene . the molecular structures of <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies . 
A series of ethylene-bridged C1 - symmetric ansa-(3-R-indenyl) ( fluorenyl ) zirconocene complexes 3a-i ( r = 2-[2-(4-methylphenyl)propyl] , 3a ; r = 2-[2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)propyl] , 3b ; r = 2-(2-benzylpropyl) , 3c ; r = 2-methylbenzyl , 3d ; r = 2-(2-cyclohexylpropyl) , 3e ; r = 2-[2-(1-cyclohexenyl) propyl ] , 3f ; r = 2-(2-n-butylpropyl) , <nUm> g ; r = cyclohexyl , <nUm> h ; r = iPr , 3i ) were synthesized by a salt metathesis method and characterized by NMR spectroscopy , elemental analysis ( or HRMS ) and x-ray diffraction ( 3e and <nUm> h ) . upon activation with methylaluminoxane , most of these zirconocene complexes exhibited sufficient catalytic activities up to <nUm> × <nUm> g C6 / ( mol - zr*h ) and high selectivities up to <nUm> % toward propylene dimerization , affording 2-methyl-1-pentene as the major isomer which was confirmed by gas chromatography . remarkably , the selectivity and activity of complexes 3a-i were significantly influenced by the structural features of the substituent on the 3-position of indenyl ring : a pendant aryl or alkyl group linked by a quaternary carbon bridge provided the complex with high selectivities in the range of <nUm> - <nUm> % for 2-methyl-1-pentene and low to moderate catalytic activities ; the lack of a quaternary carbon bridge within the substituent would lead to mainly polypropylenes of low molecular weight . the steric hindrance around the active metal center induced by the pendant group might be responsible for the catalytic dimerization behavior , and the presumed mechanism was discussed . In addition , for complexes <nUm> h and 3i , the selectivity for propylene dimerization could also be enhanced with the increase of reaction temperature . noticeably , most of these ansa - zirconocene complexes exhibit excellent thermal stability at <nUm> ° C , which is important with regard to industrial application . <nUm> elsevier ltd. all rights reserved . 




catalyst creates new grades of polyethylenes while their degradation phenomena determine the resulting application profiles . the resins and the end - products eventually contain residual catalysts . therefore , the effects of the following two residual catalysts - one ziegler - natta [ PQ silica / bu 2Mg / tBuCl / Cl4Ti ] , and the other metallocene [ PQ silica / MAO / (nBuCp)2ZrCl2 ] - on the UV - induced degradation of the resulting unstabilized ethylene homopolymer films were studied . the MetCat HomoPE film was found to be more susceptible to UV - induced degradation degradation than the Z-N HomoPE one despite the residual Zr level was <nUm> / 15th of the Ti content . therefore , the zirconocene residual catalyst better ( i ) facilitated the UV - initiated reaction , and ( ii ) decreased the activation energy required for the decomposition of the resulting hydroperoxide . these findings were explained from the differences in ( i ) electronic configuration and atomic radius , and ( ii ) surface chemistry and solid - state electronic environment of these catalyst systems . In both films , tpm and tpc did not significantly vary with the exposure time . the change of % crystallinity showed to be irregular and disturbed . As a function of carbonyl index , tpm and tpc,varied in a similar fashion in the MetCat HomoPE film . however , they significantly differed for the Z-N HomoPE film . here , tpm did not appreciably change whereas tpc initially increased very mildly ; then it did not essentially differ . 
crystalline structures and thermal properties of poly(ethylene-co-a ,o-nonconjugated diene)s , [ diene = 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) , 1,7-octadiene ( OD ) , and 1,9-decadiene ( DD ) ] have been investigated in relation to insertion mode of the dienes . In the case of poly(ethylene-co-HD) , the copolymer containing high cis-1,3-cyclopentane units shows lower melting point depression with increasing the comonomer content than the copolymers containing high trans-1,3-cyclopentane units . In the case of poly(ethylene-co-OD) and poly(ethylene-co-DD) , the copolymers containing pendant vinyl groups show higher DHm than that of the copolymers with cyclic units or branching structures . thermal degradation of the copolymers has been investigated under nitrogen atmosphere and the degradation of the copolymers containing the cyclic structures begins at lower temperature than the copolymers containing pendant vinyl groups . 
single site olefin polymerisation catalysts are suitable candidates for modelling purposes . their well - defined structure and the almost complete elucidation of their polymerisation mechanisms , make these organometallic complexes ideal for studies based on quantitative structure - activity relationships ( QSAR ) . although the QSAR technique is extensively used in drug design , there are very few reports on its application to metallocene - based polymerisation catalysis . this probably has something to do with the difficulties inherent in controlling experimental conditions during the polymerisation process . In the present study , we obtained ethylene polymerisation data using a number of zirconocene catalysts under carefully controlled experimental conditions , i.e. keeping all polymerisation variables constant except catalyst structure . the catalytic activity and molecular weight of the resulting polyethylenes were experimentally determined . we then applied 3D-QSAR methodology to explain the experimental data in terms of three - dimensional ( 3D ) field descriptors related to the structure of the metallocene catalyst . our results provide useful correlations between experimental ethylene polymerisation activities and the steric , LUMO and local softness fields of the catalysts . the molecular weights calculated from comparative molecular field analysis ( CoMFA ) models including LUMO and local softness fields correlate well with the experimental ones . the predictive capacity of the models was also tested . based on the proposed models , steric and electronic factors affecting polymerisation performance are discussed . 
the dynamic mechanical and rheological properties of five long - chain branched ( LCB ) and three linear ethylene / propylene ( EP ) copolymers were investigated and compared using a dynamic mechanical analyzer ( DMA ) and an oscillatory rheometer . the novel series of LCB EP copolymers were synthesized with a constrained geometry catalyst ( CGC ) , [ C5Me 4(SiMe2NtBu)]TiMe2 , and had various propylene molar fractions of <nUm> - <nUm> and long - chain branch frequencies ( LCBF ) of <nUm> - <nUm> . the linear EP copolymers were synthesized with an ansa - zirconocene catalyst , rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( EBI ) , and contained similar levels of propylene incorporation as the CGC copolymers , but no LCB . In dynamic mechanical analysis , the dynamic storage moduli ( G' ) and loss moduli ( G'' ) of the copolymers decreased with an increase of propylene molar fraction . the a- and b-transitions of the CGC copolymers were overlaid with each other . high damping ( tand ) values were found with the CGC copolymers at temperatures below <nUm> ° C . In oscillatory rheological analysis , compared to the linear EBI counterparts , the LCB CGC copolymer melts showed higher zero shear activation energies , broader plateaus of δ and larger elastic contributions , which are essential characteristics of LCB polymers . it was found that the long chain branching was the determining factor in controlling rheological properties of the polymer melts while the short chain branching from propylene incorporation played a decisive role in affecting dynamic mechanical properties . this work represents the first rheological evidence of LCB in EP copolymers synthesized with CGC .

isoprene ( 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene ) was attempted as a comonomer in metallocene - catalyzed propylene polymerization to prepare side chain - unsaturated isotactic polypropylenes ( i-PP ) . hydrogen was added into the sluggish copolymerization of propylene and isoprene mediated by a highly isospecific metallocene complex rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO . catalyst activity was restored due to breaking by hydrogen of the stable p-allyl zirconocene species caused by 1,4-isoprene insertion . stunningly , it was found that the generated Zr-H species had been able to take the accompanying vinylidene-terminated polymer chain for insertion as a preemptive mode of re-initiation . with a consecutive action of chain release followed by in situ reinsertion , the hydrogen - induced catalyst reactivation was not accompanied by chain termination . with the smooth occurrence of the copolymerization , the 1,2-insertion of isoprene led to the preparation of i-PP bearing pendant vinylidene groups .

ion - ion interactions are a crucial but often overlooked aspect of many polymerization reactions . the precise nature of cation - anion binding is as yet poorly understood , and little is known of the extent of ionic interactions in the typically nonaqueous , low - polarity reaction media of most polymerizations . nevertheless , adequate control of cation - anion interactions can greatly enhance the productivity and efficiency of chemical processes and can provide low - energy alternatives to current methods . this is illustrated here with the carbocationic polymerization of isoalkenes . carbocationic polymerizations involve , as the name implies , carbocations as propagating species . of the various types of substrates that can be polymerized cationically , the copolymerization of isobutene to isobutene - isoprene rubber stands out as the only large - scale , industrially important implementation of this reaction type . the products , elastomers with controlled degrees of unsaturation for subsequent cross-linking , have excellent gas barrier and mechanical dampening properties that make them indispensable components in polymer composites . for such applications , the polymer molecular weight has to be high , <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> g / mol , with 1-2 mol % isoprene . cationic polymerizations are however notoriously difficult to control . As a means of suppressing chain transfer , the process is carried out at temperatures as low as <nUm> ° C , with aluminum chloride initiators in chloromethane . current industrial production of isobutene - isoprene butyl rubber is thus highly energy intensive and produces aluminum and chloride effluent . this account summarizes how highly electrophilic organometallics coupled with new types of very weakly coordinating counteranions can provide the basis for a more environmentally friendly , lower energy alternative . because any copolymerization of two monomers , here primarily isobutene and isoprene , leads to two different propagating species , each of which is characterized by different chain growth and chain termination kinetics , variation of the associated counteranions can give rather unexpected results . with judicious choice of the initiator and the counteranion , new chemistry can be injected into such processes and can open avenues to new families of polymer materials . mechanistic investigations of the initiation process with zirconocene hydrides illustrate the complexity of this first step . replacing aluminum with zinc initiators not only provides a nontoxic alternative but also generates a system in which the polymer molecular weight is much less affected by temperature and comonomer concentration , which can lead to a range of products , from oligomeric lubricant precursors to C-C - rich high-molecular-weight elastomers . the key in all these cases is the construction of either preformed or in situ - generated complex anions that are resistant to electrophilic or redox degradation and are capable of stabilizing tightly associated carbocations . such initiator systems allow much more benign operating temperatures , reduce the need for chlorocarbon solvents , and can operate at concentrations as low as <nUm> × 10-5 m . along the way are provided the first examples of structurally characterized sec-alkyl carbocations and carbocation salts of organometallic zincates . 
macrocyclic compounds have attracted considerable attention in numerous applications , including host - guest chemistry , chemical sensing , catalysis , and materials science . A major obstacle , however , is the limited number of convenient , versatile , and high - yielding synthetic routes to functionalized macrocycles . macrocyclic compounds have been typically synthesized by ring - closing or condensation reactions , but many of these procedures produce mixtures of oligomers and cyclic compounds . As a result , macrocycle syntheses are often associated with difficult separations and low yields . some successful approaches that circumvent these problems are based on " self - assembly " processes utilizing reversible bond - forming reactions , but for many applications , it is essential that the resulting macrocycle be built with a strong covalent bond network . In this account , we describe how zirconocene - mediated reductive couplings of alkynes can provide reversible carbon-carbon bond - forming reactions well - suited for this purpose.Zirconocene coupling of alkenes and alkynes has been used extensively as a source of novel , versatile pathways to functionalized organic compounds . here , we describe the development of zirconocene - mediated reductive couplings as a highly efficient method for the preparation of macrocycles and cages with diverse compositions , sizes , and shapes . this methodology is based on the reversible , regioselective coupling of alkynes with bulky substituents . In particular , silyl substituents provide regioselective , reversible couplings that place them into the a-positions of the resulting zirconacyclopentadiene rings . according to density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations and kinetic studies , the mechanism of this coupling involves a stepwise process , whereby an insertion of the second alkyne influences regiochemistry through both steric and electronic factors.Zirconocene coupling of diynes that incorporate silyl substituents generates predictable macrocyclic products in very high yields . In the absence of significant steric repulsion , the macrocyclization appears to be entropically driven , thereby providing the smallest strain - free macrocyclic structure . the scope of the reaction has been explored by variation of the spacer group between the alkynyl substituents and by incorporation of functional and chiral groups into the macrocycle . the size and shape of the resulting macrocycles are largely determined by the length and geometry of the dialkyne spacer , especially in the case of terminal trimethylsilyl-substituted diynes . for example , linear , rigid diynes with four or fewer phenylene rings lead to trimeric macrocycles , whereas bent or flexible diynes produce dimers . depending on the reaction conditions , functional groups ( such as n-heterocycles and imines ) are tolerated in zirconocene coupling reactions , and in selected cases , they can be used to influence the shape of the final macrocyclic product . more recently , cp 2Zr(pyr)(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) has been employed as a more general zirconocene synthon ; it affords higher yields and increased functional group tolerance . functional groups can also be incorporated through transformation of the zirconacyclopentadiene products , with acid hydrolysis to the corresponding butadiene being the most efficient derivatization . furthermore , construction of chiral macrocycles has been accomplished by stereoselective macrocyclizations , and triynes have been coupled into three - dimensional cage compounds . we also discuss various design factors , providing a perspective on the utility of zirconocene - mediated couplings in the assembly of macrocyclic and cage compounds . 
characterizing reactive organometallic intermediates is critical for understanding the mechanistic aspects of metal - mediated organic reactions . moreover , the isolation of reactive organometallic intermediates can often result in the ability to design new synthetic methods . In this account , we outline synthetic methods that we developed for a variety of diverse Zr / Si organo-bimetallic compounds and Si / N heteroatom - organic compounds through the detailed study of zirconacyclobutene-silacyclobutene fused compounds.Two basic components are involved in this chemistry . the first is the Si - tethered diyne , which owes its rich reactive palette to the combination of the Si-C bond and the C = C triple bond . the second is the low - valent zirconocene species cp 2Zr(II) , which has proven very useful in organic synthesis . the reaction of these two components affords the zirconacyclobutene-silacyclobutene fused compound , which is the key reactive Zr / Si organo-bimetallic intermediate discussed here.We discuss the three types of reactions that have been developed for the zirconacyclobutene-silacyclobutene fused intermediate . the reaction with nitriles ( the C = N triple bond ) is introduced in the first section . In this one - pot reaction , up to four different components can be combined : the Si - tethered diyne can be reacted with three identical nitriles , with differing nitriles , or with a nitrile and other unsaturated organic substrates such as formamides , isocyanides , acid chlorides , aldehydes , carbodiimides , and azides . several unexpected multiring , fused Zr / Si organo-bimetallic intermediates were isolated and characterized . A wide variety of n-heterocycles , such as 5-azaindole , pyrrole , and pyrroloazepine derivatives , were obtained . we then discuss the reaction with alkynes ( the C = C triple bond ) . A consecutive skeletal rearrangement , differing from that observed in the reactions with nitriles , takes place in this reaction . finally , we discuss the reaction with the C = x substrates ( where x is O or N ) , including ketones , aldehydes , and isocyanides . oxa- and azazirconacycles are formed via a new skeletal rearrangement.Our results show that the zirconocene and the Si - tethered diyne cooperate as a " chemical transformer " after treatment with various substrates , leading to a diverse range of cyclic Zr / Si organo-bimetallic compounds . this mechanism - derived synthesis of organometallic and organic compounds demonstrates that the investigation of metal - mediated reactions and the isolation of reactive organometallic intermediates not only contribute to the understanding of complex reactions but can also lead to the discovery of synthetically useful methods . 

(Butadiene)zirconocene adds BC18F15 at a terminal diene carbon atom to yield the zirconocene-(m-hydrocarbyl)-borate betaine Cp2-Zr[C4H6-B C6F5 ] ( 4 ) . the dipolar complex <nUm> contains a distorted p-allyl moiety and features an additional stabilizing Zr-F-C(arene) coordination . under kinetic control , an isomeric betaine system is formed , characterized by an internal Zr+***CH2[B]- ion - pair interaction , that rearranges to <nUm> upon heating . A great variety of ansa-metallocene(butadiene) complexes and related systems cleanly form analogous metallocene-(m - conjugated diene)-borate betaines upon treatment with BC18F15 and related lewis acids . most of these systems represent very active homogeneous single - component ziegler - natta catalysts for a-olefin polymerization and copolymerization . In addition , these betaine catalysts are ideally suited for carrying out mechanistic studies in active ziegler - natta catalyst systems . they allow for an experimental observation of the first alkene insertion step at the active single - component catalyst . this feature has been used for studying the mechanism of transfer of the stereochemical information from the bent metallocene backbone and for an experimental characterization of the energy profile of the alkene addition / alkene insertion reaction sequence in active homogeneous ziegler - natta systems . the neutral dipolar single - component catalysts ( e.g. , <nUm> ) produce a polyolefin - modified R'-(CHR-CH2)-C4H6-B (C6F5)3- counterion at the end of the initiation period upon entering into the repetitive active catalytic cycle . 
A thorough investigation of the reactions of diynes , R(C ≡ C)2R , and polyynes , R(C ≡ C)(n)R , with titanocene and zirconocene was performed using the metallocene sources Cp2M(L)(e2-Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) ( m = Ti , L = - ; m = Zr , L = THF , pyridine ) . the conversions show an array of different products generated in complexation , coupling , and cleavage reactions . these results include remarkable structures ( e.g. , five - membered metallacyclocumulenes ) and reactions ( e.g. , C-C single - bond cleavage ) . In addition , the first C-C single - bond metathesis in homogeneous solution was discovered . the presented findings have been supported by theoretical studies . 
cascade reactions of internal and terminal alkynes , zirconocene hydrochloride , dimethylzinc , and phosphinoyl imines ( prepared in one step from aldehydes and diphenylphosphinoyl amide ) lead to allylic phosphinoyl amides after aqueous workup . microwave acceleration allows the completion of this one - pot reaction sequence in <nUm> min . these allylic amides can be converted into a variety of derivatives , including carbamates and sulfonamides , or reacted prior to workup with diiodomethane to give novel c-cyclopropylalkylamides . A solution - phase " libraries from libraries " approach was used to generate an intermediate 20-member library which was subsequently expanded to a 100-member library by a series of n-functionalizations . the biological activity was evaluated in an assay for competitive binding to the estrogen receptor ( ERa ) , revealing three potent lead compounds of a new structural type . 
recent abiotic homogeneous catalytic research focusing on the structures and organizational capabilities of enzymes to discover unique / more efficient catalytic processes is compiled . In <nUm> tian et al. reported a series of silane- and siloxane - bridged binuclear zirconocenes and these metallocenes were studied as catalysts for ethylene polymerization in the presence of MAO . sierra et al. described the synthesis of binuclear titanium and zirconium complexes , prepared by olefin metathesis . the binuclear CGC titanium catalysts are found to be very active when activated with bisborate B2 or bisborane BN <nUm> cocatalysts . methylene-bridged binuclear bis(imino)pyridyl Fe (II) complexes , activated with Al(iBu)3 , are found to exhibit higher activity than the corresponding mononuclear iron catalysts , along with an enhanced molecular weight of the linear polyethylene produced . tetra- and octanuclear half - titanocenes , when activated with MAO , display high ethylene polymerization activities . 

coupled cluster CCSD(T) calculations with core - valence correlation and complete basis set ( CBS ) limit extrapolation are used to benchmark the performance of commonly used density functionals in computing energy barriers for Zr - mediated reactions involving zirconocene species . these reactions include ( a ) insertions of the Zr-H bond of Cp2Zr(H)Cl into C = C , ci - C , and C = O bonds and ( b ) C-H activations by Zr = N bond in Cp2Zr = NH . the best performing functionals are M06-L , M06 , and M06-2X in the M06 series , all having mean unsigned deviations ( MUD ) less than <nUm> kcal / mol . the worst performing functional is OLYP , with a distinctly large MUD of more than <nUm> kcal / mol . considering also the trends in barrier heights and the systematic barrier height deviation , our best recommended functional is M06-2X . In this work , DFT empirical dispersion correction ( DFT-D3 ) is found to improve the performance of barrier height values for most functionals ( especially of OLYP and B3LYP ) . with DFT empirical dispersion correction , we also recommend M06-2X for reaction barrier calculations of Zr - mediated reactions . 
the compounds Cp2M((PR)3) ( m = Zr , r = ph ( 1 ) , cy ( 2 ) ; m = Hf , r = cy ( 3 ) ) and Cp*2Zr((PCy)3) ( 4 ) were prepared and characterized . these compounds were prepared by the known reactions of the metallocene dihalide with primary phosphide salts . alternatively , activation of the P-H bonds of a primary phosphine by zirconocene yields <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> , respectively . both stabilized metallocene(II) Cp2Zr(SMe2)2 and metallocene generated by in situ reduction were employed . attempts to identify intermediates in these reactions have been undertaken . reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with the phosphide LiPHPh in the presence of NEt4Br affords the species [Cp2ZrBr((PPh)2)] [NEt4] ( 5 ) . these results suggest a mechanism of formation of the M(PR)3 derivatives involving phosphinidene M-PR and M((PR)2) intermediates . intervention in such a mechanism is also accomplished by the additional electron on V(IV) . thus reaction of Cp2V with PH2Ph yields Cp2V((PPh)2) ( 6 ) . although this reaction could not be halted at the intermediate phosphinidene , species <nUm> was also generated via the reaction of Cp2VMeCl with LiPHPh . In a similar reaction Cp2V(PC6H2-2,4,6-Me3)2 ) ( 7 ) was generated in the reaction of Cp2V with PH2(C6H2-2,4,6-Me3) . In contrast , reaction of the species [Cp2V]+ with PH2Ph led only to the formation of the 18-electron product [Cp2V(PH2Ph)2]+ ( 8 ) . these results are described , and the implications of these results with particular reference to the mechanism of P-P bond formation are considered . compounds <nUm> , <nUm> , 4-6 , and <nUm> were characterized crystallographically . compound <nUm> crystallizes in space group P21 / a with a = <nUm> a,b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . compound <nUm> crystallizes in space group P21 / n with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . compound <nUm> crystallizes in space group , I4 / m with a = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . compound <nUm> crystallizes in space group P1 with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . compound <nUm> crystallizes in space group P21 / n with a = <nUm> a,b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . compound <nUm> crystallizes in space group P1 with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , α = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . 
the complete series of phenylchalcogenolate derivatives of permethylzirconocene Cp*2Zr(EPh)2 ( cp* = e5-C5-Me5 ; e = O , S , Se , Te ) has been prepared by the reactions of Cp*2Zr(CO)2 with PhOH and Ph2E2 ( e = S , Se , Te ) . the molecular structures of all of the derivatives Cp*2Zr(EPh)2 have been determined by x-ray diffraction , thereby providing evidence that the nature of the bonding varies as a function of the chalcogen . specifically , the structure of the phenoxo derivative is notably distinct from those of its heavier congeners . for example , whereas the Zr-S , Zr-Se , and Zr-Te bond lengths are comparable to the sum of their respective covalent radii , the Zr-O bond length is significantly shorter than the sum of the covalent radii , as would be anticipated due to an increased ionic contribution to the bonding . In addition , the Zr-O-C bond angle [ <nUm> ° ] in cp*2 - Zr(OPh)2 is effectively linear , whereas the Zr-E-C bond angles for the heavier congeners are significantly bent [ <nUm> ° <nUm> ° ] . comparison of the structure of Cp*2Zr(OPh)2 with that of the less substituted zirconocene derivative Cp2Zr(OPh)2 , which possesses a bent Zr-O-C moiety [ <nUm> ° ] , suggests that the linearity of Cp*2Zr-(OPh)2 may be attributed to steric factors . thus , short M-OR bond lengths and linear M-O-R angles are not necessarily a consequence of strong pp-dp lone pair donation from oxygen to the metal . Cp*2Zr(OPh)2 is monoclinic : C2 / c ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , and z = <nUm> . Cp*2Zr(SPh)2 is monoclinic : C2 / c ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> a,b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> - ( 2 ) ° , and z = <nUm> . Cp*2Zr(SePh)2 is hexagonal : P61 ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , and z = <nUm> . Cp*2Zr(TePh)2 is monoclinic : P21 / c ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> a,b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> a,b = <nUm> - ( 2 ) ° , and z = <nUm> . Cp2Zr(OPh)2 is orthorhombic : aba2 ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> a,b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> - ( 8 ) Å , and z = <nUm> .

the five - coordinate , dicationic complex [ cp <nUm> Zr(CH <nUm> CN ) <nUm> ] [ BPh <nUm> ] <nUm> ( 2 ) is formed by reaction of cp <nUm> IZr <nUm> and <nUm> equiv of Ag[BPh <nUm> ] in CH <nUm> CN . A stable derivative of complex <nUm> , [ cp <nUm> Zr(4,4'-dimethylbipyridine)(CH <nUm> CN ) ] [ BPh <nUm> ] <nUm> ( 11 ) , has been synthesized and fully characterized . reaction of complex <nUm> with PMe <nUm> produces a complex mixture of cp <nUm> Zr IV -PMe <nUm> products . complex <nUm> reacts rapidly with cp <nUm> Zr(CH <nUm> ) <nUm> to form [ cp <nUm> Zr(CH <nUm> )(CH <nUm> CN ) <nUm> ][BPh <nUm> ] ( 10 ) but reacts only slowly with cp <nUm> Zr(CH <nUm> ph ) <nUm> to form [ cp <nUm> zr(e- n CH <nUm> Ph)(CH <nUm> CN)][BPh <nUm> ] ( 3 ) . the relevance of these results to the synthesis of cp <nUm> Zr(R)(L) n + complexes is discussed . halide complexes cp <nUm> ZrX <nUm> react with complex <nUm> to form the monohalide cations cp <nUm> Zr(X)(L)n + , which are unstable with respect to disproportionation to cp <nUm> ZrX <nUm> and <nUm> in CH <nUm> CN . 
the chlorozirconocene carboxylates Cp2(Cl)ZrOC(0)R , with formate ( 2a , r = H ) , acetate ( 2b , r = CH3 ) , pivalate ( 2c , r - C4H9 ) , and benzoate ( 2d , r = ph ) as the carboxylate ligands , have been prepared and characterized , and their reactions with the zirconium hydride reagents [Cp2Zr(H)Cl] ] ( 1 ) and [(C5H4Me)2Zr(H)(M-H)]2(6) have been studied . these carboxylates 2a-d are available by treating [Cp2(Cl)Zr]20 with an excess of the requisite carboxylic acid . In CH2C12solution or as BrK pellets , 2a-d have IR spectra that are consistent with the presence of a chelating , biderttate ( e2-O,O ' ) carboxylate ligand , although the formate also has equilibrium amounts of unidentate ( e1 – O ) carboxylate . In THF solution , however , all exist as solvated e1-O carboxylate complexes , possibly Cp2(Cl)Zr(OC(0)R)(THF) . of these zirconocene carboxylates , all but the pivalate react in THF ( but not in toluene ) with <nUm> and yield the requisite aldehyde plus the m-oxo compound [Cp2(Cl)Zr]20 . yields of acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde are 92-93 % . No direct evidence for the postulated m-e1-O,O ’ gem - diolate intermediates Cp2(Cl)ZrOCH(R)-OZr(Cl)Cp2(3a,b,d) during this reduction of ligated carboxylate was obtained . reduction of the acetate 2b with <nUm> , however , regioselectively affords the m-oxo compound Cp2(Cl)ZrOZr(OCH2CH3)Cp2 , which is consistent with transience of a m-e1'O,O ’ gem - diolate . 
the kinetics of n-methyl group exchange in zirconocene N,N-dimethyldithiocarbamates , Cp2ZrX(Me2dtc) ( x = Cl , Br , I , me , CH2SiMe3 , CH2CMe2Ph , CH2Ph , OPh , opy ( 4-hydroxypyridinate ) , OXyl ( 2,6-dimethylphenoxide ) ) , and N,N-dimethylthiocarbamates , Cp2ZrX(Me2mtc) ( x = Cl , opy ) , have been studied by variable-temperature1H NMR spectroscopy . for the Cp2ZrX(Me2dtc) complexes , rates and activation parameters are relatively independent of the nature of the monodentate ligand when x = halide or alkyl ( k(25 ° C ) = <nUm> – <nUm> s-1 ; DH* = <nUm> – <nUm> kcal / mol ) , but there is a dramatic increase in rate as the p-donating ability of x varies in the order Cl < opy < OPh ; k(25 ° C ) = <nUm> x 104s-1and DH* = <nUm> kcal / mol when x = OPh . No dramatic increase in exchange rate is observed for Cp2ZrX(Me2mtc) as x varies from Cl to opy . except for the aryloxy dithiocarbamate complexes , rates and activation parameters are similar to those for related organic dithiocarbamates and thiocarbamates , strongly suggesting a mechanism involving rotation about the C = N bond . Cp2ZrX(Me2dtc) ( x = OPh , opy ) is believed to exchange methyl groups by a Zr-S bond - rupture mechanism . this mechanism , which is promoted by the p-donor properties of the aryloxy ligands , is inaccessible in aryloxythiocarbamate complexes because it would give a higher energy , unobserved stereoisomer . preparative methods for the Cp2ZrX(Me2dtc) and Cp2ZrX(Me2mtc) complexes and the Cp2Zr(X)Cl intermediates are described . 
cyclic organohydroborate complexes of zirconium monocyclopentadienyl CpZr{(m-H)2BC5H10}3 , <nUm> , and CpZr{(m-H)2BC8H14}3 , <nUm> , were prepared from the reaction of CpZrCl3 with <nUm> mol of K[H2BC5H10] and K[H2BC8H10] respectively , in diethyl ether . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> react with the hydride ion abstracting agent BC18F15 to form the same salt [CpZr(OEt)(OEt2)(m-OEt)]2 [HB(C6F5)3]2 , <nUm> . the complexes CpZr(Cl){(m-H)2BC8H14}2 , <nUm> , and Cp*Zr(Cl){(m-H)2BC8H14}2 [ where cp* = C2H3 ] , <nUm> , were prepared from the reaction of CpZrCl3 and Cp*ZrCl3 with K[H2BC8H10] in <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratios , respectively . an a-hydrogen of a BC8H14 unit forms an agostic interaction with Zr in compound <nUm> but not in <nUm> . all of the compounds were characterized by single - crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . 
In reactions of zirconocene dichloride , Cp2ZrCl2 , with <nUm> equiv and an excess amount of BCH6Li , the methyltrihydroborate complexes , Cp2ZrCl{(m-H)2BHCH3} , <nUm> , and Cp2Zr{(m-H)2BHCH3}2 , <nUm> , were isolated . the reaction of titanocene dichloride , Cp2TiCl2 , with an excess amount of BCH6Li produced the monosubstituted methyltri-hydroborate complex , Cp2Ti{(m-H)2BHCH3} , <nUm> . the titanium was reduced from Ti(IV) to Ti (III) , producing a 17- electron , paramagnetic titanocene complex . under a dynamic vacuum at room temperature , compound <nUm> decomposed and produced the zirconium hydride compound Cp2ZrH{(m-H)2BHCH3} . single crystal x-ray structures of <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were determined , crystal data for <nUm> : space group P21 / c , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> . crystal data for <nUm> : space group pna21 , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , z = <nUm> . crystal data for <nUm> : space group fmm2 , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , z = <nUm> . 
derivatization of silicon surfaces is an area of intense interest due to the centrality of silicon in the microelectronics industry and because of potential promise for a myriad of other applications . In this paper , we investigate the feasibility of Si-Si bond formation directly on the surface to contrast with the more widely studied Si-C and Si-O bond forming reactions . functionalization of hydride - terminated silicon surfaces with silanes is carried out via early transition metal mediated dehydrogenative silane coupling reactions . zirconocene and titanocene catalyst systems were evaluated for heterocoupling of a molecular silane , RSiH3 , with a surface Si-H group on Si ( s ) . the zirconocene catalysts proved to be much more reactive than the titanium system , and so the former was examined exclusively . the silanes , aromatic or aliphatic , are bonded to the silicon surface through direct Si-Si bonds , although the level of incorporation of the trihydroarylsilanes was substantially higher than that of the aliphatic silanes . the reaction proceeds on nanocrystalline hydride - terminated porous silicon surfaces , as well as flat Si(100)-Hx and Si(111)-H interfaces . the reactions were studied by a variety of techniques , including FTIR , SIMS , and XPS . 
an activated side - on - bound ansa - zirconocene dinitrogen complex , [ me <nUm> si(e <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> )(e <nUm> - C <nUm> H <nUm> -3- t Bu)Zr ] <nUm> ( μ <nUm> , η <nUm> ,e <nUm> -N <nUm> ) , has been prepared by sodium amalgam reduction of the corresponding dichloride precursor under an atmosphere of N <nUm> . both solution spectroscopic and x-ray diffraction data establish diastereoselective formation of the syn homochiral dizirconium dimer . addition of <nUm> atm of H <nUm> resulted in rapid hydrogenation of the N <nUm> ligand to yield one diastereomer of the hydrido zirconocene diazenido complex . kinetic measurements have yielded the barrier for H <nUm> addition and in combination with isotopic labeling studies are consistent with a 1,2-addition pathway . In the absence of H <nUm> , the hydrido zirconocene diazenido product undergoes swift diazene dehydrogenation to yield an unusual hydrido zirconocene dinitrogen complex . the N = N bond length of <nUm> Å determined by x-ray crystallography indicates that the side - on - bound N <nUm> ligand is best described as a two - electron reduced [ N <nUm> ] 2- fragment . comparing the barrier for deuterium exchange with [ me <nUm> si(e <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> )(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> -3- t Bu)ZrH ] <nUm> ( μ <nUm> ,e <nUm> , η <nUm> -N <nUm> H <nUm> ) to diazene dehydrogenation is consistent with rapid 1,2-elimination of dihydrogen followed by rate - determining hydride migration to the zirconium . this mechanistic proposal is also corroborated by H <nUm> inhibition and the observation of a normal , primary kinetic isotope effect for dehydrogenation . 
the current study describes the first in situ synthesis and characterization of a new family of cationic coordination tetrahedra of both the FV and V4E6 type , which are constructed by a new building block based on a trinuclear zirconocene moiety and the dicarboxylate or tricarboxylate anions . 
by the interaction of (C5H6)2MCl2 ( m = Ti , Zr ) ( <nUm> mol ) and a b-diketone ( keH ) ( <nUm> mol ) , in the presence of triethylamme ( <nUm> mol ) , in acetonitrile solution at <nUm> ° , the compounds C5H5MCl(ke)2 weee prepared . A similar reaction with tropolone ( TH ) gave C5H5ZrT3 . the monomeric nonelectrolytes C5H5MCl(ke)2 weee investigated by infrared and variable - temperature 1H nmr spectroscopy , which indicated that these compounds all exist as the cis isomer in solution with the exception of C5H5TCl(acac)2 for which two isomers are observed . 
dimeric Zr (III) complexes have been prepared by thermolysis of (e5-C5H5)2ZrII-bis(phosphme) compounds . these dimeric Zr (III) complexes can also be prepared by treating “ zirconocene ” with phosphines . the structure of these dimeric Zr (III) complexes has been determined spectroscopically to contain (e5-C5H5)(e1:e5-C5H4])Zr units . “ zirconocene ” is proposed to contain similar units . oxidation of these Zr (III) compounds by secondary phosphines , by O , and by I2 is described . 
the binuclear zirconocene hydride complex [(e5-C5H4CH3)2ZrH(u-H)]2 was prepared by the stoichiometric addition of <nUm> equiv of LiAlH(0-t-Bu)3 to <nUm> equiv of (e5-C5H4CH3)2ZrCI2 and was characterized by elemental analysis , IR , NMR , hydrolysis , and x-ray diffraction methods . the molecular structure of this binuclear complex consists of two (e5-C5H4CH3)2ZrH molecular units linked by two three - center , two - electron Zr-H-Zr bonds . its molecular geometry is constrained by a crystallographic center of inversion , which requires a trans orientation for the two terminal hydrides . the important bond angles within the H2Zr core are Ht,-Zr-Hb = <nUm> (1)A , Ht-Zr-Hb ‘ = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , Hb-Zr-Hb ‘ = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , and Zr-Hb-Zr ’ = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , and the metal-hydrogen bond distances are Zr-H , = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , Zr-Hb = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , and Zr-Hb ‘ = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å . so that inter-ring repulsions introduced during dimer formation might be relieved , the methylcyclopentadienyl rings have been rotated so that the methyl substituents on opposite sides of the molecule are directed away from one another . the compound crystallizes in a triclinic unit cell of PI symmetry with refined lattice parameters of a = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) a,c = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , a = <nUm> ( 3 ) ° , β = <nUm> ( 3 ) ° , γ = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , V = <nUm> ( 3 ) A3 , z = <nUm> dimer of fw <nUm> per cell , and pcalod = <nUm> g / cm3 . full - matrix least - squares refinement ( based on F ° <nUm> ) of <nUm> diffractometry data converged with final discrepancy indices of R(F0) = <nUm> , R(F02) = <nUm> , and Rw(F ° <nUm> ) = <nUm> with s1 , = <nUm> . 
the selective synthesis of a AuI complex of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid , namely , [Au(SC6H4-4-COOH)(PMe2Ph)] ( 1 ) , is reported . it shows interesting photoluminescence ( PL ) properties , for example , high PL quantum yield , multicomponent emission , and an unusually large PL lifetime . this complex was further applied as a metalloligand for the synthesis of [ Cp*2Zr{k1O-OOCC 6H4-4-SAu(PMe2Ph)}{k2O , O'-OOCC6H4-4-SAu(PMe2Ph) } ] ( 3 ) , one of the rare AuI / IVZr complexes . for the first time the exchange between the two ligands , which are bound in mono- and bidentate fashion , respectively , could be observed with the help of variable - temperature NMR spectroscopy . for the corresponding monometallic zirconocene complex [ Cp*2Zr(k1O-O2CC6H 4-4-SH)(k2O,O'-O2CC 6H4-4-SH ) ] ( 2 ) the activation parameters of this exchange could be determined by line shape analysis . 
A simple new route to access heterometallic alkoxo precursors for a wide range of materials is reported . this unique synthetic method comprises elimination of the cyclopentadienyl ring from cp <nUm> MCl <nUm> ( m = Ti , Zr ) as CpH in the presence of M'(OR) <nUm> ( M' = Ca , Mn ; OR = OCH <nUm> CH <nUm> OCH <nUm> or OEt ) in an alcohol as a source of protons . In one - pot reactions , we have prepared four different compounds with Ti <nUm> Ca <nUm> ( μ <nUm> -O ) , cp <nUm> Zr <nUm> Ca <nUm> ( μ <nUm> -Cl ) , Zr <nUm> Mn <nUm> ( μ <nUm> -O ) <nUm> , and cp <nUm> Ti <nUm> ( m-OEt ) <nUm> motifs . the compounds were characterized by single - crystal x-ray structural analysis and NMR spectroscopy . 
new early - late heterobimetallic hydrides (L2ZrCl)(Cp*Ir) ( m-H ) <nUm> ( <nUm> ; L ) cp derivative , cp* ) e5- C5Me5 ) were synthesized from zirconocene derivatives ( L2ZrCl2 ) and LiCp*IrH3 via a salt elimination reaction and structurally characterized by NMR and x-ray analyses . upon treatment of <nUm> with an alkyllithium reagent , hydride abstraction complex <nUm> underwent thermolytic ligand elimination at the Zr-Ir system to yield a novel planar square complex (L2Zr)2(Cp*Ir) <nUm> ( μ 3- H ) <nUm> ( 2 ) . when a labeling study of the reaction was conducted , it was found that the conversion of <nUm> to <nUm> involves rapid aromatic and benzylic C-H activation by a coordinatively unsaturated dinuclear complex (L2Zr)(Cp*Ir)(H) <nUm> ( 3 ) . 
the reaction of 5,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)cyclopentadiene with CpZrCl3 ( cp = e5-C5H5 ) affords the monostan - nylated metallocene complex (e5-Me3SnC5H4)CpZrCl2 ( 1 ) , accompanied by variable amounts of (e5-ClMe2-SnC5H4)CpZrCl2 ( 2 ) . the complex ( 1 ) reacts with BCl3 or with ClI to afford <nUm> ( Sn-CH3 cleavage ) , but with ClH , Cp2ZrCl2 is obtained instead ( Sn-Cp cleavage ) . depending on the reaction conditions , treatment of either <nUm> or <nUm> with BBr3 affords (e5-BrMe2SnC5H4)CpZrBr2 ( 3 ) or (e5-Br2MeSnC5H4)CpZrBr2 ( 4 ) . the reaction of <nUm> with excess I2 affords the iodostannylated complex (e5-IMe2SnC5H4)CpZrCl2 ( 5 ) . two of the complexes ( 2*2C6H5CH3 and 4*THF ) are crystallographically characterized . the adduct 4*THF has a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry about tin with a long O-Sn distance of <nUm> Å . we find overall that Me3Sn substituents undergo electrophilic halodemethylation much more readily than corresponding Me3Si substituents , whereas the reactivities of the halostannylated complexes toward nucleophiles such as airborne moisture are much lower than those of their halosilylated counterparts . 
the kinetics of ethylene / norbornene copolymerization with rac-Et(1-indenyl) 2ZrCl <nUm> ( 1 ) and [ 2,2'-Me(1,3-Me 2Cp ) 2]ZrCl <nUm> ( 2 ) catalysts with modified methylaluminoxane are analyzed through experimentation and theoretical modeling . these catalysts show that the rate of norbornene incorporation into the copolymer is strongly catalyst dependent . for example , while catalyst <nUm> shows a decreasing polymerization rate with an increase in the norbornene concentration , catalyst <nUm> shows a monotonically increasing polymerization rate with an increase in the norbornene concentration for a norbornene / ethylene mole ratio up to <nUm> in the bulk liquid phase . both terminal and penultimate models are developed to describe the rate process with these catalysts . it is shown that for both catalyst systems the penultimate model yields a more accurate description of the copolymerization kinetics than the terminal model . the penultimate model has also been applied to a continuous copolymerization reactor system with catalyst <nUm> . the copolymerization was also carried out in a continuous stirred tank reactor . the model simulation results and the experimental data of norbornene conversion , solid content , and glass transition temperature profiles obtained from a laboratory - scale continuous reactor operation have been compared . interestingly , the model simulations show that the ethylene concentration in the bulk liquid phase is much lower than the saturated ethylene concentration , suggesting that mass - transfer resistance might be present for the ethylene gas in reaching the catalytic sites in the liquid phase . 
the present study focused on the application of mixed OTi 2-SiO2 - supported methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) with a zirconocene catalyst on the linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) production . At low concentrations of O2Ti present in the mixed supports , it revealed that O2Ti was decorated on the O2Si surface and acted as a spacer to anchor MAO to the O2Si surface resulting in less steric hindrance and less interaction . As a result , catalytic activities via ethylene / 1-olefin copolymerization apparently increased with the presence of O2Ti . besides increased activities , the presence of O2Ti in the mixed supports can result in a slightly lower molecular weight ( MW ) of polymers , suggesting a higher chain transfer rate . 
A high - pressure , high - temperature continuous stirred - tank reactor ( CSTR ) system having approximately an ideal residence time distribution ( RTD ) has been set up for the polymerization of olefins utilizing metallocene catalysts . preliminary experiments of ethylene polymerized with the metallocene catalyst system zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) / modified-methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) / trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) in toluene at <nUm> psig have been carried out . the reactor system showed good control over temperature , pressure , and ethylene feed rate . the steady state was obtained after four mean residence times ( <nUm> τ 's ) . with increasing Cp2ZrCl2 concentration , the molecular weight ( MW ) of polyethylene ( PE ) decreased and the catalyst activity ( kg of PE / ( [ethylene]*g of catalyst ) ) increased . with increasing temperature between <nUm> and <nUm> ° C , the MW of PE decreased and molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) polydispersity increased . EsP with weight - average molecular weight ( mw ) <nUm> 000-52 <nUm> were obtained . the catalyst activity decreased with increasing temperature with an apparent activation energy of <nUm> kJ / mol . the deactivation of the catalyst is first - order with the rate constant kd = <nUm> × 10-3 s-1 at <nUm> ° C . the rate constants of propagation and b-scission at <nUm> ° C are kp = <nUm> × <nUm> (M*s)-1 and ktr,b = <nUm> s-1 . 
the first examples of a new class of main group metallacycles , stibathiolanes , have been synthesized via transmetalation from zirconocene metallacycles . the x-ray crystal structures of three 1-halostibathiolanes have been determined and the compounds found to be polymeric in the crystalline state . physical and spectroscopic data indicate that the compounds are monomeric in hydrocarbon solution but that they undergo rapid - reversible halide - exchange reactions . A consequence of one of these exchange reactions is the inversion of stereochemistry at antimony . the processes have been investigated by using a variety of NMR and crossover experiments . the proposed intermediate for the inversion of stereochemistry at the metal center is supported by the solid - state structures of the compounds in which the proposed connectivity of the intermediate is crystallographically established . 
zirconocene complexes of substituted naphthalynes have been generated in situ and trapped with nitriles to form azametallacycles with excellent regiochemical control . these compounds can be converted into ketones , a-iodo ketones , and iodoacylnaphthoquinones with experimentally simple procedures .

reactions of zirconocene and hafnocene silyl derivatives CpCp'M(SiR3)Cl ( cp = e5-C5H5 ; cp' = cp or cp* , cp* = e5-C5Me5 ; m = Zr or Hf ; r = me or SiMe3 ) with hydrosilanes have been investigated . the observed products depend on the nature of the starting materials , since in some cases the initial s-bond metathesis products react further via dehydrocoupling processes . for example , Cp2Zr(SiMe3)Cl reacts with PhSiH3 to give the direct products Me3SiH and Cp2Zr(SiH2Ph)Cl , which then combines rapidly with PhSiH3 to produce [Cp2ZrHCl]n , PhH2Si-SiH2Ph , and PhH2Si-SiHPh-SiH2Ph . thus , hydrosilyl complexes obtained from such reactions can be contaminated by significant quantities of the corresponding hydride . the s-bond metathesis reactions of CpCp*Hf[Si(SiMe3)3]Cl ( 2 ) with hydrosilanes RR'SiH2 cleanly give the isolable metal silyl derivatives CpCp*Hf(SiHRR')Cl ( SiHRR' = SiH2Ph ( 8 ) , SiH2(p-Tol) ( 9 ) , SiH2(p-MeOC6H4) ( 10 ) , SiH2(p-FC6H4) ( 11 ) , SiH2Mes ( <nUm> , mes = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2 ) , SiH2CH2Ph ( 13 ) , SiH2Cy ( 14 ) , SiHPh2 ( 15 ) , SiHMePh ( <nUm> , as a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of diastereomers ) , and SiHPhSiH2Ph ( <nUm> , as a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of diastereomers ) ) . In general , primary or secondary silanes will undergo such reactions , provided that a less sterically hindered silyl ligand is introduced at hafnium . tertiary silanes such as Me3SiH and Et3SiH do not react under comparable conditions . reactions of <nUm> with bis(silyl) compounds have provided the bimetallic complex 1,4-CpCp*(Cl)HfSiH2C6H4SiH2Hf(Cl)CpCp* ( 19 ) and the thiophene derivative 2,5-CpCp*(Cl)HfSiH2(C4H2S)SiH2Hf- (Cl)CpCp* ( 20 ) . the thermal ( dark ) reaction of <nUm> with PhSiH3 obeys a second - order rate law , rate = k[2] [PhSiH3] , with DH' = <nUm> ( 7 ) kcal mol-1 , DS' = <nUm> ( 2 ) eu , and kH / kD ( <nUm> ° C ) = <nUm> ( 1 ) . these parameters suggest that the above s-bond metathesis reactions involve four - center transition states similar to those that have been proposed for “ hydrocarbon activation ” reactions of d0 ; metal complexes . visible light accelerates the reactions of <nUm> with hydrosilanes , via excitation of a low - intensity transition at <nUm> nm ( ϵ = <nUm> dm3 mol-1 cm-1 ) , which appears to have considerable silyl - to - metal charge - transfer character . the quantum yield for the reaction of <nUm> with <nUm> or <nUm> equiv of PhSiH3 is 1.0*0.1 . use of radical traps failed to provide evidence for intermediate radicals in this photochemistry . possible mechanisms for the observed photochemical conversions are discussed . reactions of <nUm> with alkoxyhydrosilanes HSi(OMe)2R' provide routes to the new complexes CpCp*Hf(SiH2Me)Cl ( <nUm> , R' = me ) and CpCp*Hf(SiH3)Cl ( <nUm> , R' = OMe ) . these reactions appear to proceed via initial , metal - catalyzed redistribution of the alkoxyhydrosilanes ( e.g. , HSiMe(OMe)2 is redistributed to MeSi(OMe)3 and MeSiH3 ) , followed by trapping of the new hydrosilane by <nUm> . the Hf-Si distance observed for <nUm> ( <nUm> ( 4 ) and <nUm> ( 4 ) Å for the two independent molecules ) is much longer than that observed for <nUm> ( <nUm> ( 3 ) Å ) , apparently because of greater ligand - ligand repulsion in <nUm> . 
In zirconium - catalyzed carbomagnesation of alkenes , the dramatic enhancement in reactivity and selectivity induced by an internal lewis base is such that higher order alkylmagnesium halides , normally significantly less reactive than EtMgCl , may be used efficiently . In reactions with n-BuMgCl , two secondary carbon stereogenic centers are formed with excellent levels of stereocontrol ( <nUm> , > <nUm> % ) . experimental data are presented which demonstrate that the observed levels of selectivity and reactivity are not simply the result of regioselective insertion of the alkene into the zirconacyclopropane . A general mechanism scheme for carbomagnesation of bicyclic substrates <nUm> is presented . noteworthy mechanistic issues are the following : ( 1 ) excess alkylmagnesium halide is required for high levels of regioselectivity and substrate reactivity . we suggest that the influence of the grignard reagent stems from generation of the zirconate complex <nUm> ( r = H , me , or et ) , which may be more susceptible to ligand exchange than its zirconacyclopropane precursor <nUm> . subsequent formation of the zirconocene complex of the reacting alkene would then lead to the high levels of reactivity and selectivity observed in reactions where excess alkylmagnesium halide is present . ( 2 ) deuterium labeling experiments demonstrate that the resident lewis base strictly controls and reverses the mode of metallacyclopentane cleavage . the heteroatom binds and delivers magnesium to initiate a highly regioselective metallacyclopentane cleavage , effecting a Mg-Zr exchange with inversion of configuration . 
A mechanism for the dehydropolymerization of hydrosilanes to polysilanes , as catalyzed by early - transition - metal metallocene derivatives , is proposed . this mechanism is based on two s-bond metathesis reactions that pass through four - center transition states : ( 1 ) the dehydrometalation of silane , H(SiHR)nH , with a metal hydride to give hydrogen and a silyl derivative , M(SiHR)nH , and ( 2 ) coupling of the metal silyl derivative with more hydrosilane , H(SiHR)mH , to produce H(SiHR)n(SiHR)mH and regenerate the active metal hydride catalyst . this proposal is based on a number of observed , stoichiometric s-bond metathesis reactions involving zirconocene and hafnocene complexes . these reactions , which involve silicon , hydrogen , and a d0 metal center , are rather facile and apparently reflect the tendency of silicon to expand its coordination sphere under these conditions . one reaction of this type is rapid MH / HSi hydrogen exchange , for example between PhSi3 and CpCp*MHCl ( <nUm> , m = Zr , or <nUm> , m = Hf ) , which is observed via deuterium labeling . hydrogenolysis of CpCp*M[Si(SiMe3)3]Cl ( <nUm> , m = Zr , and <nUm> , m = Hf ) provides a convenient route to the monomeric hydride complexes <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . the first step in the proposed polymerization mechanism , which is the reverse of M-Si bond hydrogenolysis , is observed in stoichiometric reactions of <nUm> or <nUm> with PhSi3 to give hydrogen and the phenylsilyl complexes CpCp*M(SiH2Ph)Cl ( <nUm> , m = Zr , and <nUm> , m = Hf ) . the thermolytic decomposition of <nUm> to <nUm> results in Si-Si bond formation , with the production of polysilane oligomers . this second - order reaction exhibits a deuterium isotope effect at <nUm> ° C of <nUm> ( 2 ) and activation parameters ( DH ‡ = <nUm> ( 2 ) kcal mol-1 and DS ‡ = <nUm> ( 6 ) eu ) that suggest a four - center transition state . the second - order reaction of <nUm> with PhSiH3 ( to give <nUm> and (SiHPh)n polysilanes ) was also studied kinetically and found to exhibit similar kinetic parameters . this s-bond metathesis reaction , which corresponds to the second step in the proposed mechanism , is believed to pass through a four - center transition state that results from interaction of the CpCp*(Cl)Hf-SiH2Ph and H-SiH2Ph bonds . evidence for the role of hydride complexes as true catalysts is obtained by comparing gel permeation chromatograms for polysilanes obtained from both <nUm> and <nUm> as catalysts . observed reactions of CpCp*Hf[Si(SiMe3)3]Me ( 7 ) with PhSiH3 , to give CpCp*Hf(SiH2Ph)Me ( 8 ) and then CpCp*Hf(H)Me ( 9 ) , model proposed processes for the activation of catalyst precursors . the step - growth character of the reaction is illustrated by the slow dehydrocoupling of PhSiH3 by Cp*2HfH2 , which allows observation of early polysilane intermediates ( di- , tri- , and tetrasilane ) . the participation of M(SiHPh)nH complexes as intermediates in dehydrocoupling was investigated . partly on the basis of the observed reaction of CpCp*Hf[(SiHPh)3H]Cl ( 11 ) with PhSiH3 to give <nUm> and H(SiHPh)3H , it is concluded that a preferred dehydrocoupling pathway involves monosilyl intermediates , MSiH2Ph , and chain growth by one monomer unit per catalytic cycle . implications of the proposed mechanism are discussed . 
several examples are described where in situ generated ( e2-alkyne ) group <nUm> metallocene type substrates add to X-[M2] reagents ( M2 = main group metal ) to form dimetallabicyclic products Cp2M(m-e1:e2-RCCR)(m-X)[M2] which contain a planar-tetracoordinate carbon center in the m-e1:e2-hydrocarbyl bridge . thus , (e2-cyclohexyne)(PMe3)ZrCp2 ( 4a ) reacts in this way with excess trimethylgallium to give Cp2Zr(m-e1:e2-C6H8)(m-CH3)GaMe2 ( 6a ) . complex 6a is one of the rare examples of a gallium compound containing s-hydrocarbyl bridges to this heavy main group metal . complex 6a was characterized by x-ray diffraction . it crystallizes in space group P21 / c with cell parameters a = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . complex 6a contains a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom C(2) with pertinent bond distances and angles of <nUm> ( 5 ) Å [Zr-C(2)] , <nUm> ( 5 ) Å [Ga-C(2)] , <nUm> ( 8 ) Å [C(2)-C(3)] , <nUm> ( 7 ) Å [C(1)-C(2)] , <nUm> ( 4 ) ° [C(3)-C(2)-C(1)] , <nUm> ( 3 ) ° [C(3)-C(2)-Ga] , <nUm> ( 1 ) ° [Ga-C(2)-Zr] , and <nUm> ( 3 ) ° [C(1)-C(2)-Zr] , both cp rings are disordered . zirconium and gallium seem to form a three - center two - electron bond with C(2) . the planar-tetracoordinate geometry at carbon atom C(2) is probably electronically stabilized by the s-donor properties of the attached metal centers and by a p-conjugative interaction of the C(2)-C(1)-Zr moiety normal to the s-plane . (e2-1,2-Didehydrobenzene)(PMe3)ZrCp2 ( 4b ) reacts analogously with trimethylgallium to give Cp2Zr(m-e1:e2-C6H4)(m-CH3)GaMe2 ( 6b ) in almost quantitative yield . complex 6b crystallizes isomorphously to the corresponding A1 compound in space group P21 / n with cell parameters a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , μ = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . it also contains a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom [C(2)] . the reaction of ph – C ≡ C – GaMe2 ( 7 ) with (hydrido)zirconocene chloride produces Cp2Zr(m-PhCCH)(m-Cl)GaMe2 ( 9 ) which is probably also a similarly structured “ anti-va n't hoff / LeBel complex ” . complexes 6a and 6b react with ethylene or norbornene at room temperature with liberation of Me3Ga and formation of five - membered metallacyclic products ( e.g. , bis(e-cyclopentadienyl)zirconaindane is obtained from 6b and ethylene ) . 
the olefin polymerization reaction by silylene-bridged zirconocene catalysts has been investigated theoretically . with the ab initio molecular orbital ( MO ) method the structure and energetics of the reactants , the p-complex , the transition state , and the product for insertion of ethylene into (SiH2Cp2)ZrCH3+ have been determined . the nearly Cs - symmetric transition state has a low activation barrier ( about <nUm> kcal / mol from the p-complex ) . the product shows a strong Cb-H agostic interaction . based on the above transition state structure , molecular mechanics ( MM ) calculations have been carried out to investigate the effects of alkyl substituents on olefins and methyl groups and other substituents on the cp rings as well as the effects of the alkyl group on Zr , a model polymer chain end . the regioselectivity in propylene polymerization , that the primary insertion is preferred to the secondary insertion , is reproduced well by the energy difference at the transition state but not by that of the p-complex . As to the stereoselectivity in isotactic polymerization of propylene by SiH2(CpMen)2ZrR+ , the substituents on the cp rings have been found to determine the conformation of the polymer chain end , and the fixed polymer chain end conformation in turn determines the stereochemistry of olefin insertion at the transition state . the direct steric effect of the cp methyl groups on the olefin insertion stereochemistry is negligibly small . the same direct control mechanism is operational also in syndiotactic polymerization of propylene and 4-methyl-1-pentene . 
the cationic complex Cp2Zr(CH3)(THF)+ ( <nUm> , as the BPh4- salt ) reacts with 2,6-diethylpyridine to afford the chelated secondary zirconocene - alkyl complex Cp2Zr(e2-C,N-CH{Me}{6-ethylpyrid-2-yl})+ ( 2 ) . treatment of complex <nUm> with CO , C2H3N , tBuCN , and (PhCH2)(Et)3N+Cr affords Cp2Zr(CH{Me}}6-ethylpyrid-2-yl})(CO)+ ( 3 ) , Cp2Zr(CH{Me}{6-ethylpyrid-2- yl})(CH3CN)+ ( 4 ) , Cp2Zr(CH{Me}6-ethylpyrid-2-yl})(tBuCN)+ ( 5 ) , and Cp2Zr(CH{Me}{6-ethylpyrid-2-yl})(Cl) ( 6 ) , respectively . the thermally sensitive d0 carbonyl complex <nUm> is a rare example of a d0 M(alkyl)-CO adduct and is unambiguously characterized in solution by low - temperature NMR and IR spectroscopy , 13C - labeling and hydrolysis experiments , and decomposition studies . IR and NMR data establish that <nUm> contains a terminal CO ligand . an x-ray structure analysis of <nUm> establishes that the CH(Me)(6-ethylpyrid-2-yl) ligand adopts a chelated structure ; the similarity of the spectroscopic data for 3-6 implies that 3-5 have similar chelated structures . At room temperature , <nUm> in CD2Cl2 rapidly decomposes to afford a complex mixture of products . 1H NMR monitoring of the decomposition of <nUm> reveals formation of a transient cationic zirconocene-acyl intermediate <nUm> , which undergoes 1,2-H shift to afford a mixture of isomeric / oligomeric zirconocene - enolates . treatment of this mixture with (PhCH2)(Et)3N+CT affords Cp2Zr(OCH = C{Me}{6-ethylpyrid-2-yl})Cl ( 10 ) as a mixture of e / z isomers , establishing the presence of zirconocene - enolate species . hydrolysis of the decomposition products of <nUm> affords a mixture of thermally sensitive tautomers , enol <nUm> / aldehyde 11' , which are characterized by NMR , FTIR , and mass spectroscopy . 
treatment of the ansa - metallocene complex [Me2Si(C5H4)2]Zr(butadiene) ( s-cis- / s-trans-4 ) with BC18F15 yields the corresponding ansa-zirconocene[C4H6B(C6F5)3] betaine <nUm> . complex <nUm> is a homogeneous single component ziegler catalyst that actively polymerizes ethene and propene , respectively . with the olefins ethene , propene , 1-butene , 1-pentene , 1-hexene , or 1,5-hexadiene complex <nUm> undergoes a stoichiometric insertion reaction at <nUm> ° C to generate the metallacyclic carbon - carbon coupling products 9a-9f , which feature an internal C4 = C5 alkene coordination to the metal center and an intramolecular C6-Zr ion pair interaction . the rate of the overall 1-alkene insertion process <nUm> → <nUm> ( k(chem) ) was measured , and the observed rate constant of the degenerate allyl inversion process of the starting material ( <nUm> → ent-6 , k(m)(obs) ) . this allows for a mathematical kinetic deconvolution of the two - step reaction sequence , namely the initial alkene addition process to <nUm> to generate the reactive (p-alkene)(s-allyl)metallocene - type intermediate <nUm> ( rate of formation ( k1[alkene] , rate of alkene dissociation : k-1 ) and the subsequent insertion reaction <nUm> → <nUm> ( k2 ) to give k1 ( = k(chem) + <nUm> k(m)(obs) ) and the ratio k2 / k-1 ( = k(chem) / <nUm> k(m)(obs) ) . this procedure quantitatively determines the two transition states involved . In each case of the <nUm> → 9b - f series the second transition state is higher than the first one : a general energy profile is observed in which the actual insertion step is rate - determining and is preceded by the alkene addition / alkene dissociation preequilibrium . for example , the rate of 1-pentene dissociation at the stage of the intermediate <nUm> to reform the starting material <nUm> is ~ <nUm> times higher than the competing actually product forming alkene insertion reaction to yield 9d . the difference of transition - state energies ranges from DDG(+)2 = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 for 1-butene insertion to DDG(+)2 = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 for 1-pentene and 1-hexene insertion , respectively . the kinetic analysis of the alkene insertion reaction at the single component ' constrained geometry ' catalyst [Me2Si(C5H4)N(t)Bu]Zr[C4H6B(C6F5)3] <nUm> was carried out analogously . BC18F15 addition to [Me2Si(C5H4)N(t)Bu]Zr(butadiene) <nUm> yields a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of the stereoisomeric betaines <nUm> A / 11B ( ' supine / prone ' orientation of the ligand ) . the <nUm> A / 11B complex mixture actively polymerizes ethene . At low temperature the <nUm> A / 11B mixture reacts stoichiometrically with the series of olefins listed above to give the mono-alkene insertion products 14a-f , each found in solution as a single diastereoisomer . the kinetic analysis shows an even more pronounced alkene addition / alkene dissociation preequilibrium step ( k-1 / k2 ≃ <nUm> for 1-pentene ) followed by rate - determining insertion ( DDG(+)2 ranging from + <nUm> to + <nUm> kcal mol-1 ) . reaction profiles featuring the actual alkene insertion step as the kinetically controlling activation barrier could be characteristic for group <nUm> metallocene ziegler catalysts and related systems .

zirconocene dichloride catalyzes the addition of ethylmagnesium halides to chiral allylic and homoallylic alcohols and ethers in an efficient manner . these transformations proceed with high levels of regio- and stereocontrol ; with the appropriate choice of the neighboring heteroatom substituent ( alcohol vs ether ) , either of the two diastereotopic faces of a chiral alkene can be selectively functionalized . experimental data described indicate that the regio- and stereoselective outcomes of catalytic carbomagnesation of acyclic substrates are unique . simple addition of zirconacyclopropanes to unsaturated alcohols and ethers proceeds without stereoselection and affords the derived metallacyclopentanes either with no regiocontrol or with a completely opposite sense of regiochemistry compared to that obtained under the catalytic conditions . A detailed mechanistic scheme is provided that accounts for all the characteristics of a zirconium - catalyzed ethylmagnesation reaction . the proposed paradigm includes a biszirconocene complex as its centerpiece ; intermediacy of the bimetallic complex is supported by rate studies and readily accounts for the observed selectivities . the proposed mechanistic hypothesis rationalizes ( i ) the requirement for excess EtMgCl , ( ii ) the necessity for the presence of a lewis basic heteroatom , and ( iii ) the reason for the highly regioselective rupture of the intermediate metallacyclopentane . 
disubstituted aryl olefins undergo efficient alkylations in the presence of <nUm> mol % Cp2ZrCl2 , n-BuMgCl , and alkyl tosylates or alkyl bromides . In one class of reactions ( table <nUm> ) , the resulting alkyl zirconocene ( initial alkylation product ) undergoes b-hydride abstraction with a hydrogen atom from within the substrate to afford allylic alkylation products ( scheme <nUm> ) . In another category of reactions , where cyclic allylic ethers ( chromenes ) are used ( table <nUm> ) , Zr - alkoxide elimination occurs after the C-C bond formation to effect a net allylic substitution . it is proposed that these reactions involve the nucleophilic attack of substrate - derived zirconates or zirconocene - grignard reagents on various tosylates and bromides . there is little or no competitive electrophile alkylation by the n-alkyl grignard reagent . several mechanistic and synthetic aspects of these Zr - catalyzed C-C bond forming reactions are examined and discussed .

A series of silylamido complexes of zirconium , Cp2Zr(X)(NtBuSiMe2H) ( x = H , I , Br , Cl , F ; <nUm> – <nUm> ) , have been prepared . these complexes exhibit agostic b-Si-H interactions with the metal center and have been characterized by spectroscopic and structural methods . spectroscopic evidence for the interaction of the Si-H m-bond with zirconium include ( 1 ) abnormally large upfield chemical shifts for the silicon hydride and silicon nuclei in the 1H and 29Si NMR spectra , ( 2 ) unusually small values of the silicon-hydrogen coupling constants ( 1JsiH ) and ( 3 ) low - energy Si-H stretching frequencies in the infrared spectra . AH of the spectroscopic data also establish a clear trend for the strength of the nonclassical Zr-H-Si interaction in Cp2Zr(X)(NtBuSiMe2H) : x = H > I > Br > Cl > F . this ordering directly reflects the relative electrophilicity of the zirconium center . the molecular structures of the hydride and chloride derivatives <nUm> and <nUm> as determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies are also consistent with coordination of the Si-H bond to the metal center . In particular , short Zr-Si distances and acute Zr-N-Si angles point to a severe bending of the silyl group toward zirconium , and the location of the amido group near the center of the metallocene equatorial wedge is consistent with a Cp2ML3 coordination environment , not the Cp2ML2 geometry implied by the formula Cp2Zr(NR2)(X) . 
kinetics , stoichiometric model reactions , and stereochemical studies have been employed to investigate the mechanism of the zirconocene - catalyzed cyclization of nonconjugated dienes with organomagnesium reagents . transmetalation of a zirconacyclopentane intermediate with magnesium alkyls has been implicated as a key step in the catalytic reaction . A zirconacyclopentane derived from <nUm> , 9-diallylfluorene was prepared and structurally characterized . zirconium metallacyclopentanes transmetalate with dialkylmagnesium reagents having b-hydrogens to form bis-(magnesiomethyl) - substituted carbocycles and products resulting from the elimination of alkane from dialkylzirconocene . metallacycles of this type also act as catalyst precursors for the catalytic cyclomagnesiation of <nUm> , 7-octadiene . the kinetics of the catalytic cyclomagnesiation of <nUm> , 9-diallylfluorene have been examined . the reaction obeys the following rate law : rate = Kobs[Zr][Bu2Mg] when [Bu2Mg] < <nUm> m , and rate = Kobs[Zr] when [Bu2Mg] > <nUm> m . the stereochemistry of the products depends upon the substrate , the magnesium reagent , the magnesium reagent concentration , and the temperature of the cyclization . the diastereoselectivity of the reaction depends on the relative rate of metallacycle formation , isomerization , and transmetalation . an understanding of these relative rates allows for the rational control of the diastereoselectivity to reflect either the kinetic selectivity of metallacycle formation or the thermodynamic stabilites of the diastereomeric metallacycles . 
with the aim of a possible rationalization of the probability distributions of stereochemical configurations of the regioirregular units in isotactic polymer samples ( prepared in the presence of rac-ethylenebis(4 , <nUm> , <nUm> , 7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride or rac-ethylenebis(l-indenyl)zirconium dichloride and methylaluminoxane ) , a detailed molecular mechanics analysis on previously proposed model catalytic sites is reported . In particular , catalytic intermediates suitable for primary and secondary insertions of propene on primary and secondary polypropene chains , for both systems with rac-ethylenebis(4 , <nUm> , <nUm> , 7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl ) and rac-ethylenebis(l-indenyl) ligands , are compared . the models are able to rationalize the observed enantioselectivities , not only for the regioregular placements but also for the regioirregular placements ( secondary insertion on a primary chain and primary insertion on a secondary chain ) . moreover , the nonbonded interactions in the models give a contribution in favor of the monomer coordination suitable for the primary insertion , even after an occasional secondary insertion , and are able to account for the higher regiospecificity observed for titanocene - based , with respect to zirconocene - based , catalytic systems . 
A structural analysis is reported of roughly <nUm> transition - metal (TM)-chalcogenido complexes in a variety of chemical environments . with few exceptions , agreement between calculated and experimental geometries is excellent . the research provides convincing evidence that computational methods employed are adequately describing the bonding in these diverse TM complexes . interesting trends in relative TMCh ( RMCh' - RMCh ) bond lengths are found . experimental and computational data show that other than the zirconocene - and hafnocene-oxos there is similar behavior in relative bond lengths for widely varying TM - chalcogenido complexes . relative bond lengths versus oxo ( S-O , Se-O , and Te-O ) in group IVB metallocenes tend to be larger than for other families of complexes and show less variation among the heavier chalcogens ( Se-S , Te-S , and Te-Se ) . analysis of localized wave functions for Cp2ZrCh point to a greater contribution from a singly - bonded Zr-Ch structure ( relative to Zr-Ch ) when ch is O compared to heavier chalcogens . taken together , the data suggest that there is a fundamental difference in the zr-oxo ( and hf-oxo ) bond in relation to heavier chalcogens , consistent with recent experimental data . In previous studies of multiply bonded TM complexes we have focused on the ability of ECPs to make computations feasible for complexes incorporating even the heaviest transition metals . the present work also evaluates ECP methods for heavier main group ( MG ) elements . the chalcogens ( ch ) O , S , Se , and Te are included in this study .

this is the first report on the simulation of the full dynamics , at a quantum mechanical level , of a catalytic chemical reaction . ab initio molecular dynamics simulations on ethylene insertion in a bridged dicyclopentadienyl-methylzirconocene have revealed that the entire reaction path starting from the p-coordinated ethylene-zirconocene complex up to and including propyl formation takes place in about <nUm> fs , which is unexpectedly fast . this observation suggests the absence of any significant barrier of activation , as confirmed by static energy minimizations . the cp rings are very flexible . starting from a reactant structure without a-agostic interaction , at T = <nUm> K such an interaction evolves during the course of the insertion reaction and before the propyl is formed . the product state exhibits g-H agostic interaction .

the reaction of B(C6F5)3with zirconocene dimethyl complexes L2ZrMe2in hydrocarbon solvents affords base - free cationic zirconium complexes L2ZrMe+MeB(C6F5)3- ( L = e5-C5H5 , <nUm> ; e5-Me2C5H3 , <nUm> ; e5-Me5C5 , <nUm> ; e5- (TMS)2C5H3 , <nUm> ) in quantitative yields . A similar reaction using (tBu2C5H3)2ZrMe2results in the formation of the cationic metallacyclic product tBu2C5H3 ) [ tBuC5H3(Me2)CH2Zr+MeB(C6F5)3- ( 6 ) through what is presumably an intramolecular C-H activation process . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> undergo rapid hydrogenolysis to yield the corresponding cationic hydrido complexes (Me5C5)2ZrH+MeB(C6F5)3- ( 7 ) , (Me5C5)2ZrH+HB(C6F5)3- ( 8 ) ( stepwise ) , and (tBu2C5H3)2ZrH+MeB(C6F5)3- ( 9 ) , respectively . complex <nUm> undergoes slow conversion to { [(Me2C5H3)2ZrMe]2(m- F)]+MeB(C6F5)3- ( 12 ) in C6D6under an inert atmosphere at <nUm> ° C . complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> have been characterized by x-ray diffraction ( crystal data : <nUm> , monoclinic , P21 / n , a = <nUm> a,b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , r = <nUm> ; <nUm> , monoclinic , P21 / n , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β - <nUm> ° , r = <nUm> ; <nUm> , triclinic , pi , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , r = <nUm> ; <nUm> , monoclinic , p21a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , r = <nUm> ; <nUm> , triclinic , pi , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , r = <nUm> ; <nUm> , triclinic , p1a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° ,R = <nUm> ) . these structure determinations allow detailed analysis of the metrical aspects of L2ZrMe+MeB(C6F5)3- ion pairing on the solid state . As revealed by dynamic1H NMR , complexes 1-4 undergo rapid intramolecular Zr-Me / B-Me exchange ( [?]G*(s , kcal / mol , ° C , complex ) = <nUm> ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ; <nUm> ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ; <nUm> ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ; <nUm> ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ) and for <nUm> and <nUm> , symmetrizing ion - pair dissociation - recombination processes ( [?]G*(s , kcal / mol , ° C , complex ) = <nUm> ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ; <nUm> ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) ) . complexes 1-4 , <nUm> , and <nUm> are highly active homogeneous catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene with activities ( <nUm> - <nUm> x <nUm> g polyethylene / mol Zr h atm at <nUm> ° C ) comparable to methylalumoxane - based zirconocene catalysts . complexes 1-3 , <nUm> and <nUm> are also active for the atactic polymerization of propylene . In regard to polymerization chain transfer mechanisms , NMR endgroup analysis and labeling experiments using CH2 = CH13CH3indicate the predominant pathway for <nUm> and <nUm> is 0-H elimination , while for <nUm> it is 0-CH3elimination . these experiments unambiguously rule out propylene C-H activation processes as an important chain transfer pathway . complex <nUm> is highly active for the catalytic dimerization of propylene ( nt = <nUm> s-1at <nUm> ° C ) to form a mixture of 2-methyl-l-pentene and 2-methyl-2-pentene . 
the development of a new method for the regiospecific synthesis of polysubstituted indoles and indolines is reported . the key steps involve the generation of zirconocene - stabilized benzyne complexes and subsequent intramolecular olefin insertion reactions to provide tricyclic indoline zirconacycles . the zirconacyclic intermediates were cleaved with iodine to yield diiodo indolines , which were converted to a wide variety of indole and indoline products , such as analogs of tryptamine , serotonin , tryptophan , and the pharmacophore of CC - <nUm> . 
In some cases zirconocene — imine complexes insert CO2 ; more generally they insert isocyanates and cyclic carbonates . isocyanates can insert into either the Zr – C or the Zr – N bond ; protonolysis of the zirconacycle resulting from Zr – C insertion gives an amide , whereas protonolysis of the zirconacycle resulting from Zr – N insertion gives a urea . steric hindrance on the imine nitrogen or the isocyanate discourages insertion into the Zr – N bond and gives clean Zr – C insertion . the molecular structure of an n-phenyl imine complex ( 5a ) has been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . A coordinated THF in 5a exchanges with free THF by a dissociative mechanism . coordination of isocyanates to the Zr of 5a has not been observed before their insertion . the isocyanate insertion reactions of imine complexes such as <nUm> are irreversible . A chelating o-methoxy substituent on the n-phenyl of an imine complex ( 18 ) also prevents insertion into the Zr – N bond and gives clean Zr – C insertion . the treatment of <nUm> with ethylene carbonate gives a spirocyclic complex ( 23 ) ; methanolysis of <nUm> in benzene gives the methyl ester of phenylglycine . A crossover experiment suggests that the free b-hydroxyethyl ester is an intermediate in the benzene methanolysis of <nUm> .

the interaction of (e5-C5H5)2ZrX2 ( x = me , Cl ) with Al (tBu)3 and alumoxanes [ (tBu)2Al{m-OAl (Bu)2}]2 and [ (tBu)Al (m3-O)]n ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> ) has been investigated . the lewis acid — base complexes (e5-C5H5)2Zr ( x ) (m-X)-Al (tBu)3 [ x = me ( 1 ) , Cl ( 2 ) ] have been isolated and characterized by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy . the molecular structure of compound <nUm> has been obtained by x-ray crystallography , indicating the presence of a Zr (m-Cl)Al moiety . the Zr (m-Cl)Al interaction in compound <nUm> is compared to the Al — Cl bond in [PPN][AlCl- (tBu)3 ] ( 4 ) . [ (tBu)2Al{m-OAl (tBu)2}]2 , which contains two three - coordinate ( unsaturated ) aluminum centers , shows no reaction with (e5-C5H5)2ZrMe2and no catalytic activity toward ethylene polymerization . In contrast , the closed cage compound [ (tBu)Al (m3-O)]6reacts reversibly to give the ion pair complex [ (e5-C5H5)2ZrMe][ (tBu)6Al6 (O)6Me ] ( 7 ) . the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant keq has been determined and , hence , the enthalpy and entropy for the formation of complex <nUm> [ DH = <nUm> ( 1 ) kJ mol-1 , DS = <nUm> ( 5 ) J mol-1 K-1 ] . complex <nUm> is active as a catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene . polymerization is also observed for mixtures of (e5-C5H5)2ZrMe2with [ (tBu)Al (m3-O)]n ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) despite the lack of observable complex formation . A solution structure of <nUm> is proposed upon the basis of NMR spectroscopy and a comparison with [ (Et2O)Li]2[ (tBu)6Al6 (O)6Me2 ] ( 8 ) , formed from the reaction of f (tBu)Al (m3-O)]6with MeLi in Et2O . upon the basis of NMR spectroscopy , compound <nUm> exists as either the anti ( 8a ) or syn ( 8b ) isomer as a result of endo or exo methylation of the aluminum centers . the lithium atoms in compound <nUm> are formally two - coordinate ; however , close tert-butyl C — H***Li contacts suggest the presence of agostic stabilization . these results are discussed with respect to the commercial (e5-C5H5)2ZrMe2- methylalumoxane ( MAO ) polyolefin catalyst system , and the new concept of “ latent lewis acidity ” (GAL-O)is proposed to account for the reactivity of the cage hexamer [ (tBu)Al (m3-O)]6 . crystal data for <nUm> : orthorhombic , pnma , a = <nUm> ( 9 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , rw = <nUm> . crystal data for <nUm> : monoclinic , P21 / n , a = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 7 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , rw = <nUm> . crystal data for <nUm> : orthorhombic , pbca , a = <nUm> ( 8 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 6 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 9 ) Å , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , rw = <nUm> .

zirconocene - catalyzed carbomagnesation reactions of cyclic ethers <nUm> and <nUm> with n-PrMgCl and n-BuMgCl afford homoallylic and bishomoallylic alcohols <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> in ~ <nUm> % yield and exceptional levels of enantioselectivity and regiocontrol . where n-BuMgCl is used as the alkylating agent , high levels of diastereochemical control are also observed ( cf. <nUm> vs <nUm> in entries <nUm> and <nUm> of table <nUm> ) . studies reported herein underline a number of important mechanistic issues : ( i ) although zirconocene — alkene complexes <nUm> exist as a mixture of diastereomers in solution ( syn and anti ) , it is only one of the isomers which reacts to afford the observed products . ( ii ) whereas insertion of an alkene substrate into the unsymmetric complexes <nUm> and <nUm> proceeds with low levels of regioselectivity at <nUm> ° C , at <nUm> ° C high levels of regiocontrol are observed ( cf. intermediacy of <nUm> vs <nUm> in scheme <nUm> ) . In this context , various mechanistic experiments shed light on factors that may be responsible for the observed temperature effect . ( iii ) unusual modes of preference for the regioselectivity in b-hydride abstraction of intermediate dialkylzirconocene are reported ; these observations may be accounted for through consideration of the steric effects imposed by the cyclohexyl groups of the chiral ligand and the stereoelectronic requirements of the elimination reaction . 
the first high molecular weight polystannanes , H(SnR2)nH ( r = nBu , nHex , nOct ) , result from dehydropolymerization of secondary stannanes R2SnH2 by zirconocene catalysts . good catalysts include zirconocenes based on both CpCp*Zr ( cp* = e-CsMes ) and Cp2Zr fragments , and the most active catalyst with respect to production of high molecular weight polystannanes was Me2C(e5-C5H4)2Zr[Si(SiMe3)3]Me . the latter catalyst produced H(SnnBu2)nH chains ( mw / Mn = <nUm> <nUm> / <nUm> <nUm> ) that were contaminated by ca. <nUm> % ( by weight ) low molecular weight cyclic oligomers . lower molecular weights resulted from dehydropolymerizations of Me2SnH2 , PhMeSnH2 , and Ph2SnH2 . At room temperature , H(SnR2)nH ( r = alkyl group ) polystannanes have amax values at ca. <nUm> — <nUm> nm , attributed to σ — s* transitions . thermal gravimetric analyses on the polystannanes reveal that these polymers are as thermally stable as related poly(dialkylsilane)s and have onset temperatures for thermal decomposition in the range <nUm> — <nUm> ° C , under both nitrogen and air . the H(SnnBu2)nH polymer has been shown to be a good precursor to sn02 , as shown by bulk pyrolysis in air ( ceramic yield : <nUm> % ) . preliminary results also indicate that these polymers may be useful as precursors to elemental tin . the polystannanes are photosensitive , and their photobleaching behavior has been characterized by UV — vis spectrometry and 119Sn NMR spectroscopy , which demonstrated that H(SnnBu2)nH is photochemically depolymerized to a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of cyclo-(SnnBu2)5 and cyclo-(SnnBu2)6 . the polymers H(SnnHex2)nH and H(SnnOct2)nH exhibit thermochromic behavior which is visibly evident as a discoloration from yellow to colorless upon warming above room temperature . this reversible behavior is associated with an abrupt change in amax ( e.g. , from <nUm> to <nUm> nm for films of H(SnnOct2)nH ) and a phase change at ca. <nUm> ° C ( by differential scanning calorimetry ) . thin films of H(SnnBu2)nH and H(SnnOct2)nH on glass slides were doped by exposure to SbF5vapor to conductivities of 10-2and <nUm> S cm-1 , respectively . preliminary experiments suggest that the dehydropolymerization occurs by a a-bond metathesis mechanism involving four - center transition states . A previous report on production of high molecular weight poly(dibutylstannane) by the reductive coupling of nBu2SnCl2by Na / 15-crown-5 was reinvestigated and found to produce only low molecular weight material with mw / Mn = <nUm> / <nUm> . 
bis(propynyl)zirconocene ( 7a ) reacts with [ cp <nUm> CHZr <nUm> ( THF ) ] + [ BPh <nUm> ] – ( 8a ) to yield the [ (m-propynyl)(m-e <nUm> : η <nUm> -MeCCMe)(Cp <nUm> Zr ) <nUm> ] cation complex 5b that contains a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom . complex 5b was characterized by x-ray diffraction . the planar-tetracoordinate carbon center ( C2 ) of 5b exhibits four strong bonds to its nearest in plane neighbors , i.e. to two carbon and two zirconium centers . In solution , complex 5b is dynamic . the C <nUm> symmetric planar-tetracoordinate carbon compound 5b undergoes a thermally induced automerization reaction [ AG* ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol – <nUm> ] that proceeds through a C 2v -symmetric geometry ( 6b ) that has the characteristics of a transition state according to a theoretical analysis of the <nUm> ⇌ <nUm> ⇌ <nUm> ’ rearrangement process . this means that the extra stabilization energy of planar-tetracoordinate carbon relative to ordinary planar - tricoordinate carbon in the “ semi-fenestrane ” environment of the complexes <nUm> amounts to ca. <nUm> – <nUm> kcal mol – <nUm> . the <nUm> ⇌ <nUm> ’ equilibrium is strongly influenced by substituents at the m-e <nUm> : η <nUm> -RCCCH <nUm> ligand and by electronically active cp substitution . In addition , a strong memory effect is operative in the formation of <nUm> . it can be observed by using suitably substituted pairs of isomeric complexes <nUm> . thus , the reaction between [ cp <nUm> ZrCD <nUm> ( THF ) ] + ( 8d ) and ( MeCp ) <nUm> -Zr( – C ≡ C – CH <nUm> ) <nUm> ( 7e ) gives only complex <nUm> h , which exhibits the CH3 group at the planar-tetracoordinate carbon center C2 , whereas the reaction of the complementary reagent combination [ ( MeCp ) <nUm> ZrCD <nUm> ( THF ) ] + ( 8e ) / cp <nUm> zr-( – C ≡ C – CH <nUm> ) <nUm> ( 7a ) ] in this double - labeling experiment exclusively leads to the same type of product ( 5i ) that has the CD3 group bonded to C2 . this and other examples of this organometallic memory effect indicate that dimetallic intermediates are involved in the formation of the unusually structured stable planar-tetracoordinate carbon compounds <nUm> .

the coupling reaction of zirconocene alkyne complexes with a second alkyne provides a general method for the preparation of asymmetrically substituted zirconacyclopentadienes . the overall transformation is the chemoselective and regioselective intermolecular cross-coupling of two alkynes , a goal that has not been achieved with other methodology . isomerically pure 1,3-dienes or 1,4-diiodo 1,3-dienes are obtained upon treatment of the metallacyclopentadienes with aqueous acid or iodine . because this synthesis can be carried out as a one - pot procedure starting from the alkynes and schwartz 's reagent ( Cp2ZrHCl ) , it is an attractive alternative to other transition - metal - based methods for the synthesis of dienes from vinyl halides and isolated vinylmetal starting materials . 
enynes and diynes react with “ ZrCp2 ” ( where cp = e5-C5H5 generated by treating Cl2ZrCp2 with Mg and Cl2Hg or <nUm> equiv of an alkyllithium , such as n-BuLi , or a grignard reagent , such as EtMgBr , and can produce in excellent yields zirconabicycles represented by <nUm> ( m = Zr ) and <nUm> , respectively . their protonolysis can provide the corresponding exocyclic alkenes and conjugated dienes <nUm> , respectively . iodinolysis of <nUm> ( m = Zr ) can give the corresponding diiodides in high yields , while carbonylation of <nUm> ( m = Zr ) can produce bicyclic enones <nUm> ( Y = O ) in moderate to good yields . although the bicyclization reaction fails with terminal alkyne containing substrates , various types of substituents on the alkyne moiety , such as alkyl , alkenyl , aryl , trialkylsilyl , and trialkylstannyl groups , can be accommodated . investigation of the n-BuLi-Cl2ZrCp2 reaction has revealed that it gives first (n-Bu)2ZrCp2 at <nUm> ° C , which then decomposes to give Cp2Zr(CH2 = CHEt ) , identified as its PMe3 complex <nUm> . the PMe3 - stabilized complex reacts with diphenylacetylene to produce a crystalline compound which has been identified as a zirconacyclopropene , 36a . this demonstrated , for the first time , the feasibility of converting alkynes into zirconacyclopropenes . the reaction of preformed , three - membered zirconacycles with alkynes gives five - membered zirconacycles . the reaction of diphenylacetylene is ca. <nUm> times as fast as that of (E)-stilbene . these results support a mechanism involving formation of a zirconacyclopropene intermediate followed by its intramolecular carbometalation with the alkene moiety of enynes for the Zr - promoted bicyclization of enynes . 
A general method for the preparation of zirconocene complexes of imines has been developed . the x-ray crystal structure of the (trimethylsilyl)benzaldimine complex 2b shows that these complexes should be viewed as metallaaziridenes due to significant p-donation from the zirconium center to the p* orbitals of the coordinated imine . these complexes undergo a number of chemo- , regio- , and diastereoselective coupling reactions with unsaturated organic compounds to cleanly form metallacyclic compounds . In situ generation of the complexes followed by coupling with alkynes and hydrolysis affords a general route to geometrically pure allylic amines .

the development of a new macrocyclization reagent , rosenthal 's Cp2Zr(pyr)(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) , has allowed the preparation of two large , functionalized macrocycles . the diyne 5,5'-bis(4-trimethylsilylphenyl)-2,2'-bipyridine was trimerized to the bipyridine - containing macrocycle <nUm> , and 1,4-bis(4-(trimethylsilyl)ethynylphenyl)-2,3-diphenyl-1,4-diazabuta-1,3-diene was dimerized to macrocycle <nUm> . both zirconocene - containing macrocycles were characterized by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . macrocycle <nUm> , which is cleanly converted to air - stable cyclophane <nUm> with benzoic acid , has a cavity of van der waals radius <nUm> Å . In general , the Cp2Zr(pyr)(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) reagent gives higher yields of macrocycles via the coupling of diynes than does the reagent generated by addition of n-BuLi to Cp2ZrCl2 .

(Butadiene)zirconocene reacts with acetone azine by CC coupling to give a seven - membered metallacyclic <nUm> : <nUm> addition product . In contrast , benzophenone azine reacts with the diene metallocene system with liberation of butadiene to form Cp2Zr(N-CPh2)2 ( 9b ) . this product is also obtained upon irradiation of Cp2Zr(CO)2 with Ph2C-NN-CPh2 or treatment of Cp2ZrCl2 with <nUm> equiv of LiN-CPh2 . the molecular structure of the bis(alkylideneamido)metallocene complex 9b was determined by x-ray diffraction . the zirconocene complex crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2 / c with cell constants a - <nUm> ( 5 ) , b - <nUm> ( 1 ) , c - <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 8 ) ° , and z = <nUm> . the zirconium bound — N-CPh2 ligands ( including the ipso carbons of the phenyl substituents ) are oriented in the Cp-Zr-Cp bisecting plane . to a first approximation both Zr_N-CPh2 units can be regarded as being of a heteroallene structural type , characterized by bisecting C-N and N-Zr p-bonding planes and near to sp - hybridized nitrogen centers . accordingly , very short zirconium to nitrogen bond distances are observed : N(1)-Zr , <nUm> ( 2 ) Å ; N(2)-Zr , <nUm> ( 2 ) Å . the Zr-N(2)-C(2) unit ( <nUm> ( 2 ) ° ) is slightly less linearly arranged than Zr-N(l)-C(1) ( <nUm> ( 2 ) ° ) . the solid - state structure shows a clear distinction of E- and z-oriented phenyl substituents at the Ph2C-N — Zr moieties . this is not observed in solution , however . In the 13C NMR spectrum even at low temperature ( <nUm> K ) complex 9b exhibits only one set of phenyl group carbon resonances . this indicates a rapid equilibration of (E)- and (Z)-phenyl groups . this is an uncommon feature for heteroallene - type (alkylideneamido)metallocene complexes . we propose a linear to bent to linear (R2C-N)MCp2(X) isomerization reaction sequence to take place rapidly in solution . this unusual dynamic feature attributes to the organometallic compound 9b an intermediate position between organic schiff bases ( sp2 - hybridized nitrogen , bent structure ) and stabilized heteroallene - type ( sp - hybridized nitrogen , linear structure ) inorganic (alkylideneamido)metal complexes . 
A variety of zirconocene thioaldehyde complexes <nUm> have been prepared in high yield by heating (alkylthio)-methylzirconocenes <nUm> in the presence of PMe3 . the formation of the thiobenzaldehyde complex ( lb ) from Cp2Zr(Me)SCH2Ph ( 2b ) has been found to follow first - order kinetics independent of trimethylphosphine concentration , with DH ‡ = <nUm> ( 0.1 ) kcal / mol and DS ‡ = <nUm> ( 0.4 ) eu .

A hammet plot showed that phenyl substituents exert a modest influence on the reaction rate , with ρ = + <nUm> ( 0.02 ) . these observations are more consistent with a concerted four - center cyclometalation process in which the transition state is polarized so that hydrogen moves as a proton than with a stepwise b-hydride elimination / reductive elimination sequence . 
<nUm> , 6-and <nUm> , 7-enynes are efficiently cyclized to bicyclic metallacyclopentenes with titanocene or zirconocene reagents which are easily generated in situ . the metallacycles can be hydrolyzed to release the alkylidenecycloalkane or can be metathesized with main group halides such as C6S , ClSe , or Ph2SnCl2 to give heterocycles . the zirconium - mediated reaction is more effective for sterically demanding cases . the alkylidene moiety is introduced with <nUm> % stereoselectivity for the e-diastereomer ; this provides an excellent starting place for the elaboration of chiral side chains as illustrated by a formal synthesis of the ant pheromone invictolide . the cyclization is compatible with alkyl and silyl ether functionality . sugar enynes , efficiently synthesized from readily available sugar lactones , undergo stereospecific cyclization to highly functional , enantiomerically pure carbocycles .

A general method for the in situ production of zirconocene complexes of substituted benzynes is reported . these complexes can be trapped with nitriles to form good yields of metallacyclic compounds with extremely good regiochemical control . these compounds can be converted into ketones , a-iodo ketones , and isothiazoles by using experimentally simple procedures . In addition , generation of the benzyne complexes under <nUm> atm of ethylene produces metallacycles which can be readily converted into the corresponding benzocyclobutanes . 
A family of ketene - alkylaluminum complexes of formula [(e5-C5H5)2Zr(C,Oe2-OCCHR)]2(m-AlR'2)(m-X) has been prepared by treating the zirconocene ketene complexes [(e5-C5H5)2Zr(C,O-e2-OCCHR)]2with alkylaluminum reagents R'2A1X ( II , III , r = CH2CMe3 , r ’ = me , x = me ; VIa , vila , r = CH2CMe3 , r ’ = CH3 , x = Cl ; VIIb , r = H , r ’ = CH3 , x = Cl ; IX , x , r = CH2CMe3 , r ’ = et , x = H ) . the crystal and molecular structure of four compounds of this series ( III , vila , IX , and x ) have been determined . complex vila crystallizes in space group P21 / c ( z = <nUm> ) with cell constants a = <nUm> ( 14 ) A , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , <nUm> = <nUm> ( 14 ) ° , and V = <nUm> ( 10 ) A3 ( <nUm> reflections , r = <nUm> ) . complex IX crystallizes in space group C2 / c ( z = <nUm> ) with cell constants a = <nUm> ( 5 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 11 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 5 ) ° , V = <nUm> ( 2 ) A3 ( <nUm> reflections , r = <nUm> ) . complex x crystallizes in space group C2 / c ( z = <nUm> ) with cell constants a = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 8 ) ° , and V = <nUm> ( 1 ) A3 ( <nUm> reflections , r = <nUm> ) . structural comparisons of these molecules reveal several common features . two zirconocene ketene monomers are spanned by symmetric dialkylaluminum and hydride , chloride , or methyl bridges to form slightly puckered six - membered rings . A notable feature of these structures is the coordination of the bridging ligand x ( H , Cl , or me ) , which is characterized by a large m – x – m angle and an unusual hybridization for the bridging methyl ligand . the coordination of the bridging methyl group in III represents a new bonding geometry for carbon . this geometry models the structure of intermediates in alkyl transmetallations that proceed with inversion . the reaction of III with acetylene produces a zirconocene cyclic enolate IV. complex III also reacts with carbon monoxide to produce a zirconocene acyl-enol complex V — an unprecedented reaction for group <nUm> ketene complexes that is relevant to the behavior of such species over early transition - metal fischer - tropsch catalysts . the greater reactivity of III is discussed in terms of the greater lability of the methyl bridge compared to the chloride or hydride bridge . 
the reaction of lithiated benzhydryl methyl ether with zirconocene dichloride yields Cp2ZrCl(CPh2OCH3) ( 8 ) . the molecular structure of <nUm> in the crystal was determined by x-ray diffraction . <nUm> crystallizes in the space group P212121 with cell constants a = <nUm> ( 2 ) A , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) A , c = <nUm> ( 6 ) A , and gcalcd = <nUm> g cm-1for z = <nUm> . the most remarkable structural feature of <nUm> is the strong intramolecular coordination of the ether oxygen to the zirconium center . the oxygen binds to the available central position in the bent metallocene s-ligand plane . the resulting metallaoxirane structural subunit is characterized by bond distances <nUm> ( 6 ) A ( Zr-C ) , <nUm> ( 4 ) A ( Zr-O ) , and <nUm> ( 7 ) A ( O-C ) . upon heating to <nUm> ° C , <nUm> decomposes to give tetraphenylethylene and Cp2Zr(OCH3)Cl as the major components . with zirconium hydrides Cp2Zr(H)Cl or Cp2ZrH2 <nUm> reacts by intra- and intermolecular insertion reactions of the CPh2 group into the zirconium-hydrogen bond to give two pairs of compounds : Cp2Zr(OCH3)Cl ( 9 ) / Cp2Zr(CHPh2)Cl ( 24 ) and Cp2ZrCl2 ( 6 ) / Cp2Zr(CHPh2)OCH3(25) . these reactions are strongly reminiscent of the chemistry of the CH2 species on a fischer - tropsch catalyst surface . metallaoxiranes as <nUm> might , therefore , be considered to serve as molecular models for fischer - tropsch type chemistry on metal oxide surfaces . this view is supported by the observation that the bridging metallaoxirane unit in (m-formaldehyde)(Cp2ZrCl)2(1) undergoes the same type of insertion reaction . its CO-derived methylene unit is transferred to form (Cp2ZrCl)2O ( 29 ) and Cp2Zr(CH3)Cl ( 22 ) when treated with the oligomeric zirconocene ( hydrido ) chloride <nUm> at <nUm> ° C . 
the formation of adducts of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane with strongly coordinating anions such as CN- and [M(CN)4]2- ( m = Ni , Pd ) is a synthetically facile route to the bulky , very weakly coordinating anions [CN{B(C6F5)3}2]- and [M{CNB(C6F5)3}4] 2- which are isolated as stable NHMe2Ph+ and CPh3+ salts . the crystal structures of [CPh3][CN{B(C6F5)3} <nUm> ] ( 1 ) , [CPh3][ClB(C6F5)3] ( 2 ) , [NHMe2Ph]2[Ni{CNB(C6F5) 3}4]*2Me2CO ( 4b*2Me2CO ) , [CPh3]2[Ni{CNB(C6F5) 3}4]*2CH2Cl2 ( 4c*2CH2Cl2 ) , and [CPh3]2[Pd{CNB(C6F5) <nUm> } 4]*2CH2Cl2 ( 5c*2CH2Cl2 ) are reported . the CN stretching frequencies in <nUm> and <nUm> are shifted by ∼ <nUm> cm-1 to higher wavenumbers compared to the parent tetracyano complexes in aqueous solution , although the M-C and C-N distances show no significant change on BC18F15 coordination . zirconocene dimethyl complexes L2ZrMe2 [ L2 = cp2 , SBI = rac-Me2Si(Ind)2 ] react with <nUm> , 4c or 5c in benzene solution at <nUm> ° C to give the salts of binuclear methyl-bridged cations , [(L2ZrMe)2(m-Me)] [CN{B(C6F5)3}2] and [(L2ZrMe)2(m-Me)]2 [M{CNB-(C6F5)3}4] . the reactivity of these species in solution was studied in comparison with the known [{(SBI)-ZrMe}2(m-Me)][B(C6F5)4 ] . while the latter reacts with excess [CPh3][B(C6F5)4] in benzene to give the mononuclear ion pair [ (SBI)ZrMe+*** B(C6F5)4- ] in a pseudo-first-order reaction , k = <nUm> × 10-4 s-1 , [(L2-ZrMe)2(m-Me)] [CN{B(C6F5)3}2] reacts to give a mixture of L2ZrMe(m-Me)B(C6F5)3 and L2ZrMe(m-NC)B-(C6F5)3 . recrystallization of [Cp''2Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2] [CN{B(C6F5)3}2] affords Cp''2ZrMe(m-NC) BC18F15 <nUm> , the x-ray structure of which is reported . the stability of [(L2ZrMe)2(m-Me)]+X- decreases in the order x = [B(C6F5)4] > [M{CNB(C6F5)3}4] > [CN{B(C6F5)3}2] and increases strongly with the steric bulk of L2 = cp2 ≪ SBI . activation of (SBI)ZrMe2 by <nUm> in the presence of AlBui3 gives extremely active ethene polymerization catalysts . polymerization studies at 1-7 bar monomer pressure suggest that these , and by implication most other highly active ethene polymerization catalysts , are strongly mass - transport limited . by contrast , monitoring propene polymerization activities with the systems (SBI)ZrMe2 / <nUm> / AlBui3 and CGCTiMe2 / <nUm> / AlBui3 at <nUm> ° C as a function of catalyst concentration demonstrates that in these cases mass - transport limitation is absent up to [metal] ≈ <nUm> × 10-5 mol L-1 . propene polymerization activities decrease in the order [CN{B(C6F5)3}2]- > [B(C6F5)4]- > [M{CNB(C6F5)3}4]2- ≫ [MeB(C6F5)3]- , with differences in activation barriers relative to [CN{B(C6F5)3}2]- of DDG ‡ = <nUm> ( B(C6F5)4- ) , <nUm> ( Ni{CNB(C6F5)3}42- ) and <nUm> - <nUm> kJ mol-1 ( MeB(C6F5)3- ) . the data suggest that even in the case of very bulky anions with delocalized negative charge the displacement of the anion by the monomer must be involved in the rate - limiting step .

transition metals have the unique ability to simultaneously stabilize high - energy organic species and to activate them toward selective attack by a variety of chemical reagents . cyclooctyne is the smallest cycloalkyne to have been prepared in the free state while cycloheptyne and cyclohexyne have been observed as fleeting intermediates by several methods.1 several years ago , bennett and co-workers reported the trapping of in situ generated cyclohexyne and cycloheptyne as their bis(triphenylphosphine)platinum complexes . 
this paper reports an integrated chemical / physicochemical investigation of the aqueous chemistry of Cp2TiCl2 , Cp2VCl2 , and Cp2ZrCl2 , employing high - field FT NMR , chloride potentiometry , pH titrimetry , and electrical conductivity . experimental conditions include those employed previously to study the hydrolysis of cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum(II) ( “ cisplatin ” ) and those approximating physiological . In unbuffered aqueous <nUm> m KNO3 solution at <nUm> ° C , the order of decreasing hydrolytic stability of the M-(e5-C5H5) bond in the Cp2MCl2 complexes ( monitored by high - field FT NMR ) was found to be V ( kinitiai ≤ <nUm> × 10-3 h-1 ) > Ti ( kinitia| = <nUm> ( 1 ) × 10-3 h-1 ) ≫ Zr ( knitial = <nUm> ( 1 ) × 10-2h-1 ) . of the three complexes studied , only Cp2VCl2 was found to possess a stable M-(e5-C5H5) bond at physiological pH . addition of any of the Cp2MCl2 complexes to water ( pure or <nUm> m KNO3 ) results in rapid chloride ion dissociation with approximate half - lives for the loss of the second chloride ( the first is too rapid to measure ) of <nUm> min ( m = Ti ) , <nUm> min ( m = Zr ) , and <nUm> min ( m = V ) in contrast to the relatively slow chloride hydrolysis observed with cisplatin . chloride dissociation is also more extensive than that in cisplatin . equilibrium chloride ion concentration measurements indicate that the equilibrium constant ( K1 ) for the first Cp2MCl2 chloride dissociation is too large to measure , while K2 = <nUm> ( 2.7 ) × 10-2 m ( m = Ti ) and <nUm> ( 1.2 ) × 10-3 m ( m = V ) . titrimetric studies indicate that the acidity of the Cp2M2+ - bound water molecules is uniformly more acidic than the metal - bound water molecules of cis-[Pt(NH3)2(H2O)2]2+ ( Ti , pKa = <nUm> ( 5 ) and <nUm> ( 9 ) ; V , pKa = <nUm> ( 3 ) and <nUm> ( 13 ) ) . implications of these results for the observed biological activity of the Cp2MCl2 complexes are briefly discussed . 
the reaction of alkynes with a methylalane , such as Me3Al , and a zirconocene derivative , such as Cl2ZrCp2 , provides a convenient and selective route to (E)-2-methyl-1-alkenylalanes in high yields . the reaction is catalytic in Zr . the stereoselectivity is generally > <nUm> % , and the regioselectivity observed with terminal alkynes is typically ca. <nUm> % . although the reaction of alkynes with trialkylalanes containing b-hydrogens and Cl2ZrCp2 is complicated by competitive hydrometalation and diminished ( 70-80 % ) regioselectivity , the hydrometalation reaction can be avoided by using chlorodialkylalanes and Cl2ZrCp2 . the Zr - catalyzed carboalumination reaction of typical alkynes , such as phenylacetylene and 1-octyne , most likely involves direct Al-C bond addition assisted by Zr .

the soluble bis(cyclopentadienyl)bis(phenyl)titanium / methylalumoxane catalyst system produces isotactic polypropylene with a novel stereoblock microstructure consistent with a chain - end stereochemical control mechanism . chiral catalysts derived from the racemic enantiomers of ethylene-bridged indenyl derivatives are the first metallocene catalysts to form isotactic polypropylene with the conventional structure predicted by an enantiomorphic - site stereochemical control model . the meso achiral form of the ethylene-bridged titanium indenyl diastereomers and zirconocene derivatives produce polypropylene with an ideally atactic structure . differing regiospecificities during cis addition with soluble Ti and V chain - end controlled stereospecific systems result in Ti being isotactic specific and V being syndiotactic specific .

ion pairs of the type Cpx2ZrMe+***A - containing various ansa - zirconocene methyl cations in contact with Me-B(C6F5)3- or B(C6F5)4- anions have been studied with regard to their anion exchange kinetics by 2D - NMR methods in benzene or toluene solutions . the results - acceleration of anion exchange by added Li+***Me-B(C6F5) 3- , substantial nonproductive exchange between added and Zr - bound Me-B(C6F5)3- anions , an increase of exchange rates at increased zirconocene concentrations , and the exclusively entropic origin of this rate increase - all indicate that anion exchange occurs by way of ion quadruples or higher ionic aggregates , rather than via dissociation to solvent - separated ions . these findings imply that solvent - separated ( i.e. anion - free ) alkyl zirconocene cations are unlikely to be relevant intermediates in reaction systems containing Cpx2ZrMe+***A - ion pairs and , hence , also in zirconocene - based catalyst systems for the polymerization of a-olefins .

reduction of bis(e-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride with potassium naphthalene , at low temperatures in tetra-hydrofuran , yields m-(2-e1;:1-2-e2-naphthyl)-hydrido-bis[bis(e-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium] ( Zr-Zr ) , (e-C5H5)2-Zr(C10H7)(H)Zr(e-C5H5)2 ( hereinafter labeled I ) . the compound was characterized by a combination of chemical methods and x-ray crystallography . crystals of I are orthorhombic , of space group pbca ( centrosymmetric ) , cell parameters a = <nUm> ( 8 ) , b = <nUm> ( 6 ) , and c = <nUm> ( 8 ) nm , and contain eight molecules of C15H14Zr per unit cell . key structural parameters follow : D(Zr-Zr) = <nUm> ( 2 ) , mean D(Zr-C5H5 , centroid ) = <nUm> ( 3 ) , D(Zr-e1-naphthyl , carbon ) = <nUm> ( 1 ) nm . the hydrido ligand in I was not located by the x-ray work , but its presence was inferred from 1NMR spectra in THF-d8 , which show a singlet at d(CH3)4Si-9.3 . reaction of I with excess CH3I yields <nUm> mol CH4 / zr2 unit , which is in accordance with the monohydride structure . with ClH in THF , dicyclopentadienylzirconium dichloride , hydrogen , naphthalene , and a mixture of partially hydrogenated and hydrochlorinated naphthalenes are formed . reaction of the complex with H in THF yields naphthalene and dicyclopentadienylzirconium dihydride . In toluene and THF solutions , I is a catalyst for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene to cyclohexane .

zirconocene and hafnocene dichlorides react with appropriate organolithium reagents to form stable dimethyl and diphenyl derivatives , in the same manner as does titanocene dichloride . the bis(p-indenyl) dihalides of titanium , zirconium , and hafnium likewise lead to dimethyl and diphenyl compounds which in general appear to be more stable than the corresponding p-cyclopentadienyl derivatives . an analysis has been undertaken of trends in the nmr spectra of these new series of organometallic compounds , both with respect to the nature of the metal and to the nature of the p-bonded ligand . the formation and properties of bis(p-indenyl)bis(s-pentafluorophenyl) titanium and the new titanium metallocycle 5,5-bis(p-indenyl)dibenzotitanole are also described .

linear oligophenylene diynes containing <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> phenylene rings were synthesized in high yields using the nucleophilic aromatic substitution ( ArNS ) of perfluoroarenes by aryllithium reagents as the key carbon - carbon bond - forming reaction . this reaction was demonstrated to proceed readily at low temperatures with sterically hindered substrates and in the presence of base - sensitive silylalkynyl groups . diynes synthesized by this methodology were readily zirconocene - coupled into large dimeric macrocycles using the zirconocene reagent Cp2Zr(py)(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) .

reactions of tetraiodobenzene with zirconacyclopentadienes , which were conveniently prepared from two alkynes ( or diynes ) and zirconocene complexes , afforded 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted diiodonaphthalene derivatives in good isolated yields . these 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted diiodonaphthalene derivatives could be converted to 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octasubstituted anthracene derivatives by reaction with a second zirconacyclopentadiene . when the two zirconacyclopentadienes were different , unsymmetrical anthracenes such as 1,2,3,4-tetraethyl-5,6,7,8-tetraphenylanthracene ( <nUm> % isolated yield ) were obtained . on the other hand , treatment of a 2,3-dihalopyridine such as 2-bromo-3-iodopyridine with zirconacyclopentadienes gave 5,6,7,8-tetrasubstituted quinoline derivatives in good to high yields . 3,4-Dihalopyridines such as 4-chloro-3-iodopyridine reacted with zirconacyclopentadienes to afford 5,6,7,8-tetrasubstituted isoquinoline derivatives in good to high yields . 
the hafnium hydrostannyl complex CpCp*Hf(SnHMes2)Cl ( cp* = e5-C5Me5 ) has been synthesized from the reaction of CpCp*Hf(H)Cl with Mes2SnH2 . this compound has been identified as an intermediate in the metal - catalyzed dehydrocoupling of Mes2SnH2 to the distannane Mes2HSnSnHMes2 ( mes = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl ) . the dehydrocoupling in this system appears to occur by elimination of : SnMes2 from CpCp*Hf(SnHMes2)Cl , with Sn-Sn bond formation proceeding via insertion of the stannylene into a Sn-H bond . 
the electronic influence of unbridged and ansa - bridged ring substituents on a zirconocene center has been studied by means of IR spectroscopic , electrochemical , and computational methods . with respect to IR spectroscopy , the average of the symmetric and asymmetric stretches ( vCO(av) ) of a large series of dicarbonyl complexes (CpR)2Zr(CO)2 has been used as a probe of the electronic influence of a cyclopentadienyl ring substituent . for unbridged substituents ( me , et , pri , but , SiMe3 ) , vCO(av) on a per substituent basis correlates well with hammett dmeta parameters , thereby indicating that the influence of these substituents is via a simple inductive effect . In contrast , the reduction potentials ( e ° ) of the corresponding dichloride complexes (CpR)2ZrCl2 do not correlate well with hammett dmeta parameters , thereby suggesting that factors other than the substituent inductive effect also influence e ° . ansa bridges with single - atom linkers , for example [Me2C] and [Me2Si] , exert a net electron - withdrawing effect , but the effect is diminished upon increasing the length of the bridge . indeed , with a linker comprising a three-carbon chain , the [CH2CH2CH2] ansa bridge becomes electron - donating . In contrast to the electron - withdrawing effect observed for a single [Me2Si] ansa bridge , a pair of vicinal [Me2Si] ansa bridges exerts an electron - donating effect relative to that from the single bridge . DFT calculations demonstrate that the electron - withdrawing effect of the [Me2C] and [Me2Si] ansa - bridges is due to stabilization of the cyclopentadienyl ligand acceptor orbital , which subsequently enhances back - donation from the metal . the calculations also indicate that the electron - donating effect of two vicinal [Me2Si] ansa bridges , relative to that of a single bridge , is a result of it enforcing a ligand conformation that reduces back - donation from the metal . 
In a study of the reaction system MAO / (C5H5)2ZrMe2 , the size of the ion pair [ ( CH ) 2Zr(mMe)2AlMe2]+ [Me-MAO]- was determined by pulsed field - gradient NMR of its cationic moiety . A mean effective hydrodynamic radius of <nUm> - <nUm> Å , determined from diffusion rates in benzene solution at different zirconocene and MAO concentrations , indicates that the ion pair remains associated even at the lowest concentrations studied . At elevated concentrations , aggregation to ion quadruples or higher aggregates is indicated by an apparent size increase and by shifts of the CH and me 1H NMR signals . the equilibrium constant for the reaction [ ( CH ) 2ZrMe+ ⋯ Me-MAO- ] + <nUm> / 2Al2Me6 ⇌ [ ( CH ) 2Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2]+ [Me-MAO]- changes at different Al / Zr ratios ; this indicates that MAO contains various species that produce Me-MAO- anions with different lewis basicities . the volume of the Me-MAO- anion suggests that it contains 150-200 Al atoms . 
the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with <nUm> equiv of BuLi at <nUm> ° C , followed by the addition of an unsymmetrical tetra- or pentafluorophenyl substituted alkyne R1C ≡ CArf ( R1 , arf = (CH2)4Me , p-C6F4H ; me , p-C6F4H ; ph , C6F5 ) , resulted in regioselective couplings of these alkynes to zirconacyclopentadienes in which the arf substituents preferentially adopt the 3,4-positions ( bb ) of the zirconacyclopentadiene ring . with Cp2Zr(py)(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) as the zirconocene reagent , the couplings could be carried out at room temperature ; however , at higher temperatures significant quantities of the 2,4-fluoroaryl substituted ( ab ) isomers were also formed . none of the conditions employed produced the 2,5-fluoroaryl substituted ( aa ) isomers . these fluoroaryl-substituted zirconacyclopentadienes were readily converted to butadienes via reactions with acids . the zirconacyclopentadiene Cp2ZrC4-2,5-Ph2-3,4- C6F5 , which resulted from the coupling of PhC ≡ C7F5 , was converted to the corresponding thiophene by reaction with ClS , and to an arene by reaction with MeO2CC ≡ CCO2Me / ClCu . mechanistic studies on zirconocene couplings of (p-CF3C6H4)C ≡ C ( p-MeC6H4 ) indicate that the observed regioselectivities are determined by an electronic factor that controls the orientation of at least one of the two alkynes as they are coupled . additionally , these studies suggest an unsymmetrical transition state for the zirconocene coupling of alkynes , and this is supported by DFT calculations . the reaction of [ C7F5 ≡ CH ] 2CH2 with Cp2Zr(py)(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) resulted in a zirconacyclopentadiene in which the pentafluorophenyl substituents have been forced into the 2,5-positions ( aa ) . zirconocene coupling of the diyne C7F5 ≡ C-1,4-C6 H4-C ≡ C7F5 provided a route to conjugated polymers bearing electron - withdrawing pentafluorophenyl groups . 
the rate of reductive elimination for a family of zirconocene isobutyl hydride complexes , Cp*(CpRn)Zr(CH2CHMe2)H ( cp* = e5-C5Me5 , CpRn = substituted cyclopentadienyl ) , has been measured as a function of cyclopentadienyl substituent . In general , the rate of reductive elimination increases modestly with the incorporation of sterically demanding substituents such as [CMe3] or [SiMe3] . A series of isotopic labeling experiments was used to elucidate the mechanism and rate - determining step for the reductive elimination process . from these studies , a new zirconocene isobutyl hydride complex , Cp''2Zr(CH2CHMe2)-(H) ( cp'' = e5-C5H3-1,3- (SiMe3)2 ) , was designed and synthesized such that facile reductive elimination of isobutane and activation of dinitrogen was observed . the resulting dinitrogen complex , [Cp''2Zr]2(m2 , e2,e2-N2 ) , has been characterized by x-ray diffraction and displays a bond length of <nUm> Å for the N ligand , the longest observed in any metallocene dinitrogen complex . solution magnetic susceptibility demonstrates that [Cp''2Zr]2(m2 , e2 , e2-N2 ) is a ground - state triplet , consistent with two Zr (III) , d1 centers . mechanistic studies reveal that the dinitrogen complex is derived from the reaction of N with the resulting cyclometalated zirconocene hydride rather than directly from reductive elimination of alkane . 
the crystal structure and electron density ( ED ) distribution of an imine coupling product with an open zirconocene , Zr(2,4-C7H11)[(i-Pr)NCHPhCH2 CMe = CHCMe = CH2 ] ( C7H11 = dimethylpentadienyl ) , have been derived from accurate synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements . the molecular structure reveals asymmetric coordination of Zr by the pentadienyl ( 2,4-C7H11 ligand ( <Zr-C>  = <nUm> Å ) , the butadiene fragment ( <Zr-C>  = <nUm> Å ) , and the amide nitrogen atom ( Zr-N = <nUm> Å ) of the second ligand . the study of the ED and its topological analysis affords new insight into the bonding and electronic structure of the title zirconium complex . the interactions between the metal center and the ligands are represented by a Zr-N bond path and one Zr-C bond path with each of the pentadienyl and butadiene moieties , contrary to the usually depicted global metal - ligand bonding . the butadiene and pentadienyl groups exhibit a polarization of the corresponding p-like ED in the C-Zr directions , indicating that the whole conjugated systems are nonetheless involved . the 4d atomic orbitals of Zr exhibit unusual populations according to ligand field considerations , which reveal a high degree of s-donation from the conjugated π systems of both ligands . As deduced from numerical integration over the topologically defined atomic basins , the Zr to ligand charge transfer is <nUm> e to the C17H24N ligand and <nUm> e to dimethylpentadienyl . topological analysis of a short intramolecular Zr ⋯ ( C,H ) contact provides no indication of the presence of agostic interactions , despite a small Zr-N-C angle of <nUm> ° . thus , no bond path and BCP ( bond critical point ) of the ED are found in the Zr ⋯ ( C,H ) region , which would have provided evidence for such direct interactions , nor is there any evidence for charge accumulation between the Zr and H atoms , or for lengthening of the C-H bond involved in the putative interaction . these characteristics , similar to those in other distorted situations , may be common for other electron - deficient d0 complexes . 
treatment of Cp2ZrBu2 with enol ether containing a remote double bond lead to conjugated metalated diene as single isomer via a tandem isomerization - elimination sequence . 2-Arylsulfonyl 1,3-dienes can also be used as a source of dienyl zirconocene derivatives , and the stereochemistry of the diene is dependent on the transmetalation reaction . 
hydrozirconation of alkynes with zirconocene hydrochloride followed by in situ transmetalation to dimethylzinc provides access to reactive alkenyl organometallic reagents from readily available precursors . upon addition of imines , 1,2-attack leads to synthetically useful allylic amine building blocks . In the presence of CH <nUm> I <nUm> or CH <nUm> Cl <nUm> , the n-metalated allylic amide intermediate is cyclopropanated and c-cyclopropylalkylamines are formed in high yield and excellent diastereoselectivities favoring the anti products . the use of enynes as starting materials for this domino reaction provides conjugated biscyclopropanes and thus allows the stereoselective formation of five new carbon-carbon bonds . A transition state that explains the need for both zirconocene complex and alkyl zinc in the cyclopropanation reaction is proposed . 
the kinetics of propene polymerization catalyzed by ansa - metallocenes were studied using quenched - flow techniques . two catalyst systems were investigated , (SBI)ZrMe2 / AlBu3 / [Ph3C][CN{B (C6F5)3}2 ] ( <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> ) at <nUm> ° C and BCl2ISZr / methylalumoxane at <nUm> ° C ( Al : Zr = <nUm> : <nUm> ) ( SBI = rac-Me2Si(1-Indenyl)2 ) . the aims of the study were to address fundamental mechanistic aspects of metallocene - catalyzed alkene polymerizations , catalyst initiation , the quantitative correlation between catalyst structure and the rate of chain propagation , and the nature of dormant states . one of the most important but largely unknown factors in metallocene catalysis is the distribution of the catalyst between dormant states and species actively involved in polymer chain growth . measurements of polymer yield Y versus reaction time t for propene concentrations [M] = <nUm> - <nUm> mol L-1 and zirconocene concentrations in the range [Zr] = ( <nUm> - <nUm> ) × 10-5 mol L-1 for the borate system showed first - order dependence on [M] and [Zr] . up to t ≈ <nUm> s , the half - life of catalyst initiation is comparable to the half - life of chain growth ; that is , this phase is governed by non-steady-state kinetics . we propose a rate law which takes account of this and accurately describes the initial rates . curve fitting of y(t) data provides an apparent chain growth rate constant kpapp on the order of <nUm> L mol-1 s-1 . by contrast , the evolution with time of the number - average polymer molecular weight , which is independent of the concentration of catalyst involved , leads to a kp which is an order of magnitude larger , ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) × <nUm> L mol-1 s-1 . the ratio kpapp / kp = <nUm> indicates that under the given conditions only about <nUm> % of the total catalyst is actively engaged in chain growth at any one time . the system (SBI)-ZrCl2 / methylalumoxane is significantly less active , kpapp = <nUm> ± <nUm> and kp = ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) × <nUm> L mol-1 s-1 , while , surprisingly , the mole fraction of active species is essentially identical , <nUm> % . evidently , the energetics of the chain growth sequence are strongly modulated by the nature of the counteranion . increasing the counteranion / zirconium ratio from <nUm> : <nUm> to <nUm> : <nUm> has no influence on catalyst activity . these findings are consistent with a model of closely associated ion pairs throughout the chain growth sequence . for the borate system , propagation is ∼ <nUm> times faster than initiation , while for the MAO catalyst , kp / ki ≈ <nUm> . polymers obtained at <nUm> ° C show <nUm> - <nUm> mol % 2,1-regioerrors , and end - group analysis identifies 2,1- misinsertions as the main cause for chain termination ( <nUm> % ) , as compared to <nUm> % for the vinylidene end groups . the results suggest that 2,1-regioerrors are a major contributor to the formation of dormant species , even at short reaction times . 
this paper describes the synthesis of base - free (C5R5)2Zr(OtBu)+ cations , the direct observation of nonchelated alkene and alkyne adducts of these cations , and studies of the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of these novel species . reaction of Cp2'ZrMe2 ( cp' = C5H4Me ) with tert-butyl alcohol followed by [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] in benzene yields [ Cp2'Zr(O'Bu) ][B(C6F5)4] ( 1 ) , which exists as Cp2'Zr(O'Bu)(CIR)+ solvent adducts in C6D5Cl and CD2Cl2 solutions . addition of ligands L ( L = ethylene , propylene , propyne , 2-butyne , CO , phenylacetylene , allene , 1-hexene , cis-2-butene ) to <nUm> in CD2Cl2 at <nUm> ° C results in reversible formation of Cp2'Zr(O'Bu)(L)+ adducts . NMR data for Cp2'Zr(O'Bu)(H2C = CHMe)+ ( 4 ) indicate that the propylene coordinates unsymmetrically and is polarized with positive charge buildup at cint . equilibrium constants , defined by keq = [Zr-L][1]-1[L]-1 , vary in the order CO > propyne > 2-butyne > phenylacetylene > ethylene > allene > propylene > 1-hexene > cis-2-butene > vinyl chloride . loss of L from Cp2'Zr(O'Bu)(L)+to give <nUm> appears to proceed via associative displacement by CD2Cl2 in most cases . 
the synthesis , structural characterization , and abstraction chemistry of ansa - zirconocene ester enolate complexes relevant to the isospecific polymerization of methacrylates are reported . reactions of rac - (EBI)ZrMe(OTf) and rac - (EBI)Zr(OTf) <nUm> [ EBI = C 2H 4(Ind) <nUm> ] with <nUm> and <nUm> equiv of lithium isopropylisobutyrate in toluene produce the first examples of ansa - zirconocene mono- and diester enolate complexes : rac - (EBI)ZrMe[OC(O iPr ) = CMe <nUm> ] ( 1 ) and rac - (EBI)Zr[OC(O iPr ) = CMe <nUm> ] <nUm> ( 2 ) in <nUm> % and <nUm> % isolated yields , respectively . the reaction of <nUm> with B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> was investigated in six different organic solvents ; in THF at ambient temperature , this reaction cleanly produces the isolable cationic ansa - zirconocene ester enolate complex rac - (EBI)Zr+(THF)[OC(O iPr ) = CMe 2][MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - ( 3 ) in quantitative yield . the analogous reaction of <nUm> with Al(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> in toluene , however , proceeds through a proposed novel , intramolecular proton transfer process in which propylene is eliminated from the isopropoxy group , subsequently producing a carboxylate - bridged tight ion pair rac - (EBI)Zr+(Me)OC( iPr)OAl(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> - ( 4 ) . In addition to standard spectroscopic and analytical characterizations for the isolated complexes 1-4 , complexes <nUm> and <nUm> have also been structurally characterized by x-ray diffraction studies . polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) and n-butyl methacrylate ( BMA ) has been investigated using complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> . both the isolated cationic <nUm> and neutral <nUm> ( the latter combined with B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> in situ ) are highly active ( <nUm> min for quantitative MMA conversion ) and highly isospecific ( [mm] > <nUm> % for PMMA ; [mm] > <nUm> % for PBMA ) via enantiomorphic - site control , producing polymethacrylates with extremely narrow molecular weight distributions ( m w / m n = <nUm> ) . the aluminate complex <nUm> , however , produces syndiotactic PMMA predominantly via chain - end control . 
reductive elimination of alkane from a silylated bis-indenyl zirconium isobutyl hydride affords a zirconium sandwich complex with an unusual e6 indenyl ligand . crystallographic characterization of its adduct with tetrahydrofuran has been achieved and reveals significant localization in the six - membered ring . complexation of more potent ligands such as carbon monoxide and diphenylacetylene are effective in promoting haptotropic rearrangement of the e6 indenyl ligand and provides familiar bent zirconocene derivatives . the zirconium sandwich compound also undergoes oxidative addition of carbon-hydrogen bonds of pyridyl ligands , resulting in a crystallographically characterized dimethylamino pyridyl hydride complex of zirconium . 
the ansa - zirconocene dichlorides [ Me2Si(C5H 4)(3-R-C5H3)]ZrCl2 7a-e ( r = H , CH3 , cyclohexyl , -CHMe2 , -CMe3 ) were reacted with butadiene-magnesium to yield the respective ( η 4-butadiene)metallocenes 17a-e . the chiral examples give a mixture of two s-cis and two s-trans diastereomers . the strong lewis acid B(C 6F5)3 adds selectively to a terminal butadiene carbon atom to yield the (butadiene)metallocene / B(C6F 5)3 betaine complexes 18a-e . initially , the formation of the Z-18 isomers is preferred . these consecutively rearrange to the thermodynamically favored isomers E-18 . the dipolar systems <nUm> are active single component metallocene catalysts for the stereospecific polymerization of methyl methacrylate . with increasing steric bulk of the attached single alkyl substituent an increasingly isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate ) is obtained . A similar trend is observed in the methyl methacrylate polymerization at the [ Me2Si(C5H4)(3-R-C5H 3)]ZrCH3+ catalysts ( 9a-e ) that were conventionally prepared by methyl abstraction from the corresponding ansa - zirconocene dimethyl complexes by treatment with B(C6F 5)3 . A comparison of the poly(methyl methacrylates ) obtained at these two series of catalysts has revealed substantial differences in stereoselectivity that probably originate from an influence of the respective counteranions . an initial reactive intermediate of methyl methacrylate addition to the dipolar single component metallocene catalyst e-18a was experimentally observed and characterized by NMR spectroscopy at <nUm> K . the subsequently formed series of [ PMMA-C4H6-B(C 6F5)3]- anion oligomers ( at the catalyst 18c ) was monitored ( after quenching ) and characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry . 
several dienyl zirconocene derivatives were easily prepared , as unique geometrical isomers , from simple non-conjugated unsaturated enol ethers with (1-butene)ZrCp <nUm> complexes . this new methodology is based on a tandem allylic C-H bond activation - elimination sequence and the mechanism has been mapped out by deuterium labeling experiments . the stereochemical outcome of this process was determined by addition of several electrophiles . moreover , when the organometallic derivative is vinylic as well as allylic such as in 44-47Zr , an unexpected reversal of the stereochemistry has been found during the zirconium to copper transmetalation step . 
the presence of " free " trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) in methylalumoxane ( MAO ) solutions can be highly detrimental to the performance of metallocene and " post-metallocene " olefin polymerization catalysts . the most used strategy to remove " free " TMA is to evaporate MAO solutions to dryness , until a free - flowing white powder ( " solid MAO " ) is left . this procedure is tedious and potentially hazardous , because in some cases the distillate is a concentrated hydrocarbon solution of TMA . moreover , " solid MAO " is poorly soluble in common polymerization media , and once in solution it can regenerate TMA to some extent . this communication reports on a facile alternative , which consists in the controlled addition of a sterically hindered phenol , such as 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol , effectively trapping " free " TMA . we show here that 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol / MAO solutions activate equally well the dichloro-precursors of well - known zirconocene and bis(phenoxyimine)Ti catalysts , and that their use in propene polymerization results in a substantially higher productivity , polymer stereoregularity , and / or average molecular mass compared with activation by MAO alone .

monomeric imidozirconocene complexes of the type Cp2(L)Zr = NCMe3 ( cp = cyclopentadienyl , L = lewis base ) have been shown to activate the carbon-hydrogen bonds of benzene , but not the C-H bonds of saturated hydrocarbons . to our knowledge , this singularly important class of C-H activation reactions has heretofore not been observed in imidometallocene systems . the m = NR bond formed on heating the racemic ethylenebis(tetrahydro)indenyl methyl tert-butyl amide complex , however , cleanly and quantitatively activates a wide range of n-alkane , alkene , and arene C-H bonds . mechanistic experiments support the proposal of intramolecular elimination of methane followed by a concerted addition of the hydrocarbon C-H bond . products formed by activation of sp2 C-H bonds are generally more thermodynamically stable than those formed by activation of sp3 C-H bonds , and those resulting from reaction at primary C-H bonds are preferred over secondary sp3 C-H activation products . there is also evidence that thermodynamic selectivity among C-H bonds is sterically rather than electronically controlled . 
the organometallic multicomponent reaction of alkenyl zirconocene , alkynyl imine , and zinc carbenoid in the presence of dimethylzinc leads to novel C,C-dicyclopropylmethylamines . the formation of intermediate bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes represents the first synthetically useful example of a double C,C-s - bond insertion , and the increase in structural complexity from starting materials is highlighted by the formation of nine new C,C - bonds in the final product . 
A series of enantiopure C1 - symmetric metallocenes , { ( SiMe 2)2[e5-C5H(CHMe 2)2][e5-C5H2((S) CHMeCMe3)]}ZrCl2 , (S)-2 , { ( SiMe2 ) 2[e5-C5H(CHEt2) 2][e5-C5H2((S)-CHMeCMe 3)]}ZrCl2 , (S)-6 , and { ( SiMe2 ) 2[e5-C5HCy2][e5- C5H2((S)-CHMeCMe3)]}ZrCl2 ) , (S)-7 ( cy = cyclohexyl ) , zirconocene dichlorides that have an enantiopure methylneopentyl substituent on the " upper " cyclopentadienyl ligand , and diastereomerically pure precatalysts , { ( SiMe2 ) 2[e5-C5H((S)-CHMeCy)(CHMe 2)][e5-C5H3]}ZrCl2 , (S)-8a and (S)-8b , which have an enantiopure , 1-cyclohexylethyl substituent on the " lower " cyclopentadienyl ligand , has been synthesized for use in the polymerization of chiral a-olefins . when activated with methylaluminoxane , these metallocenes show unprecedented activity for the polymerization of bulky racemic monomers bearing substitution at the 3- and / or 4-positions . due to the optically pure nature of these single site catalysts , they effect kinetic resolution of racemic monomers : the polymeric product is enriched with the faster reacting enantiomer , while recovered monomer is enriched with the slower reacting enantiomer . the two components are easily separated . for most olefins surveyed , a partial kinetic resolution was achieved ( s = kfaster / kslower ≈ <nUm> ) , but , in one case , the polymerization of 3,4-dimethyl-1-pentene , high levels of separation were obtained ( s > <nUm> ) . 13C NMR spectroscopy of poly ( 3-methyl-1-pentene ) produced with (S)-2 indicates that the polymers are highly isotactic materials . x-ray crystal structure determinations for (S)-2 , { (SiMe2)2[e 5-C5H(CHMe2)2][e5- C5H2((S)-CHMeCMe3)]}Zr(SC6H 5)2 , (S)-6 , and (S)-7 have been used in combination with molecular mechanics calculations to examine the prevailing steric interactions expected in the diastereomeric transition states for propagation during polymerization . precatalysts (S)-8a and (S)-8b are less selective polymerization catalysts for the kinetic resolution of 3-methyl-1-pentene than are (S)-2 , (S)-6 , and (S)-7 . 
A family of isolable , well - defined bis-indenyl zirconium sandwich complexes , ( e5-C9H5-1,3-R 2)-(e9-C9H5-1,3-R 2)Zr ( r = silyl , alkyl ) , have been prepared by either alkane reductive elimination or alkali metal reduction of a suitable zirconium(IV) dihalide precursor . crystallographic characterization of two of these derivatives , r = SiMe2CMe3 and CHMe2 , reveals unprecedented e9 coordination of one of the indenyl ligands . variable - temperature and EXSY NMR studies establish that the e5 and e9 rings are rapidly interconverting in solution . the sandwich complexes serve as effective sources of low - valent zirconium reacting rapidly with both olefins and alkynes at ambient temperature . In contrast to bis-cyclopentadienyl chemistry , the olefin adducts of the bis-indenyl zirconium sandwiches undergo preferential C-H activation to yield the corresponding allyl hydride compounds , although reaction with excess olefin proceeds through the e2-olefin adduct , forming the corresponding zirconacyclopentane . 
the reaction of the chiral chelated bis-amide complex Zr{(2R,4R)-PhNCHMeCH2CHMeNPh}Cl2(THF)2 ( R,R-7 ) with lithium ansa-bis-indenyl reagents Li2[SBI](Et2O) ( 8a , SBI = (1-indenyl)2SiMe2 ) or Li2[EBI](Et2O) ( 8b , EBI = 1,2-(1-indenyl)2ethane ) in THF affords the corresponding ansa - zirconocenes S,S-(SBI)Zr{(2R,4R)-PhNCHMeCH2CHMeNPh} ( S,S,R,R-9a ) or S,S-(EBI)Zr{(2R,4R)-PhNCHMeCH2CHMeNPh} ( S,S,R,R-9b ) in > <nUm> % isolated yield and > <nUm> % enantiomeric excess . compound 9b was converted to the corresponding enantiomerically pure dichloride S,S - (EBI)ZrCl2 ( S,S-10b ) in <nUm> % isolated yield by reaction with ClH in Et2O . the chiral diamine (2R,4R)-HPhNCHMeCH2CHMeNHPh ( R,R-5 ) was recovered from this reaction . 
the origin of the hydrogenation of the dinitrogen ligand in [(e5-C5Me4H)2Zr]2(m2,e2,e2-N2) has been investigated by a combined computational and experimental study . density functional theory calculations on the zirconocene dinitrogen complex demonstrate significant imido character in the zirconium nitrogen bonds , arising from effective p-back - bonding from the low - valent zirconium and the side-on bound N ligand . the twisted ground - state structure of the N complex is a key requirement for nitrogen hydrogenation , as calculations on the model complex [(e5-C5H5)2Zr]2(m2,e2,e2-N2) reveal reduced overlap as the dihedral angle between the zirconocene wedges approaches <nUm> ° . experimentally , isotopic labeling studies on the microscopic reverse are consistent with a 1,2-addition mechanism for nitrogen hydrogenation . 
the generation and properties of nonchelated zr-aryl-alkyne and zr-aryl-alkene complexes that are stabilized by the presence of b-Si-substituents in the alkyne and alkene ligands and fluorination of the aryl ligand are described . reaction of [Cp'2Zr(OtBu)(ClCD2Cl)][B(C6F5)4] ( <nUm> , cp' = C5H4Me ) with alkyne and alkene substrates ( L ) generates Cp'2Zr(OtBu)(L)+ adducts ( L = HC ≡ CCH2SiMe3 ( 2 ) ; CH2 = CHCH2SiMe3 ( 3 ) ; HC ≡ CMe ( 4 ) ; CH2 = CHCH2CMe3 ( 5 ) ) . equilibrium constants for substrate binding ( keq = [Zr-L][1]-1[L]-1 ; CD2Cl2 , <nUm> ° C ) are much larger for the b-Si - substituted compounds <nUm> ( <nUm> × <nUm> M-1 ) and <nUm> ( <nUm> × <nUm> M-1 ) than for hydrocarbon analogues <nUm> ( <nUm> × <nUm> M-1 ) and <nUm> ( <nUm> M-1 ) , which is ascribed to b-Si stabilization of the partial positive charge on cint of the bound substrate . [Cp2Zr(C6F5)][B(C6F5)4] ( <nUm> , cp = CH ) was generated by the reaction of Cp2Zr(C6F5)Me with [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] in C6D5Cl . reaction of <nUm> with alkyne and alkene substrates ( L ) generates Cp2Zr(C6F5)(L)+ adducts ( L = HC ≡ CCH2SiMe3 ( 8 ) ; H = CCHCH2SiMe3 ( 10 ) ) . No insertion of the substrate into the Zr-C6F5 bond is observed in <nUm> ( at <nUm> ° C ) or <nUm> ( up to <nUm> ° C ) . the allyltrimethylsilane ligand in <nUm> undergoes nondissociative alkene face exchange ( " alkene flipping " , i.e. , exchange of the Cp2Zr(C6F5)+ unit between the two alkene enantiofaces without alkene dissociation ) , with a first - order rate constant kflip = <nUm> s-1 ( C6D5Cl , <nUm> ° C ) . <nUm> also undergoes slower reversible decomplexation of the alkene ( kdissoc = <nUm> s-1 ; C6D5Cl , <nUm> ° C ) . 
the reaction of Zr{PhN(CH2)3NPh}Cl 2(THF)2 ( 5 ) with lithium ansa-bis-indenyl reagents Li 2[XBI]-(Et2O) ( XBI = (1-indenyl)2SiMe <nUm> ( SBI , 7a ) , (2-methyl-1-indenyl)2SiMe2 ( MSBI , 7b ) , (2-methyl-4,5-benz-1-indenyl)2SiMe2 ( MBSBI , 7c ) , (2-methyl-4-phenyl-1-indenyl)2SiMe2 ( MPSBI , 7d ) , and 1,2-(1-indenyl)2ethane ( EBI , 7e ) ) affords rac - (XBI)Zr{PhN(CH 2)3NPh } ( 8a-e ) in high yield . the meso isomers were not detected by 1H NMR . x-ray crystallographic studies show that the Zr{PhN(CH2)3NPh} rings in <nUm> , 8a , 8c , and ( C 5H5)2-Zr{PhN(CH2)3NPh} ( 10 ) adopt twist conformations that position the N-Ph groups on opposite sides of the N-Zr-N plane . this conformation complements the metallocene structures of rac-8a-e but would destabilize the corresponding meso isomers . it is proposed that the Zr{PhN(CH2)3NPh} ring adopts a similar twist conformation in the stereodetermining transition state for addition of the second indenyl ring in these reactions , which leads to a preference for rac products . the results of metallocene syntheses from other Zr amide precursors support this proposal . 8a-e are converted to the corresponding rac - (XBI)ZrCl2 complexes ( 9a-e ) by reaction with ClH . 
the reactivity of [rac-(C2H4(1-indenyl)2)Zr(n-butyl)][MeB(C6F5)3] ( 4 ) , [rac-(C2H4(1-indenyl)2)Zr(sec-butyl)][MeB(C6F5)3] ( 5 ) , and [rac-(C2H4(1-indenyl)2)Zr(polypropenyl)][MeB(C6F5)3] with propene , ethene , and hydrogen was studied by low - temperature ( < <nUm> ° C ) 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy in toluene solutions . In contrast with previous suggestions that <nUm> ° zirconium alkyl species such as <nUm> are dormant sites , these measurements demonstrate reactivity of <nUm> ° zirconium alkyls with propene and ethene comparable to the <nUm> ° zirconium alkyl species <nUm> and [rac-(C2H4(1-indenyl)2)Zr(polypropenyl)][MeB(C6F5)3] . because 2,1-insertion of propene is an infrequent event , these results preclude significant accumulation of catalyst in the form of <nUm> ° zirconium alkyls for this metallocene and counterion . the reactivity of <nUm> with hydrogen is at least <nUm> orders of magnitude faster than other <nUm> ° zirconium alkyls . such high reactivity accounts for the puzzlingly high fraction of butyl end groups in prior hydrooligomerization studies and implies that catalyst responsivity to H as a molecular weight control agent correlates with the regioselectivity of the catalyst . 
the dimethylsilanediyl-bridged ansa - zirconocene dichloride <nUm> , that contains a pendent allyl substituent at a cp - ring , adds HB(C6F 5)2 to the vinyl group to yield the bifunctional zirconocene / borane complex <nUm> . substituted benzimidazoles were added to the strongly electrophilic borane moiety as protective groups , which allowed subsequent chloride versus -CH2SiMe3 exchange at zirconium to take place by treatment with the respective alkyllithium reagent . alternatively , the introduction of active s-ligands at zirconium is carried out first , followed by the hydroboration reaction . this route was followed for the synthesis of the diphenyl-ansa-zirconocene / borane complex <nUm> . complex <nUm> reacts slowly in solution by intramolecular electrophilic attack of the borane at its adjacent cp - ring , followed by deprotonation using a [Zr]-Ph group to yield the zwitterionic complex <nUm> featuring a borata-tetrahydroindenyl moiety as part of the ansametallocene framework . complex <nUm> was characterized by x-ray diffraction . it adds PMe3 at zirconium to yield <nUm> . thermolysis of <nUm> with excess PMe3 leads to the formation of the (aryne)zirconocene complex <nUm> , which is stabilized by PMe3 coordination to zirconium and PMe3 addition to boron . N-Methylbenzimidazole adds to the -B(C6F5)2 unit of <nUm> to give the <nUm> : <nUm> adduct <nUm> . thermolysis of <nUm> at <nUm> ° C in benzene solution in the presence of one additional equivalent of n-methylbenzimidazole results in deprotonation of the substrate to yield the s-N- methylbenzimidazolyl zirconium complex <nUm> ( as a mixture of two diastereoisomers ) . an additional n-methylbenzimidazole ligand is bonded to the BC12F10 unit in this product . 
zirconocene - olefin complexes Cp2Zr(H2C = CHR ) , prepared in benzene-THF at <nUm> ° C , react with acid chlorides to provide homoallylic alcohols . the key is an equilibrium between the zirconocene - olefin complexes and the corresponding zirconocene allyl hydride complexes via allylic C-H bond cleavage of the coordinating alkenes . furthermore , the zirconocene - olefin complexes are also available for the reaction with 1,4-diketone to afford anti-1,4-diols with excellent diastereoselectivity . thus , Cp2Zr(H2C = CHR ) serves as a donor of both hydride and an allylic group . these reactions also proceed efficiently by using zirconocene - olefin complexes , derived from Cp2ZrCl2 , Mg metal , and 1-alkenes . 
the nucleophilic character of a charge neutral , high oxidation d0 zirconium trimethylenemethane ( TMM ) class of compound of general structure Cp*Zr(TMM)[N(R1)C(Me)N(R2)] , 1a ( R1 = R2 = i-Pr ) and 1b ( R1 = t-Bu , R2 = et ) , is presented through documentation of its reactivity with a range of alkyl and silyl halides and triflates , including unactivated ones such as ethyl triflate . these results should contribute to efforts directed toward expanding the synthetic chemist 's toolbox of synthetic methods for the construction of complex organic molecules . 
one Si - tethered diyne is coupled in one pot with three molecules of organonitriles promoted by a low - valent zirconocene species . cleavage of one of the three C ≡ N triple bonds and cleavage of the two Si-C bonds take place to afford pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridine derivatives after hydrolysis . 
cyclohexene ( CHE ) has been incorporated into the polymer chain in ethylene / CHE copolymerization by nonbridged half - titanocenes containing aryloxo ligands of the type , Cp'TiCl2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) , in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) cocatalyst . the effect of the substituent in the cyclopentadienyl fragment was found to be very important for CHE incorporation ; both the tert-BuCp ( 3 ) and 1,2,4-Me3Cp analogues ( 4 ) showed efficient CHE incorporation , whereas a negligible amount of CHE incorporation was observed by both the indenyl ( 1 ) and the cp* analogue ( 2 ) under the same conditions . cp - ketimide analogue , CpTiCl2(N = CtBu2 ) ( 5 ) , zirconocene - like Cp2ZrCl2 ( 6 ) , and linked half - titanocene - like [Me2Si(C5Me4)(NtBu)]TiCl2 ( 7 ) did not show any CHE incorporation under the same conditions ; unique characteristics for using this type of catalyst precursor for the present copolymerization have thus been emphasized . 
functionalization of the N ligand in the side-on bound dinitrogen complex , [ ( e5-C5Me4H ) 2Zr]2-(m2,e2 , e2-N2 ) , has been accomplished by addition of terminal alkynes to furnish acetylide zirconocene diazenido complexes , [ (e5-C5Me4H)2Zr(C ≡ CR ) ] <nUm> ( m2,e2,e2-N 2H2 ) ( r = nBu , tBu , ph ) . characterization of [ ( e5- C5Me4H ) 2Zr(C ≡ CCMe3)]2(m2 , e2,e2-N2H2 ) by x-ray diffraction revealed a side-on bound diazenido ligand in the solid state , while variable - temperature 1H and <nUm> N NMR studies established rapid interconversion between e1,e1 and e2,e2 hapticity of the [ HN2 2]2- ligand in solution . synthesis of alkyl , halide , and triflato zirconocene diazenido complexes , [ ( e5-C 5Me4H)2ZrX]2(m2 , e1,e1-N2H2 ) ( x = Cl , I , OTf , CH2Ph , CH2SiMe3 ) , afforded e1,e1 coordination of the [ HN2 2]2- fragment both in the solid state and in solution , demonstrating that sterically demanding , in some cases p-donating , ligands can overcome the electronically preferred side-on bonding mode . unlike [(e5-C5Me4H)2ZrH] <nUm> ( m2,e2,e2-N 2H2 ) , the acetylide and alkyl zirconocene diazenido complexes are thermally robust , resisting a-migration and N cleavage up to temperatures of <nUm> ° C . dinitrogen functionalization with [(e5-C5Me4H)2Zr] <nUm> ( m2,e2,e2-N <nUm> ) was also accomplished by addition of proton donors . weak bronsted acids such as water and ethanol yield hydrazine and ( e5-C 5Me4H)2Zr(OH)2 and (e5-C5Me4H)2-Zr(OEt) <nUm> , respectively . treatment of [ ( e5-C 5Me4H)2Zr]2(m2 , e2,e2-N2 ) with HNMe2 or H2NNMe2 furnished amido or hydrazido zirconocene diazenido complexes that ultimately produce hydrazine upon protonation with ethanol . these results contrast previous observations with [ ( e5-C 5Me5)2Zr(e1-N2) ] <nUm> ( m2,e1,e1-N <nUm> ) where loss of free dinitrogen is observed upon treatment with weak acids . these studies highlight the importance of cyclopentadienyl substituents on transformations involving coordinated dinitrogen . 
poly(propylene-ran-1,3-butadiene) that contained pendant vinyl groups derived from 1,2-inserted butadiene units was selectively synthesized by rac-dimethylsilylbis(2-methyl-4-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( ph - ind ) activated with modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) in the presence of hydrogen . the copolymers obtained without hydrogen had 1,2-inserted and 1,4-inserted butadiene units . the addition of hydrogen to the copolymerization improved the activity by ∼ 1000-fold and gave the copolymer only with 1,2-inserted butadiene units , of which the content was equal to the copolymer obtained without hydrogen . the 13C NMR analysis of the copolymers clarified that butadiene also inserted into the copolymer as a tetramethylene unit , of which the content was almost the same as that of 1,4-inserted butadiene units observed in the absence of hydrogen . No signal that could be assigned to cyclic structures or long branched side chains was observed . these results indicate that p-allyl species of zirconocenes formed by 1,4-butadiene insertion at the growing polymer chain ends transformed to the tetramethylene chain end by hydrogenation and continued successive propylene insertion . 
the zirconocene - complexed dibismuthene , Cp2Zr(BiR)2 ( cp = CH ; r = C6H3-2,6-Mes2 ) , was prepared by the reaction of sodium metal with Cp2ZrCl2 and RBiCl2 . the air- and moisture - sensitive dark reddish / brown compound is the first organometallic compound containing Bi-Zr bonds and the only example of a Bi2Zr ring . moreover , our computations on associated model systems offer insight into the nature of the interaction of the heaviest dipnictene with a metallocene center . 
reaction of the disilenide <nUm> with Cp2ZrCl2 yields <nUm> , the first transition metal complex with an e1-s - bonded disilene moiety . the compound <nUm> exhibits a strongly red - shifted UV - vis absorption , resulting in an intensely green color . the Si = Si bond in <nUm> is considerably activated as shown by the rearrangement to a silyl-substituted zirconocene <nUm> . x-ray diffraction studies on <nUm> reveal that the Si = Si bond is significantly longer than that in the precursor <nUm> . conversely , the Zr-Si distance is considerably smaller than the corresponding distance in <nUm> , suggesting a certain degree of electron donation toward the 16e- zirconium center . 
the rates of hydrogenation of the N ligand in the side-on bound dinitrogen compounds , [ ( e5-C5Me4H ) 2Zr]2(m2,e2 , e2-N2 ) and [ ( e5-C5Me 5)(e5-C5H2-1,2-Me 2-4-R)Zr]2(m2,e2 , e2-N2 ) ( r = me , ph ) , to afford the corresponding hydrido zirconocene diazenido complexes have been measured by electronic spectroscopy . determination of the rate law for the hydrogenation of [ (e5-C5Me5)(e5-C 5H2-1,2,4-Me3)Zr]2(m2 , e2,e2-N2 ) establishes an overall second - order reaction , first order with respect to each reagent . these data , in combination with a normal , primary kinetic isotope effect of <nUm> for H <nUm> versus D2 addition , establish the first H addition as the rate - determining step in N hydrogenation . kinetic isotope effects of similar direction and magnitude have also been measured for hydrogenation ( deuteration ) of the two other zirconocene dinitrogen complexes . measuring the rate constants for the hydrogenation of [ ( e5-C 5Me5)(e5-C5H2-1,2,4- Me3)Zr]2(m2,e2 , e2-N2 ) over a <nUm> ° C temperature range provided activation parameters of DH ‡ = <nUm> kcal / mol and DS ‡ = <nUm> eu . the entropy of activation is consistent with an ordered four - centered transition structure , where H undergoes formal 1,2-addition to a zirconium-nitrogen bond with considerable multiple bond character . support for this hypothesis stems from the observation of N functionalization by C-H activation of a cyclopentadienyl methyl substituent in the mixed ring dinitrogen complexes , [ ( e5- C5Me5)(e5-C5H 2-1,2-Me2-4-R)Zr]2(m2 , e2,e2-N2 ) ( r = me , ph ) , to afford cyclometalated zirconocene diazenido derivatives . 
transition metal-benzyne complexes have found many applications in organic synthesis , mechanistic studies , and the synthesis of functional materials . In sharp contrast , the reaction chemistry of transition metal-carboryne complexes is virtually unknown although the theoretical calculations indicated that the formation of carboryne ( 1,2-C2B10H10 ) and benzyne is very energetically comparable . this communication reports a novel zirconocene-carboranyl complex Cp2Zr(m-Cl)(m-C2B10H10)Li(OEt2)2 ( 1 ) , an efficient precursor of the zirconocene-carboryne species , prepared from the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with <nUm> equiv of B5CH5Li in Et2O . the reactivity studies indicated that <nUm> resembles zirconocene-benzyne in reactions with polar unsaturated organic molecules . on the other hand , it shows no reactivity toward alkynes and alkenes , a reactivity pattern which is quite different from that of zirconocene-benzyne . this work also furnishes a novel method for the preparation of functional o-carboranes and their metal complexes which can not be synthesized by other methods presently known . 
the reaction of Cp'2Zr(OtBu)Me ( cp' = C5H4Me ) and [Ph3C][B(C6F 5)4 ] yields the base - free complex [ cp' 2Zr(OtBu)][B(C6F5)4] ( 6 ) , which exists as Cp'2Zr(OtBu)(CIR)+ halocarbon adducts in CD2Cl2 or C6D 5Cl solution . addition of alkenes to <nUm> in CD2Cl <nUm> solution at low temperature gives equilibrium mixtures of cp'2- Zr(OtBu)(alkene)+ ( 12a-l ) , <nUm> , and free alkene . the NMR data for 12a-l are consistent with unsymmetrical alkene bonding and polarization of the alkene C = C bond with positive charge buildup at cint and negative charge buildup at cterm . these features arise due to the lack of d-p* back - bonding . equilibrium constants for alkene coordination to <nUm> in CD2Cl2 at <nUm> ° C , K eq = [12][6]-1[alkene]-1 , vary in the order : vinylferrocene ( <nUm> M-1 ) ≫ ethylene ( 7.0 ) ≈ a-olefins > cis-2-butene ( 2.2 ) > trans-2-butene ( < <nUm> ) . alkene coordination is inhibited by sterically bulky substituents on the alkene but is greatly enhanced by electron - donating groups and the b-Si effect . compounds 12a-l undergo two dynamic processes : reversible alkene decomplexation via associative substitution of a CD2Cl2 molecule , and rapid rotation of the alkene around the metal - ( alkene centroid ) axis . 
this paper describes the generation and properties of nonchelated d <nUm> zirconocene-aryl-alkene and alkyne adducts that are stabilized by the presence of b-SiMe3 substituents on the substrates and the weak nucleophilicity of the -C6F5 ligand . the cationic complexes [ (C5H4R)2Zr(C6F 5)][B(C6F5)4] ( 4a : r = H , 4b : r = me ) were generated by methide abstraction from ( C5H 4R)2Zr(C6F5)Me by ph 3C+ . NMR studies show that 4a,b contain an o-CF ⋯ Zr dative interaction and probably coordinate a PhCl molecule in PhCl solution . addition of allyltrimethylsilane ( ATMS ) to 4a,b in C6D5Cl solution at low temperature produces an equilibrium mixture of ( C 5H4R)2Zr(C6F5)(H 2C = CHCH2SiMe3)+ ( 7a,b ) , 4a,b , and free ATMS . similarly , addition of propargyltrimethylsilane ( PTMS ) to 4a produces an equilibrium mixture of Cp2Zr(C6F5)(HC = CCH2SiMe3)+ ( 8a ) , 4a , and free PTMS . the NMR data for 7a,b,and 8a are consistent with highly unsymmetrical substrate coordination and substantial polarization of the substrate multiple bond with significant positive charge buildup at cint and negative charge buildup at cterm . PTMS binds to 4a more strongly than ATMS does . the ATMS adducts undergo nondissociative alkene face exchange ( " alkene flipping " ) , i.e. , exchange of the ( C5H4R ) 2Zr(C6F5)+ unit between the two alkene enantiofaces without decomplexation of the alkene , on the NMR time scale . 
exposure of e9,e5-bis(indenyl)zirconium sandwich complexes to <nUm> atm of H resulted in facile oxidative addition to furnish the corresponding zirconocene dihydrides , ( e5-C9H5-1,3-R2 ) 2ZrH2 ( r = SiMe3 , SiMe2Ph , CHMe <nUm> ) . continued hydrogenation completed conversion to the tetrahydroindenyl derivatives , ( e5-C9H 9-1,3-R2)2ZrH2 . deuterium labeling studies established that dihydrogen ( dideuterium ) addition to the benzo rings is intramolecular and stereospecific , occurring solely from the endo face of the ligand , proximal to the zirconium . In the absence of dihydrogen , the bis(indenyl)zirconium dihydrides rearranged to new zirconium monohydride complexes containing an unusual e5,e3-4,5- dihydroindenediyl ligand , arising from metal - to - benzo ring hydrogen transfer . mechanistic studies , including a normal , primary kinetic isotope effect measured at <nUm> ° C , are consistent with a pathway involving regio- and stereoselective insertion of a benzo C = C bond into a zirconium hydride . the stereochemistry of the insertion reaction , and hence the e5 , e3-4,5-dihydroindenediyl product , is influenced by the presence of donor ligands and controlled by the preferred conformation of the indenyl rings . exposure of the zirconium hydrides containing the e5 , e3-4,5-dihydroindenediyl rings to <nUm> atm of dihydrogen afforded the tetrahydroindenyl zirconium dihydride complexes , establishing the intermediacy of this unusual coordination environment during benzo ring hydrogenation . 
treatment of the η <nUm> ,e <nUm> -bis(indenyl)zirconium sandwich complex , ( η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> -1,3-(SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> )(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> -1,3- ( SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> )Zr , with dialkyl ethers such as diethyl ether , CH <nUm> OR ( r = et , n bu , t bu ) , n bu <nUm> O , or i Pr <nUm> O resulted in facile C-O bond scission furnishing an η <nUm> ,e <nUm> -bis(indenyl)zirconium alkoxy hydride complex and free olefin . In cases where ethylene is formed , trapping by the zirconocene sandwich yields a rare example of a crystallographically characterized , base - free η <nUm> , η <nUm> -bis(indenyl)zirconium ethylene complex . observation of normal , primary kinetic isotope effects in combination with rate studies and the stability of various model compounds support a mechanism involving rate - determining C-H activation to yield an η <nUm> ,e <nUm> - bis(indenyl) - zirconium alkyl hydride intermediate followed by rapid b-alkoxide elimination . for isolable η <nUm> ,e <nUm> - bis(indenyl) - zirconium THF compounds , thermolysis at <nUm> ° C also resulted in C-O bond cleavage to yield the corresponding zirconacycle . both mechanistic and computational studies again support a pathway involving haptotropic rearrangement to η <nUm> ,e <nUm> -bis(indenyl)zirconium intermediates that promote rate - determining C-H activation and ultimately C-O bond scission . 
the mechanism of stereocontrol in the site - controlled stereospecific polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) with C2- and C s-symmetric zirconocenes is investigated with a DFT based approach . our model explains the experimentally observed isospecificity in MMA polymerization with the C2 - symmetric rac-C2H 4(Ind)2Zr - based system as well as the experimentally observed syndiospecificity in MMA polymerization with the C s-symmetric Me2C(Cp)(Flu)Zr - based system . In both cases , the chiral metallocene induces a chiral orientation of the ester enolate growing chain . In turn , the chirally oriented growing chain selects its own enantioface . comparison with the mechanism of stereocontrol operative in the case of propene polymerization by the same zirconocenes is performed to stress similarities and differences . although analogies are expected , surprising differences also exist . the most peculiar is that the in the case of 1-olefins , the enantioselective event is selection between the enantiofaces of the prochiral monomer . instead , in the case of acrylates , the enantioselective event is selection between the enantiofaces of the prochiral growing chain . 
the species on the zirconocene catalyst is changed from two cp 's to the brintzinger ligand and catalytic amounts of MAO are used to usually effect a > <nUm> % regiocontrol of negishi carboaluminations of 1-alkynes in toluene . 
an investigation of the use of Cp2Zr(H)Cl ( schwartz 's reagent ) to reduce a variety of amides to the corresponding aldehydes under very mild reaction conditions and in high yields is reported . A range of tertiary amides , including weinreb 's amides , can be converted directly to the corresponding aldehydes with remarkable chemoselectivity . primary and secondary amides proved to be viable substrates for reduction as well , although the yields were somewhat diminished as compared to the corresponding tertiary amides . results from NMR experiments suggested the presence of a stable , 18-electron zirconacycle intermediate that presumably affords the aldehyde upon water or silica gel workup . A series of competition experiments revealed a preference of the reagent for substrates in which the lone pair of the nitrogen is electron releasing and thus more delocalized across the amide bond by resonance . this trend accounts for the observed excellent selectivity for tertiary amides versus esters . experiments regarding the solvent dependence of the reaction suggested a kinetic profile similar to that postulated for the hydrozirconation of alkenes and alkynes . addition of p-anisidine to the reaction intermediate resulted in the formation of the corresponding imine mimicking the addition of water that forms the aldehyde . 
the reaction of Li2[Me2Si(3-R-C5H3)2] salts with Zr{Me3SiN(CH2)3NSiMe3}Cl2(THF)2 in THF quantitatively afforded rac-Me2Si(3-R-C5H3)2Zr{Me3SiN(CH2)3NSiMe3} zirconocenes with <nUm> % stereoselectivity . NMR monitoring studies showed that these reactions initially form rac / meso mixtures , which undergo isomerization to pure rac . the isomerization requires cp - enantioface exchange and is catalyzed by chloride ion , which reversibly displaces cp- from Me2Si(3-R-C5H3)2Zr{Me3SiN(CH2)3NSiMe3} . kinetic analyses for selected complexes showed first - order dependence of the isomerization rate on both metallocene and chloride concentrations . reversible cp- / cl- exchange is also facile for {ansa-bis-Cp}ZrCl2 and nonbridged Cp2ZrCl2 complexes . 
silica - tethered fluorinated sulfonic acids in combination with trimethylaluminum activate metallocenes for the polymerization of ethylene . various control experiments indicate that the in situ formation of known cocatalysts such as methylaluminoxane is not likely . it is proposed that the interaction between the alkylaluminum and the supported sulfonic acid creates a site that can activate the zirconocene precatalyst to form the polymerization catalyst . this is a new combined support / activator for single - site olefin polymerization . 
the zirconocene complex [Cp2ZrMe]+ reacts with 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene to give methane and the allyl complex [Cp2Zr(e3-CH2C(CH2CHMe2)CH2)]+ . the reaction involves as an intermediate the unprecedented alkyl e1-alkene complex [Cp2Zr(Me)(e1-CH2CMeCH2CHMe2)]+ , in which C(2) is essentially carbocationic and the C(1) - C(2) bond order is sufficiently low that rotation about it occurs . the hydrogen atoms of the methyl group on C(2) are sufficiently acidic that proton transfer to the Zr-Me group occurs to generate the allylic product . it seems likely that the chemistry described here provides a rationale for deactivation of propene polymerization catalysts since the normal products of chain transfer , polymers with vinylidene end groups , should form allylic species in the same way . 
multisubstituted olefins are efficiently prepared by the zirconocene - mediated regio- and stereoselective coupling between 1-alkynylboronates and ethylene , followed by sequential transformation in moderate to high yields . the proper combination of substrates and reaction conditions is important for high yields . the synthesis of various tetrasubstituted alkenes in a regio- and stereocontrolled manner is described . this methodology has been applied to the synthesis of (Z)-tamoxifen in a concise , regio- and stereoselective manner . this multicomponent coupling strategy involves the characteristics of 1-alkynylboronates toward high selectivities followed by palladium(0) - mediated cross-coupling with aryl halides . 
the first asymmetric iridium - catalyzed C-C bond forming hydrogenation is described . by simply hydrogenating alkynes in the presence of n-arylsulfonyl imines using an iridium catalyst modified by (R)-Cl,MeO-BIPHEP , one may obtain the corresponding allylic amines 1b-21b in highly optically enriched form ( 92-99 % ee ) . this protocol circumvents the use of preformed vinyl metal reagents and is applicable to aromatic , heteroaromatic , and aliphatic n-arylsulfonyl aldimines 1a-16a . the reductive coupling products , allylic amines 1b-21b , are produced as single geometrical isomers ( ≥ <nUm> : <nUm> , e : z ) . nonsymmetric alkynes couple to imines 8a and 12a under standard conditions with excellent levels of regioselection . absolute stereochemical assignment of allylic amines 1b-21b is based upon single - crystal x-ray diffraction analysis of 22b , the p-bromophenylsulfonyl analogue of adduct 1b , using the anomalous dispersion method . A stereochemical model accounting for the observed sense of absolute stereoinduction and regioselectivity is provided . 
the insertion of enantiopure C2 - symmetric diphenylethylene carbonate into the Zr-C bonds of zirconaaziridines leads to the asymmetric synthesis of amino acid methyl esters . because the zirconaaziridine enantiomers interconvert , the reaction is a dynamic kinetic resolution ( DKR ) . the efficiency of the DKR ( the ratio of the two diastereomeric products ) is determined by the balance between the rate of enantiomer interconversion and the rate of insertion ; slow addition of the inserting enantiopure carbonate is often required to maximize the stereoselectivity . for a case when enantiomer interconversion is fast , its rate constant kinv has been determined by NMR line broadening ; for a case when interconversion is slow , kinv has been determined by computer simulation of the formation of the diastereomeric products as a function of time ; for several intermediate cases , kinv has been determined by making the zirconaaziridine enantioenriched and monitoring its racemization by CD spectroscopy . the observed kinv is independent of [THF] , implying that interconversion occurs with THF coordinated . interconversion presumably occurs via an achiral intermediate , either a rapidly inverting ( via an e1-N structure ) e3-azaallyl hydride or an e1-imine . As addition of THF slows insertion without affecting enantiomer interconversion , it produces a more efficient DKR without slow addition of the enantiopure carbonate . 
the reaction of Cp2Zr(4-F-o-tolyl)(CD2Cl2M)+ ( A ) with 2-butyne at <nUm> ° C in CD2Cl2 proceeds by reversible formation of the alkyne complex Cp2Zr(4-F-o-tolyl)(2-butyne)+ ( C ) , followed by rate limiting insertion to produce Cp2Zr{CMe = CMe(4-F-o-tolyl)}+ ( d ) . analysis of this system by pre-equilibrium kinetics ( <nUm> ° C ) gives keq = <nUm> M-1 for 2-butyne coordination to A and kinsert = <nUm> × 10-4 s-1 and δ g ‡ insert = <nUm> kcal / mol for the insertion step . stabilization of C by an agostic interaction and steric crowding in the transition state contribute to the high insertion barrier . 
the scope of CO-induced N <nUm> cleavage in a series of zirconocene and hafnocene complexes containing activated , side-on bound dinitrogen ligands has been studied . In each case , bridging oxamidide ligands , [ N 2C 2O <nUm> ] 4- , were formed from N-N bond cleavage coupled to N-C and C-C bond assembly . for the zirconium examples , [ ( η 5-C 5Me 4H ) 2Zr ] <nUm> ( μ 2,e 2,e 2-N <nUm> ) and [ me 2Si(e 5-C 5Me 4)(e 5-C 5H 3-3- tBu)Zr ] <nUm> ( μ 2,e <nUm> , η 2-N <nUm> ) , dinitrogen loss became competitive with N <nUm> carbonylation , and significant quantities of the zirconocene dicarbonyl accompanied oxamidide formation . In contrast , the hafnocene complex [ ( η 5-C 5Me 4H ) 2Hf ] <nUm> ( μ 2,e 2,e 2-N <nUm> ) underwent clean carbonylative dinitrogen cleavage with no evidence of N <nUm> loss . CO-induced N <nUm> cleavage was also coupled to N-H bond formation by hydrogenation and C-H bond activation , as carbonylation of the zirconocene and hafnocene dinitrogen complexes in the presence of H <nUm> or phenylacetylene furnished isocyanato metallocene complexes with bridging imido ( m-NH ) ligands . In the case of the ansa - hafnocene dinitrogen complex , replacing the dihydrogen atmosphere with various primary silanes yielded an isocyanato hafnocene m-oxo hydride resulting from cleavage of N <nUm> and CO , the diatomics with the two strongest bonds in chemistry . 
the alkylaluminum - complexed zirconocene trihydride cation [(SBI)Zr(m-H)3(AliBu2)2] + , which is obtained by reaction of BCl2ISZr with [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] and excess AlH iBu2 in toluene solution , catalyzes the formation of isotactic polypropene when exposed to propene at <nUm> ° C . this cation remains the sole observable species in catalyst systems free of AlMe compounds . In the presence of AlMe3 , however , exposure to propene causes the trihydride cation to be completely converted , under concurrent consumption of all hydride species by propene hydroalumination , to the doubly me - bridged cation [(SBI)Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2]+ . the latter then becomes the resting state for further propene polymerization , which produces , by chain transfer to Al , mainly AlMe2 - capped isotactic polypropene . 
the ansa - zirconocene complex rac-Me2Si(1-indenyl) 2ZrCl2 ( BCl2ISZr ) reacts with diisobutylaluminum hydride and trityl tetrakis(perfluorophenyl)borate in hydrocarbon solutions to give the cation [ (SBI)Zr(m-H)3(Al iBu2)2]+ , the identity of which is derived from NMR data and supported by a crystallographic structure determination . analogous reactions proceed with many other zirconocene dichloride complexes . [ (SBI)Zr(m-H)3(AliBu 2)2]+ reacts reversibly with AlCl iBu2 to give the dichloro-bridged cation [(SBI)Zr(m-Cl)2AliBu2]+ . reaction with AlMe3 first leads to mixed - alkyl species [ (SBI)Zr(m-H) <nUm> ( AlMex iBu2 - x)2 ] + by exchange of alkyl groups between aluminum centers . At higher AlMe3 / Zr ratios , [(SBI)Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2] + , a constituent of methylalumoxane - activated catalyst systems , is formed in an equilibrium , in which the hydride cation [ (SBI)Zr(m-H) 3(AlR2)2]+ strongly predominates at comparable HAliBu2 and AlMe3 concentrations , thus implicating the presence of this hydride cation in olefin polymerization catalyst systems . 
accurate active - site counts are necessary for the establishment of olefin polymerization kinetics , yet current techniques are often tedious and limited in sensitivity . herein , we describe the development of a novel method for determining the fraction of initiated catalyst using standard gel - permeation chromatography ( GPC ) . the first insertion of monomer into the chromophore - bearing zirconocene <nUm> generates a single equivalent of a labeled polymer chain . the polymer - bound label can be quantified as a function of polymer molecular weight using a GPC with a UV detector ; simultaneous RI detection allows both the extent of monomer conversion and the molecular - weight distribution to also be established . we estimate that monomer to catalyst ratios of as high as <nUm> : <nUm> can be measured using this technique . 
91Zr ( I = <nUm> / <nUm> ) solid - state NMR ( SSNMR ) spectra of the zirconocene compounds , Cp2ZrCl2 , cp* 2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) , Cp2ZrBr2 ( 2 ) , ( me 3SiC5H4)2ZrBr2 ( 3 ) , O(Me2SiC5H4)2ZrBr2 ( 4 ) , (1,3-C5H3)(SiMe2OSiMe2) 2(1,3-C5H3)ZrBr2 ( 5 ) , ind 2ZrCl2 ( 6 ) , Cp2ZrMeCl ( 7 ) , cp 2ZrMe2 ( 8 ) , and [Cp2ZrMe][MeB(C 6F5)3 ] ( 9 ) have been acquired . static 91Zr SSNMR spectra have been acquired for all complexes at magnetic fields of <nUm> and <nUm> T. Cp2ZrCl2 and complexes <nUm> to <nUm> possess relatively narrow central transition powder patterns which allows for magic - angle spinning ( MAS ) 91Zr solid - state NMR spectra to be acquired at a moderate field strength of <nUm> T . complexes <nUm> to <nUm> possess ultrawideline central transition SSNMR spectra necessitating piece-wise acquisition techniques . from the static and MAS 91Zr SSNMR spectra , it is possible to measure 91Zr electric field gradient ( EFG ) and chemical shift ( CS ) tensor parameters , as well as the euler angles which describe their relative orientation . basis sets and methods for the accurate quantum chemical calculation of 91Zr EFG and CS tensors have been identified . the origin of the observed EFG and CS tensor parameters are further investigated by visualization of the EFG and CS tensor orientations within the molecular frames . correlations between the observed and calculated NMR tensor parameters and molecular symmetry and structure are made . all of these observations suggest that 91Zr SSNMR spectroscopy can be utilized to probe the molecular structure of a variety of homogeneous and heterogeneous olefin polymerization catalysts . 
the reaction of the low - valent metallocene(II) sources cp 2Ti(n2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) ( 7 ) and Cp2Zr(py)(n2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ( <nUm> , cp = n5-cyclopentadienyl , py = pyridine ) with carbodiimides RN = C = NR ( r = cy , i-Pr , p-Tol ) leads to the formation of five membered hetero-metallacycloallenes Cp2M{Me3SiC = C = C[N(SiMe3)(R)]-N ( r ) } ( 9M-R ) ( m = Ti , r = i-Pr ; m = Zr , r = cy , i-Pr , p-Tol ) . elimination of the alkyne ( as the hitherto known reactivity of titanocene and zirconocene alkyne complexes would suggest ) was not observed . the molecular structures of the obtained complexes were confirmed by x-ray studies . moreover , the structure and bonding of the complexes 9Zr-Cy and 9Zr-p-Tol was investigated by DFT calculations . ( figure presented ) 
the cationic zirconocene - phosphinoaryloxide complexes [ cp 2ZrOC6H4P(t-Bu)2][B(C 6F5)4 ] ( 3 ) and [ Cp*2ZrOC 6H4P(t-Bu)2][B(C6F5) <nUm> ] ( 4 ) were synthesized by the reaction of Cp2ZrMe <nUm> or Cp*2ZrMe2 with 2-(diphenylphosphino) phenol followed by protonation with [2,6-di-tert-butylpyridinium][B(C 6F5)4 ] . compound <nUm> exhibits a Zr-P bond , whereas the bulkier cp* derivative <nUm> was isolated as a chlorobenzene adduct without this Zr-P interaction . these compounds can be described as transition - metal - containing versions of linked frustrated lewis pairs ( FLPs ) , and treatment of <nUm> with H under mild conditions cleaved H <nUm> in a fashion analogous to that for main - group FLPs . their reactivity in amine borane dehydrogenation also mimics that of main - group FLPs , and they dehydrogenate a range of amine borane adducts . however , in contrast to main - group FLPs , <nUm> and <nUm> achieve this transformation in a catalytic rather than stoichiometric sense , with rates superior to those for previous high - valent catalysts . 
the extension of the frustrated lewis pair ( FLP ) concept to the transition series with cationic zirconocene - phosphinoaryloxide complexes is demonstrated . such complexes mimic the reactivity of main group FLPs in reactions such as heterolytic hydrogen cleavage , CO <nUm> activation , olefin and alkyne addition , and ring - opening of tetrahydrofuran . the interplay between sterics and electronics is shown to have an important role in determining the reactivity of these compounds with hydrogen in particular . the Zr-H species generated from the heterolytic activation of hydrogen is shown to undergo insertion reactions with both CO <nUm> and CO . crucially , these transition metal FLPs are markedly more reactive than main group systems in many cases , and in addition to the usual array of reactions they demonstrate unprecedented reactivity in the activation of small molecules . this includes S N and E2 reactions with alkyl chlorides and fluorides , enolate formation from acetone , and the cleavage of C-O bonds to facilitate S N type reactions with noncyclic dialkyl ethers . 
reactions of cp 2Zr(m-Cl)(m-C 2B 10H 10)Li(OEt <nUm> ) <nUm> with alkynes r 1C ≡ CR <nUm> gave as insertion products zirconacyclopentenes incorporating a carboranyl unit , 1,2-[Cp 2ZrC(R <nUm> ) = C(R 2)]-1,2-C 2B 10H <nUm> ( 1 ) . treatment of <nUm> with another type of alkyne r 3C ≡ CR <nUm> in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of ClNi <nUm> and ClFe <nUm> or a catalytic amount of ClNi <nUm> afforded symmetric or unsymmetric benzocarboranes . the regioselectivity was dominated by the polarity of the corresponding alkynes . these reactions could also be carried out in one pot , leading to the equivalent of a three - component [ <nUm> + <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition of carboryne and two different alkynes promoted by transition metals . A reaction mechanism was proposed after the isolation and structural characterization of the key intermediate nickelacycle . these results show that nickel complexes are more reactive than the iron ones toward the insertion of alkynes but that the latter do not initiate the trimerization of alkynes , making the insertion of activated alkynes possible . this work also demonstrates that a catalytic amount of nickel works as well as a stoichiometric amount of nickel in the presence of excess ClFe <nUm> for the reactions . such a catalytic reaction may shed some light on the development of zirconocene - based catalytic reactions . 
coordination polymerization of renewable a-methylene-g-(methyl) butyrolactones by chiral C 2-symmetric zirconocene catalysts produces stereo - random , highly stereo - regular , or perfectly stereo - regular polymers , depending on the monomer and catalyst structures . computational studies yield a fundamental understanding of the stereocontrol mechanism governing these new polymerization reactions mediated by chiral metallocenium catalysts . 
salt metathesis reactions of cp <nUm> ( NR 2)ZrX ( x = Cl , I , OTf ) and lithium hydrosilazides ultimately afford hydride products cp <nUm> ( NR 2)ZrH that suggest unusual b-hydrogen elimination processes . A likely intermediate in one of these reactions , cp 2Zr[N(SiHMe 2)t-Bu][N(SiHMe <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , is isolated under controlled synthetic conditions . addition of alkali metal salts to this zirconium hydrosilazide compound produces the corresponding zirconium hydride . however as conditions are varied , a number of other pathways are also accessible , including C-H / Si-H dehydrocoupling , g-abstraction of a CH , and b-abstraction of a HSi . our observations suggest that the conversion of (hydrosilazido)zirconocene to zirconium hydride and silanimine does not follow the classical four - center mechanism for b-elimination . 
chemistry research is an eloquent , yet extremely complex discipline consisting of a diverse range of topics . the complexity of every sub-discipline requires extensive focus , which can limit cross-talk between fields , thus leading to their isolation . In particular , natural product and material chemistries have experienced this trend , and it has led to an ever growing separation between them . yet by looking at the fundamental aspect of the relationship between molecular design and the resulting properties , it is possible to remind chemists of their ability to bridge these research areas . it is intradisciplinary collaborations that can provide a path toward collectively addressing the many challenges of chemistry . 
reduction of Zr(IV) metallocenium cations with sodium amalgam ( HgNa ) produces EPR signals assignable to Zr (III) metallocene complexes . the chloro-bridged heterodinuclear ansa - zirconocenium cation [ (SBI)Zr(m-Cl) 2AlMe2]+ ( SBI = rac-dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl) ) , present in toluene solution as its BC6F5 <nUm> - salt , thus gives rise to an EPR signal assignable to the complex (SBI)ZrIII(m-Cl)2AlMe2 , while (SBI)ZrIII-Me and (SBI)ZrIII(m-H)2Al iBu2 are formed by reduction of [ (SBI)Zr(m-Me) 2AlMe2]+ BC6F5 <nUm> - and [ (SBI)Zr(m-H)3(AliBu 2)2]+ BC6F5 <nUm> - , respectively . these products can also be accessed , along with (SBI)ZrIII - iBu and [(SBI)ZrIII] + AlR4 - , when (SBI)ZrMe2 is allowed to react with HAliBu2 , eliminating isobutane en route to the Zr (III) complex . further studies concern interconversion reactions between these and other (SBI)Zr(III) complexes and reaction mechanisms involved in their formation . 
the reactivity of a series of disilazido zirconocene complexes is dominated by the migration of anionic groups ( hydrogen , alkyl , halide , OTf ) between the zirconium and silicon centers . the direction of these migrations is controlled by the addition of two - electron donors ( lewis bases ) or two - electron acceptors ( lewis acids ) . the cationic nonclassical [ Cp2ZrN(SiHMe 2)2]+ ( [2]+ ) is prepared from Cp2Zr{N(SiHMe2)2}H ( 1 ) and B(C 6F5)3 or [Ph3C][B(C 6F5)4 ] , while reactions of B(C 6F5)3 and Cp2Zr{N(SiHMe 2)2}R ( r = me ( 3 ) , et ( 5 ) , n-C3H7 ( 7 ) , CHi -CHSiMe3 ( 9 ) ) provide a mixture of [2]+ and [Cp2ZrN(SiHMe2)(SiRMe2)]+ . the latter products are formed through BC18F15 abstraction of a b-H and r group migration from Zr to the b-Si center . related b-hydrogen abstraction and x group migration reactions are observed for Cp2Zr{N(SiHMe2)2}X ( x = OTf ( 11 ) , Cl ( 13 ) , OMe ( 15 ) , O-i-C3H7 ( 16 ) ) . alternatively , addition of DMAP ( DMAP = 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine ) to [2]+ results in coordination to a Si center and hydrogen migration to zirconium , giving the cationic complex [Cp2Zr{N(SiHMe2)(SiMe2DMAP)}H] + ( [19]+ ) . related hydrogen migration occurs from [ cp 2ZrN(SiHMe2)(SiMe2OCHMe2) ] + ( [18]+ ) to give [ Cp2Zr{N(SiMe 2DMAP)(SiMe2OCHMe2)}H]+ ( [22] + ) , whereas x group migration is observed upon addition of DMAP to [Cp2ZrN(SiHMe2)(SiMe2X)]+ ( x = OTf ( [12]+ ) , Cl ( [14]+ ) ) to give [ cp 2Zr{N(SiHMe2)(SiMe2DMAP)}X]+ ( x = OTf ( [26]+ ) , Cl ( [20]+ ) ) . the species involved in these transformations are described by resonance structures that suggest b-elimination . notably , such pathways are previously unknown in early metal amide chemistry . finally , these migrations facilitate direct Si-H addition to carbonyls , which is proposed to occur through a pathway that previously had been reserved for later transition metal compounds . 
treatment of a [(trimethylsilylethynyl)alkenyl]ZrCp2 complex with piers ' borane [HB(C6F5)2] resulted in the clean formation of the Zr / B complex [ e2-(C6F 5)2B-Ci - C-SiMe3]ZrCp2 ( 3 ) . this compound shows some unique reaction patterns . with a variety of typical donor ligands ( carbon monoxide , an isonitrile , a nitrile , THF-d8 , ) it forms the respective adducts <nUm> ( four examples characterized by x-ray diffraction ) . toward terminal alkynes ( RCi - CH ) compound <nUm> behaves as a Zr (II) metal lewis base / boron lewis acid frustrated lewis pair ( FLP ) and undergoes typical regioselective 1,2-Zr / B addition reactions to yield the metallaheterocyclic products <nUm> ( four examples characterized by x-ray diffraction ) . compound <nUm> also undergoes characteristic 1,4-Zr / B FLP addition to a silyl-substituted conjugated enyne ( to give <nUm> ) and also to 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)butadiyne to yield a metallacyclic butatriene derivative <nUm> ( both <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by x-ray diffraction ) . eventually , compound <nUm> reacted with mes2P-Ci - CH to give the metallacycloallenoid product <nUm> , which was probably formed by means of 1,2-Zr / B FLP addition followed by alkynyl shift from boron to zirconium and reductive coupling . treatment of <nUm> with tolane gave the closely related zirconacycloallenoid complex <nUm> by carbon carbon coupling . both the products <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by x-ray diffraction . 

Cs - ligated ansa - zirconocene bis- and mono(ester enolate ) complexes incorporating the diphenylmethylidene-(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl) ligand , upon activation with appropriate activators , are highly active catalysts for the syndiospecific polymerization of MMA at ambient temperature , leading to the production of PMMA with high syndiotacticity ( rrrr = <nUm> % ) and glass transition temperature ( tg = <nUm> ° C ) . 
the mechanism of reversible alkyne coupling at zirconium was investigated by examination of the kinetics of zirconacyclopentadiene cleavage to produce free alkynes . the zirconacyclopentadiene rings studied possess trimethylsilyl substituents in the a-positions , and the ancillary cp2 , me 2C(e5-C5H4)2 , and CpCp* ( cp* = e5-C5Me5 ) bis(cyclopentadienyl) ligand sets were employed . fragmentation of the zirconacyclopentadiene ring in Cp2Zr[2,5-(Me3Si) 2-3,4-Ph2C4 ] with PMe3 , to produce Cp2Zr(e2-PhC ≡ CSiMe3)-(PMe <nUm> ) and free PhC ≡ CSiMe3 , is first - order in initial zirconacycle concentration and zero - order in incoming phosphine ( kobs = 1-4(2) × 10-5 s-1 at <nUm> ° C ) , and the activation parameters determined by an eyring analysis ( DH ‡ = <nUm> kcal mol-1 and DS ‡ = <nUm> eu ) are consistent with a dissociative mechanism . the analogous reaction of the ansa - bridged complex Me2C(e 5-C5H4)2Zr[2,5-(Me 3Si)2-3,4-Ph2C4 ] is <nUm> times faster than that for the corresponding cp2 complex , while the corresponding CpCp* complex reacts <nUm> times slower than the cp2 derivative . these rates appear to be largely influenced by the steric properties of the ancillary ligands . 
addition of <nUm> equiv of carbon dioxide to the ansa - zirconocene dinitrogen complex resulted in selective insertion into each zirconium nitrogen bond , forming a C2 symmetric dicarboxylated diazenido compound . treatment with excess Me3SiI furnished the ansa - zirconocene diiodide along with the N,N-dicarboxylated silylated hydrazine . new nitrogen-carbon bonds were also assembled by addition of methyl triflate . tri- and tetrasubstituted hydrazines could be formed by treatment with water and Me3SiI , respectively . the regiochemistry of the N carboxylation is controlled by the ansa-cyclopentadienyl ligand where the sterically demanding tert-butyl substituents and the C2 symmetry of the dimer dictates the stereochemistry of CO2 insertion . these results demonstrate the ability of zirconium dinitrogen compounds to participate in heterocumulene insertion chemistry . 
exposure of the isolable zirconocene sandwich compounds , (e5-C5Me5)(e5-C 9H5-1-R1-3-R2)Zr ( R1 = me , iPr , tBu ; R2 = me ) to one atmosphere of dinitrogen resulted in N coordination . x-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy establish that the resulting dimeric dinitrogen compounds contain an unusual m2,e2-bridging indenyl ring and a weakly activated N ligand . N coordination from the isolable zirconium sandwich compounds is extremely sensitive to the number and size of the indenyl subsituents . compounds bearing two [iPr] or three methyl substituents are stable as e9 sandwich compounds for weeks under dinitrogen likely due to the inability to dimerize through a two - atom N <nUm> bridge . performing the reduction of ( e5-C 5Me5)(e5-C9H5-1- R1-3-R2)ZrCl2 ( R1 = iPr , tBu ; R2 = me ; R1 = R2 = SiMe <nUm> ) under an N atmosphere produced a different outcome ; rare examples of side-on , end-on zirconium dinitrogen compounds were isolated and in one case , crystallographically characterized . protonolysis studies with weak bronsted acids were used to evaluate the relative activation of the bridging dinitrogen ligands . 
sodium amalgam reduction of the bis(indenyl)zirconium dihalide complexes , (e5-C9H5-1-iPr-3-Me)2ZrX2 ( x = Cl , Br , I ) , yielded the corresponding end-on dinitrogen complexes , [(e5-C9H5-1-iPr-3-Me)2Zr(NaX)]2(m2 , e1 , e1-N2 ) , with inclusion of <nUm> equiv of salt per zirconocene . the solid state structures of the chloro and iodo congeners establish short Zr = N and elongated N-N bonds , consistent with modest to strong activation of the coordinated dinitrogen molecule . exposure of the N compounds to <nUm> atm of dihydrogenresulted in rapid N-H bond formation to yield a hydrido zirconocene hydrazido compound concomitant with salt elimination . these studies establish a new structural type of zirconocene dinitrogen complex and demonstrate that side-on coordination of the N ligand in the ground state is not a prerequisite for dinitrogen hydrogenation . 
reactions of unbridged zirconocene dichlorides , ( r n C <nUm> H 5-n ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> , or <nUm> ) , with diisobutylaluminum hydride ( HAI'Bu <nUm> ) result in the formation of tetranuclear trihydride clusters of the type ( r n C <nUm> H 5-n ) <nUm> Zr(m-H) <nUm> ( Al i Bu2)3(m-CI) <nUm> , which contain three [ Al i bu <nUm> ] units . ring - bridged ansa - zirconocene dichlorides , Me2E(R n C <nUm> H 4-n ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> with e = C or Si , on the other hand , are found to form binuclear dihydride complexes of the type Me2E(R n C <nUm> H 4-n ) <nUm> Zr(CI)(m-H) <nUm> Al i bu <nUm> with only one [ AIBu <nUm> ] unit . the dichotomy between unbridged and bridged zirconocene derivatives with regard to tetranuclear versus binuclear product formation is proposed to be connected to different degrees of rotational freedom of their C <nUm> - ring ligands . alkylaluminum - complexed zirconocene dihydrides , previously observed in zirconocene - based precatalyst systems activated by methylalumoxane ( MAO ) upon addition of HAI'Bu <nUm> or Al i bu <nUm> , are proposed to be species of the type me <nUm> si(ind) <nUm> Zr(Me)(m-H) <nUm> Al i bu <nUm> , stabilized by interaction of their terminal me group with a lewis acidic site of MAO . 
low - valent zirconocene species reacted with 1,1,6,6-tetraalkyl-1,2,3,4,5- hexapentaenes to form both 1-zirconacyclopent-3-ynes and n2-p- coordinated complexes according to the alkyl groups ( r ) and the existence of the neutral ligand ( L ) . haptotropic interconvertion between these two complexes was observed . it was proposed that double insertion of isocyanide into the Zr-C bond of 1-zirconacyclopent-3-ynes takes place via the isocyanide adduct of the n2-p - complex as an intermediate . 
treatment of the bis-acetylide zirconocene complexes ( RCp ) 2Zr(C ≡ C-SiMe3)2 ( 8a,R = CH3 ; 8b,R = tert-butyl ) with BC12F10H results in the formation of the five - membered organometallic zirconacycloallenoid products ( 9a , 9b ) . both were characterized by x-ray diffraction , and the special bonding features of 9a were studied by DFT calculation . the overall reaction was followed by NMR experiments at variable temperature . starting from 8a the reaction proceeds by alkynyl abstraction to give a zwitterionic [ ( MeCp ) 2ZrC ≡ C-SiMe3]+[e-Ar2 FB(H)C ≡ C-SiMe3]- intermediate ( 12a ) , single crystals of which were obtained at <nUm> ° C for characterization by x-ray diffraction , followed by a 1,1-hydroboration / s-ligand coupling sequence to give the new five - membered zirconacycloallenoid product 9a . 
reaction of <nUm> equivs of MesC ≡ CPh with cp 2Zr( e2-Me 3SiC ≡ CSiMe 3)(pyr) afforded the zircona-cyclopentadiene cp 2Zr[2,5-Ph2-3,4-Mes 2C <nUm> ] . the regiochemistry of this isomer ( ssss with respect to the mesityl substituents ) was determined through single - crystal x-ray analysis and 2D ( NOESY , HSQC , HMBC ) NMR experiments . this selectivity is attributed largely to a steric - based directing effect of the o-methyl ring substituents since coupling of 1,3-dimethyl-2-(phenylethynyl)benzene with zirconocene gave a single regioisomer ( o-xylyl groups in both ss-positions ) while coupling of 1,3-dimethyl-5-(phenylethynl)benzene gave a statistical distribution of zirconacyclopentadiene regioisomers . the coupling reaction of <nUm> equivs of MeC ≡ CMes or CPr ≡ CMes with cp 2Zr(e 2-Me 3SiC ≡ CSiMe 3)(pyr) at ambient temperature gave the ssss regioisomers , cp 2Zr[2,5-Me2-3,4-Mes 2C <nUm> ] and cp 2Zr[2,5-Pr2-3,4-Mes 2C4 ] , respectively , as the major products . heating solutions of these zirconacycles at <nUm> ° C for several hours resulted in an increase in the amount of the unsymmetrical product . for reaction mixtures of CPr ≡ CMes and cp 2Zr(e 2-Me 3SiC ≡ CSiMe 3)(pyr) the major ( and apparently thermodynamic ) product under these reaction conditions was cp 2Zr[2,4-Mes 2-3,5-Pr 2C <nUm> ] . the steric strain in the mesityl-substituted zirconacycles allowed for facile substitution reactions of MesC ≡ CPh or CPr ≡ CMes by less bulky alkynes ( i.e. , tolan and 3-hexyne ) to give the unsymmetrical ziconacyclopentadienes cp 2Zr[2,4,5-Ph 3-3-MesC <nUm> ] , cp 2Zr[2-Ph- 3-Mes-4,5-Et 2C <nUm> ] , and cp 2Zr[2-Pr-3-Mes-4,5- ph 2C <nUm> ] . reaction of a mesityl-terminated diyne containing a rigid dihexylfluorenylene spacer with zirconocene afforded poly(p-fluorenylenedienylene) after demetalation with benzoic acid . 
( chemical equation presented ) the reaction of cpx 2ZrCl2 ( cpx = cp , cp* ) with ammonia borane in presence of n-butyllithium yielded Cp2Zr(Cl)NH 2BH3 and Cpx2Zr(H)NH 2BH3 . these derivatives are isoelectronic with the ethyl zirconocene chloride and hydride , respectively , and feature a chelating amidoborane ligand coordinating through a Zr-N bond and a Zr-H-B bridge . In solution , each of the complexes consists of an equilibrium mixture of two isomers differing in the orientation of the amidoborane ligand with respect to the Zr-X bond ( x = H , Cl ) , while in the solid state , only one isomer was observed . such isomers have not been characterized for any metal complexes containing the isoelectronic b-agostic ethyl ligand or any other agostic alkyl group . 
treatment of the hafnocene complex bearing a strongly activated , side-on bound dinitrogen ligand , [ ( e5-C5Me4H ) 2Hf]2(m2,e2 , e2-N2 ) , with two equivalents of methyl triflate yielded a mixture of products , one of which was identified as the triflato hafnocene methyl diazenide compound , ( e5-C5Me 4H)2Hf(OTf)(N2(CH3)) , arising from methylation of one of the nitrogen atoms . this reactivity contrasts with that of the zirconocene congener , [ ( e5-C5Me 4H)2Zr]2(m2,e2 , e2-N2 ) , where methyl triflate addition yields a variety of products that lack new nitrogen-carbon bonds . the methylated hafnocene product , ( e5-C5Me4H ) 2Hf(OTf)(N2(CH3)) provides a platform for additional transformations for the functionalized dinitrogen core . treatment with additional methyl triflate results in a second nitrogen-carbon bond formation to yield a rare example of a triflato hafnocene hydrazonato complex . loss of methane and formation of the hafnocene bis(triflate) accompany the transformation . isotopic labeling studies and other experiments are consistent with a pathway involving initial methylation of the unsubstituted nitrogen in the methyl diazenido ligand followed by deprotonation by a triflate anion . 
reactions of 1,2-dipotassiotetrakis(trimethylsilyl)disilane with group <nUm> metallocene dichlorides lead to the formation of the respective metallocene 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)disilene complexes . while the disilene titanocene complex could be structurally characterized , the zirconocene and hafnocene compounds , which are believed to possess some degree of bis-[bis(trimethylsilyl)silylene] character , can only be isolated in substance as the respective trimethylphosphane adducts . analogous metallocene 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)digermene complexes and a tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)silagermene complex were prepared . instead of metallocene 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)distannene complexes , four - membered rings composed of a metallocene and three bis(trimethylsilyl)stannylene units were obtained . 
( chemical equation presented ) the C-D activation of bromobenzene-d <nUm> by [Cp*2ZrMe(BrC6D5-kBr)] [B(C6F5)4] to form s-aryl complex [Cp*2Zr(2-BrC6D4-k2Br,C)] [B(C6F5)4] is accelerated when the decamethylzirconocene methyl cation is generated in the presence of tertiary amines . computational studies suggest that the overall B - bond metathesis reaction proceeds , in the presence of tertiary amines , via initial deprotonation of bromobenzene in the coordination sphere of the metal center . In a subsequent step , the resulting neutral methyl aryl species , Cp*2ZrMe(2- BrC6D4 ) , reacts with the concurrently generated trialkylammonium cation to generate [ Cp*2Zr(2-BrC 6D4-k2Br,C ) ] [B(C6F5)4] . 
( chemical equation presented ) addition of 1-hexene to methylalumoxane- activated catalyst systems based on rac-Me2Si(ind)2ZrMe2 causes , concurrent with polyhexene formation and diminution of the otherwise prevalent cation [ rac-Me2Si(ind)2Zr(m -Me ) 2AlMe2]+ , formation of a hitherto unobserved species [ rac-Me2Si(ind)2Zr(m -R)(m -Me)AlMe 2]+ , where r is a Zr - bound polyhexyl chain . As hexene is increasingly consumed , this cation decays , mainly back to [ rac-Me 2Si(ind)2Zr(m -Me)2AlMe2 ] + and , in part , to some species containing a Zr - bound allylic chain end . 
the reactions of internal and terminal alkynes with organoalanes containing et , n-Pr , and i-Bu groups in the presence of cp 2ZrCl <nUm> and MeZrCp 2Cl were investigated with the goal of clarifying mechanistic details of some representative cases . three fundamentally different processes , i.e. , ( i ) C-M bond addition without C-H activation in the alkyl group , ( ii ) cyclic C-M bond addition via C-H activation , and ( iii ) hydrometalation , have been observed , and the courses of these reactions significantly depend on ( i ) the nature and number of alkyl groups in organoalanes , ( ii ) their amounts , and ( iii ) solvents . the reaction of alkynes with et 3Al in the presence of <nUm> equiv of cp 2ZrCl <nUm> in nonpolar solvents , e.g. , hexanes , proceeds via C-H activation to give the corresponding aluminacyclopentenes . investigation of the reaction of 5-decyne with 1-3 equiv of et 3Al and <nUm> equiv of cp 2ZrCl <nUm> , which gave mono- , di- , or trideuterated (Z)-5-ethyl-5-decene as shown , together with the previously reported structural study on the reaction of et 3Al with cp 2ZrCl <nUm> leading to the formation of well - characterized bimetallic species <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> , supports a catalytic cycle involving bimetallic species <nUm> and <nUm> . In summary , this process requires a zirconocene derivative containing one Zr - bound et group which is linked to et 3Al ( but not to et 2AlCl ) through a Cl bridge , i.e. , <nUm> , to produce <nUm> via β C-H activation . In sharp contrast , the reaction of et 2AlCl-Cp 2ZrCl <nUm> as well as of ( n-Pr ) 2AlCl-Cp 2ZrCl <nUm> does not involve any C-H activation processes . it proceeds well in chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents , e.g. , ( CH 2Cl ) <nUm> , but it is extremely sluggish in nonpolar solvents , e.g. , hexanes . the reaction may well involve direct C-Al bond addition to alkynes , as suggested earlier for Zr - catalyzed Me-Al bond addition to alkynes , but a few other alternatives can not be ruled out on the basis of the currently available data . the reaction of alkynes with ( n-Pr ) 3Al-Cp 2ZrCl <nUm> in nonpolar solvents proceeds partially via C-H activation and partially via hydrometalation . In contrast with the C-H activation process observed with et 3Al , that with ( n-Pr ) 3Al is totally dominated by dimerization of alkynes to give aluminacyclopentadienes rather than aluminacyclopentenes , reflecting a previously established generalization that propene can be much more readily displaced from Zr by alkynes than ethylene . hydrometalation is the exclusive process with ( i-Bu ) 3Al-Cp 2ZrCl <nUm> . this hydrometalation reaction , however , reveals a few interesting complications . alkyl-substituted internal alkynes give double bond migrated products in addition to the expected hydrometalation products . with terminal alkynes the reaction produces the expected hydrometalation products and the 1,1-dimetalloalkanes in comparable yields . various other related reactions involving other alkynes , e.g. , PhC ≡ CPh , n-OctC ≡ CH , and PhC ≡ CH , and other reagents , e.g. , et 3Al-MeZrCp 2Cl , et 2AlCl-MeZrCp 2Cl , and ( n-Pr ) 3Al-MeZrCp 2Cl , were also studied . 
In polymers made from (E)- or (Z)-[1-D]propene with methyl alumoxane (MAO)-activated ansa - zirconocene catalysts , signals of deuterium - labeled mrrm pentads document that stereoerrors arise mainly from an isomerization of the Zr - bound chain end . reduced d - atom redistribution in poly( [2-D]propene ) indicates a kinetic isotope effect of k(H) / k(D) ~ <nUm> for the b-H / d transfer associated with the isomerization reaction . In all poly([1- and [2-D]propenes ) studied , d - labeled mmmm pentads occur with a probability similar to that of d - labeled mrrm pentads ; this observation requires further mechanistic clarification . olefinic chain ends of polymers obtained with C <nUm> H <nUm> ( thind ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> -MAO from (E)- or (Z)-[1-D]propene deviate in their d - label distributions from the expected stereochemistry . isomerization of the Zr - bound chain end , probably via a Zr - bound tertiary alkyl intermediate , thus contributes also to chain - growth termination . with the sterically hindered catalyst me <nUm> Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> -MAO , almost all chain terminations appear to occur via chain - end isomerization , which does not lead to stereoerrors here . with the high - performance catalyst me <nUm> Si(2-Me-benz[e]indenyl) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> -MAO , finally , no d - label is found in the mrrm and mmmm pentad signals ; here , Zr - alkyl isomerization can apparently not compete with the high rate of olefin insertion .

the mechanism of diimine-Ni - catalyzed ethylene polymerization reaction has been studied theoretically using the B3LYP density functional method . the chain initiation reaction proceeds with the coordination of ethylene to the model active catalyst [L2NiCH3]+ , L2 - CH2N , followed by ethylene insertion into the metal - alkyl bond with a rate - determining <nUm> kcal / mol free energy barrier to form a g-agostic intermediate , which with a small barrier rearranges to a more stable b-agostic intermediate and then forms an olefin alkyl complex upon coordination of the next ethylene . linear polymer propagation takes place from this olefin alkyl complex , the resting state in the catalytic cycle , via the same insertion , rearrangement , and coordination pathway . an alternative pathway from the olefin alkyl complex passes over a 14-15 kcal / mol barrier for b-hydride elimination and reinsertion for branched polymer propagation . these energetics suggest that the Ni (II) - catalyzed reaction is expected to produce more linear than methyl-branched polymers , and that higher temperature increases and higher ethylene pressure decreases the branching . hydrogenolysis is an energetically favorable termination pathway , proceeding via coordination of a hydrogen molecule to the metal center , followed by H-H activation though a four - centered ' metathesis - like ' transition state and reductive elimination of alkane . A comparison with zirconocene - catalyzed ethylene polymerization shows that the Ni(II)catalyzed polymerization should be slightly slower and should give more branching . 
the microstructures of polypropenes produced with several zirconocene- based catalyst systems are compared , to verify the possible correlation between the type of stereospecificity and the amount of regioirregularities . it is confirmed that , while syndiospecific and aspecific zirconocenes are highly regiospecific , isospecific systems produce substantial amounts of regioirregular monomeric units . the amount of these secondary units strongly depends on the nature of the p-ligands and on the type of the bridge connecting them . molecular mechanics calculations are reported , indicating that the intermediates which are energetically suitable for the secondary and primary insertions , for isospecific or syndiospecific complexes , coordinate monomer enantiofaces of the opposite or the same chirality , respectively . this difference accounts for the lower regiospecificity of the isospecific catalytic complexes , assuming that the energy barrier for the rotation of the coordinated monomer around the metal - olefin bond , between the orientations suitable for the primary and secondary insertions is lower than ( or comparable to ) the activation energy for secondary monomer insertion . 
the reactions of so called ' tuck-in ' permethyl zirconocene compounds Cp*(e5-e1-C5Me4CH2)ZrX ( x = cl(1a) , C6H5 ( 1b ) , CH3 ( 1c ) ) with the highly electrophilic boranes BC12F10H and BC18F15 are described . the products are zwitterionic olefin polymerization catalysts . reactions with 1a and 1b yielded single products cleanly , but reactions with tuck-in methyl starting material 1c gave mixtures . spectroscopic and structural studies showed that the electrophilic zirconium center in the product zwitterions was stabilized by a variety of mechanisms . In the products of reaction between 1a and 1b with BC12F10H , Cp*[e5,e1-C5Me4CH2B(C6F5)2(m-H)]ZrX ( x = Cl ( 2a ) , <nUm> % ) , C6H5 ( 2b , <nUm> % ) ) , the metal is chelated by a pendant hydridoborate moiety . chloride product 2a was characterized crystallographically . In the reaction of BC18F15 with 1a , the fluxional zwitterionic product Cp*[e5-C5Me4CH2B(C6F5)3]ZrCl ( 3a , <nUm> % ) is stabilized by a weak donor interaction between one of the ortho-fluorine atoms of the -CH2B- C6F5 counteranion and the zirconium center ( Zr-F = <nUm> Å ) . In the product of the reaction between lb and BC18F15 , Cp*[e5-C5Me4CH2B(C6F5)3]ZrC6H5 ( 3b , <nUm> % ) , a similar ortho- fluorine interaction was found in a yellow kinetic product ( y-3b ) , which converted upon heating gently to a thermodynamic orange polymorph ( o-3b ) in which the zirconium center is compensated via an agostic interaction from an ortho C-H bond of the phenyl group and an interaction between the methylene group of the -CH2B C6F5 counteranion . these compounds were both characterized by x-ray crystallography . zwitterion o-3b reacts with H to form the zwitterionic hydride Cp*[e5-C5Me4CH2B(C6F5)3]ZrH ( <nUm> , <nUm> % ) , characterized by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography to reveal a return to the ortho-fluorine mode of stabilization . compounds 2a , 3a , o-3b , and <nUm> were all found to be active ethlyene polymerization catalysts ; the chloride derivatives required minimal amounts of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) to alkylate the zirconium center . polymerization data are discussed in light of the structural findings for the catalysts employed . 
the extrusion of methane from (2-phosphininyl)(methyl) zirconocenes 3a-c at <nUm> ° C in benzene affords the corresponding < eta > 2-phosphabenzyne-zirconocene dimers 4a-c , one of which has been characterized by x-ray crystal structure analysis . the parameters of the C-C-Zr three - membered ring are exactly similar to those found in the < eta > 2-benzyne-zirconocene complex : C-C , <nUm> ; C-Zr , <nUm> and <nUm> Å . the P-Zr distances are normal at <nUm> and <nUm> Å . the reaction of these < eta > 2-phosphabenzyne complexes with acetonitrile , Ph3P = S , (diphenylphosphino)- and (trimethylsilyl)alkynes , aldehydes , and (+)-camphor have been investigated . In all cases , an insertion into the C2-Zr bond is observed . hydrolysis of the intermediate zirconacycles thus obtained yielded several new 2-functional phosphinines , including a thiol ( 6 ) , a vinylphosphine ( 8 ) , two secondary alcohols ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) , and an homochiral phosphinine - substituted alcohol ( 17 ) . the regiospecificity of the insertion is ascribed to the huge concentration of negative charge at the a-position of the phosphinine ring . 
the lewis acid tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane adds to the (butadiene)group <nUm> metallocenes 1a-d ( metallocene = Cp2Zr , Cp2Hf , (MeCp)2Zr , (Me3CCp)2Zr ) to give the metallocene-(m-C4H6)-borate-betaine complexes 2a-d . (Isoprene)zirconocene ( 1e ) and (2-phenylbutadiene)zirconocene ( if ) add the BC18F15 reagent regioselectively at the carbon atom C-4 to give the complexes 2e and 2f , respectively . the complexes <nUm> all show a pronounced M***F-C interaction with one of the six ortho-B(C6F5)3 fluorine atoms . the resulting metallacyclic structures were characterized by x-ray diffraction of the complexes 2c and 2e ( Zr***F ~ <nUm> Å , angle Zr-F-C ~ <nUm> ° ) . the bridging fluorine atom of the complexes in solution is characterized by an extreme upfield shift of its 19F NMR resonance ( δ ~ <nUm> to <nUm> ppm ) relative to the signals of the remaining five o-F resonances of the BC18F15 moiety ( average δ ~ <nUm> ppm ) . the 19F NMR spectra of the complexes <nUm> are dynamic even in the noncoordinating solvent toluene-d8 . all six o-fluorine signals equilibrate with coalescence temperatures around <nUm> K at <nUm> MHz to give a single resonance signal at high temperature . this fluorine equilibration process of the -B(C6F5)3 end of the metallocene-borate-betaine complexes <nUm> is very likely to proceed via a rate determining cleavage of the coordinative M***F-C interaction . from the activation barrier of this process , obtained from the dynamic fluorine NMR spectra , Zr***F bond dissociation energies of ca. <nUm> kcal / mol were estimated for the complexes <nUm> . this magnitude of the M***F-C band dissociation energy makes the internal fluorocarbon coordination a very suitable tool for protecting active electrophilic metal catalyst centers . the Zr***F-C bond of the complexes <nUm> is cleaved by the addition of the donor solvent THF with formation of acyclic 1,2-e2-allyl metallocene complexes .

synthetic pathways to several salts of the anion [Cp*2ZrH3]- have been developed . reaction of Cp*2ZrH2 ( 3 ) prepared from [Cp*2Zr(N2)]2(m-N2) ( 2 ) , with KH in THF , afforded [Cp*2ZrH3]K ( 1 ) in a <nUm> % yield . In a similar manner , addition of HLi gave [Cp*2ZrH3]Li ( 4 ) . while this synthetic pathway provides reproducible routes to land <nUm> , purification of <nUm> is problematic . another preparation involving the reaction of Cp*2ZrC12 with <nUm> equiv of n-BuLi under H affords 4.0.5(LiCI-THF) . alternatively , reaction of Cp*2ZrC12 with AlH4Li afforded the species Cp*2ZrH(m2-H2AlH2) ( 5 ) in virtually quantitative yield . subsequent reaction of <nUm> with n-BuLl afforded the direct and high - yield conversion to <nUm> . deuteration and NMR studies infer attack of BuLi occurs at the Al center exclusively prompting transfer of a hydride to Zr and liberation of the Zr trihydride anion . variable - temperature 1H NMR spectra and H / d scrambling experiments for <nUm> and 4-d3 are consistent with the hydride exchango process mediated by ion pairing while T1 studies infer a classical trihydride formulation is appropriate . crystallographic studies of 4-0.5(LiCI*THF) , <nUm> , and <nUm> also affirm cation - anion pairing in <nUm> and 4.0.5(LiCl*THF) and hydride bridging between A1 and Zr in <nUm> . 
treatment of bis(phenylethynyl)silane ( PhC ≡ C ) <nUm> SiR <nUm> ( r = me ( 2a ) , et ( 2b ) or ph ( 2c ) ) with cp <nUm> ZrEt <nUm> ( 1 ) ( cp = cyclopentadienyl ) and H <nUm> O / ClCu in this order afforded (1E,3E)-1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene ( 3 ) in 56-88 % yields after hydrolysis . on the other hand , hydrolysis of the reaction mixture of 2a-h with cp <nUm> ZrEt <nUm> gave silacyclobutene derivatives 4a-h in 61-87 % yields . zirconium - containing intermediate <nUm> was obtained as crystals suitable for X- ray analysis when t-BuC <nUm> H <nUm> was used as the ligands of a zirconocene derivative . structure of <nUm> showed that the intermediate contained the zirconacyclobutene-silacyclobutene fused ring system . reaction of silacyclobutene 4a with ClCu selectively opened the silacyclobutene ring . the further treatment of the reaction mixture with phi in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(PPh <nUm> ) <nUm> gave 1,3,4-triphenyl-1-silyl-1,3-butadiene compound <nUm> . zirconacyclopentadienes with an alkynylsilyl group at the a- position afforded zirconacyclohexadiene derivatives <nUm> in 82-98 % yields . when t-BuC <nUm> H <nUm> was used as the ligands instead of two cp , the structure was determined by x-ray analysis . the structure clearly showed that <nUm> had the zirconacyclohexadiene-silacyclobutene fused ring system . 
A new class of isospecific and highly regiospecific C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes , characterized by a bisindenyl ansa ligand with bulky substituents in the <nUm> position of indence and a single carbon bridge is disclosed : variation of the size of the substituent in C(3) has a strong effect on the extent of chain transfer and isospecificity in propene polymerization . In fact , while rac-[Me2C(1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 produces low molecular weight and moderately isotactic polypropene ( iPP ) also containing some regioirregularities ( m(n) = <nUm> , mmmm ca. <nUm> % and 2,1(tot) = <nUm> % at <nUm> ° C in liquid monomer ) , rac-[Me2C(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 produces iPP with molecular weights between <nUm> ( t(p) = <nUm> ° C ) and <nUm> ( t(p) = <nUm> ° C ) and a fairly high isotacticity ( mmmm ca. <nUm> % at <nUm> ° C ) , with no detectable <nUm> units . the influence of polymerization temperature on the catalyst performance has been investigated by polymerizing liquid propene in the temperature range of 20-70 ° C : the experimental DDE values for enantioface selectivity have been estimated for two members of the new class ( rac-[Me2C(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 DDE(enant) = <nUm> kcal / mol ; rac-[Me2C(3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 DDE(enant) = <nUm> kcal / mol ) . for comparison , brintzinger 's moderately isospecific , benchmark catalyst rac-[ethylene(1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 ( DDE(enant) = <nUm> kcal / mol ) , the single carbon bridged , unsubstituted rac-[Me2C(1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 ( DDE(enant) = <nUm> kcal / mol ) , and the C2 - symmetric , practically aspecific , rac-[ethylene(3-methyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 ( DDE(enant) = <nUm> kcal / mol ) are also reported . the molecular structures of rac-[Me2C(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 and rac-[Me2C(3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 have been determined . 
the zirconocene - coupling of diynes with internal silicon substituents , MeC ≡ CMe2SiArSiMe2C ≡ CMe ( <nUm> : Ar = 1,4-C6H4 ; <nUm> : Ar = 1,3-C6H4 ; <nUm> : Ar = 1,3-C6H4 ; <nUm> : Ar = 4,4'-C6H4C6H4 ) , generates regiospecific polymers containing zirconacyclopentadiene in the main chain ( 5-7 ) . these organometallic polymers hydrolyze cleanly to butadienediyl polymers of the type [ Me2SiArSiMe2CH = CMeCMe = CH](n) ( 11-13 ) , and polymer <nUm> reacts with iodine to give the iodine - containing polymer [ 1,4-Me2SiC6H4SiMe2C(I) = CMeCMe = C(I)](n) ( 14 ) . the organometallic polymers undergo facile and high - yield degradations to macrocycles under mild conditions ( refluxing tetrahydrofuran solution ) . the size and shape of the resulting macrocycles depend upon the nature of the diyne spacer group . thus , polymers <nUm> and <nUm> containing parallel diyne units convert to the trimeric macrocycles [Me2SiArSiMe2C4Me2ZrCp2]3 ( <nUm> : Ar = 1,4-C6H4 ; <nUm> : Ar = 4,4'- C3H2 ) , while polymer <nUm> gives the dimeric macrocycle [ 1,3- Me2SiC6H4SiMe2C4Me2ZrCp2]2 ( 18 ) . the dimeric macrocycle [Me2SiC6H4SiMe2C6H4SiMe2C4Me2ZrCp2]2 ( 20 ) was obtained directly from the zirconocene coupling of Me2Si[(1,4-C6H4)- SiMe2(C ≡ CMe)]2 ( 4 ) by heating the reaction mixture to reflux . In a similar manner , the diyne Me2Si(C ≡ CMe)2 was converted in high yield to the hexameric macrocycle [Me2SiC4Me2ZrCp2]6 ( 22 ) . the macrocycles <nUm> , [1,4-Me2SiC6H4SiMe2C4Me2H2]3 ( 16 ) , and <nUm> were characterized by single - crystal x-ray crystallography . molecules of <nUm> adopt a nearly planar C3 macrocyclic structure with a cavity described by an average transannular Si***Si distance of <nUm> Å , while the hydrolyzed macrocycle <nUm> has a chair conformation . this conformation change results from conversion of cis diene groups in the zirconacyclopendiene fragments to trans diene groups in <nUm> . the high- yield formation of macrocycles apparently results from the reversible nature of the alkyne - coupling reaction , which allows for a low - energy pathway to the smallest macrocycle possessing minimal ring strain .

bis(e-methylcyclopentadienyl)(e4-butadiene)zirconium adds <nUm> equiv of the organometallic lewis acid BC18F15 to yield the metallocene- (mC4H6)-borate betaine <nUm> , which is an active , homogeneous , one - component ziegler catalyst for the polymerization of 1-alkenes . the metallacyclic metallocene betaine <nUm> undergoes a degenerate p=s=p-allyl interconversion on the NMR time scale in toluene solution ( DG([?])(m(obs))-(toluene) = <nUm> kcal mol-1 ) which becomes markedly faster in the presence of added reactive 1-alkenes ( DG([?])(m(obs)) = <nUm> ( 1-hexene ) , <nUm> ( 1-pentene ) , <nUm> ( 1- buterie ) , <nUm> kcal mo1-1 ( propene ) ) . this lowering of the activation barrier is probably due to an increased stabilization of the (s-alkyl)(p- alkene)metallocene betaine intermediate <nUm> , which at the same time is passed as the essential intermediate stage of the insertion of these alkenes into the reactive zirconium carbon bond of <nUm> to yield the mono olefin insertion products <nUm> . the gibbs activation energies of this chemical insertion reaction ( DG([?])(chem) = <nUm> ( 1-hexene ) , <nUm> ( 1-pentene ) , <nUm> ( 1-butene ) , <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( propene ) ) are similar in magnitude to the activation energies of magnetical exchange ( DG([?])(m(obs)) ) . this creates the interesting situation that in the presence of these reactive 1-alkenes , the ( reversible ) magnetical exchange rate ( k(m(obs)) ) , as determined by the dynamic NMR experiment , is dependent on the rate of the competing ( irreversible ) overall chemical addition reaction ( k(chem) ) . the rate constants k(m(obs)) and k(chem) were measured in the presence of these 1-alkenes , which allowed for a determination of the height of the first , i.e. , the complexation barrier ( DG([?])1 = <nUm> ( 1-hexene ) , <nUm> ( 1-pentene ) , <nUm> ( 1-buterie ) , <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( propene ) ; standard state c(Th) = <nUm> mol L-1 ) and its difference ( DDG([?])2 ) to the top of the actual insertion barrier ( DDG([?])2 = <nUm> ( 1-hexene ) , <nUm> ( 1-pentene ) , <nUm> ( 1-butene ) , <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( propene ) ) . these values , together with the activation energy of the degenerate allyl ligand interconversion of the model system (s-allyl)(p-allyl)zirconocene ( 10 ) ( DG([?])3 = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ) , allowed for a good experimentally based estimate of the intrinsic activation energy ( reaction <nUm> → <nUm> ) of the insertion of these 1-alkenes into the zirconium carbon bond at this group <nUm> bent metallocene unit . the thus obtained insertion barrier is DG([?]) / ( ins ) ≃ 10-11 kcal mol-1 for the 1-alkenes used in this study . the alkene decomplexation barrier ( reaction <nUm> → <nUm> ) is lower by ca , 1-2 kcal mol-1 . 
A series of substituted poly(p-phenylenediyne)s ( 1a-f ) was synthesized by the palladium - catalyzed cross-coupling condensation of terminal dialkynylalkanes with substituted diiodobenzenes . polymerizations were conducted with 1,4-diiodo-5-hexoxy-2-methoxybenzene or 1,4-diiodo-5-hexyl-2- methylbenzene and with 1,6-hexadiyne , 1,7-heptadiyne , or 1,8-octadiyne . thus , six different poly(p-phenylenediyne)s ( 1a-f , [ ArC ≡ C(CH2)(n)C ≡ c](m) ; Ar = 5-hexoxy-2-methoxyphenylene or 5-hexyl-2-methylphenylene , and n = <nUm> , <nUm> , or <nUm> ) were obtained . intramolecular zirconocene couplings of 1a-f afforded zirconacyclopentadiene - containing polymers 2a-f . these metal - containing polymers were then cleanly hydrolyzed to the substituted poly(p-phenylene- dieneylene)s ( 3a-f , [ ArCH = C(CH2)(n)C = CH](m) ; Ar = 5-hexoxy-2- methoxyphenylene or 5-hexyl-2-methylphenylene , and n = <nUm> , <nUm> , or <nUm> ) . variation of the polymer structure allows for manipulation of the absorption and emission maxima over the ranges of 316-524 nm and 437-619 nm , respectively . the optical properties of model compounds 9a-f , ( ArCH = C(CH2)(n)C = ArCH ; Ar = phenyl or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl , and n = <nUm> , <nUm> , or <nUm> ) are very similar to those for polymers 3a-f . the structures of 9c ( Ar = 2,5-dimethoxy-4- methylphenyl , n = <nUm> ) and 9d ( Ar = phenyl , n = <nUm> ) were determined by single- crystal x-ray crystallography . molecules of 9c are almost completely planar , while molecules of 9d are twisted and have poor ap-orbital overlap . the conformation of the diene unit in polymers 3a-f and the model compounds 9a-f are largely responsible for the observed variations in optical properties . finer tuning of the optical properties for poly(p-phenylenedienylene)s may be achieved via synthesis of copolymers from mixtures of 1,6-heptadiyne and 1,7- octadiyne . the optical properties of the resulting copolymers represent weighted averages for the corresponding homopolymers . investigation of the photophysical properties of polymers retaining some of the diyne units suggest that defects play a major role in defining the emissive properties of the poly(p-phenylenedienylene)s described here . 
(Alkenyl)zirconocene chlorides Cp2Zr(Cl)(CH = CHR ) ( <nUm> , r = H , phenyl , n- butyl , or cyclohexyl ) react with ' Cp2Zr ' generated from various precursors to yield the neutral dinuclear alkenyl-bridged bis(metallocene) complexes <nUm> [ Cp2Zr(m-Cl)(m-n1:n2-CH = CHR)ZrCp2 ] . the complexes <nUm> are regioselectively protonated by treatment with (HNMe2Ph+)(BPh4-) ( 8a ) to yield the unusually structured products <nUm> [ Cp2Zr(m-Cl)(m-n1:n2- C1H2C2HR)ZrCp2+ ] , which exhibit an unsymmetrically bridged hydrocarbyl ligand containing a novel type of a hypercoordinated carbon center ( C1 ) inside the rigid organometallic framework . from the NMR analysis and an X- ray crystal structure determination of the example 10c [ (MeCp)2Zr(m- Cl)(m-C1H2C2Hn-butyl)Zr(MeCp)2 / + ] , it is evident that the hypercarbon atom C1 is coordinated to four close neighboring atoms ( zr1 , zr2 , C2 , and h(1a) ) in a distorted square - planar arrangement with the remaining C1-H(1b) bond being oriented perpendicular to it . h(1b) thus marks the apex of a distorted square pyramid ; the hypercarbon atom C1 is located in the center of the basal plane . this unusual structural coordination geometry around C1 is determined by the stereoelectronic features of the two adjacent group <nUm> bent metallocene units . from the dynamic features of complex 9a ( r = H ) , a stabilization energy of ca. <nUm> kcal mol-1 is estimated for the uncommon coordination mode of C1 , which is favored here , relative to a ' normal ' sp3- hybridized structure in a c(2v)-symmetric metallacyclic framework . part of the pronounced thermodynamic stabilization of this unusual pentacoordinate carbon geometry originates from the strong a-agostic Zr***H(la)-C1 interaction in the basal plane . from the monodeuterated derivative 9a-C1HD , an energy difference of <nUm> cal mol-1 between d and H favoring the bridging position was determined .

A new method for the directed meta acylation of aromatic compounds is described . this method involves an ortho lithiation procedure combined with zirconocene-benzyne chemistry . 3-Acyl-1 - substituted benzene derivatives were obtained by acidic hydrolysis of the azazirconacycle intermediate which results from the coupling of a nitrile with a zirconocene-benzyne complex . similarly , 3-acyl-2-iodo-1 - substituted benzene derivatives were obtained by the iodination of the same intermediate followed by acidic hydrolysis . these procedures , which utilize simple , readily available starting materials , give good yields of regiochemically pure products . 
absolute metal - ligand σ bond enthalpies have been determined for a series of titanocene , zirconocene , and hafnocene halides and dimethyls by iodinolytic titration calorimetry . absolute metal - iodine bond disruption enthalpies were measured by iodination of the monomeric trivalent group <nUm> metallocenes Cp(tt)2TiI , (Me5C5)2TiI , Cp(tt)2ZrI , and Cp(tt)2HfI ( cp(tt) = e5-1,3-di-tert-butylcyclopentadienyl ) . iodinolysis of Cp(tt)2ZrMe2 and Cp(tt)2HfMe2 in turn yields absolute Zr-Me and Hf-Me bond enthalpies . derived values ( kcal / mol ) are D[Cp(tt)2Ti(I)-I] = <nUm> ; D[(Me5C5)2Ti(I)-I] = <nUm> ; D[Cp(tt)2Zr(I)-I] = <nUm> ; D[Cp(tt)2Hf(I)-I] = <nUm> ; D[Cp(tt)2Zr-Me2] = <nUm> ; and D[Cp(tt)2Hf- me2 ] = <nUm> . that D[Cp(tt)2Zr(I)-(I)] ≃ D(I3Zr-I) and D[(Me5C5)2Ti(I)-I] ≃ D(I3Ti-I) , while D[Cp(tt)2Ti(I)-I] ≃ D(I3Ti-I) - <nUm> kcal / mol , argues for more reliable transferability of D(M(IV)-I) in sterically less congested metallocenes . the molecular structures of Cp2(tt)ZrI2 , Cp2(tt)ZrI , and Cp2(tt)HfI were determined by x-ray diffraction . In Cp(tt)2ZrI2 , the Zr ligation is pseudotetrahedral , and the ring tert-butyl groups ' straddle ' the Zr-I bonds to minimize steric interactions . the geometry about Zr in Cp(tt)2ZrI is pseudotrigonal , with contracted Zr - ring centroid and Zr-I distances versus Cp(tt)2grI2 , primarily reflecting substantially diminished ligand - ligand repulsive nonbonded interactions in the latter . Cp(tt)2HfI is isomorphous with Cp(tt)2ZrI , and the slightly different metrical parameters are in accord with Hf vs Zr ionic radii . the significant differences in interligand repulsive interactions in the trivalent versus tetravalent complexes are confirmed by van der waals calculations . high - resolution UV PE spectra combined with ab initio relativistic effective core potential calculations provide details of electronic structure . absolute ionization energy values indicate that iodine behaves as both a strong σ and π donor . trends in the large Cp2MX(n) structural database can be understood in terms of the interplay between electronic and molecular structure factors , which are highly sensitive to the substitution patterns of the cyclopentadienyl ligands and , in particular , to competing σ vs π M-X bonding . 
bis(2-arylindenyl)zirconium dichlorides activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) produce elastomeric polypropylene . the elastic properties of this material are proposed to arise from a stereoblock microstructure . the silyl bridged catalysts rac- and meso-dimethylsilyl(bis(2-phenylindenyl))zirconium dichloride were prepared and used to model the polymerization behavior of the unbridged catalysts . the meso isomer is approximately twice as productive as the rac isomer in propylene polymerization . additionally , blends of isotactic and atactic polypropylene were prepared by using varying amounts of the rac and meso isomers until the IR and NMR characteristics matched polypropylenes produced from bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride . these studies suggest ( 1 ) that the rac isomer is favored in the isomerization equilibrium for the unbridged catalysts and ( 2 ) that the larger fraction of atactic polymer in the elastomeric polypropylene is a consequence of the higher rate of polymerization for the meso isomer .

At lower propylene concentrations , polymers with lower molecular weights and tacticity ( mostly m - type steroerrors ) are obtained . the microstructures of polymers produced under differing reaction conditions are consistent with stereocontrol dominated by a site epimerization process , an inversion of configuration at zirconium resulting from the polymer chain swinging from one side of the metallocene wedge to the other without monomer insertion . the relative importance of chain epimerization ( at the β carbon ) has been established by parallel polymerization of 2,d <nUm> -propylene and d <nUm> -propylene with 1b / MAO at low propylene concentrations . the C <nUm> -symmetric systems 1d,e / MAO display an unusual dependence of sterospecificity on propylene concentration , switching from isospecific to syndiospecific with increasing propylene pressure , consistent with a competitive unimolecular site epimerization process and a bimolecular chain propagation . the microstructures of the polypropylenes produced by 1d / MAO and 1e / MAO with [r] ≃ <nUm> % resemble the hemiisotactic microstructure produced by me <nUm> c(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> -3-Me)(e <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> )ZrCl <nUm> ( 2b ) / MAO . contrastingly , the hemiisotactic polypropylene microstructure obtained with 2b / MAO is found to be maintained at all propylene concentrations examined . 
the new C1 - symmetric complexes rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(2- methylbenz[e]-1-e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 14a ) , rac-[1-(9- e5-fluorenyl)-2-(4,5-cyclohexa-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 14b ) , and rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl- 1-e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 15 ) were prepared in up to <nUm> % yield . these compounds , activated with methyl aluminoxane , exhibit high active propene polymerization rates which remain constant over hours , even at elevated polymerization temperatures of <nUm> and <nUm> ° C . the two different coordination sites of these ' dual - side ' catalysts lead to isotactic polypropenes with variable amounts of stereoerrors , depending on the monomer concentration . the 2-methyl substituent of the indenyl ligands results , at the same time , in significantly increased molecular weights of the polymer products ( up to <nUm> x <nUm> g mol-1 ) , the bulk properties of which can be adjusted from flexible , semicrystalline thermoplastic to excellent thermoplastic elastic . 
enantiopure biphenyl-bridged titanocene and zirconocene complexes were obtained , by an asymmetric thermal transformation of the binaphthol complexes formed from the metallocene racemates and subsequent transformation to the corresponding dichlorides , in practically quantitative yields . increased rates of this transformation in the presence of O gas or TEMPO indicate a radical reaction mechanism . the biphenyl-bridged titanocene enantiomers give rise to an efficient asymmetric catalysis for the hydrogenation of cyclic and noncyclic imines .

isotopically labeled alkyl zirconocene complexes of the form ( CpR n ) <nUm> Zr(CH <nUm> CDR' <nUm> )(X) ( CpR n = alkyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl ; R' = H , alkyl group ; x = H , d , me ) undergo isomerization of the alkyl ligand as well as exchange with free olefin in solution under ambient conditions . increasing the substitution on the cp ring results in slower isomerization reactions , but these steric effects are small . In contrast , changing x has a very large effect on the rate of isomerization . pure s-bonding ligands such as methyl and hydride promote rapid isomerization , whereas p-donor ligands inhibit b-H elimination and hence alkyl isomerization . for ( e-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Zr(R)(Cl) , internal alkyl complexes have been observed for the first time . the rate of isomerization depends on the length of the alkyl group : longer alkyl chains ( heptyl , hexyl ) isomerize faster than shorter chains ( butyl ) . the transient intermediate species have been identified by a combination of isotopic labeling and <nUm> H , <nUm> H , and <nUm> C NMR experiments . the solid - state structure of the zirconocene cyclopentyl chloride complex , cp <nUm> Zr(cyclo-C <nUm> H <nUm> )(Cl) , has been determined by x-ray diffraction .

by kinetically stabilizing imidozirconocene complexes through the use of a sterically demanding ligand , or by generating a more thermodynamically stable resting state with addition of diphenylacetylene , we have developed transition metal - catalyzed imine metathesis reactions that are mechanistically analogous to olefin metathesis reactions catalyzed by metal carbene complexes . when <nUm> mol % of Cp*Cp(THF)Zr = N'Bu is used as the catalyst precursor in the metathesis reaction between PhCH = NPh and p-TolCH = N-p-Tol , a <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> equilibrium mixture with the two mixed imines p-TolCH = NPh and PhCH = N-p-Tol is generated in C6D6 at <nUm> ° C . the catalyst was still active after <nUm> days with an estimated <nUm> turnovers ( t(1 / <nUm> ) <nUm> m ; TON = <nUm> h-1 ) . when the azametallacyclobutene Cp2Zr(N(Tol)C(Ph) = C(Ph) ) is used as the catalyst precursor under similar reaction conditions , a total of <nUm> turnovers are obtained after <nUm> days ( t(1 / <nUm> ) <nUm> m ; TON = <nUm> h-1 ) . an extensive kinetic and equilibrium analysis of the metallacyclobutene- catalyzed metathesis of PhCH = N-p-Tol and p-F-C6H4CH = N-p-F-C6H4 was carded out by monitoring the concentrations of imines and observable metal- containing intermediates over time . numerical integration methods were used to fit these data to a detailed mechanism involving coordinatively unsaturated ( 16-electron ) imido complexes as critical intermediates . examination of the scope of reaction between different organic imines revealed characteristic selectivity that appears to be unique to the zirconium - mediated system . several zirconocene complexes that could generate the catalytically active ' CpCp'Zr = ArN ' ( cp ' = cp or cp* ) species in situ were found to be effective agents in the metathetical exchange between different n-aryl imines . N-Alkyl aldimines were found to be completely unreactive toward metathesis with n-aryl aldimines , and metathesis reactions involving the two n-alkyl imines TolCH = NPr and PhCH = NMe gave slow or erratic results , depending on the catalyst used . metathesis was observed between n-aryl ketimines and n-aryl aldimines , but for n-aryl ketimine substrates , the catalyst resting state consists of zirconocene enamido complexes , generated by the formal C-H activation of the α position of the ketimine substrates .

we report the joint application of ab initio computations and total synthesis to assign the absolute configuration of a new natural product . the expected specific rotations of the (7S,10R)- and (7R,10R)-isomers of pitiamide A in a CCl3H solvent continuum model were determined as + <nUm> and - <nUm> , respectively , by CADPAC calculations of the electric-dipole-magnetic- dipole polarizability tensor . total syntheses of these two stereoisomers of the marine metabolite were achieved by a convergent strategy that utilized evans ' oxazolidinone alkylation , a novel water - accelerated modification of negishi 's zirconocene - catalyzed asymmetric carbometalation as well as an unusual segment condensation via mitsunobu alkylation of a nosyl-activated amide . the experimental optical rotation measurements confirmed the results of the computational optical rotation predictions . on the basis of NMR comparisons , the configuration of pitiamide A was assigned as ( 7R,10R ) . these studies highlight the considerable structural significance of [a](D) data , but , because the optical rotation of the natural product was different from either synthetic diastereomer , our work serves also as an illustration of potential problems with obtaining accurate experimental [a](D) data for natural samples . 






rapid hydrozirconation of alkenes by zirconocene hydrochloride , followed by addition of <nUm> equiv of enone and catalytic amounts of Cu (I) salts , led to the corresponding 1,4-addition products in moderate to high yields and provided the first protocol for in situ preparation of alkyl cuprates from alkenes . 
the spirocyclic 1,2,7,7a-tetrahydrocycloprop-[1,2-c]indol-4-one subunit of CC - <nUm> and duocarmycin A , which comprises the common pharmacophore of the two antibiotics , has been efficiently synthesized in six steps from readily available starting materials . the key step of the synthesis utilizes a zirconocene - stabilized benzyne complex .

(Butadiene)zirconocene ( 4 ) was reacted with <nUm> mol equiv of pivalonitrile to give the nine - membered metallacyclic product <nUm> . 1,4-Selective coupling of butadiene with the two nitrile functionalities was achieved at the zirconocene template . subsequent hydrolytic cleavage ( H2O / THF ) gave (3Z,5E,7Z)-3,8-diamino-2,2,9,9-tetramethyldeca-3,5,7-triene ( 13 ) . the stable conjugated primary enamine <nUm> was isolated in <nUm> % yield . it was characterized by an x-ray crystal structure analysis . compound <nUm> crystallizes in space group pbca with cell parameters a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , rw = <nUm> . analogously , coupling of two 4-methylbenzonitrile molecules with butadiene at the zirconocene template followed by hydrolysis yielded l,6-diamino-1,6-di-p-tolyl-1,3,5-hexatriene ( 6b ) . compound 6b crystallizes in space group P21 / a with cell parameters a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , rw = <nUm> . both primary enamines contain planar conjugated polyene frameworks with alternating carbon-carbon double and single bonds . the geometries at the sp2-CNH2 groups of the stable conjugated primary enamines 6b and <nUm> are very similar as observed in aromatic amines . it was shown by ab initio calculation of suitable model systems on the MP2 / <nUm> – 31+G* / / <nUm> – 31+G* level that the conjugated tail - to - tail connection of two CH-C(NH2)H primary enamine moieties results in an unfavorable repulsive electron interaction which may become effectively compensated when the conjugated system separating the H2N substituents is sufficiently extended as is the case in the frameworks found in <nUm> or <nUm> . therefore , some development of the chemistry of stable , isolable primary enamines may be based on suitably substituted 1,6-diamino-1,3,5-hexatriene systems which will be easily available by our novel template synthesis . 
(+-)-N2-(Benzenesulfonyl)-CPI ( 16 ) , the protected a-unit of CC - <nUm> , was synthesized in <nUm> steps from <nUm> with an overall yield of <nUm> % . the two pyrrole moieties in <nUm> were obtained by a zirconocene and a Pd (0)-initiated cyclization . it should be stressed that in the first cyclization a iodinated benzene moiety 7a is obtained with the iodine at the correct position as needed for the following heck reaction . also , the nitrogen at C-5 was introduced completely regioselectively . thus , the described synthesis represents an excellent entry to the racemic CPI unit . however , also the enantiopure CPI unit may be synthesized by this route , since boger et al.8 have shown that <nUm> can be resolved after cleavage of the n-benzenesulfonyl group and formation of a BOC amide .

Bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium(IV) complexes , Cp2ZrH2(1) and Cp2Zr(0-i-Pr)2(4) , in the presence of an appropriate hydrogen acceptor such as benzaldehyde or cyclohexanone catalyze the oppenauer - type oxidation of allylic alcohols to a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds . for instance , primary allylic terpenoid alcohols , geraniol and nerol , were oxidized to a- and 0-citrals , which are essential compounds in the perfumery industry , in substantial yields without any treatment . similarly , secondary allylic alcohols such as 3-hexen-2-ol and 2-cyclohexen-l-ol were also oxidized with ease to give 3-hexen-2-one and 2-cyclohexen-l-one in <nUm> % and <nUm> % yields , respectively . but the present OPP - type oxidation by zirconocene complexes is ineffective for propargylic alcohols . 
group IVA metallocene complexes such as bis(n5-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dihydrides , Cp2ZrH2 ( 1 ) , and hafnium dihydrides , Cp2HfH2 ( 8 ) , catalyze the chemoselective reduction of polycarbonyl compounds to hydroxy carbonyl compounds . for instance , the reduction of keto aldehydes 3-ketobutanal ( <nUm> g ) and 2-phenyl-2-ketoethanal ( <nUm> h ) proceeded selectively at aldehyde group to provide the corresponding hydroxy ketones <nUm> g and <nUm> h in <nUm> % and <nUm> % yields , respectively . under similar conditions , however , cyclohexanediones were easily aromatized to benzenediols . on the other hand , <nUm> and <nUm> also catalyze the selective 1,2-reduction of various types of a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds , giving the corresponding allylic alcohols in good to excellent yields . thus , steroidal dicarbonyl compounds , having an enone framework in their molecules d4-androstene-3,17-dione ( 11a ) and d4-progestene-3,20-dione ( 11b ) were reduced by <nUm> to 17-hydroxy-D4-androsten-3-one ( 12a ) and 20-hydroxy-D4-progest-3-one ( 12b ) , which are essential human hormones , in <nUm> % and <nUm> % yields , respectively .

A one - pot method for the transformation of an aryl bromide , an internal alkyne , and sulfur dichloride into a polysubstituted benzothiophene , in high yield , is described . the method involves the generation and trapping of a zirconocene complex of a substituted benzyne . 
the reaction of Cp2Zr(CH <nUm> CH2R <nUm> )2 with a monosubstituted terminal alkene ( H <nUm> C = CHR <nUm> ) can produce , in a highly regio- and diastereoselective manner , zirconacyclopentane derivatives ; the trans-3,4-disubstituted derivatives may be formed to the extents of > <nUm> % in cases where both r <nUm> and r <nUm> are alkyl , while the trans-2-aryl-4-alkyl derivatives may be formed to the extents of > <nUm> % in the coupling between a monoalkyl-substituted olefin and styrene or its derivative . 
chiral tricyclic lactam ( 5 ) was sequentionally metalated ( LDA or LDA / zirconocene halides ) and alkylated to give quaternary alkylation products ( 8 ) in 6-54 : <nUm> diastereomeric ratio . reduction and hydrolysis furnish the title compound in three steps with > <nUm> % enantiomeric purity . 
under the influence of zirconocene complex , Cp2ZrH2(1) or Cp2Zr(0-i-Pr)2(9) , cycloalkanones <nUm> condensed directly with aliphatic aldehydes <nUm> or primary alcohols <nUm> to form 2-alkylidenecycloalkanones <nUm> or 2-alkyl-2-cycloalken-l-ones <nUm> , respectively , in fair to substantial yields . the selectivity of the cross-condensations was slightly improved by using <nUm> in combination with a metal salt such as Cl2Ni . dihydrojasmone ( 13 ) was synthesized in <nUm> % yield by one - step reaction from the commercially available 3-methylcyclopentanone ( 2e ) with pentanol ( 7b ) in the presence of <nUm> and Cl2Ni .

two one - pot multicomponent synthetic methods for highly substituted indenes are described . the intermolecular coupling of aromatic ketones with alkynes on low - valent zirconocene species generates oxazirconacyclopentenes , which upon hydrolysis with <nUm> % ClH for <nUm> h afforded indene derivatives in good to excellent yields . similarly , the pair - selective coupling of two identical or different alkynes bearing at least one aromatic substituent formed zirconacyclopentadienes . quenching of the reaction mixture with concentrated H2O4S also results in the formation of highly substituted indenes in high yields . 
three different components involving alkynes , ethylene , and aldehydes were selectively integrated in a one - pot procedure to afford homoallyl ketones in good yields , via an effective combination of zirconocene - mediated C-C bond forming reactions and lewis acid mediated organic transformation . mechanistic studies revealed that a formal oppenauer oxidation of seven - membered oxazirconacycles , generated in situ from the reactions of zirconacyclopentenes and aldehydes , was promoted by lewis acid-aldehyde adducts . As a whole , the first aldehyde was incorporated into the product and the second aldehyde was reduced to an alcohol . multiply deuterated homoallyl ketones could be readily prepared in high yields with more than <nUm> % deuterium incorporation by using this method . 
( chemical equation presented ) o-Alkenyl or alkynyl benzylzirconocene intermediate , which was readily generated by the reaction of 2-alkoxymethyl-styrene or 2-alkoxymethyl-1-(trimethylsilylethynyl)-benzene derivative with zirconocene - butene complex ( negishi reagent , " cp 2Zr " ) , reacted with allyl or propargyl halides in the presence of a catalytic amount of ClCu to give allylation or allenylation products . conversion to dane 's diene , which is a key intermediate for estrone synthesis , was efficiently carried out by enyne olefin metathesis of the allylation products . 
( chemical equation presented ) In the presence of CCuN , reaction of g,g-dialkoxyallylic zirconium species <nUm> , generated in situ by treating triethyl orthoacrylate with zirconocene - butene complex , with allylic and propargylic phosphates proceeded at the a-position of <nUm> in a highly SN2' - selective manner to give the corresponding 5-alkenoates and 4,5-alkadienoates , respectively . In the present Cu (I) - mediated coupling reaction , the g,g-dialkoxyallylic zirconium species <nUm> serves as a synthetically useful homoenolate anion equivalent of propionate . 
the combination of zirconocene - mediated coupling of silylated alkynes with a protonation - desilylation or bromination - desilylation process afforded otherwise unavailable butadiene derivatives . when (E,E)-2,3-dialkyl-1,4- bis(trimethylsilyl)-1,3-butadienes were treated with <nUm> equiv of br2 in CCl2H2 , (E)-2,3-dialkyl-1,1,4,4-tetrabromo-2-butenes were obtained in excellent yields with perfect stereoselectivity . 
the reaction of ene - imine with cp <nUm> ZrBu <nUm> was carried out . when a crude imine , which was prepared from ene - aldehyde and primary amine in the presence of MgOS <nUm> , was treated with cp <nUm> ZrBu <nUm> at room temperature overnight , cyclopentane derivative having trans-substituents was obtained in high yield along with a small amount of cyclopentane derivative having cis-substituents . presumably , cis-zirconacycle is a thermodynamic product . reactions using various ene - imines were carried out . In the case of ene - imine prepared from ene - aldehyde and t BuNH <nUm> , only cyclopentane having cis-substituents was produced . In this reaction , chiral amine was used , and diastereoselective cyclization of ene - imine was carried out . As a result , cyclopentane derivative having cis-substituents was obtained in an optically active form after hydrogenolysis of the cyclized compound . 
A novel method for preparation of allylic zirconium reagents directly from 1-alkenes via zirconoceneolefin complex has been developed . selective transfer of the hydride of zirconocene allyl hydride complex , a tautomer of zirconocene - olefin complex , to diisopropyl ketone generates the corresponding zirconocene alkoxide allyl . the allylic zirconium reagents formed effects stereoselective allylation of aldehyde at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> ° C to provide syn- and anti-homoallyl alcohols , respectively . the anti-isomer is formed via a six - membered chair transition state under kinetic control . the syn-selectivity can be rationalized by considering isomerization of the anti-adduct by a retroallylation process . 
reactions of o-(alkoxymethyl)styrene derivatives with a stoichiometric amount of zirconocenebutene complex ( zirconocene equivalent , " cp 2Zr " ) brought about an insertion of the zirconocene species into a benzylic carbon-oxygen bond . the oxidative insertion of Cp2Zr to the benzylic carbon-oxygen bond is a result of sequential reactions : ( i ) formation of zirconacyclopropane by the ligand exchange with o-(alkoxymethyl)styrene , ( ii ) elimination of the alkoxy group through an aromatic conjugate system giving metalated o-quinodimethane species , and ( iii ) transfer of zirconium metal to the benzylic position . through use of a catalytic amount of " Cp2Zr " , however , unprecedented homo-coupling reactions ( dimerization ) of o-(alkoxymethyl)styrene derivatives occurred to give a tetracyclic compound . on the other hand , reactions of o-(1-alkoxyisopropyl) styrene derivatives gave rise to the analogous tetracyclic compounds regardless of the amount of " Cp2Zr " ( stoichiometric or catalytic ) . heterocoupling product between o-(1-alkoxyisopropyl)styrene and styrene congeners was obtained in high cis stereo- and regioselectivity by treating o-(1-alkoxyisopropyl)styrene derivatives with " Cp2Zr " in the presence of an excess amount of styrene derivatives . 
D-Arabinose and d-glucose are transformed into the identical vinyl furanoside , whose role is to serve as the precursor to enantiopure cyclooctadienone <nUm> . the key steps of this relay involve a zirconocene - promoted ring contraction and [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement of an enynol . subsequently defined are convenient synthetic routes to several cyclooctane-1,2,3-triols , 1,2,3,4,5-pentaols , and structurally related glycomimetics . 
multi-substituted pentacenes , such as 1,2,3,4,6,8,9,10,11,13- decasubstituted pentacenes ( type I ) , 1,2,3,4,6,-13-hexasubstituted pentacenes ( type II ) , 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted pentacenes ( type III ) , and 2,3-disubstituted pentacenes ( type IV ) , 1,2,3,4,6,11-hexasubstituted naphthacenes ( type V ) , 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted naphthacenes ( type VI ) , and 2,3-disubstituted naphthacenes ( type VII ) , were prepared by a homologation method . the homologation method involved the conversion of phthalic acid ester derivatives to two ring extended phthalic acid ester derivatives via diynes and metallacyclopentadienes using transition metals , such as Zr and Rh . for the formation of pentacenes of type III and type IV and naphthacenes of type VII , trimethylsilyl-substituted diynes were used for zirconocene - mediated cyclization . elimination of the trimethylsilyl groups after the cyclization afforded nonsubstituted position on pentacenes or naphthacenes . structures of 1,4,6,8,9,10,11,13-octaethyl-2,3-bis(methoxycarbonyl)pentacene ( 9a ) and 8,9,10,11-tetraethyl-2,3-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-1,4,6,13-tetrapropylpentacene ( 9b ) were determined by x-ray analysis . the structure of 9a had the herringbone packing system in the crystal like nonsubstituted pentacene . however , 9b , whose substituents at 1,4,6,13-positions were changed from et to Pr at 1,4,6,13-positions of 9a , had the face parallel plane system in the crystal . 
we report herein the total synthesis of the corynanthe alkaloid dihydrocorynantheol and the formal syntheses of the indole alkaloids tacamonine , rhynchophylline , and hirsutine . the strategies for assembling the corynanthe and tacaman skeletal frameworks comprised of both the classical ABD → ABCD and ABC → ABCD approaches wherein the variously substituted piperidinone d-rings were formed via ring - closing metathesis ( RCM ) followed by a 1,4-addition to introduce the requisite side chain at C(15) . since 1,4-additions to a,b-unsaturated lactams represent an underdeveloped field , we conducted a series of studies with two unsaturated lactams employing organocuprates and metal enolates as the nucleophiles . these studies revealed that organocuprates derived from grignard reagents and either stoichiometric amounts of CCuN or catalytic amounts of CuBr*DMS complex are excellent nucleophiles for such additions ; TMSC1 was a crucial additive for optimizing these reactions . the anion derived from ethyl 1,3-dithiolane-2-carboxylate was also an excellent nucleophile in these 1,4-additions , although the stereochemistry of such 1,4-additions to carboline - derived , unsaturated lactams was sensitive to substitution on the indole nitrogen atom . the ABD → ABCD approach to these alkaloids featured a novel one - pot sequence of an RCM reaction and a zirconocene - catalyzed carbomagnesation followed by a second RCM to generate the d - ring . 
( chemical equation presented ) alkenylphosphines with various substituents were prepared by the reaction of an alkenylzirconocene with a chlorophosphine . reactions of ( a-unsubstituted alkenyl)zirconocenes with ph <nUm> ClP or PhPCl <nUm> gave the corresponding alkenylphosphines in good yields . on the other hand , direct reactions of ( a-unsubstituted alkenyl)zirconocenes with i Pr <nUm> ClP did not proceed . analogously , ( a-substituted alkenyl)zirconocenes did not react with chlorophosphines directly . however , these reactions proceeded in the presence of ClCu affording the corresponding alkenylphosphines as ClCu complexes . treatment of the copper complexes with Na <nUm> ( dtc ) ( dtc = N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate ) or Na <nUm> ( edta ) liberated free alkenylphosphines from the copper centers . the overall protocol could be applicable to preparation of a variety of alkenylphosphines from alkynes via alkenylzirconocene species . 
( figure presented ) A synthetic approach to synthesize EDOT and EDOS from a common precursor <nUm> is reported . the method involves zirconocene dichloride mediated reaction of a common diyne <nUm> followed by treatment with disulfur dichloride ( ClS ) and in situ prepared selenium dichloride ( Cl2Se ) . the higher lability of a-trimethylsilyl group in EDOS compared to EDOT is explained using DFT calculations . 
large , soluble polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) have been synthesized using Zr - mediated and stille - type biphenylation reactions . both the Zr and stille methodologies have been adopted to incorporate tert-butyl substituents , permitting the direct synthesis of alkylated PAHs that are much more soluble than their unsubstituted analogues . to demonstrate the utility of these methods and the importance of solubilizing functionality , several large PAHs were synthesized and crystallographically characterized . the scope of the Zr - mediated and stille methodologies is shown to be complementary . the stille methodology often gives higher yields but is ineffective for the introduction of strain and failed with some polybrominated arenes . In these difficult cases , the zirconium methodology is effective , albeit in low yields . 
( chemical equation presented ) an enantiodivergent strategy for the total chemical synthesis of both naturally occurring (+)-fomannosin ( 1 ) and its (-)-antipode ( ent-1 ) from a-D-glucose has been developed and successfully implemented . the key steps in the overall pathway include the following : ( i ) application of the zirconocene - mediated ring contraction of vinyl furanosides for the construction of highly substituted cyclobutanols ; ( ii ) the use of ring - closing metathesis to form the pendant five - membered ring ; ( iii ) making recourse to a monothio malonic ester to allow for chemoselective reduction to sensitive lactone intermediate <nUm> ; ( iv ) hydroxyl-directed dihydroxylation with O4Os to generate <nUm> ; and ( v ) sequential elimination via a cyclic sulfite and a cyclobutyl triflate . the bridge between the enantiomeric series consisted of a six - step linkup involving the structural modification of <nUm> so as to generate ent-30b . optical activity was fully preserved throughout . 
( chemical equation presented ) A new and diastereoselective method for the synthesis of the estrone skeleton from a substituted styrene based on sequential 3-fold use of Cp2ZrBu2 ( oxidative addition - alkylation and two cyclization - alkylation sequences ) and a ruthenium complex catalyzed RC - metathesis of a sterically hindered diene was developed . the prepared estratetraene was obtained in <nUm> steps from a commercially available starting material and thus the overall synthesis of estrone could be accomplished in <nUm> steps . moreover , we have also found that the course of the reaction of substrates bearing the 2-halo-1,7-diene moiety with Cp2ZrBu <nUm> , i.e. , cyclization or oxidative addition to the C-X bond , could be controlled by the nature of the halogen leaving group .

reactions of vinylcyclopropane derivatives with a zirconocene-1-butene complex ( " Cp2Zr " ) caused regioselective cleavage of the cyclopropyl bond to give e3 p-allylic and / or e1 s-allylic complexes . the regioselectivity of the bond cleavage and the formation of a e3 p-allylic or e1 s-allylic complex depend on the bulkiness of the substituents on the cyclopropyl group and the presence of leaving functionality . A catalytic use of " Cp2Zr " in the presence of excess grignard reagent also caused a ring opening of the vinylcyclopropane derivatives with the same sense of regiochemical selectivity . the reaction of the thermally equilibrated " Cp2Zr " -propenylcyclopropane complex with acetone indicated the possibility for the synthesis of the steroidal side chain in either natural or unnatural forms . the synthetic utility of the present mCp2Zr " -vinylcyclopropane chemistry was ascertained by the stereocontrolled preparation of the C-20 , C-24 dimethylated steroidal side chain which is identical to the active metabolite of vitamin D2 . 
imine complexes of zirconocene , generated by a b-hydrogen abstraction process , which possess a carbon-carbon multiple bond , undergo inter- or intramolecular carbometalation to afford 1,4-cyclohexanediamine or cycloalkylaniline derivatives depending on the relative position of the unsaturated moiety with respect to the imine complex . A new diastereoselective synthesis of azetidines has been developed by treatment of azazirconacyclopentanes with iodine . 
the aldol condensations of a- and b-(benzyloxy) aldehydes with enol silanes , catalyzed by Cp2Zr(OTf)2THF or Cp2Zr(OTf)2 , in a variety of solvents were studied . the simple diastereoselectivity of these reactions is modest and comparable to that observed using simple aldehydes of similar steric requirements . studies have revealed that TMSOTf is directly produced on reaction with the zirconocene catalyst with the enol silane in nitroalkane solvent or is formed during catalysis in dichloromethane solution . although TMSOTf is known to catalyze cross-aldol reactions under these conditions , the rate of this process is not always competitive with that observed using the zirconocene catalysts . In particular , sterically unhindered or aromatic aldehydes react via a mechanism that appears to be mainly Zr - catalyzed , based on both the difference in rate between zr- and Si - mediated reactions as well as differences in enol silane / silyl triflate reactivity in crossover - type experiments . with sterically hindered aldehydes in dichloromethane or nitromethane , catalysis is mediated by Si . the Zr - catalyzed process occurs via formation of a Zr - aldolate complex from aldehyde and enol silane , with liberation of TMSOTf , followed by rate - limiting o-silylation of the metal aldolate by TMSOTf , as revealed by both model studies and in situ monitoring during catalysis . 
zirconocene - coupling reactions of 6,6'-bis[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]-2,2'-bipyridine and 5,5'-bis[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]-2,2'-bipyridine give trimeric , zirconocene - containing macrocycles ( <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ) in high yield . molecules of <nUm> in the solid state are chiral about their crystallographic C2 axis of symmetry , with each bipyridine unit in an anti conformation . compound <nUm> exists in solution as a mixture of diastereomers ( with D3 and C2 symmetries ) that could not be distinguished in the solid state by x-ray crystallography . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> are cleanly converted to the corresponding l,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)butadiene derivatives <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively , via demetalation with acetic acid . the latter cyclophanes are less conformationally rigid , as determined by variable - temperature NMR experiments .

we have developed a highly convergent synthesis of the manumycin - type m- C7N-antibiotic nisamycin that is applicable to other members of this family of antibiotics . the synthesis features a three - step sequence to the epoxyquinol core that serves as a scaffold for the attachment of the polyene side chains . the eastern polyene side chain was constructed via a novel organozirconocene - mediated synthesis . zirconocene methodology was also applied to the synthesis of the polyene side chains of asukamycin . the southern side chain of nisamycin was introduced via a stille reaction that employed a vinyl bromo ketone , derived from an acid - sensitive bromo ketal . Pd - mediated coupling of the vinyl bromide with a stannyl TIPS ester gave TIPS - protected nisamycin that was readily converted to the natural product . 
the relative energetic stability of the " rac " and the " meso " rotational isomers of metallocene - based ziegler - natta ( ZN ) catalysts plays an important role in determining the structural , physical and chemical properties of synthesized polymers . due to the large molecular size of these systems , ab initio calculations are often prohibitive . to circumvent this problem , we use the QM - pot approach , which treats the metal center and its surrounding atoms / ligands by quantum mechanics ( QM ) , whereas the ( organic ) atoms / functional groups away from the metal center are described by an interatomic potential function ( pot ) . As a concrete example , we choose a commercially important zirconocene - based catalyst and compute : ( 1 ) the relative energies of the rac and meso structures ; ( 2 ) the activation barrier for the rotational transition from one to the other ; and ( 3 ) the effect of the addition of organic functional groups on the above energies . due to small mismatches between QM and pot potential surfaces , one has to be careful in defining the QM cluster . In particular , larger QM clusters do not necessarily yield better results . despite these difficulties , we show that it is possible to define a cluster for which the hybrid approach yields meaningful results when compared to full QM calculations . 
A bridged d0 zirconocene dichloride is reported as a first group <nUm> metal complex possessing rare long - lived ligand - to - metal charge transfer ( LMCT ) excited states with high emission yields and excited - state lifetimes in fluid solutions ( e.g. , PhLUM = <nUm> and τ = <nUm> ms in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at <nUm> ° C ) . the basic emission parameters PhLUM and τ are shown to be extremely solvent - dependent in fluids at room temperature . the first principle dependences of LMCT emission parameters on solvent properties are revealed with use of the target complex . for fluid solutions , the linear correlation between PhLUM and τ is reported , thus suggesting that a solvent determines the rate constant for nonradiative decay , knr . 
we propose routes for the catalytic cycle and possible termination reactions for the polymerization of ethylene with cationic chromium complexes of the type [CpCr(L)R] + which contain donor ligands with phosphorus or nitrogen ( L = PR <nUm> or NR <nUm> ) . we confirm the rate - determining character of the insertion of ethylene into the chromium - alkyl bond . contrary to the situation with late transition metals , the resulting agostic isomers will readily isomerize . the termination of the polymerization reaction by b-hydrogen elimination to the chromium center and subsequent dissociation of the resulting olefin is found to require about <nUm> kcal / mol and to be thermodynamically much less feasible than the alternative termination process by b-hydrogen transfer to a monomer . the latter process involves spin change ; two minimum - energy crossing points as well as further transition states and intermediates have been identified . our calculations predict that adduct formation with the polymerization additive 9-BBN should be feasible both from a cp - quinoline - based chromium catalyst and a zirconocene catalyst . however , only the latter undergoes exergonic chain transfer , which is in accordance with the experimentally observed formation of ultrahigh m W polyethylene when using 9-BBN as polymerization additive in combination with Cr catalysts . for the first time , quantum dynamics simulations of such open - shell systems have been performed , which give a lifetime of the Cr - alkyl complex with regard to ethylene insertion of only <nUm> fs . the simulations indicate that the dissociation of ethylene from the chromium center should be relatively insignificant compared to migratory insertion . 
some metallocene methyl cations made of zirconium , that have been used as catalysts in polymerization of ethylene , were studied by means of the conceptual density functional theory ( DFT ) . up to now , catalytic activity , a pure experimental parameter , that measures the kilograms of polyethylene produced per gram of metallocene , per time unit , per temperature unit , and per pressure unit , has been mainly explained in terms of steric hindrance at least qualitatively , meaning that a catalyst having a higher steric hindrance will present a lower catalytic activity . however , there has not been a satisfactory explanation for those few cases in which the steric effect can not be linked with the catalytic activity , thus meaning that the electronic inductive effect predominates over the steric effect . As a consequence , the electronic inductive effect must be quantified through the use of a proper descriptor based on quantum chemical calculations and , in addition , this descriptor should be able to explain high values of catalytic activities even when the steric effect seems to play an unfavorable role . this work has demonstrated that a local reactivity descriptor called local hyper - softness coming from the conceptual DFT is a suitable pure theoretical parameter that explains such anomalies in some values of catalytic activity . it is expected that the findings exposed here can help to estimate catalytic activity and lead to a more rational design of new catalysts by means of computational chemistry . 
ethene polymerization with bis(2-dimethylsilyl-indenyl)zirconium(IV) dichloride ( 1 ) / MAO and bis(2-trimethylsilyl-indenyl)zirconium(IV) dichloride ( 2 ) / MAO and ethene-co-1-hexene polymerization with <nUm> / MAO are presented . the end group analysis of homopolymers reveals a pronounced dependence of the termination rate on temperature changes . In combination with the high molecular weights obtained , these results are in accord with theoretical predictions . gel permeation chromatography , fourier transform infrared , and 13C NMR analyses of copolymerization products from <nUm> / MAO as a function of comonomer concentration at two different temperature series denote its tendency to form inhomogeneous polymer blends . thermal analysis and fractionation results of one such blend indicate an inhomogeneity in the enchainment process and the existence of multiple active sites of differing geometry . these indications are further supported by AMBER force field and density functional theory studies of the catalyst precursors and the active site of <nUm> / MAO . for this system , d-agostic interactions for the stabilization of the zirconium cation are favored over b-agostic interactions , which , in contrast to the situation in studies on bis-Cp systems , is a sparsely populated species . the gap in activation enthalphies for b-hydride transfer and elimination is marginalized for these bulky zirconocenes , and conceptually new mechanisms for the isomerization of the vinyl end groups are discussed . further , unexpected activation of the silicon-hydrogen bond within the ligand framework is observed with an activation enthalpy as low as <nUm> kcal / mol . 
cationic zirconocene complexes are active species in ziegler - natta catalysis for olefin polymerization . their structure and metal - ligand bond strength strongly influence their activity . In the present work , the infrared multiphoton dissociation ( IRMPD ) spectrum of mass selected Zr(C 5H5)2(OH)(CH3CN)- cations was obtained in the 300-1500 cm-1 fingerprint range by coupling a fourier - transform ion cyclotron resonance ( FT - ICR ) mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization ( ESI ) source and the infrared free electron laser ( IR - FEL ) at the centre laser infrarouge d'Orsay ( CLIO ) . the experimental efforts are complemented by quantum chemical calculations at the MP2 and B3LYP levels using the 6-311G basis set . vibrational assignments of transitions observed in the IRMPD spectra to modes of the Zr-O-H , C5H <nUm> , and C2H3N moieties are based on comparison to calculated linear absorption spectra . both the experimental data and the calculations provide unprecedented information about structure , metal - ligand bonding , charge distribution , and binding energy of the complex . 
the effect of zirconocenes , used as drugs for various therapeutic applications , on the crystal growth of hydroxyapatite was investigated at sustained supersaturation . all zirconocenes weee found to inhibit crystal growth of hydroxyapatite possibily through adsorption onto the active sites for crystal growth . the kinetics results favored a langmuir - type isotherm , suggesting a high affinity of zirconocene dichloride for hydroxyapatite . 
ethylene ( e ) / propylene ( P ) solution copolymerizations with low propylene ratios were carried out using constrained geometry catalyst , [C5Me4(SiMe2NtBu)]TiMe2 ( CGC ) , and ansa - zirconocene , rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( EBI ) , at 130-150 ° C and <nUm> × <nUm> kPa . ethylene / propylene copolymers with long chain branch ( LCB ) densities from <nUm> to <nUm> carbons per <nUm> <nUm> carbons , molecular weight distributions close to <nUm> , and narrow comonomer composition distributions were synthesized with CGC . broad molecular weight and comonomer composition distributions were found in the EBI copolymers . reactivity ratios showed that CGC was more active for propylene incorporation than EBI . terminal group analysis indicated that more terminal unsaturation occurred with EBI than with CGC . two additional types of terminal unsaturated groups , vinylidene with side group having more than three carbons ( 2VD ) and trans-vinylene ( VE ) , were found with EBI while the terminal vinyl ( V ) and vinylidene with methyl side group ( 1VD ) were determined in both CGC and EBI copolymers . long chain branch structures were formed by the V type macromonomer incorporation . the long chain branching rate constants were also estimated . 
the hydro-oligomerization of cyclopentene in toluene solution using [ethylenebis(e5-indenyl)]-zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) or bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride and methylaluminoxane as catalysts was studied . the crude oligomer mixture obtained using the former catalyst was extracted with hot toluene to provide a fraction consisting predominantly of dimer , trimer , and tetramer . distillation provided trimer of <nUm> % purity . pure tetramer was precipitated from methanol-toluene as a crystalline solid . hydro-oligomerization of cyclopentene with zirconocene dichloride as catalyst provided two tetramers , one of which was identical to that produced using the chiral catalyst . the structure of the trimer , including stereochemistry , was established by total synthesis . these results conclusively demonstrate that the original structure assigned to poly(cyclopentene) is incorrect and that enchainment of cyclopentene occurs predominantly by cis-1,3-insertion . A mechanism for the polymerization of cyclopentene using catalyst <nUm> is discussed . 
the termination processes of zirconocene - MAO olefin polymerization catalyst under high pressure of 100-1500 MP were studied . it was found that the ratios of olefinic polymer ends depend on the reaction pressure , and trans-vinylene groups predominantly form under high pressures . the b-hydrogen transfer to olefin was accelerated under <nUm> MPa in hexene polymerization with (C5H4Me)2ZrCl2 . 
the diastereoselectivity of the cyclization step in the cyclopolymerization of 1,5-hexadiene with homogeneous catalysts based on zirconocene / methylalumoxane systems is investigated through the analysis of the nonbonded interactions on model catalytic sites analogous to those proposed for a-olefin polymerizations . A model which does not include any cyclopentadienyl ring presents a small trans specificity : the minimum energy intermediate brings the formation of trans rings and resembles a cyclohexane chair in which the growing chain occupies a pseudoequatorial position ( trans-chair conformation ) . the addition of two cyclopentadienyl rings to the Zr atom , due to interactions with the growing chain which occupies a pseudoaxial position , disfavors the two most stable cis conformations ( a cis-chair and a cis-boat ) . As a consequence , the model with two cyclopentadienyl rings shows a higher trans specificity than the “ bare ” model . In the presence of two pentamethylcyclopentadienyl rings , the steric interactions of the aromatic ligands tend to disfavor the trans-chair with respect to a cis-twist conformation and the model becomes cis-specific . A good qualitative agreement between the modeling and polymerization results is observed .

substantial transfer of growing polypropyl chains to methylalumoxane and trimethylaluminum occurs with the highly substituted , isospecific zirconocene catalyst Me2Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C5H2)2ZrCl2 / MAO , while little if any such chain transfer is observed for the more open isospecific catalyst Me2Si(2-MeInd)2ZrCl2 / MAO , for aspecific H4C2(Flu)2ZrCl2 / MAO , and for syndiospecific Ph2C(Cp)FluZrCl2 / MAO . propene polymerization with MAO - activated mixtures of Me2Si(2-MeInd)2ZrCl2 and H4C2(Flu)2ZrCl2 gives completely separable mixtures of the isotactic and atactic polymers characteristic for each of the individual catalysts . MAO - activated mixtures of Me2Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C5H2)2ZrCl2 and H4C2(Flu)2ZrCl2 , however , give polypropene mixtures that contain , besides isotactic and atactic polymers , polymer fractions in which isotactic and atactic polypropene chain segments are inseparably linked . while clear evidence for isotactic - syndiotactic stereoblock formation was not obtained , some polymeryl exchange between isospecific and syndiospecific catalyst sites in MAO - activated mixtures of Me2Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C5H2)2ZrCl2 and Ph2C(Cp)-FluZRCl2 is indicated by increased stereoerror frequencies in some fractions of the polymer product mixture obtained by temperature - rising elution fractionation . structural prerequisites for an efficient transfer of growing polymer chains between different types of catalyst centers are discussed . 
the correlation between relative reactivity of the two styrene enantiofaces and geometry of ansa - zirconocene systems has been determined by 13C NMR microstructural analysis of the poly(propylene-co-styrene-ethylene) ( P / S-E ) obtained in the presence of C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocene catalysts . the chemical shifts assignment accomplished by using configurational additivity rules suggests that secondary styrene insertion with C2 - symmetric metallocene occurs with the opposite enantioface with respect to primary propylene insertion . on the contrary the analysis of 13C enriched copolymer obtained in the presence of Cs - symmetric catalyst seems to indicate that the secondary styrene insertion occurs with same enantioface with respect to propylene . this stereochemistry is what one expects for a simple olefin inserting in secondary fashion despite the peculiar behavior of the aromatic monomer toward zirconocene - based catalysts . 
copolymerization of ethylene with 5-vinyl-2-norbornene ( VNB ) using the dicyclopentadienylzirconium dichloride / methylaluminoxane ( zirconocene / MAO ) catalyst system has been shown to occur with regioselective insertion of the endocyclic double bond of VNB into the copolymer chain , leaving the exocyclic vinyl double bond as a pendant unsaturation . the pendant vinyl group in the copolymer can be readily converted to the hydroxy / epoxy group with complete conversion under mild reaction conditions , giving rise to the corresponding functionalized copolymers . the copolymers ( parent and functionalized ) have been characterized using IR , NMR , TGA , DSC , and intrinsic viscosity measurements . 
the influence of the ligand structure of zirconocene polymerization catalysts on the accessibility of the active reaction center was studied by an ab initio hartree - fock method . the variations in the accessibility were elucidated by comparing molecular structures and relative stabilities of <nUm> bridged zirconocene catalysts with <nUm> different bridging units , <nUm> ancillary cp' ligands , and <nUm> ligand substituents . ligand variations gave rise to various steric and electronic effects affecting both the nature and the concentration of active metal centers in the system , such as steric blocking or shielding of the metal center , and stabilization or destabilization of the active cationic species . comparisons to experimental work demonstrated clear correlations between accessibility of the active reaction center and observed polymerization activity . furthermore , interactions between the lewis acidic aluminum centers and lewis basic functionalities were observed . the consequences of such interactions are discussed . 
poly(l-butene) was obtained by polymerization of 1-butene at <nUm> ° C using rac-(dimethyl-silyl)bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( I ) as catalyst and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst . the product was characterized by NMR ( 1H and 13C ) , size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) , and vapor pressure osmometry ( VPO ) . the number - average molecular weight of the polymer was determined as <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> by SEC , VPO , and NMR , respectively . the poly(l-butene) is <nUm> % isotactic and has high regioselectivity ( ca. <nUm> % 1,2-addition ) . both saturated and unsaturated end groups were characterized by NMR . vinylidene and trisubstituted double bonds comprise approximately <nUm> % and <nUm> % , respectively , of the unsaturated end groups with the remainder consisting of vinylene , vinyl , and tetrasubstituted double bonds . n-Butyl and sec-butyl groups constitute the saturated end groups in the approximate ratio <nUm> : <nUm> . there is a slight excess of saturated end groups relative to unsaturated end groups . these results are discussed in terms of a reaction mechanism of initiation and propagation with various chain - transfer reactions ( b-hydride transfers with and without rearrangement , transfer to aluminum , transfer to vinylidene end groups , and b-alkyl transfer ) . 
polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) was conducted with the catalyst systems of rac-Et(Ind)2Zr(CH3)2 / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 , rac-Et(IndH4)2Zr(CH3)2 / ph3CB(C6F5)6 , and rac-Me2Si(Ind)2Zr(CH5)2 / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 . these catalysts only weee found to be inactive . however , the addition of suitable lewis acids like alkylzinc and alkylaluminum compounds gave highly isotactic PMMA . the isotactic pentad [mmmm] in PMMA as well as the propagation rate constant ( kp ) depended significantly upon the zirconocene compounds . both the microstructure ( [mmmm] ) and propagation rate constant ( kp ) increased in the following order : Me2Si(Ind)2 < Et(IndH4)2 < Et(Ind)2 . the microstructure of PMMA was also affected slightly by alkylzinc compounds : C3H5 = CH2 < C2H5 > C4H9 . when the polymerization was initiated by the rac-Et(Ind)2Zr(CH3)2 / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 / Zn(C2H4CH = CH2)2 catalyst system at <nUm> ° C in toluene , the molecular weight of PMMA increased in proportion to the conversion of MMA . the increase of temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C caused a decrease in isotactic pentad content by approximately <nUm> % . the isotactic polymerization of MMA was revealed to proceed by an enantiomorphic site - controlled mechanism . 
ethylene-styrene copolymers have been prepared in the presence of the catalytic system based on [(methyl)(phenyl)methylene(1-cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)]zirconium dichloride , methylalumoxane , and Al(13CH3)3 . end - group analysis shows that in the initiation step the regiospecificity of styrene insertion into the Zr — 13CH3 bonds is prevailingly secondary . 
c2v-symmetric ethylenebis(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) and its C2 - symmetric bis-[9-(1-methyl)fluorenyl] derivative ( 2 ) have been synthesized in good yields using a convenient synthetic route . precursor <nUm> activated with triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( 3 ) catalyzes propylene polymerization with a constant activity of ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) × <nUm> g of PP / ( ( mol of Zr)*[C3H6]*h ) between <nUm> and + <nUm> ° C . the polypropylene is ideally atactic and has the same of ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) × <nUm> . the above system catalyzes ethylene polymerization with a maximum activity of <nUm> × <nUm> g of PE / ( ( mol of Zr)*[C2H4]*h ) at <nUm> ° C which decreases exponentially with an increase of tp . all the polyethylenes produced between <nUm> and + <nUm> ° C have the same of ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) × <nUm> . In contrast , precursor <nUm> catalyzed the formation of anisotactic polypropylene of low stereoregularity . molecular mechanics calculations indicated that substituents on the fluorenyl rings have little effect on both diastereomeric ratios in the synthesis and stereoselectivities in the polymerization . 
we report the stereospecific polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) with single - component cationic zirconocene catalysts . the complexes Me2CCpIndZrMe(thf)+BPh4- ( 1 ) and Me2CCp2-ZrMe(thf)+BPh4- ( 2 ) are active catalysts for the polymerization of MMA , in remarkable contrast to other cationic zirconocenes . while <nUm> yields highly isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) , <nUm> is syndiospecific at low temperatures . this is the first example for a rational control of PMMA microstructure via catalyst symmetry . polymerization kinetics and stereospecificity control in MMA polymerization with <nUm> and <nUm> are discussed . on the basis of the experimental data , a possible polymerization mechanism is proposed . 
A new poly(oxyphenylene) derivative containing a 3-(trialkylammonio)propyl substituent was synthesized via hydroiodinated poly(oxy-2-allyl-6-methyl-1,4-phenylene) followed by quaternization with trialkylamine . poly(oxy-2-allyl-6-methyl-1,4-phenylene) obtained by oxidative polymerization of 2-allyl-6-methylphenol was allowed to react with bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium chloride hydride ( ZrCp2 - ClH ) at room temperature in inert atmosphere in which the allyl group was converted to a terminally zirconocene - substituted propyl group . the activated propyl group can react with I2 to yield the 3-iodopropyl group . the quaternization of the resulting polymer was performed through the menshutkin reaction with a series of trialkylamines to obtain the poly[oxy-2-[3-(trialkylammonio)propyl]-6-methyl-1,4-phenylene iodide ] . the resulting polyammonium salt as an ion exchange resin exhibits higher thermal stability than poly[oxy-2-[(trimethylammonio)methyl]-6-methyl-1,4-phenylene salt ] , e.g. , no decomposition in water below <nUm> ° C for <nUm> h . 
A new monocyclopentadienylamido complex , [ e5:e1-(2,3-Me2 Benz[e]Ind)SiMe2NtBu]TiCl2 ( I ) , was synthesized as catalyst precursor . the studies on the homopolymerization and copolymenzation of 4-methyl-1-pentene ( P ) and ethylene ( e ) were presented , by comparing complex I with other CpA complexes and Cp2M zirconocenes . the complex I , activated with methylaluminoxane , provided an enhanced copolymerization activity , an excellent incorporation of 4-methyl-1-pentene into the polyethylene chain , and an increased copolymer molecular weight . analysis of 13C NMR spectra of polymers , combined with the monomer reactivity ratios and the polymerization results , demonstrated that the regioselectivity of monomer insertion , tacticity , productivity , molecular weights , and polymer microstructure are significantly dependent on the ligand substitution pattern and the metal atom in CpA complexes . the CpA I - derived poly(4-methyl-1-pentene-co-ethylene)s contained a significant amount of regioirregular arrangement of 4-methyl-1-pentene unit , but with no virtually consecutive 4-methyl-1-pentene sequence . In contrast , the [ e5:e1-(Me4C5) SiMe2NtBu]TiCl2 (IV)-derived copolymers revealed the small clustered sequence ( e.g. , EPPE ) but without any regioirregular arrangement of 4-methyl-1-pentene units . the copolymers prepared with [e5:e1-(Flu)SiMe2NtBu] Cl2Ti ( VI ) not only showed quite different microstructure from that based on catalysts I and IV but also manifested the more pronounced tendency to form an alternating distribution of monomers in the polymer chains . furthermore , the VI - derived copolymer contained neither a regioregular insertion of comonomer nor the consecutive 4-methyl-1-pentene sequences . 
A structural analysis of the oriented γ form of isotactic polypropylene ( iPP ) is presented . the x-ray diffraction intensity distribution in the oriented γ form is quantitatively evaluated for the first time . the structural analysis is performed on a new , poorly stereoregular ( [mmmm] = <nUm> % ) polypropylene material , prepared with a novel C2 - symmetric zirconocene based catalytic system , showing elastomeric properties . the sample , initially amorphous , partially crystallizes upon aging . In the oriented crystalline materials , obtained by stretching the aged sample , the crystallites tend to assume a preferred orientation with the chain axes parallel to the draw direction . disorder is present in the structure . for low draw ratios ( less than twice the initial length ) disordered crystalline modifications , very close to the γ form of iPP , are obtained ; increasing the draw ratio , crystalline modifications , closer to the α form of iPP , are observed . the structural disorder occurring in our stretched samples originates from the random succession of bilayers of chains with chains parallel ( like in the α form ) or tilted ≈ <nUm> ° each other ( like in the γ form ) . the results of this analysis are the follows . for the sample stretched at a low draw ratio , ≈ <nUm> % of the bilayers of chains are faced each other like in the γ form so that the fraction of bilayers with chain axes pointing preferentially along the draw direction is on the order of 60-65 % ( the remaining 35-40 % , being oriented with the chain axes tilted ≈ <nUm> ° to the draw direction ) . for the samples stretched at higher draw ratios , the fraction of bilayers facing each other like in the γ form is reduced to 20-30 % , so that only 10-15 % of the bilayers results oriented with the chain axes nearly normal to the draw direction . this is as if , in all cases , the regions of the crystals with chains arranged like in the α form tend to be oriented with the chain axes parallel to the stretching direction rather than tilted ≈ <nUm> ° . A continuum of disordered modifications intermediate between the pure γ and α forms could exist . the possible inclusion in the crystalline domains of stereo defects ( mainly of the kind mrrm ) , which would favor the γ , - like packing situations on the local scale , is discussed . 
In order to gain further insight into dicarbollide - catalyzed ethylene-norbornene polymerization , the behavior of the (e5-C2B9H11)- Zr(NRt2)2(NHEt2) - TIBA catalyst was studied and preliminary compared with that of Me2Si(3-tBuCp)(adamantylamido)- Cl2Zr / MAO ( 2 ) and (e5-C5Me5)- Cl3Zr - MAO ( 3 ) . several ethylene-norbornene copolymerizations were carried out over a wide range of monomer compositions . the resulting polymer products were analyzed by 13C NMR spectroscopy to gain information about the copolymer microstructure . 
rac-[Methylene(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 activated by MAO , employed as catalyst in the ethylene-styrene copolymerization , shows a peculiar behavior . actually , it produces block copolymers , whereas the homogeneous catalytic systems known to copolymerize these monomers preferentially give rise to alternating sequences of ethylene and styrene . the polystyrene blocks are isotactic and show crystallinity , also when their average length is as short as <nUm> units . some evidence suggests the primary styrene insertion into the metal-carbon bond of the growing chain : this unusual regiochemistry could account for the observed tendency to give homosequences . 
polyethylene and isotactic polypropylene having 1,2- or 1,3-disubstituted cyclopentane structures were prepared by copolymerization of ethylene or propylene with cyclopentene ( CPE ) or 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) using zirconocene catalysts . effect of the cyclopentane structures on the melting point and crystalline structure of the copolymers was investigated . In the case of ethylene-based copolymers , polyethylene containing 1,3-disubstituted cyclopentane structure , poly(ethylene-co-HD) , showed a lower degree of melting - point depression and decreasing crystallinity with increasing cyclopentane contents than polyethylene containing 1,2-disubstituted cyclopentane structure , poly(ethylene-co-CPE) . expansion of crystalline unit cell , especially along the a-axis , with increasing cyclopentane content was observed in the wide - angle x-ray diffraction patterns of the poly(ethylene-co-HD) . the phenomenon indicated incorporation of 1,3-disubstituted cyclopentane structure in the crystalline phase of polyethylene . on the other hand , both poly(propylene-co-CPE) and poly(propylene-co-HD) showed similar profiles in the relationship between the comonomer content and the melting point or the crystallinity of the copolymers . 
lowest energy ligand - to - metal charge - transfer ( LMCT ) transitions of racemic siloxy-substituted ethylene-bridged bis(indenyl) - type zirconocenes reacted with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) were studied using UV / vis spectroscopy in combination with the ab initio hartree - fock method . the LMCT absorptions were recorded at various [Al] / [Zr] ratios , representing dichloride , methylated , and cationic forms of the zirconocenes . the experimental LMCT absorption energies of each intermediate were compared to the calculated energies of the indenyl ligand - based HOMO and the zirconium - based LUMO . the lowest energy LMCT absorptions were directly proportional to the calculated LUMO - HOMO energy gaps . furthermore , the LMCT absorption energies were demonstrated to correlate with ethylene polymerization activity of the siloxy-substituted complexes . this correlation was clarified by a frontier orbital analysis , suggesting that decreasing absorption energy is related to the feasibility of the activation of the catalyst . 
density functional ( DFT ) calculations were carried out on the B3LYP level of theory on bridged and unbridged cationic zirconocene complexes to clarify why unbridged [Zr(Cp)2(Me)(thf)][BPh4] is not active in the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) , whereas [Zr{(Cp)2CMe2}(Me)(thf)][BPh4] polymerizes MMA readily , as we showed experimentally . it is shown , that the initial step of the polymerization - the transfer of the metallocene bound methyl group to the first MMA molecule-is endothermic for [Zr(Cp)2(Me)(MMA)]+ but exothermic for [Zr{(Cp)2CMe2}(Me)(MMA)]+ . furthermore - and more important - the activation energy is higher for the reaction of the unbridged compound compared to the activation energy of the bridged compound . from these results and an estimation of the rate constants it follows that in the temperature range investigated experimentally ( <nUm> to + <nUm> ° C ) either the endothermic product is not formed at all and / or the reversed reaction to the reactant is much faster than the reaction with the next MMA molecule . these results are confirmed by the inclusion of solvent effects by the CPCM solvation model ( also known as COSMO ) . alternative reaction paths for both cations were also investigated and found to be energetically much less favorable . 
an investigation of the ethylene polymerization with meso ansa metallocenes of group <nUm> allows clarifying some aspects of the branching formation observed in the polyethylene produced with these catalysts . the meso structure of the zirconocene precursor is more effective in promoting the chain growing isomerization when indenyl ligands bear no substituents . but the same coordinating neighborhood when surrounding the Ti(IV) or Hf(IV) ion gives rise to complexes not effective in the ethyl-branched polyethylene synthesis . on the other hand , several activators in combination with meso-ethylenebis(1-indenyl)Zr(CH3)2 produce catalysts able to polymerize ethylene to ethyl-branched polyethylene . No difference has been detected in the amount of branches with respect to that observed with MAO - activated meso-ethylenebis(1-indenyl)ZrCl2 . 
recently , an asymmetric ansa - zirconocene dichloride complex that is able to introduce single stereoerrors into an isotactic polypropene chain as a function of monomer concentration is described . though , one major requirement for the practical application of such new materials is a molecular weight high enough to ensure satisfying tensile and creep properties below and above room temperature . this paper reports on a series of new asymmetric zirconocene dimethyl , hafnocene dichloride , and hafnocene dimethyl complexes for the homopolymerization of propene in toluene solution and in liquid monomer after MAO and borate activation . 
stereoregular PPs having a hydroxyl group at the side chain were easily synthesized . the method employed is the stereospecific propene polymerization by zirconocene dichlorides-[Ph <nUm> C][B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] combined with ODIBA , in place of usual trialkylaluminum , followed by quenching with O <nUm> . 
ethene homopolymerization and copolymerization in toluene solution with varying amounts of 1-hexene were catalyzed by the methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) activated zirconocene catalysts (1,2,4-Me3-Cp)2ZrCl2 and (Me5Cp)2ZrCl2 and a mixture of these two in a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio . the dual site catalyst ( <nUm> : <nUm> mixture ) has a homo- and copolymerization activity intermediate between the individual catalysts . deviations from the expected average behaviour taking into account the ca. 6-fold higher <nUm> h yield of (1,2,4-Me3Cp)2 Cl2Zr are observed . the dual site system results in a copolymer with ca. <nUm> % too low comonomer incorporation . the melting endotherm attributed to (Me5Cp)2ZrCl2 is found to be ca. 30-70 % too high , and the observed molecular weights for the copolymers are higher than expected and even higher than for the two individual catalysts . chain transfer to trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) is found to become less important at high comonomer concentrations concurrent with an increase of the concentration of vinyl and trans-vinylene unsaturations . further , it is noteworthy that with the dual site system it is possible to produce ethene / 1-hexene copolymers with narrow molecular weight distribution as a mixture of chains containing low and high comonomer contents . the observed discrepancies in the mixed system from the average of the (1,2,4-Me3Cp)2ZrCl2 and (Me5Cp)2ZrCl2 catalysts are provisionally explained by chain transfer between the sites coupled with an activity increase of the latter of these sites . 
the copolymerizations of propylene with allyl monomers carrying alcohol or amine were conducted by the rac-dimethylsilylbis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride / methylaluminoxane catalyst system . the allyl monomers were pretreated by alkylaluminum before the polymerization . although the efficiency of the introduction of allyl alcohol - based comonomer was extraordinary low ( <nUm> - <nUm> mol % in polymer ) , the trimethylaluminum - treated allylamine was found to be introduced more effectively ( <nUm> mol % in polymer ) . the 13C NMR study indicated that the position of allylamine unit in the copolymer was influenced by the kind of alkylaluminum used at the polymerization . In the presence of trimethylaluminum , the terminally aminated polypropylene was obtained ( [ amino end polymer ] / [ whole polymer ] = <nUm> ) . In the presence of triisobutylaluminum , however , the allylamine unit is located both on the main chain and at the chain end . the end - aminated polymer was probably obtained due to the formation of dormant species after the insertion of the comonomer followed by the chain transfer to alkylaluminum . 
the activation of 1-siloxy-substituted zirconocene with MAO occurs slowly , in 4-6 h . the slow activation process involves three distinct ligand to metal charge transfer ( LMCT ) band shifts in the UV / vis spectrum before the maximum LMCT absorption energy and intensity of the third appearing band is reached . In addition , at very high MAO concentrations , a fourth band at <nUm> nm begins to form . on the contrary , the corresponding 2-siloxy-substituted as well as the unsubstituted zirconocene react with MAO in less than a minute , immediately producing the final species , as confirmed by only one observed LMCT band shift . the 1-silyl-substituted zirconocene reacts with MAO , producing the final active species in <nUm> h . UV / vis spectroscopic observations were interpreted with the aid of molecular modeling studies , demonstrating that the interactions of the oxygen donor atom of the siloxy substituent with electron deficient Zr center and coordinatively unsaturated Al in MAO play a prominent role in the activation process . 
vinyl chloride monomer ( VCM ) has been employed as a chain transfer agent to yield polyolefins with one vinyl end group per chain ; subsequent incorporation of these macromonomers has resulted in the formation of branched polyolefins . the use of VCM as a comonomer in transition - metal - catalyzed olefin polymerizations results in b-chloride elimination , yielding polymers that contain vinyl end groups and a chlorinated catalyst . through reactivation of the catalyst by advantageous MAO , or other aluminum alkyl , reinitiation of the olefin polymerization can occur ; the combination of elimination and reactivation allows for VCM to behave as a chain transfer agent . the use of VCM as a chain transfer agent results in the exclusive formation of vinyl end groups ( no vinylidene or internal vinyl end groups ) in polyethylenes , both homopolyethylene and copolymers with octene ; in propylene polymerizations , vinyl end groups are formed in addition to vinylidene end groups , the result of b-hydride elimination which occurs even in the absence of VCM . the chain transfer constants for VCM in ethylene polymerizations for a variety of single site catalysts were determined and found to be very similar , with Cs × <nUm> ∼ <nUm> ; for a propylene polymerization using a zirconocene catalyst , Cs × <nUm> ∼ <nUm> . it was further observed that the resulting macromonomers formed in the polyethylene polymerizations could be incorporated into the growing polymer chains , resulting in the formation of long chain branches . 
the cationic zirconocene trihydrides [ Cp'4Zr2H (m-H)2]+X- , generated from [Cp'2ZrH2]2 with various trityl salts of weakly coordinating anions , are powerful initiators for the polymerization of isobutene ( IB ) and its copolymerization with isoprene ( IP ) ( cp' = C5H4SiMe3 ) . this study is concerned with the quantification of the effects of the counteranion and of trace moisture on IB / IP copolymers and the nature of the initiating species . polymer molecular weights increase with decreasing anion nucleophilicity in the order x = [B(C6F5)4] ≈ [H2N{B(C6F5)3}2] > [CN{B(C6F5)3}2] . using [Cp'4Zr2H3]- [CN{B(C6F5)3}2]- , high copolymer molecular weights are found ( mw ≈ <nUm> × <nUm> g / mol at <nUm> ° C ) . there is little reduction in either rate or molecular weight on addition of isoprene . polymer molecular weights are substantially higher than with the Et2AlCl / BuCl initiator system under identical conditions . water was shown to be an important chain - transfer agent ; substoichiometric quantities of water reduced activity , and copolymer molecular weights decreased linearly with increasing [H2O] . mechanistic studies suggest that [ Cp'4Zr2H- (m-H)2]+ does not itself act as a cationic initiator but is transformed into one or more other binuclear ( polynuclear ? ) species , accompanied by alkene insertion into the Zr-H bond and a monomer hydrogenation step . tentative structures for these reactive intermediates are suggested . 
methylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride substituted in C(3) , activated by methylalumoxane , is able to give polystyrene and ethylene-styrene copolymers . In this study hydrooligomers , whose structure , determined by 13C NMR and GC-MS techniques , gives information about the regiochemistry and the stereochemistry of styrene insertion , have been purposefully prepared . the regiochemistry of the styrene insertion is related to the encumbrance of substituents in C(3) . rac-[Methylene-(3-R-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 with r = H , CH3 , or C2H5 induces a prevailingly secondary styrene insertion into the zirconium-carbon bond . with increasing the substituent 's steric hindrance ( r = C3H7 ) , regiochemistry inversion occurs and the primary insertion becomes prevailing . the analysis of ethylene-styrene copolymers obtained in the presence of the different catalysts allows confirming the correlation between regiochemistry and comonomers ' reactivity . besides , also the stereospecificity can be evaluated from the structure of the hydrotrimers , when the insertion is primary . whereas the isospecificity in the absence of substituents ( secondary insertion ) and in the presence of the tert-butyl substituent ( primary insertion ) is well - known , a surprising syndiospecificity is observed when the indenyl ligand bears the isopropyl substituent in C(3) . 
copolymerizations of ethylene with 1,3-butadiene in the presence of catalytic systems based on some C2 - symmetric zirconocenes ( rac-[CH2(3-R-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 where r = -C(CH3)3 ( 1 ) , -CH(CH3)2 ( 2 ) , -CH2CH3 ( 3 ) , -CH3 ( 4 ) , and -H ( 5 ) ) are compared . the chemical nature and the relative amount of constitutional comonomer units from butadiene are strongly affected by the bulkiness of the substituent in positions <nUm> and 3' . DFT calculations indicate that the observed dependence of constitutional units from butadiene on the bulkiness of the alkyl ligand substituent can be easily rationalized by the occurrence of an unusual insertion mechanism for butadiene . this mechanism , involving butadiene if primary coordination followed by its primary vinyl insertion , becomes largely predominant for catalytic systems based on the zirconocenes ( 1-4 ) , which present r ≥ CH3 . this kind of butadiene insertion mechanism is also able to account for the high stereoregularity which is observed for adjacent methylene-1,2-cyclopropane units . 
poly(propylene-ran-1,3-butadiene) that contained selectively inserted 1,4-butadiene units was successfully synthesized by ind-1 activated with MAOs . the average amounts of 1,4-BD per polymer chain and thus the average length of propylene units between 1,4-BDs of the copolymer could be controlled by the butadiene concentration in the feed . the copolymers with high molecular weight were converted to a,o-divinyl isotactic PP by ethenolysis . 
the synthesis of a vinyl-terminated , hyperbranched polysilane and the additional hydroboration with bis(pentafluorophenyl) borohydride are reported . quantitative transformation was proved by 1H NMR and FT-IR analysis . the polymeric borane was tested as cocatalyst in the metallocene - catalyzed polymerization of propylene . the corresponding catalyst system comprising rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1- e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconocene dichloride and the polymeric borane was activated in situ in the presence of triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) . polymerizations were performed at temperatures of <nUm> and <nUm> ° C with a propylene concentration of <nUm> mol / L in toluene solution using various cocatalyst : catalyst ratios ( <nUm> : <nUm> , <nUm> : <nUm> , and <nUm> : <nUm> ) . this polymer - supported catalyst system produces polypropylenes with excellent activities and good molecular weights . these results were compared with an additional set of polymerization experiments using molecular dispersed BC18F15 as cocatalyst , resulting in significantly reduced polymerization activities . this indicates a hindered catalyst mobility inside the hyperbranched cocatalyst matrix , leading to a higher concentration of active species within the hyperbranched nanostructure . 
addition of aluminum or zinc alkyls ( AIRs or ZnR2 , r = me or et ) lowers the molar masses of norbornene - ethene ( N / e ) copolymers obtained with the catalyst systems Me2C(Ind)(Cp)ZrCl2 / MAO or rac-C 2H4(2-tBuMe2SiO-Ind) 2ZrCl2 / MAO to different degrees . these chain - shortening effects and changes in relative end - group abundance indicate the degree to which e / N copolymers growing at a Zr catalyst center are transferred to Al or Zn centers by alkyl-polymeryl exchange . increased molar masses of copolymers obtained in the presence of added Al(iBu)3 indicate that this reagent suppresses polymer chain exchange between Zr catalyst centers and methylaluminum species contained in the MAO activator . these observations are interpreted in terms of reversible adduct formation between Al or Zn alkyls and cationic zirconocene alkyl species . 
mechanistic studies of isospecific polymerization of methacrylates by a cationic , chiral ansa - zirconocene ester enolate complex , rac - (EBI)Zr +(THF)[OC(O iPr ) = CMe 2][MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) 3]- [ <nUm> ; EBI = C 2H 4-(Ind)2 ] , are reported . complex <nUm> effects isospecific and living (co)polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) and re-butyl methacrylate ( BMA ) , producing highly isotactic homopolymers and block copolymers with narrow molecular weight distributions and high initiator efficiencies . investigations of statistical copolymerizations of MMA and BMA have yielded monomer reactivity ratios of τ MMA = <nUm> and τ BMA = <nUm> ( the kelen - tudos method ) , indicating that the copolymer formed instantaneously has a somewhat alternating character . studies of MMA polymerization kinetics have shown that propagation is first order in both concentrations of the monomer and the active species . the single MMA addition product , rac - (EBI)ZrMe[OC(OMe) = C(Me)CH 2C(Me <nUm> ) C(O iPr)-O ] ( 3 ) , has been isolated from the reaction between the neutral roc - (EBI)ZrMe[OC(O iPr ) - C(Me) <nUm> ] ( 2 ) and MMA ; however , subsequent MMA additions do not proceed , unless the single addition product is further treated with B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> to generate the eight - membered - ring cyclic ester enolate species , rac - (EBI)Zr +[OC(OMe) = C(Me)CH 2C(Me 2)C(O iPr)-O][MeB-(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - ( 4 ) , which corresponds to the structure of the intermediate for the single MMA addition product of <nUm> . all results presented here are consistent with the conclusion that isospecific polymerization of methacrylates by 1-which models the proposed isospecific propagating species for the methacrylate polymerization by chiral ansa - zirconocene complexes-is enantiomorphic site controlled and proceeds in a monometallic , intramolecular michael addition mechanism . 
A new method to prepare polypropylene-graft-polystyrene copolymers with tailored structure has been developed . the ability of a series of copolymers with variable structure to compatibilize the polypropylene-polystyrene blends was evaluated through microscopic observation of the morphology of the blends . the synthesis is a two - step process , the first one being the preparation , in the presence of ansa - zirconocene - based catalyst , of the backbones formed by i-PP sequences spaced by p-methylstyreneethylene units . In the second step , the methyl groups in the aromatic rings are reacted with sec-butyllithium , and the resulting metalated polymers allowed to add the styrene to initiate the side polystyrene chains growth . this synthesis turns out versatile both in the first step because by changing monomers feed ratio , backbones with different number of the sites of growth of the grafts and with different length of the polypropylene sequences can be obtained , and in the last step because , by tuning styrene concentration and reaction time , the side chains length can be regulated . the PP-g-PS copolymers with PP sequences varying in the range of 24-98 units , with number of the side chains from <nUm> to <nUm> and with PS side chains length from <nUm> × <nUm> to <nUm> × <nUm> units , were obtained and afterward tested as compatibilizers in the PP / PS blends . the morphologies of the blends , analyzed and compared by scanning electron microscopy , suggest that the compatibility of PP / PS blends is improved with increasing either the PP sequences length or the PS side chains length or the number of the side chains in the PP-g-PS copolymer . 
the coordination acrylamide polymerization by the cationic , chiral ansa - zirconocene ester enolate complex was discussed . the features of the polymerization include the high degree of control over polymerization stereochemistry and polymer molecular weight distribution . Poly(N,N- dimethylacrylamide ) ( PDMMA ) with unprecedented isotacticity , high m n , low polydispersity index ( PDI ) and T m as high as <nUm> ° C is synthesized . the efforts are underway to synthesize other types of stereoregular polyacrylamides using this technique . 
A comparative analysis of the structure and mechanical properties of two elastomeric amorphous and semicrystalline polypropylenes samples , produced with c2v-symmetric and chiral C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocene catalysts , respectively , is presented . the poorly isotactic polypropylene ( iam-PP ) of medium molecular weight , prepared with the chiral C 2-symmetric catalyst , slowly crystallizes , by aging at room temperature or by stretching , in a continuum of disordered modifications intermediate between α and γ forms of isotactic polypropylene . structural and morphological transformations occur during stretching . disordered α / γ modifications , containing a high fraction of perpendicular chains , present in the unoriented film , transform by stretching at high deformations into structures more similar to the α form with a high content of parallel chains . the development of the small level of crystallinity induces elastic properties . the small crystalline domains in the amorphous matrix , indeed , act as physical knots of the elastomeric lattice . this poorly isotactic iam-PP sample shows , instead , poor elastic properties and viscous flow at high deformations in the amorphous state , before crystallization , because of the not high molecular weight . the unique crystallization mode of the iam-PP sample explains the remarkable enhancement of elastic properties in low stereoregular polypropylene upon development of crystallinity . the fully amorphous high molecular weight atactic polypropylene ( a-PP ) , prepared with the c2v-symmetric catalyst , presents elastic behavior only in a small deformation range ( up to <nUm> % strain ) and experiences viscous flow of the chains at high deformations . the elasticity arises from the physical network generated by the high degree of entanglement of the polymeric chains generated by the high molecular weight of the sample . the poorly isotactic iam-PP sample , before crystallization , presents much poorer elastic properties than the a-PP sample because of the lower molecular weight . after crystallization , it shows better elastic properties in a large range of deformation with higher strength , notwithstanding the lower molecular weight , due to the presence of crystallinity . 
unbridged zirconocene catalysts , where a seven- or eight - membered ring fused to a cyclopentadiene is associated with a phenyl substituent in position <nUm> ( C7Ph-Zr and C8Ph-Zr ) , were tested , under the same polymerization conditions , to produce polypropenes with microstructure , molecular properties , and thermal behavior similar to those prepared with (IndPh)2ZrCl2 ( w-Zr ) , the " classical " waymouth catalyst . different results were obtained from the homologue titanium catalysts ( C7Ph-Ti and C8Ph-Ti ) and from the titanium benzyl derivative ( C7Bn-Ti ) , which produced quite heterogeneous materials with broad molecular weight and that can be separated into fractions spanning from completely atactic to fractions characterized by the presence of long isotactic blocks . A quite interesting behavior is observed with the zirconium benzyl derivative C7Bn-Zr , which produces good yields of a polymer with narrow polydispersity , which , despite its rather high isotacticity , shows a hardly detectable melting peak and is completely ether soluble . quite surprisingly , the same sample , after prolonged annealing , shows a narrow melting peak at low temperature ( 55-65 ° C ) . this result , together with the x-ray analysis , is in favor of a quite homogeneous material , capable of giving crystallites of small size . 
density functional calculations have been performed on different conformers and isomers of the propyl group in alkyl cations [L2Zr-Pr] - ( L = cp , cp* ; Pr = n-propyl ) , corresponding to two catalysts with different observed rate orders ( n ) for ethylene polymerization , to explore the single - center , two - state kinetic model for olefin polymerization . for L = cp ( n ≈ <nUm> ) , the b-agostic conformer is found to be the most stable structure and also the most reactive with respect to ethylene coordination , which is commensurate with unity rate order . for L = cp* ( n ≈ <nUm> ) , the favored propagation route involves the g- and a-agostic conformations of the alkyl complex , with coordination taking place to an a-agostic conformation in order to minimize the steric hindrance experienced by the incoming ethylene . the barriers to rearrangement from the a- and g-agostic conformers to the more stable b-agostic structure are significantly lower than those of propagation . moreover , no structure was found to be of lower energy than the b-agostic conformation , and the latter thus takes the role of the resting state for both catalysts in the present study . assuming that the single - center , two - state model applies to zirconocene - catalyzed ethylene polymerization , our calculations thus suggest that the corresponding fast and slow , or dormant , states do not originate from equilibria of the alkyl group as investigated here . 
A protocol is described in which zirconocene - catalyzed alkene polymerization reactions are terminated by bromine to give polymers containing brominated end groups , Br - polymeryl . using NMR spectroscopy , the Br - polymeryl groups can be identified as primary or secondary , thus providing information concerning the nature of the Zr - polymeryl linkage ( s ) , and ( via integrations ) quantified , thus giving information about the relative concentration ( s ) of the Zr - polymeryl linkage ( s ) . the procedure can in principle give very useful information concerning the nature and concentrations of Zr - polymeryl groups in existence during polymerization processes and is tested through ethylene polymerization by the Cp2ZrMe2 / B(C6F 5)3 catalyst system and propylene polymerization by the Cp2ZrMe2 / BC18F15 , (indenyl)2 - ZrMe2 / BC6F5 <nUm> , and rac-{C2H4(1-indenyl)2} ZrMe2 / BC18F15 catalyst systems . to this point the resulting data concerning Zr - polymeryl concentrations are generally consistent with data in the literature but are rather more easily obtained . 
A kinetic model based on the coordination - insertion mechanism was developed to characterize metallocene - catalyzed propylene polymerization using two different catalyst systems : rac - Et(Ind) 2ZrCl <nUm> / MAO ( I / MAO ) and rac-Et(4,7-Me 2-1-Ind ) 2ZrCl <nUm> / MAO ( II / MAO ) . slurry propylene polymerizations were performed in a semibatch reactor at <nUm> ° C to investigate the effects of propylene partial pressure and MAO / Zr ratio . the kinetic model accounts for the formation of regioirregularities , the occurrence of chain transfer to trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) , and b-hydride chain transfer to both monomer and metal to predict the effects of propylene partial pressure and the MAO concentration on polymer molecular weight and the formation of isobutyl end groups . A systematic optimization strategy was applied to estimate the kinetic parameters from on - line measurements of the reaction rate and end - of - batch measurements of the molecular weights and percentages of end groups . the formation of <nUm> , 1-insertions was more frequent for catalyst II / MAO ( k s = <nUm> L mol <nUm> s <nUm> vs k s = <nUm> L mol <nUm> s <nUm> for I / MAO ) . the m w of polymer produced with I / MAO decreased at low pressures due to the high rate of monomolecular b-hydride transfer to the metal ( k H = <nUm> s <nUm> ) . chain transfer to TMA was more significant with the catalyst II / MAO ( k Al = <nUm> × <nUm> + <nUm> L mol <nUm> s <nUm> vs k Al = <nUm> × <nUm> + <nUm> L mol <nUm> s <nUm> for I / MAO ) . 
this work studies the mechanism and application of the novel diastereospecific ion - pairing polymerization ( DIPP ) effected by a catalyst system comprising chiral zirconocene bis(ester enolate ) rac-(EBI)-Zr[OC(O iPr ) = CMe <nUm> ] <nUm> [ <nUm> , EBI = C 2H 4(Ind) <nUm> ] and <nUm> equiv of lewis acid A1(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> . the <nUm> / 2Al(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> system effectively promotes DIPP of functionalized alkenes such as methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) , producing polymers having various stereoregularities , including isotactic , syndiotactic , and isotactic-e-syndiotactic multiblock microstructures , depending on the [monomer] / [catalyst] ratio employed . our detailed investigations into the polymerization characteristics and kinetics , elementary reactions , characterization and behavior of the isolated key intermediates , as well as temperature and lewis acid effects have yielded a mechanism for the DIPP of MMA by the l / 2Al(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> system . this mechanism consists of four manifolds - isospecific , syndiospecific , anion - monomer exchange , and chain - transfer domains - and satisfactorily explains the formation of various polymer stereomicrostructures under given conditions . the most significant part of this overall mechanism is for the production of the isotactic-b-syndiotactic stereomultiblock structure , which is made possible by two pathways that can interconvert diastereospecific propagating manifolds : exchange between the coordinated anion and monomer as well as chain transfer . this unique polymerization technique has also been applied to the copolymerization of MMA with methacrylates having longer alkyl chains , leading to functionalized polymeric materials with tunable properties that are controlled by their stereomicrostructures and nature of the comonomer . 
the systematic investigations of the synthesis , thermal properties , and microstructures of isotactic poly(3-methyl-l-butene) ( iP3M1B ) was performed . three C2 methallocene catalysts , namely , (DMSBMPI)ZrCI2 , (DMSBI)ZrCl2 , and (DMSMBI)ZrC12 with MAO , are used for the synthesis of iP3M1B . it was synthesized in a <nUm> mL three - necked glass bottle equipped with a magnetic stirrer . the reaction equipment was evacuated for half an hour and filled with nitrogen before polymerization . the melt - state NMR analysis revealed that sample synthesized with (DMSMBI)ZrCl2 shows a high regiospecificity . melt - state NMR analysis yields important microstructure information for insoluble polymers , similar to that obtained by solution - state NMR analysis , although melt - state NMR analysis suffers from a lower spectral resolution . 
the calculations based on the density functional theory ( DFT ) to investigate the experimental differences observed in the molecular weights of the polymers obtained using different zirconocene catalysts have been performed . geometric structures and gibbs free energy profiles were obtained using the B3LYP hybrid DFT functional and LANL2DZ basis set for all atoms . all calculations were performed using the gaussian03 package , while thermodynamic data were calculated for <nUm> bar ethylene pressure and <nUm> K using standard statistical thermodynamic methods implemented in the gaussian package . it was observed that the silyl-bridged bis-indenyl catalysts containing linear alkyl substituents in the 3-position of the indenyl ligand yield polyethylenes with different molecular weights depending on the alkyl chain length . the corresponding product presents a metallacycle structure and the polymer chain ejected from the catalyst . 
the effect of cyclopentadienyl ring substitution on the immobilization and activation of zirconocenes on supports of type Cl2Mg / AlR n(OEt)3-n has been investigated . comparison of the activity of immobilized zirconocenes (RCp)2ZrCl2 in ethylene polymerization , using simple aluminum alkyls such as AlEt3 or AliBu3 as a cocatalyst , revealed a remarkable effect of the substituent r in the cyclopentadienyl ring . low activity ( < <nUm> kg / mol bar h ) was obtained with r = H or et , but longer alkyl substituents , notably n-Pr or n-Bu , gave more than an order of magnitude increase in activity . zirconocenes with branched substituents ( i-Pr , t-Bu ) were less easily immobilized and gave relatively low activity , while the activities of zirconocenes of composition cp - (RCp)ZrCl2 ( r = n-Pr , n-Bu , n-pentyl ) were intermediate between those of Cp2ZrCl2 and (RCp)2ZrCl2 . experiments carried out under homogeneous conditions with aluminoxane cocatalysts indicated that the effect of cyclopentadienyl ring substitution can be related to differences in the ease of formation of the active species . an inverse relationship between activity and the catalyst loading on the support was found . At a low loading of <nUm> mmol (n-PrCp)2ZrCl2 / g support , an activity greater than <nUm> <nUm> kg / mol bar h was obtained in ethylene polymerization at <nUm> ° C , with AliBu3 as the cocatalyst . the results demonstrate that with certain Cl2Mg - immobilized zirconocenes it is possible to achieve very high polymerization activity without the use of methylaluminoxane or a borate activator , but the strong effect of catalyst loading on activity implies the presence of a relatively low number of active species . 
the mechanism of stereoselectivity in methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) monometallic polymerization promoted by the C1 - symmetric ansa-Me 2C(Cp)(Ind)Zr - based zirconocene , presenting two diastereotopic coordination sites , was investigated within density functional theory . At variance from the case of propene polymerization , our results suggest that MMA addition is stereoselective when the growing chain is in the more hindered as well as in the more open diastereotopic coordination site . In both cases the same enantioface of the enolate bond of the ester enolate growing chain is selected , although selectivity is higher when the growing chain is in the more hindered diastereotopic coordination site . further , there is no substantial energy difference between these two situations , which indicates that the moderate isotacticity of the produced PMMA is consistent with an almost regular chain - migratory mechanism . the different stereoselectivity of the two diastereotopic sites is due to different steric interaction between the growing chain ( chain effect ) or MMA ( monomer effect ) with the indenyl ligand . this decomposition of stereoselectivity into chain and monomer effects is used to reinvestigate the stereoselectivity of strictly related C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocenes . 
A liquid crystalline phase has been discovered in a polyolefin of poly(methylene-1,3-cyclopentane) ( PMCP ) having low molecular weight , which was obtained with cyclization polymerization of 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) using a zirconocene catalyst in the presence of chain transfer reagents . PMCP clearly shows fluidity and birefringence above the glass transition temperature under the ambient conditions . schlieren - like texture , which indicates nematic liquid crystalline phase , has been detected in places . clear diffraction pattern is observed in wide - angle x-ray diffraction analysis below the isotropization temperature . the isotropization temperature decreases with decreasing of molecular weight of the PMCP . PMCP with the higher molecular weight takes the longer time for liquid crystallization from isotropic phase . Non-Newtonian viscosity region in the range of low share rate , which is a characteristic of liquid crystal , has been detected below the isotropization temperature . 
the copolymerization of ethylene with tert-butylethylene ( TBE , 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene ) using various half - titanocene [ cp' TiCl2X ( x = O-2,6-iPr2C6H <nUm> , N = CtBu2 ) ] - cocatalyst systems has been carried out . the aryloxo-containing half - titanocenes , Cp'TiCl 2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) ( cp' = cp* , tBuC5F4 , 1,2,4-Me3C5H2 ) , displayed the capability to bring about TBE incorporation in the presence of MAO as a cocatalyst , while their ketimide analogues , Cp'TiCl2(N = CtBu <nUm> ) ( cp' = cp , cp * , tBUC5H4 ) , could not accomplish TBE enchainment in ethylene / TBE copolymerization . among aryloxo derivatives , those carrying tert-butyl and trimethyl substituents on the cyclopentadienyl moiety , Cp'TiCl2(O-2,6- iPr2C6H3 ) ( cp' = tBuC5H4 , 1,2,4-Me3C 5H2 ) , exhibited efficient TBE incorporation and moderate catalytic activity in the presence of MAO , affording ethylene / TBE copolymers with relatively high molecular weight and uniform molecular weight distribution . however , the copolymerization conducted by employing constrained geometry catalyst ( linked half - titanocene ) , [ Me2Si(C5Me 4)(NtBu)]TiCl2 , and zirconocene [ cp 2ZrCl2]-MAO catalyst systems resulted in polyethylene without TBE incorporation . furthermore , the copolymerization of 1-hexene ( 1-Hex ) with TBE and vinyltrimethylsilane ( VTMS ) , by ( tBuC5F 4OTiC12(O-2,6-iPr2C 6H3 ) and CpTiCi2(N = CtBu <nUm> ) - MAO catalyst systems , indicated a considerably higher reactivity of VTMS . the 1-Hex / VTMS copolymerization has been elucidated to proceed via 1,2-insertion as manifested by the remarkably efficient VTMS enchainment , hence revealing the difference in the reactivity of TBE and VTMS to arise from that in their electronic and / or steric nature . 
poly(methylene-1,3-cyclopentane) ( PMCP ) , which is composed with alternating linkage of methylene and 1,3-cyclopentane unit , was synthesized by cyclization polymerization of 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) with various metallocene catalysts . the optically active PMCP samples were prepared by cyclization polymerization of HD with an optically active zirconocene catalyst , [ (+)-(S,S)-ethylene-1,2- bis(n5-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)- 1,1'-bi-2-naphtholate ] , combined with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as a cocatalyst in the presence of triethylaluminum ( A1Et3 ) as a chain transfer reagent to control the molecular weight in toluene at room temperature . the PMCP samples obtained with the optically active zirconocene catalyst show optical rotation in chloroform solution . the MnS of the PMCP samples were measured by gel - permeation chromatography and relatively calibrated with standard polystyrene samples . the birefringent texture of PMCP with relatively high molecular weight showed the fingerprint texture indicating cholesteric liquid crystal . 
low molecular weight ( ca. <nUm> ) ethylene - 1-butene copolymers were synthesized at <nUm> ° C using rac-(dimethylsilyl)bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( I ) catalyst and methyl-aluminoxane ( MAO ) cocatalyst . comonomer composition , triad sequence distribution , and end groups were analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR . the average polymer molecule contains about one double bond and one saturated end group . the unsaturated end groups were formed almost exclusively by transfer from propagating chains containing 1-butene as the terminal unit . At least <nUm> % of the unsaturated end groups are vinylidene and trisubstituted double bonds , which are present in the approximate ratio <nUm> : <nUm> . saturated end groups result from the initiation process . both ethylene and 1-butene are involved in initiation , but ethylene more than 1-butene . the product is a random copolymer with very short blocks ( no longer than 2-3 monomer units ) of both ethylene and 1-butene . the comonomer sequence distributions determined by 13C NMR were fitted to first - order markovian statistics , which allowed calculation of the monomer reactivity ratios . the results are discussed in terms of a reaction mechanism consisting of initiation , propagation , and chain transfer reactions . 
A molecular mechanics analysis on model metallocene complexes , as possible intermediates for the propene polymerization , in which the two coordination positions available for the monomer and the growing chain are diastereotopic , is presented . the energy difference between the corresponding diastereoisomeric preinsertion intermediates appears to be relevant for the model complexes based on the meso-ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl) ligand ( 1 ) , the isopropylidene[(3-methyl(e5-cyclopen > r tadienyl))(e5-9-fluorenyl) ligand ( 2 ) , and the rac-ethylene[1-(e5-9-fluorenyl)-1-phenyl-2-(e 5-1-indenyl ) ] ligand ( 3 ) , while it appears to be small for those based on the rac-ethylene[1-(e5-cyclopentadienyl)-1-phenyl-2-(e 5-1-indenyl ) ] ligand ( 4 ) . it is suggested that these energy differences can be related to an increased probability of a back - skip of the growing chain toward the outward coordination position after the monomer insertion and prior to the coordination of a new olefin molecule . the kinetic competition between the back - skip of the chain outwards and the monomer coordination is able to rationalize the kinds of defects in prevailingly hemi-isotactic chains obtained with systems based on <nUm> , as well as the increased stereoregularity at decreasing monomer concentration for systems based on <nUm> ( not shown by systems based on <nUm> ) . the molecular mechanics analysis shows that the nonbonded interactions are also able to account for the influence of the ethylene bridge conformation on the stereospecificity of the propene polymerization in ansa - zirconocene complexes .

the polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) , initiated by zirconocene complexes cp2 - ZrMe2 ( 1 ) and [Cp2ZrMe(THF)][BPh4] ( 2 ) , provides partially syndiotactic poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) in high yield and with a narrow molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) . the kinetics of this process were studied and reveal that in this system , the rate of initiation is much slower than that of propagation . initiation appears to involve the rate - limiting reaction of complex <nUm> with monomer to generate a cationic enolate complex ( 3 ) . the latter compounds also initiate polymerization of MMA , albeit at a much slower rate than that observed using initiators <nUm> and <nUm> . the mechanism for propagation in polymerizations initiated by complexes <nUm> and <nUm> has a rate - limiting step involving the reaction of neutral zirconium enolate species ( 4 ) , produced in situ from <nUm> and <nUm> , with monomer , activated by coordination to complex <nUm> . neutral enolate complexes <nUm> and complex <nUm> function as effective initiators of MMA polymerization in which the rate of initiation is greater than or equal to the rate of propagation . under these conditions . PMMA can be produced with very narrow MWD and the polymerization process is living at or below <nUm> ° C . the rate of this process is highly sensitive to the presence of impurities and thus the degree of polymerization is practically limited by initiator concentration . the polymerization of MMA , using initiators <nUm> and <nUm> , in the presence of trialkylaluminum compounds was studied with a view to overcoming these limitations . alkylaluminum compounds appear to act as chain transfer termination reagents in these polymerizations , although the rate of this process is much slower than the rate of propagation . In particular , triisobutylaluminum can be used to purify monomer and solvent and allows production of PMMA with a narrow MWD at high conversion . the polymerization of n-butyl acrylate ( BuA ) , initiated by complexes <nUm> and <nUm> , was studied . poly(n - butyl acrylate ) ( P(BuA) ) can be prepared in high yield at low temperatures with a narrow MWD . this process is not living and the principal termination process involves back - biting cyclization as revealed by MALDI - TOF mass spectra of low-MW polymer . At higher temperatures , the growing chains are deactivated by this process and also by competitive a-hydrogen transfer , such that high monomer conversions are not obtained . 
the zirconocene coupling of conjugated dines is a versatile route to a new family of polymers with primarily cross-conjugated structures . this partially cross-conjugated and irregular structure result in the relatively wide band gaps of the polymers which appear to be responsible for the observed emission of blue light . 
A kinetic study of the ethylene-styrene copolymerization in the presence of rac-(ethylenebis-(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride activated by MAO shows the peculiar behavior of this catalytic system that is known to produce crystalline nearly alternating copolymers . some inferences on the monomer - metal interactions are made on the basis of this study . the parallel investigation on the catalyst based on isopropylidene(1-cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride allows us to produce a stereoregular nearly alternating ethylene-styrene copolymer also with this catalytic system . the same main tacticity seems to characterize the copolymers obtained with the C2 and Cs symmetric catalysts in accordance with the generally accepted mechanism of stereocontrol in the 1-alkene polymerizations . 
cationic metallocene / borate catalysts , generated from zirconocene dimethyl compounds , LnZrMe2 , and anilinium borate , [HNMe2Ph]+[B(C6F5)4] - , were used to polymerize 5-amino-1-pentenes and one 4-amino-1-butene with dimethyl , diethyl , diisopropyl , or diphenyl substitution patterns on nitrogen . the monomer 5-(N,N-diisopropylamino)-1-pentene showed the highest activity with Cp*2ZrMe2 / borate and was used for all further investigations . the catalytic system Cp*2ZrMe2 / borate was <nUm> times more active than the corresponding methylaluminoxane - based system and <nUm> times more active than the heterogeneous system , Cl3Ti / Al(i-Bu)3 . 1-Hexene and 5-(N,N-diisopropylamino)-1-pentene were polymerized with Cp*2ZrMe2 and rac-ethylenebis(tetrahydroindenyl) zirconium dimethyl , rac-EB(THI)-ZrMe2 . polymerization of both monomers with Cp*2ZrMe2 displayed similar activities . hexene polymerizations with rac - EB(THI)ZrMe2 were <nUm> times more active than those with aminopentene . 5-(N,N-Diisopropylamino)-1-pentene polymerizations gave rise to isotactic poly(aminopentene) with C2 symmetric catalysts , syndiotactic polymer with a Cs symmetric catalyst , and atactic polymer with achiral catalyst precursors . 
synthesis of " meso " - and " racemic " - like diastereomers of Me2Si(3-MeInd)(Ind)ZrCl2 ( <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ) was achieved through either metathetical reactions between the dianion of Me2(3-MeIndH)-(IndH) ( 4 ) with Cl4Zr or via amine elimination reactions , followed by fractional crystallization . propylene polymerizations using meso-5 in the presence of methyl aluminoxane under a variety of conditions leads to the formation of low molecular weight , semicrystalline , low tacticity , poly(propylene) ( PP ) . the dominant chain transfer mechanism in this case is shown to involve b-H transfer to monomer . In contrast , rac-6 provides higher molecular weight , semicrystalline , elastomeric poly(propylene) ( elPP ) under a variety of conditions ; chain transfer in this case involves , predominantly , b-H transfer to Zr . the properties of elPP produced using catalyst <nUm> show a gradual change from a lightly , cross-linked elastomer to a poorly crystalline thermoplastic , depending on both polymer molecular weight and crystallinity as revealed by differential scanning calorimetry and tensile testing . In particular , more crystalline material exhibits a higher initial modulus , yielding behavior and lower strain to break than less crystalline material of equivalent molecular weight . these findings further define polymer properties for the synthesis of flexible elastomers using this class of catalysts . 
the zirconocene complexes CP2ZrMe2 and Cp*2ZrMe2 activated with BC18F15 initiate the carbocationic polymerization of isobutene and isobutene - isoprene copolymerizations to IIR rubbers at temperatures as high as <nUm> ° C . unlike conventional metal halide initiators , these metallocene - based initiator systems produce both homo- and copolymers of broadly similar molecular weights . copolymers prepared in the presence of ca. <nUm> mol % isoprene show a diene incorporation rate of <nUm> - <nUm> % , with the typical 1,4-trans structure . comparison of the effectiveness of zirconocene dialkyls with that of the metallocene hydrolysis products Cp*2Zr(OH)2 and (Cp2ZrMe)2(m-O) in the presence of BC18F15 suggests that initiation by traces of protons is less efficient than initiation by cationic metallocene alkyl species , while oxo-bridged complexes (Cp'2ZrMe)2(m-O) / B(C6F 5)3 ( cp' = CH or C5H4SiMe3 ) are inactive . 
A possible rationalization of the dependence of regiospecificity of propene polymerization for catalytic systems based on C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocenes ( and hafnocenes ) on the p-ligand alkyl substitutions is presented . with this aim , models of preinsertion intermediates and transition states for primary and secondary monomer insertion reactions are compared through molecular mechanics analyses . the nonbonded energy contributions to the regioselectivity , as well as the enantioselectivities of regioregular and regioirregular insertion steps have been investigated . nonbonded energy interactions are able to account for the increases of regiospecificity experimentally observed for zirconocene - based catalytic systems when the p-ligands are alkyl substituted in position <nUm> or <nUm> as well as the decrease of regiospecificity observed when the p-ligands are dimethyl substituted in positions <nUm> and <nUm> . 
the properties of three elastomeric stereoblock polypropylene ( PP ) samples made with unbridged 2-phenylindene zirconocene catalysts were investigated . one of the characteristics of these catalysts is the ability to control the structure and properties of the polypropylenes by manipulation of the reaction conditions . samples PP1 and PP2 were prepared to have similar tacticities ( as indicated by IR and NMR spectroscopy ) yet different molecular weights . the molecular weight of PP2 is approximately half the molecular weight of PP1 . sample PP3 has a molecular weight similar that of PP2 but is lower in isotactic pentad content . all three samples were separated into fractions that differ in their solubilities in boiling ether and heptane . the fractionation appeared to be governed by tacticity and molecular weight . thermal analysis by differential scanning calorimetry showed very broad melting endotherms . the broadness of the transitions and the relatively large standard deviations calculated for the enthalpy of fusion are indicative of a multiphase material . x-ray powder diffraction patterns of the three samples and their fractions ( except the ether - soluble fractions ) all showed characteristic peaks of the α crystalline phase . the heptane - insoluble fractions of both PP1 and PP2 also exhibited g-phase reflection , whereas in the heptane - soluble fractions , that reflection is less evident . tensile tests performed on PP1 and PP2 yielded a similar tensile modulus for the two , indicating similar degrees of crystallinity . PP1 exhibited better recovery properties , as measured in tests at <nUm> % and <nUm> % elongation . 
A kinetic model for chain propagation that can account for reaction orders higher than one on monomer concentration , observed for several insertion polymerizations , is discussed . this model is based on the presence of a ` single - center , two - state catalyst ' system , where the slower state is of lower energy and the interconversion rate between the two states is intermediate between the fast and slow propagation rates . this kinetic model fits available experimental data on polymerization rates , as a function of propene concentration , in the presence of zirconocene catalysts . different possibilities for the chemical nature of the two catalyst states are discussed . 
the solid - state structure and physical behavior of an elastomeric polypropylene ( PP1 ) synthesized with unbridged 2-phenylindene zirconocene catalyst were examined using solid - state 13C NMR spectroscopy , differential scanning calorimetry , wide - angle x-ray powder diffraction , and birefringence measurements of relaxation behavior . extraction of these elastomeric polypropylenes with boiling ether and heptane yielded three fractions of different molecular weight and tacticity . the ether - soluble fraction is the lowest in isotactic pentad content and exhibits no detectable crystallinity . for the other fractions and the parent homopolymer , the degrees of crystallinity estimated from DSC and WAXD results are similar . the amount of the immobile phase determined by solid - state NMR , however , appears much higher than the degree of crystallinity . an increase in temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C results in a loss in the relative fraction of mobile and immobile phase as measured by solid - state NMR and a corresponding loss in the percent crystallinity as measured by DSC . the relaxation of polymer samples subjected to step shear as a function of increasing temperature was investigated using polarized optical birefringence measurements . these studies revealed that the elastic network remains stable up to temperatures of <nUm> ° C . blends of atactic and isotactic polypropylene with similar average isotactic pentad contents as PP1 and its heptane - insoluble fraction were examined in comparison . despite their similar taciticities and degrees of crystallinity , the blends show no evidence of a network structure after being subjected to a step shear but instead relax back to an isotropic orientation . 
RHF / 3-21G ab initio , density functional theory ( B3LYP / 3-21G ) , and single - point calculations using an effective core potential ( B3LYP / 6-31G*-ECP(S) / / 3-21G ) are performed for different mechanisms of polymerization of acrylic acid and methyl acrylate by dicyclopentadienyl-zirconocene enolate complexes . polymerization is considered involving a cationic zirconocene complex and a neutral zirconocene complex , respectively . In addition , a mechanism proposed by collins is treated which involves a neutral and a cationic zirconocene complex in the CC bond - forming step at the same time . catalytic cycles can be devised in all cases which suggest that all three mechanisms may be realizable under suitable conditions . however , the ' bimetallic ' mechanism proposed by collins shows the lowest energy of activation for the propagation step . it is shown that bridging of the cyclopentadienyl rings should be important not only with respect to reactivity but also with respect to the possible catalytic cycle . methyl methacrylate is not included in the treatment ; i.e. , the problem of tacticity in these polymerizations is not addressed . 
an experiment was conducted to show the presence of ethylene as catalyst reactivator in the propene - styrene copolymerization . the copolymerizations have been performed by bubbling the gaseous monomers at atmospheric pressure into a flask containing a styrene solution of the prototypical ansa - zirconocene complex rac-(ethylene)bis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride activated by methylalumoxane . In structure A one tertiary carbon atom bearing the phenyl ring is surrounded in both sides by sequences of two methylene groups while in structure B the junction is characterized by the presence of two tertiary carbon atoms bearing the phenyl ring separated by three methylene groups . by reducing the styrene content in the comonomer feed composition ( [E] / [P] / [S] ) <nUm> / <nUm> / <nUm> in the liquid phase ) a copolymer with a <nUm> % styrene units is obtained . the results reported show that it is possible to introduce some styrene units in an isotactic polypropylene sequence by using a small amount of ethylene to reactivate the catalyst after the styrene insertion . 
the synthesis and polymerization behavior of a new C1 - symmetric bridged indenyl-fluorenyl zirconocene dimethylsilylene [9-fluorenyl][(2,4,7-trimethyl)indenyl]zirconium dichloride ( 5 ) is reported . the complex when activated by MAO was found to polymerize ethylene and propylene , although the activity and stereoselectivity of <nUm> for propylene were found to be lower than for the previously prepared ethylene-bridged analogue <nUm> and several other ethylene-bridged precursors . it has been found that , depending on both the substitution patterns on the indenyl ligand and the nature of the bridge in this series of asymmetric zirconocenes , polypropylenes with varying microstructures from aspecific to highly isospecific are obtained . the propylene polymerization behavior of the new complexes has been studied in detail , and the mechanistic aspects of polymerization are discussed . 
various techniques were applied to study thermoplastic elastomeric polypropylene derived from oscillating bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconocene in order to provide information on the morphology of this stereoblock polymer . multiple melting fractions in the differential scanning calorimetry scans of thermally fractionated samples characterized the polydispersity of the crystallizable block lengths . crystal morphologies of these materials and their change during and after tensile extension were observed using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . In addition , AFM and acid digestion studies provided estimated of the crystallizable sequence lengths in these elastomers . 
polymerization of 1-hexene or 1-octene under high pressures ( 100-1000 MPa ) was investigated using permethylated ansa - metallocenes / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as catalyst systems . besides the known zirconocene complex ( <nUm> , Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)2ZrCl2 ) , dialkylsilyene- and dimethyl-germylene-bridged hafnocene dichlorides , R2E(e5-C5Me4)2HfCl2 ( <nUm> , r = me , e = Si ; <nUm> , r = et , e = Si ; <nUm> , r = vinyl , e = Si ; <nUm> , r = me , e = Ge ) , were synthesized and structurally characterized . the catalytic activity of the ansa - metallocenes was remarkably enhanced under high pressures despite their very congested structures . poly(1-hexene) with unprecedented high molecular weight such as mw = <nUm> × <nUm> ( mw / Mn = <nUm> , by GPC ) was obtained under <nUm> MPa with <nUm> . studies on termination reactions revealed that the bimolecular chain - transfer process ( b-hydrogen transfer to olefin ) is much accelerated under <nUm> MPa in <nUm> , while b-hydrogen elimination to metal is still major termination process in <nUm> . this indicated that two complexes that have same structure but central metals showed quite different high - pressure effects . 
Cp2ZrCl2 is presented as both an effective photoinitiator and additive for radical photopolymerization reactions in aerated conditions . this compound is characterized by remarkable properties : ( i ) an efficiency higher than that of a reference type I photoinitiator ( 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone , DMPA ) , ( ii ) an excellent ability , when added to DMPA , to overcome the oxygen inhibition of the polymerization , and ( iii ) a never reported in situ photoinduced and oxygen - mediated formation of zirconium - based nanoparticles ( diameter ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> nm ) . the photochemical properties of Cp2ZrCl2 are investigated by steady state photolysis and electron spin resonance ( ESR ) experiments . the high reactivity of this compound is ascribed to a bimolecular homolytic substitution H2S ( clearly characterized by molecular orbital calculations ) which converts the peroxyls into new polymerization - initiating radicals and oxygenated Zr - based nanoparticles .

heating grey selenium with [e5-C5H4(t-Bu)]2Zr(C6H4(p-OCH3))2in boiling octane affords the diselenophenylenezirconocene complex containing a methoxy group in the ortho position . A similar reaction , although less selective , occurs when starting from [e5-C5H4(t-Bu)]2Zr-(C6H4(p-CH3))2 . the structures of the diselenophenylenezirconocenes obtained were confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and definitively proved by comparison with the authentic orthosubstituted derivatives prepared from the corresponding methyl-o-anisyl- and methyl-o-tolylzirconocene . the mechanism proposed to explain this transformation involves the activation of a tert-butyl C — H bond by a transient benzynezirconocene species . the cyclometalation product , which is obtained by heating the diphenylzirconocene , reacts toward selenium and unsaturated organic compounds like the benzynezirconocene but the reaction takes place at room temperature . the cyclometalation pathway allows a more sterically hindered selenium - containing derivative [e5-C5H4(t-Bu)]2ZrSe2C6H3(o,o'-(CH3)2) to be prepared . the new diselenophenylenezirconocenes described are good precursors to generate benzodiselenagermoles and related spiro compounds by a zirconium - germanium transmetalation reaction . all the new products synthesized , zirconocene complexes and cyclometalated derivatives , benzodiselenagermoles , and spirobisbenzodiselenagermoles , were identified by the multinuclear NMR methods and mass spectrometry . the structure of the cyclometalated product [e5-C5H4(t-Bu)]Zr[(2,5-(CH3)2C6H3)(e1:e5-CH2C(CH3)2C5H4)] was determined by x-ray diffraction analysis . this compound crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21 / c with two molecules per asymmetric unit with cell dimensions a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , and β = <nUm> ° at <nUm> K . least - squares refinement led to a value for the final r index of <nUm> for <nUm> reflections with I > 2s(I) .

all - electron RHF and RMP2 ab initio calculations with split valence basis sets of double- and triple-x quality have been used to study reaction paths for the reaction of acetylene ( 1 ) with the model compounds Cl2ZrH+ ( 2 ) and Cl2ZrCH3+ ( 3 ) . At the RMP2 / / RHF level the insertion process is calculated to have a barrier of <nUm> ( 2 ) and <nUm> kcal / mol ( 3 ) with respect to complexed acetylene and to be <nUm> ( 2 ) and <nUm> kcal / mol ( 3 ) exothermic with respect to free acetylene . the transition states ( TS ) are four membered cycles . the products and TS of Cl2ZrCH3(C2H2)+ are stabilized through an agostic interaction . the calculated energetics of the reaction path are compared with available theoretical as well as experimental data for insertion of unsaturated hydrocarbons into metal — r ( r = H , CH3 ) σ bonds . on the basis of extended huckel calculations a MO picture of the insertion path is provided for the reaction of acetylene with Cp2ZrH+ and Cp2ZrCH3+ . 
the crystal and molecular structures of the C2 symmetric rac-(EBI)ZrCl2(1r) [ monoclinic , space group I2 / c , no. <nUm> , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° ] and of its meso isomer ( <nUm> m ) [ monoclinic , space group P21 / n , no. <nUm> , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° ] have been solved . 1r is in the indenyl-forward ( ∏ ) conformation , as is the case for most of the chiral ansa ethylene-bridged bisindenyl-type metallocenes . In solution however , already at room temperature there is a rapid ( NMR time scale ) interconversion between the two ∏ and Y ( indenyl-backward ) conformations , as shown by conformational analysis on the proton spectra of the bridge methylenes . this equilibrium is shifted toward the lower energy conformation δ at lower temperatures and is influenced by both the solvent and the s-ligands . the solid state structure of <nUm> m shows that this meso form is actually in a chiral conformation ( C1 symmetry ) because of the staggered placement of the two indenyl ligands ( Ind[?]Ind = <nUm> ° ) . In solution this aspecific zirconocene gives a perfectly symmetric 1H NMR spectrum , indicating that , as in the case of the rac - isomer , there is a rapid interconversion between the two equienergetic , mirrorimage limit conformations . 
it has been shown that a nickel(0) complex of bis(trimethylsilyl)butadiyne , (Ph3P)2Ni(e2-Me3SiC ≡ CC ≡ CSiMe3 ) , readily reacts with the titanocene Cp2Ti(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) and zirconocene Cp2Zr(THF)(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) complexes to form the heterobimetallic , doubly acetylide bridged complexes Cp2M(m-e1:e2-C ≡ CSiMe3)Ni(PPh3)(m-e1:e2-C ≡ CSiMe3 ) ( m = Ti ( 1 ) , m = Zr ( 2 ) ) . the structures of these complexes have been established by x-ray crystal structure analysis . two s,p-bridging acetylide units are a-bonded to different metals and p-bonded to the second metal . compound <nUm> in solution at <nUm> K is highly fluxional . an NMR study showed that at <nUm> K an equilibrium exists between one isomer with two nonequivalent and another isomer with two equivalent acetylide units . the cleavage of the central C-C single bond of the butadiyne was not observed in the reaction of the unsymmetrically substituted butadiyne PhC ≡ CC ≡ CSiMe3with titanocene “ Cp2Ti ” generator Cp2Ti(Me3SiC = CSiMe3 ) . the product is a bridging tetradehydro-(1-3-e):(2-4-e)-trans,transbutadiene unit ( zigzag butadiyne ) between two titanium centers in Cp2Ti{m-(1-3-e):(2-4-e)-trans,trans-PhC ≡ CC ≡ CSiMe3}TiCp2(5) . if the phenyl(trimethylsilyl)butadiyne is complexed by nickel(0) , the reaction with the titanocene generated from Cp2Ti(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) yields the heterobimetallic complex Cp2Ti(m-e1:e2-C ≡ CSiMe3)(m-e1:e2-C ≡ CPh)Ni(PPh3) ( 6 ) . both acetylide units are s-bonded to the titanium atom and p-bonded to the nickel atom , giving a “ tweezerlike ” structure . 
the titanocene and zirconocene derivatives Cp2Ti(Me3SiC2SiMe3) and Cp2Zr(pyridine)(Me3SiC2SiMe3) generate under mild conditions unstable metallocenes “ CP2M ” , which react in situ with two molecules of the ketimine HN = CPh2 to form metallocene amido alkylideneamido complexes Cp2M(NH — CHPh2)(N = CPh2 ) ( m = Ti ( 1 ) , Zr ( 2 ) ) by hydrogen transfer of the ketimine moieties . by C-C coupling of two aldimine molecules PhN = CHPh , “ zirconocene ” affords the cyclic diamido complex ( 3 ) . the structures of the products have been established by x-ray structure analysis . 
pinacolborane ( <nUm> equiv ) hydroborates both terminal and internal alkynes , in the presence of <nUm> mol % zirconocene chloride hydride ( HZrCp2Cl ) at <nUm> ° C , in excellent yields and with excellent regio- and stereoselectivity . without HZrCp2Cl and under otherwise identical conditions , hydroboration proceeds to an extent of only 2-20 % . 
the functionalized (fluoroaryl)borate salts Ph3C+B(C6F4TBS)4 - and Ph3C+B(C6F4TIPS)4 - ( TBS = tBuMe2Si ; TIPS = iPr3Si ) are prepared in three steps from 1,4-HC6F4Br , reaction with zirconocene dimethyls yields crystalline , thermally stable , soluble L2ZrCH3 +B-(C6F4SiR3)4 - and L'2ZrH+B(C6SiR3)4 - salts ( L = e5-C5H5 ; e5-1,2-Me2C5H3 ; L ' = e-Me5C5 ) which function as highly active ethylene polymerization catalysts . 
the reaction of the ansa - titanocene dichlorides [(e5-C5H5R1)(e5-C5H5R2)SiMeR3]TiCl2(1a , R1 = R2 = H , R3 = me ; 1b , R1 = H , R2 = SiMe3 , R3 = me ; 1c , R1 = R2 = SiMe3 , R3 = ph ) with <nUm> equiv of CLi ≡ CSiMe3 ( 2 ) yields the bis(alkynyl) ansa - titanocenes [(e5-C5H5R1)(e5-C5H5R2)SiMeR3]Ti(C ≡ CSiMe3)2(3a , R1 = R2 = H , R3 = me ; 3b , R1 = H , R2 = SiMe3 , R3 = me ; 3c , R1 = R2 = SiMe3 , R3 = ph ) . these compounds react with Ni(CO)4(4) to afford { [(e5-C5H3R1)(e5-C5H3R2)SiMeR3]Ti(C ≡ CSiMe3)2}Ni(CO) ( 5a , R1 = R2 = H , R3 = me ; 5b , R1 = H , R2 = SiMe3 , R3 = me ; 5c , R1 = R2 = SiMe3 , R3 = ph ) in high yields . compounds 5a-c contain a low - valent nickel-monocarbonyl fragment , which is stabilized by the chelating effect of both alkynyl ligands of <nUm> . In contrast , the ansa - zirconocene dichloride [(e5-C5H4)(e5-C5H3SiMe3)SiMe2]ZrCl2(6) leads with <nUm> equiv of CLi ≡ CSiMe3(2) to a variety of reaction products , of which the s,e2-doubly alkynyl-bridged dinuclear zirconocene { [(e5-C5H4)(e5-C5H3SiMe3)SiMe2]Zr(C ≡ CSiMe3)}2(7) can be crystallized . compound <nUm> can be synthesized in much better yields by reacting <nUm> first with CLi ≡ CSiMe3 and secondly with n-butyllithium ; a possible mechanism for the formation of <nUm> will be discussed . In <nUm> the alkynyl ligands act both as s-and p-donors . compound <nUm> contains two formal ZrIII centers . the x-ray structure analyses of lb , 3a , and <nUm> are reported . crystals of 1b and 3a are monoclinic , space group P21 / n ( lb ) and P21 / a ( 3a ) : 1b , cell constants a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> ; 3a , cell constants a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . complex <nUm> crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1 with the cell constants a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . the properties of the MeRSi - bridged titanocenes <nUm> and <nUm> in comparison to the appropriate unbridged species are discussed . 
the tilt caused by the one - atom interannular bridge in a zirconocene unit in <nUm> imposed at bis(e6-benzene)vanadium ( 3* ) is very small . As judged from EPR spectroscopy , the electronic structure of 3* is virtually unaffected by zircona[1]vanadocyclophane formation . the novel binuclear complexes are very robust thermally but quite labile chemically . the latter property precludes a thorough electrochemical study of metal — metal interaction in 7* . 
the reaction of main - group ( B , Al , and Ga ) alkoxides with zirconocene complexes of benzynes was used to prepare novel zirconium - group <nUm> heterobimetallic compounds [R2E-(m-OR')(m-l,2-aryl)Zr(e5-C5H5)2] [ e = B , r = et , r ' = me , aryl = phenyl ( 1 ) ; e = B , r = me , r ' = et , aryl = phenyl ( 2 ) ; e = B , r = et , r ' = me , aryl = 3-methoxyphenyl ( 3 ) ; e = Al , r = et , r ' = et , aryl = phenyl ( 5 ) ; e = Ga , r = me , r ' = me , aryl = 3-methoxyphenyl ( 6 ) ] and [(EtO)2B(m-l,2-naphthyl)Zr(e5-C5H5)2(OEt)] ( 4 ) . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> have been characterized by x-ray crystallography . compound <nUm> contains a dative bond from an oxygen lone pair of the methoxy ligand on the zirconium to an acceptor p-orbital on the boron atom ( 11B NMR ; δ <nUm> ppm ) . In contrast , the weakly lewis acidic boron center in <nUm> ( 11B NMR ; δ <nUm> ppm ) does not show a bonding interaction between the alkoxy ligand on the zirconocene fragment and the boron center . 
the synthesis of a variety of nonbridged optically active C2- and C1 - symmetric titanocenes and zirconocenes is reported together with a detailed investigation of the ability of these complexes to effect the catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of 2-phenyl-1-butene and 2-(a-naphthyl)-1-butene . the respective dihydro products are shown to be produced with enantiomeric excesses ranging from <nUm> % to <nUm> % . the absolute configuration of these 2-arylbutanes was noted to be sensitive to the three - dimensional characteristics of the particular bicyclo - fused ligand involved . for a series of verbenone - related metallocenes , an increase in the size of a substituent positioned a and syn to the metal center was found to be unfavorable for stereoinduction . this phenomenon has been rationalized in transition state terms , with the alkene approaching laterally to engage in hydrogen atom transfer . the three - dimensional stereochemical model advanced in explanation of the observed catalytic selectivity underscores the development of steric biases during olefin coordination to the reactive metal hydride intermediate . 
tandem mass spectrometry methods were used to assign the structure of C10H10Zr*+ ions produced by electron impact ionization of C12H16Zr and [(C5H5)2ZrO]2 . the results were consistent with the formation of the zirconocenium radical - cation . the neutralization - reionization mass spectrum of this species showed a recovery signal , indicating that neutral monomeric zirconocene had been generated in the gas phase . 
the formation of η <nUm> -imine-zirconocene complexes ( zirconaziridines ) ( cp <nUm> Zr(NR <nUm> CR <nUm> r <nUm> ) by elimination of r <nUm> H from cp <nUm> Zr(R <nUm> )(NR <nUm> CHR <nUm> r <nUm> ) has been investigated with regard to the variation in r <nUm> , r <nUm> , r <nUm> , and r <nUm> , in particular by making use of hammett type structure / rate correlations ( r <nUm> , r <nUm> , r <nUm> = p-XC <nUm> H <nUm> , x = me <nUm> N , MeO , H , Cl , CO <nUm> me ; r <nUm> , ρ = <nUm> ; r <nUm> , ρ = <nUm> ; r <nUm> , = − <nUm> ) . the elimination is first order in the zirconocene complex , has a deuterium isotope effect for the hydrogen eliminated of <nUm> at <nUm> ° C , and kinetic studies on cp <nUm> Zr(Me)(NPhCHMe <nUm> ) give the activation parameters DH ‡ = <nUm> kJ mol − <nUm> and DS ‡ = − <nUm> J K − <nUm> mol − <nUm> for the elimination of methane . A cyclometalation involving deprotonation a to nitrogen by ( r <nUm> ) - best fits the data . the relationship between the rate of the reaction and the structure of the amine shows a marked dependency on both electronic and steric effects ranging between no reaction after <nUm> h at <nUm> ° C for piperidine to below room temperature for silylamines and benzylanilines . for the first time η <nUm> -imine complexes have been formed even from simple amines such as dibutylamine and trapped with an alkyne to form secondary allylic amines on workup . In the absence of a trap η <nUm> -(PhN = CMe <nUm> )ZrCp <nUm> rearranges via a rapidly reversible hydride shift to afford a η <nUm> -azaallylzirconocene hydride . 
(2-Methylcyclopenta[l]phenanthryl)2ZrCl2 and (2-phenylcyclopenta[l]phenanthryl)2ZrCl2 were synthesized and used , after activation with MAO , as catalysts for the polymerization of propene . the resulting polymers had low isotacticities ( 8-18 % [mmmm] ) . ligand rotation barriers for the corresponding zr-dibenzyl derivatives were determined by dynamic NMR spectroscopy . pathways and transition states for ligand rotation in this series of complexes were studied by molecular - mechanics calculations and are discussed in relation to the microstructure of the respective polymer products . 
the zirconocene e2-formaldehyde dimer <nUm> reacts with trialkylchlorosilanes R3SiCl ( r = ethyl , methyl , isopropyl ) to yield the (e2-(trialkylsiloxy)methyl)zirconocene chloride complexes cp2- Zr(Cl)CH2OSiR3 ( 7a-c ) . these complexes exhibit internal o-coordination ; they belong to a metallaoxirane structural type . thermolysis of 7b,c at <nUm> ° C leads to equilibration with the isomers 8b,c and 9b,c . complexes <nUm> are the acyclic Cp2Zr(Cl)CH2OSiR3 isomers of <nUm> , whereas dyotropic rearrangement has resulted in the formation of the Cp2Zr(Cl) OCH2SiR3 products <nUm> . the kinetics of the thermally induced rearrangement of 7b ( r = CH3 ) is described by a 8b ⇌ 7b → 9b kinetic scheme . At <nUm> ° C the k(8b ⇌ 7b ) equilibrium constant is <nUm> . the gibbs activation energy of the 7b → 8b isomerization at <nUm> ° C is DG ‡ isom(383 K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 . the activation barrier of the 7b -9b transformation is in the expected range of a concerted dyotropic rearrangement process at DG ‡ dyo(383 K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 . treatment of <nUm> with triphenylchlorosilane has resulted in the direct formation of the acyclic addition product Cp2Zr(Cl)CH2OSiPh3 ( 8d ) . our study underlines the important participation of metallaoxirane type structures in dyotropic rearrangement systems . 
two general synthetic routes for the preparation of ethylene-bridged ansa - zirconocene dichlorides rac-[1-(e5-Cp1)-1-R1-2-(e5-Cp2)-2-R2-C2H2]ZrCl2 ( 6a-c ) bearing different cyclopentadienyl fragments [ Cp1,Cp2 = cp ( cyclopentadienyl ) , ind ( indenyl ) , flu ( fluorenyl ) ] and a variable bridge substitution pattern ( R1 , R2 = H , ph ) are described , using chiral epoxides as starting materials . diastereomeric complexes were separated by crystallization . the solidstate structures of two representative examples are reported . In combination with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) , rac-[1-(e5-9-fluorenyl)-2-(e5-1-indenyl)ethane]ZrCl2 ( 6a ) , carrying no bulky bridge substituent , and the diastereomeric systems rac-[1- (e5-9-fluorenyl)-1(R,S)-phenyl-2-(e5-1(R,S)-indenyl)ethane]ZrCl2 ( 6b1 = RR,SS ; 6b2 = RS,SR ) , showing different bridge conformations , were used for propene polymerization . the stereoselectivity depends on monomer concentration for all three unsymmetric catalysts . under comparable conditions 6a and 6b <nUm> produce polypropenes with significantly different stereoregularities . this demonstrates the importance of a defined bridge conformation for the design of highly stereoselective catalysts . 
page <nUm> . figure <nUm> and the text should reflect that the distance between the Zr atom and ha in 6b and 7b has been calculated to be <nUm> Å for 6b and <nUm> Å for 7b . the distance between and Zr amounts to <nUm> Å for 6b and <nUm> A for 7b . 
synthesis of rac-[((1,2,3,4-tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene-1,4-diyl)germylene)bis(1-e5-indenyl)]dichlorozirconium ( 1 ) was achieved with substantial suppression of the undesired meso diastereomer as predicted by MM2 force field calculations . the corresponding zirconocenium ion of <nUm> polymerizes propylene with high catalytic activity and stereospecificity to very high molecular weight . the characteristics of this catalysis are essentially independent of polymerization temperature over a broad temperature range . 
the synthesis of seven new bridged zirconocenes is described , which make isotactic polypropylene when used in polymerizations of propylene with methylaluminoxane as cocatalyst . their polymerization behavior in propylene and ethylene polymerizations is examined and discussed . aromatic substituents in appropriate positions of the zirconocene ligand frame result in catalysts with activities , stereospecificities , and polypropylene molecular weights much higher than those of any previously described metallocene system . by structure variations it is demonstrated that the effectiveness of these substitutions strongly depends on their position and on a nonincremental synergism with alkyl substituents on the ligand frame . the high activities of the systems can be explained well by electronic effects , whereas steric effects obviously play the more important role for the high stereospecificities and high molecular weights of the polymers . 
the dimethylsilyl-bridged zirconocene complexes (CH3)2Si(benz[e]indenyl)2ZrCl2 ( I ) and (CH3)2Si(2-methylbenz[e]indenyl)2ZrCl2 ( II ) have been synthesized ; the structure of II was determined by x-ray diffraction . complex I is about <nUm> times more active in polymerizing propene than its bis(indenyl) analog when activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) under otherwise identical conditions . the resulting catalyst system polymerizes also the g-branched olefins 3-methyl-1-butene and 3-methyl-1-pentene . polymers produced with complex II have molecular weights about <nUm> times higher than those obtained with complex I under identical conditions . the a-methyl substituents of II appear to block those chain terminations which arise from b-H transfer directly to a coordinated monomer molecule . 
treatment of the zirconocene terminal imido complex (CpR)2ZrqqNtBu(THF) ( 1a-THF : r = H ; 1b-TNF : r = me ) with acetylene results in the formation of a dinuclear product , [(CpR)2Zr]2(m-CHCHNtBu)(m-NtBu) ( 3a , r = H ; 3b , r = me ) , in which the zirconium centers are bridged by nitrogen and carbon . upon heating , the dinuclear complex <nUm> is cleaved into the azametallacyclobutene (CpR)2Zr(e2-NtBuCHCH) ( 4 ) and the terminal imido complex (CpR)2ZrqqNtBu ( 1 ) , which can be trapped with lewis bases or alkynes . heating <nUm> in the absence of traps cleanly produces the alkynyl-bridged species [(CpR)2ZrNHtBu]2(m-CqqC) ( 5 ) . kinetic data indicate that the dinuclear complex <nUm> fragments into the mononuclear species <nUm> and <nUm> prior to C-H activation to form <nUm> . the x-ray structures of [Cp2Zr]2(m-CHCHNtBu)-(m-NtBu) ( 3a ) and [Cp2ZrNHtBu]2(m-CqqC) ( 5a ) are reported ; the structure of the dinuclear species [(Cp2Zr)((CpMe)2Zr)](m-CHCHNtBu)(m-NtBu) ( 3c ) is included in the supporting information . 
A mixture of Cp2Zr(PMe3) complexes of cycloheptadienyne ( 5a-c ) has been prepared . hydride abstraction from the mixture gave the first example of a zirconium complex of tropyne . reaction of 5a-c with , 2-butyne followed by hydride abstraction gave the first example of a transition - metal metallacycle with the π framework of an azulene . 
the use of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane , BC18F15 , as a cocatalyst in the dehydrocoupling of phenylsilane , in the presence of zirconocene - derived catalysts , leads to suppression of chain scission reactions and to an increase in polysilane chain length ( Mn > <nUm> ) . an exhaustive multinuclear NMR study of the catalytic species leads to the conclusion that they are zirconocene - ( IV ) hydride bridged dimers , with a “ cation - like ” silylium ligand on each zirconium : [Cp2Zr(SiHPh)(m-H)]2[Bu2(C6F5)2B]2 . 
the syntheses of the Zr primary phosphido complexes Cp2Zr(PH(C6H2-2,4,6-t-Bu3))Cl ( 1 ) and Cp2Zr(PH(C6H2-2,4,6-Me3))Cl ( 2 ) from the appropriate LiPHR and <nUm> equiv of Cp2ZrCl2 are described . In reactions of PH2(C6H2-2,4,6-Me3) or PH2SiMe3 with Cp2ZrHCl , the respective bridging - phosphinidene derivatives (Cp2ZrCl)2(m2-PC6H2-2,4,6-Me3) ( 3 ) and Cp2Zr(m2-PSiPh3)(m2-e1:e5-C5H4)ZrCpCl ( 4 ) are obtained . these products are planar at phosphorus , indicative of Zr – P p-bonding . reaction of PH(C6H2-2,4,6-t-Bu3) with excess Cp2ZrHCl results in the formation of the planar , trinuclear phosphide complex (Cp2Zr)2(m2-Cl)(m3-P)(ZrCp2Cl) ( 5 ) . this species <nUm> is also generated from the addition of PH(C6H2-2,4,6-t-Bu3) to a mixture of Cp2ZrCl2 and Mg . the mixed - valent product <nUm> is paramagnetic , exhibiting an EPR spectrum typical of Zr(III)-P species . under similar reaction conditions , but with prolonged exposure to Mg , the diamagnetic phosphide derivative (CpZr(m2-e1:e5-C5H4))3(m3-P) ( 6 ) is obtained . In contrast to <nUm> , the geometry at phosphorus in <nUm> is pyramidal . the terminal phosphinidene complexes Cp2Zr(P(C6H2-2,4,6-t-Bu3))(PMe3) ( 7 ) and Cp2Zr(P(C6H2-Me3))(PMe3) ( 8 ) are generated via the reaction of <nUm> or <nUm> with KH and PMe3 . the reaction mechanisms operative in the formation of these phosphinidene or phosphide complexes are discussed . MO calculations were performed on models of the terminal and bridging phosphinidene complexes as well as the planar and pyramidal trinuclear phosphide complexes . these studies provide insights regarding the structure and bonding in these compounds . cumulatively , this work implies that phosphinidene species are generally highly reactive , exhibiting the ability to induce C – H and P – C activation . crystallographic data are reported herein for compounds <nUm> , and <nUm> . compound <nUm> : space group P21 / a with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . compound <nUm> : space group P1 with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . compound <nUm> : space group P21 / a with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and z = <nUm> . 
reactions of anionic zirconocene e2-aldehyde complexes with metal carbonyls lead to rapid and quantitative formation of heterobimetallic complexes containing a new carbon-carbon bond , thereby suggesting a modified mechanism for homogeneously catalyzed carbon monoxide hydrogenation . nine new bimetallic complexes are reported , including the x-ray structure of(e5-C5H4Me)2Zr(Me){OCH(C6H4Me)C(O)Fe(CO)4}Li-(THF)2 . 
In this study valence force field parametrizations for zirconocene dichloride complexes are reported . the three models developed and investigated provide complete sets of parameters that can be used either in standard force fields without software extensions for the treatment of p-ligands or in force fields that can handle the multiple - reference problem encountered in highly symmetric coordination compounds as well as in force fields where a distributed - forces model for the treatment of centrosymmetric ligands is available . the new parameters have been tested with a series of <nUm> nonbridged and <nUm> ansa - metallocene complexes . the agreement between x-ray structural data and the results of the three model calculations is excellent . on the average , bond lengths are reproduced to better than <nUm> pm , bond angles to <nUm> ° , and the torsion angles defining the relative orientations of the ligands in the bent - metallocene conformers to about <nUm> ° for complexes exhibiting no significant intermolecular interaction in the solid state . additionally , the new series of parameter sets presented allows for a good reproduction of the experimental vibrational data . 
the intramolecular zirconocene coupling of 4,4-bis(hexyloxymethyl)-1,7-bis-p-halophenyl-1,6-heptadiynes provides 2,5-bis-p-halophenylzirconocyclopentadienes ( bromo and chloro derivatives ) , which undergo efficient transmetalation reactions with Br4Ge . methylation of the resulting dihalogermoles with MeLi provided bis-p-halophenyl-2,5-germole monomers . these functionalized germoles were polymerized via nickel coupling to give oligo- and poly(2,5-diphenylgermole) materials ( 7 ) . investigations of optical properties reveal that the monomers and a model 2,5-bisphenylgermole are somewhat photoluminescent ( φ = <nUm> - <nUm> ) , while the high molecular weight polymer ( Mn ≈ <nUm> ) exhibits very efficient photoemission ( φ = <nUm> ) . electrochemical studies indicate that delocalization in <nUm> is accompanied by a modest lowering of the LUMO level relative to that of the monomer . 
In the presence of excess butylmagnesium chloride and in diethyl ether at <nUm> ° C , zirconocene dichloride is an effective catalyst precursor for the the stereoselective cyclization of nonconjugated dienes containing a terminal alkoxide substituent . the products are carbocyclic rings containing adjacent vinyl and methyl substituents with trans stereochemistry . 
it has been shown that the zirconocene complex Cp2Zr(THF)(Me3SiC2SiMe3) readily reacts with disubstituted butadiynes R1C ≡ CC ≡ CR2 ( R1 = R2 = SiMe3 ; R1 = SiMe3 , R2 = tBu or ph ) to form the dimeric symmetrical complex [ Cp2Zr(m-e1:e2-C ≡ CSiMe3)]2 ( 2 ) and doubly acetylide - bridged , unsymmetrical complexes [ Cp2Zr(m-e1:e2-C ≡ CSiMe3 ) ( m-e1:e2-C ≡ CtBu)ZrCp2 ] ( 3 ) and [ Cp2Zr(m-e1:e2-C ≡ CSiMe3)(m-e1:e2-C ≡ CPh)ZrCp2 ] ( 4 ) , respectively . the structure of the products has been established by x-ray structure analyses . 
the (m-formaldehyde))Cp2ZrCl)2 complex <nUm> reacts with alkyl isocyanides RNC ( r = -CH2SiMe3 , -CMe3 ) with insertion into the Zr — C bond and opening of the metallaoxirane unit by cleavage of the adjacent Zr — O bond to give the “ n-inside ” (if-iminoacyl)zirconocene complexes 2(a,b) [ (Cp2ZrCl)C(CH2OZrCp2Cl) = NR ] . this insertion behavior of <nUm> is unusual as compared to the (e2-formaldehyde)zirconocene dimer <nUm> that reacts with Me3SiCH2NC without zi — O bond cleavage to give a four - membered metallacyclic (e1-iminoacy)zirconocene complex . the isonitrile insertion product 2a was characterized by x-ray diffraction . it crystallizes in the space group PI with cell parameters a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , γ = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , rw2 = <nUm> . the C = N bond length in 2a is <nUm> Å . the adjacent Zr — c(iminoacyl) bond is <nUm> Å . 
intramolecular cyclization reactions of YCH2- CH = CHCH2XCH2CH = CH2 ( x = CH2 , NPr , NPh ; Y = PhO , MeO ) , which have a terminal double bond and an allylic ether moiety , were catalyzed by zirconocene dichloride ( 10-20 mol % ) in the presence of n-BuMgCl . cyclization products 2-methyl-1-vinyIcyclopentane , 4-methyl-1-propyl-3-vinylpyrrolidine , and 4-methyl-lphenyl-3-vinylpyrrolidine were obtained in <nUm> ‒ <nUm> % yields . stoichiometric cyclization with Cp2ZrBu2 or (C5H3Me2)2ZrBu2 at room temperature gave the same products in high yields after hydrolysis . when an excess of Cp2ZrBu2 was used , the stereoisomerization of cis product to trans isomer was observed . 
an ethylene-bridged zirconocene complex , (Cp2ZrMe)2(CH2CH2) , was prepared by the reaction of Cp2ZrMe2 with a zirconocene - ethylene complex , [ cp2- ZrEt(CH2 = CH2)]MgBr , and the structure of this complex was determined by a single - crystal x-ray diffraction study . the structure of this complex showed one methyl group on each zirconium and an ethylene ligand simultaneously coordinating to the two zirconocene moieties . 
A bis(cyclopentadienyl) ligand containing two ethanediyl bridges is obtained by skattebol rearrangement of the bis(dibromocarbene) adduct of 1,2,5,6-tetramethylenecyclooctane . reactions of its dilithium salt with TiCl3(THF)3 , Cl4Zr , and VCl3(THF)3 afford , after appropriate workup , the corresponding doubly bridged metallocene dichlorides . x-ray diffraction studies give space group P21 / n for all three of the complexes C14Cl2H14Ti and C9Cl2H11Zr , and C14Cl2H14V . 
dimethylzirconocene ( 4 ) was treated with <nUm> molar equiv of pyrazole to give methane and (pyrazole-N)methylzirconocene ( 5 ) . treatment of <nUm> with tributylammonium tetraphenylborate gave the cationic (e2-pyrazolyl-N,N')(tetrahydrofuran)zirconocene complex <nUm> , isolated as the tetraphenylborate salt in > <nUm> % yield . the related (e2-pyrazolyl-N-N')(e1-pyrazolyl-N)zirconocene tetraphenylborate salt was obtained by treating the methylzirconocene cation <nUm> with pyrazole in dichloromethane . cationic (e2-pyrazolyl-N-N')(tetrahydrofuran)zirconocene <nUm> reacts with acetylacetone by proton transfer to give (acetylacetonato)(e1-pyrazole-N)zirconocene tetraphenylborate ( 9 ) . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by x-ray diffraction . complex <nUm> was employed as a general lewis - acid catalyst in the mukaiyama aldol reaction between [(trimethylsilyl)oxy]cyclopentene and benzaldehyde . 
the arsenic - functionalized zirconocene arsenido complexes [Cp'2Zr{As(SiMe3)2}(Cl)] ( <nUm> ; cp' = C5H4Me ) and [Cp2Zr{As(SiMe3)2}2] ( <nUm> ; cp = CH ) are obtained by the reaction of [Cp'2ZrCl2] or [Cp2ZrCl2] with Li(THF)2As(SiMe3)2 <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by spectroscopy ( IR , NMR , mass spectrum ) and by x-ray structure determinations . In <nUm> there are two distinctly different As(SiMe3)2 groups and Zr-As bond lengths ( Zr-As1 = <nUm> Å , Zr-As2 = <nUm> Å ) , indicating the presence of a Zr-As1 single bond and a Zr-As2 double bond . 
substituted 7-hydroxynorbornenes were prepared in a single step by the reaction of titanocene dichloride with electron - deficient alkenes . the reaction is diastereoselective and also exhibits mild regioselectivity . the effects of solvents , added reagents and alkene structure upon the reaction were studied . the reaction is proposed to occur via a metal - assisted oxidative cycloaddition . zirconocene dichloride also reacts with electron - deficient alkenes , but yields unoxidized cycloaddition products . 
the diels — alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and various dienophiles is efficiently catalyzed by cationic zirconocene compounds ( e.g. [Cp2Zr(OtBu)THF][BPh4] ( 2 ) ) . the use of catalytic amounts of optically pure (S)-[ethylenebis(e-tetrahydroindenyl)]-zirconium tert-butoxide tetrahydrofuran tetraphenylborate ( 3 ) resulted in modest enantioselectivity in this CC bond - forming process . compound ( S ) -3crystallizes in the hexagonal space group P61 : a = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , V = <nUm> A3 , z = <nUm> with r = <nUm> , rw = <nUm> for <nUm> observed reflections with F > 6.0s(F) . A model for the facial selectivity observed is presented on the basis of the structure of compound (S)-3 . 
the interaction of the chiral difunctional ligand (1R,2S,3R)-3-mercapto-1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo-[2.2.1]heptan-2-ol ( 1 ) with group IV metallocene complexes affords the product Cp2M(OC10H16S) ( cp = cyclopentadienyl ; m = Ti ( 2 ) or Zr ( 3 ) ; C10H16OS = (1R,2S,3R)-3-thio-1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo-[2.2.1]heptan-2-olato ) . In CDC13 solution , complex <nUm> exists as a mixture of a monomeric species and an associated dimeric species . complex <nUm> readily hydrolyzes to give an air - stable complex , [ Cp2Zr(m-O) (m-OC10H16S)ZrCp2 ) ] ( 4 ) . the complex <nUm> crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with cell parameters a = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , V = <nUm> ( 10 ) A3 , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . the complex <nUm> is an oxo-bridged zirconocene dimer that is also bridged by a heterodifunctional ligand . the Zr-O-Zr angle is small at <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , and the Zr ⋯ Zr distance is <nUm> Å . two zirconocene moieties are inequivalent due to the asymmetric difunctional ligand . the related complex [Cp2Zr(m-OCH2CH2S)]2 ( 5 ) was also prepared . complex <nUm> crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21 / c with cell parameters a = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , V = <nUm> ( 7 ) A3 , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . the complex <nUm> is a zirconocene dimer bridging through the oxygen atoms . the OZr framework is nearly planar with both sulfur atoms above the plane by ~ <nUm> Å , and the Zr ⋯ Zr distance at <nUm> Å is somewhat longer than that in complex <nUm> . 
doubly bridged zirconocene derivatives with C2 symmetrically disposed substituents , ((CH3)2-Si)2(3,4-dimethyl-1,2-cyclopentadienediyl)2ZrCl2 ( <nUm> A ) and ((CH3)2Si)2(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1,2-indenediyl)2ZrCl2 ( 4B ) were synthesized by reactions of the corresponding ligand dilithium salts with Cl4Zr in toluene ; the racemic isomers were obtained by fractionated crystallization of the diastereomeric product mixtures . x-ray diffraction studies give space group P1 with a = <nUm> ( 5 ) Å b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> ( 9 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 4 ) ° , β = <nUm> ( 4 ) ° , γ = <nUm> ( 4 ) ° , and z = <nUm> ( two crystallographically independent molecules ) for <nUm> A and space group P21 / n with a = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , and z = <nUm> for 4B . both complexes show the expected C2 - axial symmetry . In combination with methylalumoxane , <nUm> A and 4B are slowly converted to catalysts for the polymerization of propene , which yield polymers with low and medium isotacticities , respectively . control experiments indicate that conversion of these complexes to active catalysts involves degradation of their strained ligand frameworks ; intact <nUm> A and 4B do not appear to give rise to catalytic activity . 
zirconocene complexes of two strained cyclopropenes , bicyclo[3.1.0]hex-5-eneandbicyclo[4.1.0]-hept-6-ene , have been prepared by elimination of bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane and bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane from bis-(bicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl)- and bis(bicyclo[4.1.0]heptyl)-zirconocene in the presence of Me3P . the bicycloalkene complexes undergo reaction with diphenylacetylene to give reductive coupling products which react with ClH to give bicycloalkyl-substituted cis-stilbenes . 
the carbon-carbon triple bond in bis[(dialkylamino)(phenylethynyl)boryl]methanes 2a,b can be easily cyclized using zirconocene to give derivatives 3a,b of the new pentalene - like 6,8-dibora-3-zirconabicyclo[3.3.0]octa-l,4-diene , containing a zir-conacyclopentadiene ring attached to a 1,3-diboracy-clopentane unit . these heterocycles are characterized by NMR methods and by an x-ray structure determination of 3b . compound 3b crystallizes from pentane in the monoclinic space group C2 / c with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> Å <nUm> , and r(calc) = <nUm> Mg / m <nUm> for m = <nUm> g / mol and z = <nUm> . 
from Cp2ZrCl2 and <nUm> equiv of the appropriate lithium phosphinomethanides (D)Li[HC(PMe2)X] ( d = -,X = PMe2,6 ; d = TMEDA , x = SiMe3,7 ) , the 1,3-zirconaphosphacyclobutane derivatives [ formula omitted ] ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) , containing the first examples of doubly metalated alkylphosphines as chelating ligands , are formed via the known zirconaphosphacyclopropane derivatives [ formula omitted ] ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) . an intramolecular pathway is deduced from a cross-coupling experiment with [ formula omitted ] , <nUm> and <nUm> . In contrast , <nUm> ( x = SiMe3 ) reacts with LiCH2PMe2 ( 5 ) to give the substitution product [ formula omitted ] ( 13 ) . In the case of <nUm> ( x = PMe2 ) , again metalation occurs with LiR ( r = CH3 , CH2PMe2 , tBu ) , thereby generating {Cp2Zr[C(PMe2)2]}2 ( 14 ) . an x-ray diffraction study of the yellow crystals of 14-toluene ( monoclinic , space group P21 / c , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> a,b = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , z = <nUm> , I = <nUm> ° C , rw = <nUm> , [ formula omitted ] shows the diphosphinocarbene ligands to function as e2(C,P)-u-(C,P') six - electron ligands to 18e zirconium centers . only traces of metalation product are observed , however , in the sterically most crowded system [ formula omitted ] ( 4 ) / (TMEDA){Li[C(PMe2)(SiMe3)2}2 ( 8 ) . instead , an oxidative phosphinomethanide coupling ( PC ) leads to the phosphorus ylide (Me2P)(Me3Si)2CPMe2C(SiMe3)2 ( 15 ) , probably via an external reaction in the ligand sphere . however , a metalation product , [ formula omitted ] ( 17 ) , can be obtained via a more indirect route from [ formula omitted ] ( 9 ) and KCp . insertion of tBuNC into the ZrC bonds of <nUm> gives the six - membered heterocycle [ formula omitted ] ( 19 ) . all compounds were characterized by means of NMR spectroscopy . 
oxidative additions of PH bonds to “ zirconocene ” have been studied . the resulting zirconocenephosphidehydrides are not stable and react further to give a variety of products the nature of which depends on the electronic and steric properties of the phosphide moiety . In the case of the PhPH2 derivative , cyclopentadienyl CH activation occurs affording the fulvalenidephosphide dimer [CpZr(m-PHPh)]2(m-e5-e5-C10H8) ( 1 ) in the similar reaction of CyPH2 , the isolated product is [Cp2Zr(m-PHCy)]2 ( 2 ) . the isolated derivative of (2,4,6-Me3C6H2)PH2 resembles <nUm> and was confirmed crystallographically to be [CpZr(m-PH(2,4,6-Me3C6H2)]2(m-e5-e5-C10H8) ( 3 ) . the compound <nUm> crystallizes in the space group P1 with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> , and V = <nUm> A3 . In the case of Ph3SiPH2 three products were obtained . [Cp2Zr(m-PH(SiPh3)]2 ( 4 ) and [CpZr(m-PH(SiPh3))]2(m-e5-e5-C10H8) ( 5 ) are the major products , while [CpZr]2(m-PH(SiPh3)(m-PSiPh3)(m-e6-e5-C10H8) ( 6 ) is also formed in low yield . the compound 4*THF crystallizes in the space group P21 / n with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> , and V = <nUm> A3 , while <nUm> crystallizes in the space group C2 / c with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> , and V = <nUm> A3 . the phosphidephosphinidene - bridged , mixed - valent Zr(IV) / Zr (III) compound 6*[(THF)2Li(m-Cl)]2*THF crystallizes in the space group P1 with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> , and V = <nUm> A3 . the course of these reactions is discussed in terms of the electronic and steric properties of the phosphines . the mechanism for cyclopentadienyl CH activation is considered , and a dimeric Zr(IV) intermediate [CpZr(m-e5-e1-C5H4)(PHR)]2 is proposed on the basis of spectroscopic data derived from monitoring these reactions . alternative synthetic routes to these dimers were explored . the dimers <nUm> and <nUm> were obtained from the reactions of zirconocene dichloride with Mg in the presence of the respective phosphine . these dimers <nUm> and <nUm> were also isolated from the reaction of the primary phosphine with zirconocenehydride chloride . the compound [Cp2Zr(m-PHPh)]2 ( 7 ) was isolated in a similar reaction . the species <nUm> crystallizes in the space group C2 / c with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> and V = <nUm> A3 . direct reaction of Li2PPh and Cp2ZrCl2 or deprotonation of <nUm> generates the bis(phosphinidene) - bridged homobimetallics [Cp2Zr(m-PR)]22- ( r = ph , 8a , r = cy , 8b ) . reaction of 8a with a proton source and TMEDA affords the mono(phosphinidene) - bridged complex [(Cp2Zr)2(m-PHPh)(m-PPh)][(THF)2Li(TMEDA)] ( 9 ) . the compound 9*THF crystallizes in the space group P1 with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> , and V = <nUm> A3 . similarly , reaction of 8a with Me3O+ generates the species [(Cp2Zr)2(m-PMePh)(m-PPh)]Li ( 10 ) . the heterobimetallic complex Cp2Zr(m-PHCy)(m-e1-e2-OC)Mo(CO)Cp ( 11 ) is derived from the reaction of <nUm> with [CpMo(CO)3]2 . this product crystallizes in the space group P1 with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> , and V = <nUm> A3 . deprotonation of <nUm> affords the phosphinidene - bridged heterobimetallic [Cp2Zr(m-PCy)(m-e1-e2-OC)Mo(CO)Cp]- ( 12 ) . this process is reversible . the chemistry and structural data for these phosphide and phosphinidene species are presented and discussed . In particular , the structural data for the Zr (III) species are considered in light of recent postulates of “ super-long ” metalmetal bonding in related zirconocene dimers . some of the discussion is supported by the results of fenske - hall and extended huckel molecular orbital calculations . 
this paper outlines the generation of the transient monomeric imido complexes Cp2ZrNR ( 1a – e ) , their successful trapping with unsaturated organic molecules and dative ligands , and their use in activating C — H bonds . the generation of Cp2ZrNR has been accomplished by thermolysis of the alkyl amides Cp2Zr(NHR)(R') ( 2a – d ) and bis(amides) Cp2Zr(NHR)2 ( 3a – c ) via a-abstraction of alkane and amine , respectively . the imido intermediate 1a , generated from alkyl amide 2a ( r = 4-tert-butylphenyl , R' = me ) in THF , resulted in the formation of the bridging imido dimer 4a in <nUm> % yield . In contrast , the generation of intermediates 1b – d ( 1b r = tert-Bu ; 1c r = 2,6-dimethylphenyl ; 1d r = Si(CMe3)Me2 ) under similar conditions furnished the monomeric imido THF complexes 5b – d in <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> % yields . imido dimer 4a and monomer 5b were characterized crystallographically . the THF ligands of 5b – d are weakly bound , as demonstrated by the exchange of bound and free THF in 5c on the NMR time scale and by facile substitution of Ph3PO for THF in 5b , giving the triphenylphosphine oxide adduct Cp2Zr(NCMe3)(OPPh3) ( 6b ) . thermolysis of the alkyl amides 2b and 2d at <nUm> – <nUm> ° C in benzene resulted in the addition of the C — H bond of benzene across the Zr — N linkage to provide the phenyl amides 7b and 7d . similarly , the THF adduct 5b reacted with benzene under the same conditions to give the C — H activation product 7b . the imido intermediates Cp2ZrNR undergo cycloaddition reactions with a variety of unsaturated organic compounds . In addition to formation of azametallacyclobutenes ( e.g. , 8b , 8c , 9c , 10b ) from alkynes , certain olefins react with cp2 - ZrNR to give azametallacyclobutanes . thus , upon reaction of norbornene or ethylene with imido complex 5b an equilibrium mixture of 5b , free olefin , free THF , and the metallacycles 12b and 13b , respectively , were observed . addition of a large excess of norbornene shifted the equilibrium almost entirely to the azametallacyclobutane 12b and facilitated its isolation . the structure of 12b was determined after crystallization from hexamethyldisiloxane . complex 5b also reacted with benzophenone and tert-butyl isocyanate to provide the tert-butylimine of benzophenone and di-tert-butylcarbodiimide in <nUm> and <nUm> % yields , respectively . monomer 5b reacted with tert-butyl isocyanide to provide the coupling / trapping product Cp2Zr-(N(CMe3)CNCMe3)(CNCMe3) ( 16 ) , while reaction of 5b with isobutene oxide gave the epoxideopened product Cp2Zr(NHCMe3)(OCH2C(Me)CH2) ( 17 ) . finally , heating the alkyl amide Cp2Zr(NHCHPh2)(CH2CH2CMe3) ( 2e ) ( which contains hydrogens both α and β to nitrogen ) with diphenylacetylene yielded the azametallacyclobutene product formed via a-abstraction in <nUm> % yield . 
zirconocene and hafnocene complexes such as CP <nUm> MH <nUm> and cp <nUm> M(Cl)H ( m = Zr or Hf ) were found to catalyze efficiently the selective dimerization of aldehydes to esters under mild conditions . hafnocene complexes exhibited higher activity than the corresponding zirconocene complexes , while titanocene complexes were inert in the present reaction . the reaction was found to be markedly influenced by the structure of the aldehydes used . cross-dimerization could be achieved by allowing cp <nUm> HZr <nUm> or cp <nUm> ClHZr to react with two different aldehydes whose reactivities are slightly different from each other . 
the results of ab initio RHF and RMP2 geometry optimization on the model compounds of the postulated intermediates in ziegler – natta catalysis Cl2ZrCH2CH3+ ( 3 ) and Cl2ZrCH-CH2+ ( 4 ) and for comparison on three neutral complexes Cl2Zr(X)CH = CH2 , x = H ( 5 ) , CH3 ( 6 ) , Cl ( 7 ) , show that these species are stabilized through a three - center 2-electron Zr – Hb-C interaction . In <nUm> – <nUm> this interaction is regiospecific and takes place either cis ( 5a ) or trans ( 6b , 7b ) to the Zr – x bond , depending on the steric repulsion between x and hb . the examination of the potential energy surface on the basis of extended huckel calculations on substituted species Cp2ZrC(R1)-CH(R2)+ , R1 = SiMe3 ( 8 ) , CMe3 ( 9 ) and R2 = H ( a ) , me ( b ) , H3Si ( c ) , CMe3 ( d ) , SiMe3 ( e ) , ph ( f ) , reveals that <nUm> and <nUm> can be stabilized through either g-Si ( C ) – C or b-CH agostic interactions , depending on the subtle balance between the electronic and steric effects on R1 and R2 . 
to expand the availability of transition - metal aldehyde complexes for study , a new method for their synthesis has been developed . our first application of this method has been to the synthesis of zirconocene e2-aldehyde complexes . proceeding through a-stannylalkoxide intermediates ( M-OCHR-SnMe3 ) , this route provides ready access to both neutral and anionic complexes under mild conditions . the first x-ray structure of an anionic aldehyde complex is reported . the neutral complexes dimerize producing meso and racemic diastereomers . monomeric zirconaoxiranes are shown to be excluded from the reaction coordinate during insertion and isomerization reactions of these neutral complexes . ( r , S)-[Cp2Zr(e2-OCHCH2CHMe2)]2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21 / c with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , and z = <nUm> . the refinement was carried out with <nUm> observed room temperature reflections to give R(F) = <nUm> % and Rw(F) = <nUm> % . { Cp2Zr(Me) (e2-OCHCH2-CHMe2)Li}2(C4H8O) crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group c2cb with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , and z = <nUm> . the refinement was carried out with <nUm> observed room temperature reflections to give R(F) = <nUm> % and Rw(F) = <nUm> % . 
two rare examples of complexes that contain an acetylide ligand bridging between a main group metal ( aluminum ) and a transition metal ( zirconium ) are described . such complexes are prepared by treatment of dimethylzirconocene with <nUm> molar equiv of (alkynyl)dimethylalummum [(RCC)AlMe2]2 ( r = SiMe3 , cyclohexyl , CMe3 , CH3 ; 2a – d ) . In this reaction an (e2-alkyne)zirconocene complex is probably formed in situ which is then trapped by the excess (alkynyl)dimethylaluminum to yield the complexes Cp2Zr ( m-e1:e2-RCCMe ) ( m-C = CR ) AlMe2 ( 6a – d ) . the complexes 6a ( r = SiMe3 ) and 6b ( r = cyclohexyl ) were characterized by x-ray diffraction . for comparison , we have also carried out the x-ray crystal structure analysis of the [(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]dimethylaluminum dimer 2a . the complexes <nUm> contain a dimetallabicyclic framework . one of the bridgehead positions is a carbon center which is planartetracoordinate . In these complexes the CCR bridge between zirconium and aluminum can be described as being mainly of m-(s-acetylide) character . 
it has been shown that the bis(trimethylsilyl)-acetylene complex of zirconocene Cp2Zr(THF)(Me3SiC2SiMe3) ( 1 ) and the binuclear s-alkenyl complex of zirconium {Cp[m-(e1:e5-C5H4)]Zr[C(SiMe3)CH(SiMe3)]}2 ( 2 ) readily react with carbon dioxide at room temperature to form the dimeric zirconafuranone metallacycle [ formula omitted ] ( 3 ) . under similar conditions the reaction of Cp2Zr(THF)(Me3SiC2SiMe3) and {Cp[m-(e1:e5-C5H4)]MZr[C(SiMe3)CH(SiMe3)]}2with water affords the zirconoxane complex [ Cp2ZrC(SiMe3) = CH(SiMe3)]2O ( 4 ) . the structures of the obtained complexes have been established by x-ray structure analysis . 
two zirconocene derivatives with organic ligands containing a nitrogen substituents have been prepared , and their structures have been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffractometry . the reaction of Cp2Zr(Me)(e2-CHPhNMe2) with C2F3HO2 yields Cp2Zr(O2,CCF3)(e2-CHPhNMe2) ( 8 ) . the reaction of Cp2Zr(CMeNtBu) ( C2F3O2 ) with Cp2Zr(Me)H yields Cp2Zr ( e2-XMeNtBu ) (m-O,O'-O2CHCF3)Zr(Me)Cp2 ( 9 ) . the structure of <nUm> was determined at - <nUm> ° C ; it crystallizes in space group P21 / n , with a = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 5 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , and z = <nUm> . the structure of <nUm> was determined at - <nUm> ° C ; it crystallizes in space group P21 / n , with a = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , and z = <nUm> . In both <nUm> and <nUm> the nitrogen is coordinated inside the carbon and oxygen ligand atoms . 
PhCH(K)NMe2 and LiCH2NMe2 react with zirconocene or hafnocene chlorides in THF to give satisfactory yields of their (dimethylamino)alkyl derivatives . Cp2Zr(R)CH(Ph)NMe2 ( r = Cl , <nUm> ; r = me , <nUm> ) was prepared by treating Cp2Zr(R)Cl with PhCH(K)NMe2 . Cp(e5-C5H4R)M(Cl)CH2N(CH3)2 ( m = Zr , x = Cl , r = H , <nUm> ; m = Hf , x = Cl , r = H , <nUm> ; m = Zr , x = Cl , r = CPh(CH3)2 , <nUm> ) was prepared by treating the appropriate metallocene dichloride with C3H8LiN . acidic reagents ( C2F3HO2 , CpMo(CO)3H , [n-Bu3NH][BPh4] ) cleaved the methyl ligand from <nUm> and gave the -O2CCF3 complex ( 10 ) , the -(m-OC)Mo(CO)2Cp complex ( 12 ) , or the solvated cation ( 13 ) . complex <nUm> did not react with excess C3H8LiN , LiPh , MeI , CO ( g ) ( <nUm> atm ) , or HgNa , but a low yield of its methyl derivative was obtained by treating it with CH3Li . the inequivalence of the n-methyl groups in the 1H NMR spectra of complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> – <nUm> at low temperatures showed that the CH(R)NMe2 ligands were bound in an e2 fashion . simulation of the temperature - dependent 1H NMR spectra of CDCl3 solutions of <nUm> gave DH ‡ and DS ‡ values of <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal / mol and <nUm> ± <nUm> eu , respectively , for n-methyl exchange . the Zr-N interaction energy in <nUm> can thus be estimated at <nUm> kcal / mol . 
generation of “ Cp2Zr ” in the presence of PhPH2 results in P-H activation , affording the intermediate Cp2Zr(PPhH)H. C-H activation and subsequent C-C bond formation yield the Zr (III) diphosphide- and fulvalenidebrkdged complex [(e5-Cp)Zr(m2-PPhH)(m-e5:e5-C5H4C5H4)]2 ( 1 ) . In the analogous reaction employing (2,4,6-t-Bu3C6H2)PH2 , the isolated product is the trimeric , phosphide - capped Zr(IV) species ((e5-Cp)(m-e1:e5-Cp)Zr)3(m3-P) ( 2 ) . C-H activation is evident as metalated cp rings bridge adjacent Zr atoms in a e1:e5-fashion . this compound <nUm> also represents a rare example of a trinuclear organometallic species containing a capping phosphorus atom . further , the structure of <nUm> implies a mechanism for the formation of <nUm> involving the initial formation of a dimer in which the Zr centers are linked by e1:e5-Cp moieties . 
the hydrosilylation of olefins such as styrene , 1-hexene , and 2-pentene with diphenylsilane can be carried out with catalysts generated from zirconocene dichloride and <nUm> equiv of butyllithium . complete regioselectivity is observed as only terminal organosilicon products are produced ( ~ <nUm> % ) . In the case of styrene , three major products are formed : phenethyldiphenylsilane , trans-1-phenyl-2-(diphenylsilyl)ethene , and ethylbenzene . the product distribution was found to be dependent on reagent concentrations : reactions run with excess diphenylsilane favored diphenylphenethylsilane ; excess styrene favored trans-1-(diphenylsilyl)-2-phenylethene . reactivity as a function of silane , olefin , and catalyst was examined . secondary silanes are generally superior to primary and tertiary silanes for hydrosilylation . silane coupling reactions compete with hydrosilylation with less sterically hindered silanes to produce oligomeric products . sterically hindered silanes , such as triphenylsilane , react only at elevated temperature and yield vinylsilane as the major product . extensive H / d exchange is observed in the hydrosilylation of styrene with Ph2SiD2 . stoichiometric reactions indicate that dibutylzirconocene reacts to form a zirconocene - butene complex at room temperature . the possibility of an “ olefin first ” mechanism is discussed . 
attempts to synthesize fused bicyclic thiophenes by zirconocene - mediated cyclization of bis(trimethylsilyl) a,o-diynes led to the isolation of air - stable bis(e <nUm> -cyclopentadienyl)zirconacyclopentadlene complexes when there is a heteroatom ( i.e. oxygen or substituted nitrogen ) tethered between the acetylenes . 
anions of the type [(C2B9H11)2M]-(M = Fe , Co , Ni ) are suitable for use as “ noncoordinating ” anions with [Cp2ZrMe]+ cations.Catalysts generated from Cp2ZrMe2 and[PhNMe2H] [(C2B9H11)2M] are active for the polymerization and copolymerization of ethylene and a-olefins . spectroscopic examination of the cobalt complex indicates that the anion is weakly coordinated to the metal at room temperature . At low temperatures , however , the aniline - coordinated adduct [Cp2ZrMe(NMe2Ph)][(C2B9H11)2M] is present . these catalysts are active in toluene or hexane for the polymerization of ethylene and the copolymerization of ethylene and 1-butene .

alternative reaction modes for a-olefin insertion in a zirconocene alkyl cation are investigated by the extended huckel MO method . agostic interaction of one of the a-H atoms of the migrating alkyl group with the Zr center is found to stabilize the transition state of the preferred reaction mode . essential contributions to this preference are identified by fragment-MO analysis . implications of these findings for stereoselective olefin polymerization by chiral ansa - metallocene derivatives are discussed . 
(Butadiene)zirconocene adds <nUm> molar equiv of aluminum trichloride to give Cp2Zr(m-C4H6)(m-Cl)AlCl2 ( 3 ) . complex <nUm> crystallizes in space group P21 / n with cell parameters a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . In the crystal the butadiene carbon centers C(1) and C(2) are bonded to zirconium ( Zr - C(1) = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , Zr – C(2) = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å ) , whereas the Zr – C(3) separation is large at <nUm> Å . the butadiene C(4) – Al bond length is <nUm> ( 2 ) Å . A “ p-agostic ” interaction may serve to describe the special bonding situation observed in complex <nUm> . 
from cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> and the appropriate lithium phosphinomethanides , the novel complexes cp <nUm> Zr(Cl)[C - ( PMe <nUm> )(X)(Y) ] ( x = H , Y = PMe <nUm> ( 4 ) ; x = H , Y = SiMe <nUm> ( 5 ) ; x = Y = SiMe <nUm> ( 6 ) ) are obtained as crystalline solids and characterized by spectroscopy and by x-ray structure determinations . <nUm> : monoclinic , P2 <nUm> / n , a = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , V = <nUm> Å <nUm> , z = <nUm> , T = − <nUm> ° C , r w = <nUm> , w = <nUm> / σ <nUm> ( F ° ). <nUm> : monoclinic , P2 <nUm> / c , a = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , V = <nUm> Å <nUm> , z = <nUm> , T = − <nUm> ° C , r w = <nUm> . 6*0.5(toluene) : monoclinic , P2 <nUm> / c , a = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , V = <nUm> Å <nUm> , z = <nUm> , T = − <nUm> ° C , r w = <nUm> . In all three complexes <nUm> – <nUm> , the zirconium atom as part of a metallaphosphacyclopropane ring is the most prominent structural feature . whereas the Zr – P ( <nUm> ( 1 ) / <nUm> ( 1 ) Å <nUm> , <nUm> ( 1 ) / <nUm> ( 1 ) Å <nUm> , <nUm> ( 1 ) Å ) as well as the Zr – Cl ( <nUm> , <nUm> ( 1 ) / <nUm> ( 1 ) Å ; <nUm> , <nUm> ( 1 ) / <nUm> ( 1 ) Å <nUm> , <nUm> ( 1 ) Å ) and the Zr – d distances ( where d denotes the centroid of the cyclopentadienyl rings ; <nUm> , <nUm> / <nUm> and <nUm> / <nUm> Å ; <nUm> , <nUm> / <nUm> and <nUm> / <nUm> Å ; <nUm> , <nUm> / <nUm> Å ) are nearly equal , the Zr - C(1) distances differ considerably in going from <nUm> ( <nUm> ( 2 ) / <nUm> ( 2 ) Å ) to <nUm> ( <nUm> ( 5 ) / <nUm> ( 5 ) Å ) and to <nUm> ( <nUm> ( 1 ) Å ) , due to steric congestion . consequently , <nUm> exists in solution as an η <nUm> (P)-coordinated 16e complex , as may be deduced from NMR data . complex <nUm> exists in solution as an equilibrium mixture of isomers <nUm> and 4a , the latter exhibiting a chelating P,P - coordination of the diphosphinomethanide ligand , thus forming the four - membered heterocycle Zr – P – C – P . At elevated temperatures , all phosphorus nuclei equilibrate , obviously via a common intermediate of <nUm> and 4a . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> do not react with CO at ambient temperature and pressure , whereas <nUm> decomposes above <nUm> ° C in solution . 
the novel four - membered chelate complexes cp <nUm> (Cl)Zr[(R <nUm> P ) <nUm> C(X) ] ( r = me , x = SiMe <nUm> ( 4 ) ; r = ph , x = SiMe <nUm> ( 5 ) , r = ph , x = H ( 6 ) ) have been prepared from cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> and the appropriate lithium diphosphinomethanides in et <nUm> O . the compounds have been characterized by their NMR spectra and by x-ray structure determinations of <nUm> and <nUm> . <nUm> : monoclinic , P2 <nUm> / c , a = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , V = <nUm> Å <nUm> , z = <nUm> , T = <nUm> ° C , r w = <nUm> , w = <nUm> / σ <nUm> ( F ° ). 5*2(toluene) : monoclinic , P2 <nUm> / n , a = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , V = <nUm> Å <nUm> , z = <nUm> , T = − <nUm> ° C , r w = <nUm> . In both <nUm> and <nUm> , the cp <nUm> ClZr moiety is coordinated by the [ ( r <nUm> P ) <nUm> C(SiMe <nUm> ) ] − ligands via both P atoms ( η <nUm> ( P,P ) ) , thus forming a four - membered ring . the Zr – P distances are rather long and inequivalent ( <nUm> , <nUm> ( 5 ) / <nUm> ( 5 ) and <nUm> ( 4 ) / <nUm> ( 5 ) Å for two independent molecules ; <nUm> , <nUm> ( d / <nUm> ( 1 ) Å ) . the inequivalence of the phosphorus nuclei and the weak Zr – P interaction in <nUm> – <nUm> can also be deduced from the <nUm> P NMR spectra . these also reveal that <nUm> is not in equilibrium with the η <nUm> (C,P)-coordinated complex , which is at variance with the respective findings for cp <nUm> (Cl)Zr[(PMe <nUm> ) <nUm> CH ] . 
A study has been carried out to examine the factors that influence the overall [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition reactions between imidozirconocene complexes Cp2(THF)Zr = NR ( r = 2,6-i-Pr2C6H3 , 2,6-Me2C6H3 , t-Bu ) and small , unsaturated organic molecules . steric factors in the cycloaddition reactions investigated were found to be significant in both the imido fragment and the heterocumulene reactant partner . when Cp2(THF)Zr = NR ( r = 2,6-Me2C6H3 ) was treated with symmetrical carbodiimides RN = C = NR ( r = t-Bu , i-Pr , SiMe3 cyclohexyl , p-tolyl ) , the corresponding diazametallacycles formed in high yields . however , with the more sterically encumbered zirconocene imido complex Cp2(THF)Zr = NR ( r = 2,6-i-Pr2C6H3 ) , diazametallacycle formation was observed only with the heterocumulenes 1,3-diisopropyl-carbodiimide , 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide , and 1,3-di-p-tolylcarbodiimide . 
A series of singly and doubly bridged ansa - zirconocene dihydride complexes has been prepared from hydrogenation of the corresponding dimethyl complexes . for the singly [SiMe2] - bridged species , the hydrogenation reaction is facile at <nUm> ° C , whereas for the doubly [SiMe2] - bridged complexes hydrogenation occurs over the course of days at <nUm> ° C . hydrogenation of { meso-Me2Si(e5-C5H3-3- CMe3)2}ZrMe2 affords the isomeric dimeric dihydrides [ { meso-Me2Si(e5-C5H3- 3-CMe3)2 } ZrH]2(m2-H)2 , one of which has been characterized by x-ray diffraction . the racemo isomer of Me2Si(e5-C5H2-2- SiMe3-4-CMe3)2ZrMe2 ( BpZrMe2 ) reacts with dihydrogen , affording the first example of a monomeric ansa - zirconocene dihydride , { rac-Me2Si(e5-C5H2-2- SiMe3-4-CMe3)2}ZrH2 ( rac - BpZrH2 ) . In the presence of dinitrogen , rac - BpZrH2 undergoes thermal reductive elimination of H and reaction with N , yielding the dinitrogen complex BpZr(m2,e2,e2-N2)ZrBp , for which the dinitrogen ligand is coordinated in a side-on fashion to both zirconiums with a N - N bond distance of <nUm> Å . the doubly [SiMe2] - bridged zirconium dimethyl complex { (Me2Si)2(e5-C5 H3)2 } ZrMe2 ( RpZrMe2 ) undergoes hydrogenation under forcing conditions , affording the mixed valent ( Zr(IV) / Zr(IV) / Zr (III) ) hydride trimer [RpZr]3(m3-H)2(m2- H)3 , which has been characterized by x-ray diffraction . more substituted doubly [SiMe2] - bridged zirconocene dihydrides such as [ { (Me2Si)2(e5-C5H-3,5- (CHMe2)2)(e5-C5H2-4- CHMeEt}ZrH]2(m2-H)2 [sec-BuThpZrH]2(m2-H)2 ) and [ (Me2Si)2(e5-C5H-2,4- (CHMe2)2)(e5-C5H2- CHMe2)ZrH]2(m2-H)2 ( [iPrThpZrH]2(m2-H)2 ) have been prepared and shown to be robust dimers in solution . 
the reaction of methyl 2-ethylbutyrate with an equimolar amount of lithium diisopropylamide ( LDA ) leads to the formation of the lithium enolate of methyl 2,2,4-triethyl-3-oxohexanoate . further reaction with bis-(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium(methyl)chloride yields a crystalline zirconocene enolate complex , the structure of which was determined by x-ray diffraction . 
(1,2,5,6-Tetramethyl-3,4-dimethylenetricyclo[3.1.0.02,6]hexane)zirconocene ( 2a ) , prepared by irradiation of diene la and diphenylzirconocene , and (2,3-dimethylenebicyclo[2.2.1]heptane)zirconocene ( 2b ) , obtained by reduction of zirconocene dichloride with lithium in the presence of 2,3-dimethylenenorbornane ( lb ) , both react with carbon monoxide under displacement of the conjugated diene forming zirconocene dicarbonyl . envelope - shaped s2 , p-type structures were found for the diene zirconocene units in x-ray diffraction studies of both complexes . 2a crystallizes in space group P1 ( z = <nUm> ) with cell constants o = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , α = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , β = <nUm> ( 8 ) ° γ , and y = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° ( <nUm> observed reflections , r = <nUm> ) . compound 2b crystallizes in space group PI ( z = <nUm> ) with cell constants a = <nUm> ( 7 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 8 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 7 ) Å , α = <nUm> ( 5 ) ° , β = <nUm> ( 5 ) ° , and γ = <nUm> ( 7 ) ° ( <nUm> observed reflections , r = <nUm> ) . comparison of the molecular geometries of (diene)zirconocenes 2a , b , d , e and the zirconaindan <nUm> reveals a continuously increasing metallacyclopentene character . In this series the reactivity of 2a and 2b toward carbon monoxide is markedly less influenced by ground - state effects as compared with that of 2d , 2e , and <nUm> . 
dibenzylzirconocene ( 3a ) and ( s-trans-n4-trans , trans-1,4-diphenylbutadiene)zirconocene ( 5 ) are formed rapidly upon irradiation of benzyl(b-styryl)-zirconocene ( 2a ) in benzene at ambient temperature . trapping and crossover experiments using benzyl chloride and (b-styryl)zirconocene chloride and the kinetic influence of added “ moderators ” trimethyl phosphite and triphenylphosphine in addition to ESR experiments point to a radical reaction mechanism for alkenyl group transfer . transfer and coupling of alkenyl ligands can also be initiated in a dark reaction when starting from methyl(b-styryl)zirconocene ( 2b ) . 
the (1,3-pentadiene)zirconocene complex and its higher homologues of the type (e5-C5H5)2Zr(CR1-(CH3) = = CR2CR3 = CR4H ) were prepared by reaction of (e5-C5H5)2ZrHCl with alkyl-substituted or nonsubstituted pentadienyl anions through novel s-p rearrangement of hydrido-2,4-pentadienylzirconium species . the 1H NMR studies on these complexes revealed that the 1,3-pentadiene and 2,4-hexadiene complexes are composed of ca. <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of s-cis and s-trans isomers while each of the complexes containing 2-methyl-1,3-pentadiene , 3-methyl-1,3-pentadiene , 2,4-dimethyl-1,3-pentadiene , 1-(trimethylsilyl)-1,3- pentadiene , and 1,5-bis(trimethylsilyl)-1,3-pentadiene ligands consists of a single isomer of s-cis structure . the process of hydrogen transfer was elucidated on the basis of the analysis of the stoichiometric reaction between (e5-C5H5)2ZrDCl and (2-methylpentadienyl)potassium . the reaction of (e5-C5H5)2Zr ( 2,4-hexadiene ) with 1-alkenes or 2-butyne showed that the coordinated diene is easily expelled to give zirconacyclopentanes or a zirconacyclopentadiene derivative , respectively . the addition of butanal or 3-pentanone resulted in double insertion into the 2,4-hexadiene moiety to selectively afford 3-hexene-1,6-diols through hydrolysis . 
lithium enolates , e.g. , C2H3LiO , prepared by the reaction of BuLi with THF , or CHLiO = CMe2 , prepared from MeLi and Me3SiOCH = CMe2 , react readily with Cp2MXCl ( x = me , Cl ; m = Ti , Zr ) to give the corresponding enolates Cp2M(OCH = CR2)Me and Cp2M(OCH = CR2)2 ( r = H , me ) . these complexes are thermally quite stable and show no tendency to eliminate aldehyde and form ketene complexes . the crystal structure of Cp2Ti(OC2H3)2 has been determined : orthohombic , pbcn , o = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 5 ) Å , V = <nUm> ( 6 ) A3 <nUm> , z = <nUm> , pcalcd = <nUm> g / cm3 . the molecule has crystallographically imposed C2 symmetry . important bond distances ( A ) and angles ( deg ) are as follows : Ti — cp(centroid) = <nUm> ( 4 ) , cp — Ti — cp = <nUm> ( 1 ) , Ti — O = <nUm> ( 2 ) , C — O = <nUm> ( 4 ) , C = C = <nUm> ( 5 ) , Ti — O — C = <nUm> ( 2 ) , O — C — C = <nUm> ( 2 ) . 
the title compound <nUm> ( Cp2Zr(Cl)CH(CH3)OCH2CH3 , cp = e5-C5H5 ) has been prepared in good yield by treatment of Cp2ZrCl2 with (1-ethoxyethyl)lithium . compound <nUm> is the first example of a stable , structurally characterized secondary zirconocene alkyl derivative which shows no tendency to rearrange to the primary alkyl derivative at room temperature . carbon monoxide and isocyanides react with <nUm> to give migratory insertion products without rearrangement of the 1-ethoxyethyl fragment . At high temperatures , <nUm> decomposes to give ethylene and Cp2Zr(Cl)OCH2CH3 , the same products obtained at ambient conditions from the reaction of Cp2ZrHCl ( schwartz 's reagent ) with ethyl vinyl ether . 
attempts to develop a ring - opening polymerization ( ROP ) approach to polymeric zirconocene complexes are reported . A new silicon - bridged [1][1]zirconocenophane , (SiMe2)2(e5- C5H3)2Zr(NEt2)2 ( 3a ) , was synthesized by reaction of Zr(NEt2)4 with (C5H4)2(SiMe2)2 ( 4 ) . single - crystal x-ray diffraction revealed a highly tilted structure with an angle of <nUm> ° , a significant increase over the untethered compound (e5-MeC5H4)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , which possesses a tilt angle of <nUm> ° . this and the related compounds (SiMe2)(e5-C5H4)2 MCl2 ( 1a , m = Ti ; 1b , m = Zr ) and (SiMe2)2(e5-C5 H3)2ZrCl2 ( 3b ) were tested for transition - metal catalyzed ROP behavior in the presence of pt(0) catalysts but were found to be inactive . the novel spirocyclic silacyclobutane - bridged monomer (CH2)3Si(e5-C5 H4)2ZrCl2 ( 7b ) was prepared via a " fly trap " amine elimination reaction between cyclotrimethylenedicyclopentadienylsilane ( 8 ) and Zr(NMe2)4 ; this initially yielded (CH2)3Si(e5-C5 H4)2Zr(NMe2)2 ( 7a ) , which was converted to 7b by reaction with a slight excess of Me3SiCl . 7a and 7b were characterized by 29Si , 13C , and 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry as well as single - crystal x-ray diffraction . both showed moderate tilt angles ( <nUm> ° and <nUm> ° , respectively ) as well as highly strained silacyclobutane rings with C-Si-C bond angles of <nUm> ° and <nUm> ° , respectively . transition - metal - catalyzed ROP of 7b led to the formation of the polycarbosilane [ (CH2)3Si(e5-C5 H4)2ZrCl2]n ( 10 ) . both the soluble and insoluble fractions of <nUm> were characterized by CP - MAS 29Si and 13C NMR , and the soluble , oligomeric fraction was further characterized by solution 29Si , 13C , and 1H NMR . complexes 7a , 7b , and polyzirconocene <nUm> were found to exhibit moderate activity as ethylene polymerization catalysts . 
treatment of the reagent [C5H4B(C6F5)3] Na,Li*Et2O ( 4 ) with zirconocene dichloride gave the neutral tris(cyclopentadienyl)Zr-betaine - type complex (e5-Cp)2[e5-C5H4B (C6F5)3]Zr ( 1 ) . In the crystal complex <nUm> contains the three e-cyclopentadienide ligands in a nearly trigonal - planar coordination around zirconium with a pronounced Zr-F-C(aryl) coordination perpendicular to it . the Zr-F bond length is <nUm> Å . the Zr-F-C(aryl) coordination is persistent in solution . the activation energy of the reversible cleavage of the Zr-F linkage of <nUm> was determined as DG ‡ ( Zr - f)diss(253 K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 by dynamic 19F NMR spectroscopy in toluene-d8 . 
( e6-Phenol ) tricarbonylchromium complexes are conveniently converted to [(e6-phenoxide)Cr(CO)3]- species on treatment with aqueous base . the phenoxide chromium anions , which are readily isolated as crystalline tetraethylammonium salts , react with main - group electrophiles ( (p-tol)SO2Cl or C2ClF3O ) to produce new sulfonate - and carboxylate - substituted arene chromium complexes . similar reactions between the phenoxide anions and metal electrophiles ( CpFe(CO)3 + or Cp2ZrCl2 ) result in electron - transfer reactions that consume the starting arene complexes . transition - metal complexes bearing (e-phenoxide)Cr(CO)3 ligands are conveniently prepared through alcoholysis reactions with metal alkoxide and metal dimethylamide precursors . an x-ray crystallographic study of Cp2Zr{(e-OC6H5)Cr(CO)3}2 was carried out . for <nUm> unique intensity data collected by using Cu ka radiation in a θ – 2th scan procedure , the space group for the molecule was determined to be pnma with unit cell parameters a = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 5 ) Å , and c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å . the refinement converged to an R(F) of <nUm> and an RW(F) of <nUm> . the molecule shows general structural features common to other bent zirconocene and p-arene chromium complexes but shows some unexpected features associated with the Zr - aryloxide bonding . little evidence is found for either steric interactions between the (e-OC6H5)Cr(CO)3 units or for Zr-O π bonding . the o-arene bond does show a small degree of multiple - bond character . this observation is supported by the deviation of the O-C arene vector from the least - squares arene plane , suggesting that a small degree of a cyclohexadienone resonance form is contributing to Zr - arene bonding .

bis(alkynyl)zirconocene and -hafnocene complexes (R1Cp)2M(C ≡ CR)2 ( 6 ) were prepared by reacting metallocene dihalides (R1Cp)2MCl2 ( R1 = H , CH3 , terf - butyl ) with alkynyl anion equivalents . subsequent comproportionation of <nUm> with additional (R1Cp)2MCl2 yielded mono(alkynyl)metallocene chlorides <nUm> . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were treated with zirconocenes (R2Cp)2Zr , generated in situ from the corresponding (e4-butadiene)metallocene systems to give binuclear alkynyl-bridged complexes (R1Cp)2M(m-Cl)(m-C ≡ CR)Zr(CpR2)2 ( 9 ) or (R1Cp2)M(m-C ≡ CR)2Zr(CpR2)2 ( 10 ) , respectively ( m = Zr , Hf ; R1 R2 = H , CH3 , t-Bu ; r = CH3 , ph ) . the x-ray crystal structure analysis of Cp2Zr(C ≡ CCH3)2 ( 6a ) revealed no noticeable conjugative interaction of the 16-electron d0-configurated early - transition - metal center with the acetylenic p-system . complex 6a crystallizes in space group pnc2 with cell constants a = <nUm> ( 7 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 9 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 5 ) Å ; d(Zr-C(1)) = <nUm> ( 3 ) , C(1) - C(2) = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å ; C(1)-Zr-C(1*) = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , Zr-C(1)-C(2) = <nUm> ( 3 ) ° . In contrast , the metal-acetylide unit in the Cm symmetric (H3CCp)2Zr(C ≡ CPh ) dimer ( 10f ) has a much shorter Zr-Ca bond ( <nUm> ( 2 ) Å ) , as revealed by x-ray diffraction . together with the other pertinent bonding features [ d(Ca ≡ cb ) = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å ; . Zr*-Ca / cb = <nUm> ( 2 ) / <nUm> ( 2 ) Å ; Zr***Zr* = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å ; Ca***Ca* = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å ] this indicates a substantial p-interaction between the metal and the C ≡ CR unit of the binuclear complexes of type <nUm> . nevertheless , complexes <nUm> are highly fluxional — the alkynyl ligands undergo rapid intramolecular exchange between adjacent metal centers ( DG* ≈ <nUm> – <nUm> kcal / mol ) . for one example , the (t-BuCp)2Zr(m-C ≡ CCH3)2ZrCp2 system , the temperature - dependent dynamic NMR spectra have disclosed the presence of a novel c2v symmetric binuclear species ( 13a ) equilibrating with the Cs symmetric doubly alkynyl-bridged complex 10d . this may indicate that in such systems the automerization process by sequential s-alkynyl ligand migrations ( via <nUm> ) is favored over the concerted exchange involving the common d2h symmetric transition state . 
A series of (alkoxymethyl)zirconocene chlorides ( <nUm> , Cp2Zr(Cl)CH2OR , cp = e5-C5H5 ) has been prepared by treatment of Cp2ZrCl2 with (alkoxymethyl)lithium reagents . compound lc , Cp2Zr(Cl)CH2OCH2C6H5 , crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group pbca , with a = <nUm> ( 9 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 9 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 8 ) Å , and z = <nUm> . the x-ray crystal structure shows that the alkoxymethyl ligand is e2 , with a significant Zr-O interaction . compounds <nUm> with r = benzyl or substituted benzyl undergo a wittig rearrangement when heated to give products <nUm> ( Cp2Zr(Cl)OCH2R ) . the activation parameters that were determined for the transformation , the effects of substituents on the rate of the reaction , the identity of the reaction 's side products , and the retention of configuration at the benzylic carbon are all consistent with the formation of a short - lived radical pair intermediate . 
thermally generated (e2-1,2-didehydrobenzene)titanocene and - zirconocene react with hexacarbonylmolybdenum or - tungsten at <nUm> ° C to give five - membered metallacyclic titan - and zirconoxycarbene complexes <nUm> . the carbene complex Cp2ZrOC[ = W(CO)5]C6H4 ( 4a ) is an organometallic lewis acid . At room temperature 4a adds <nUm> equiv of acetophenone giving the adduct <nUm> [ IR dvc = <nUm> = <nUm> cm-1 ; 13C NMR ( acetophenone carbonyl C ) dd = + <nUm> ppm ) . complex 4a is oligomeric in the solid state . bridging between the monomeric units occurs by formation of [W] — C ≡ O — [Zr] connections using the CO group at tungsten trans to the carbene ligand . In contrast , (Me3CCp)2ZrOC( = C11H4O5W ( <nUm> g ) is monomeric in the crystal ; the bulky tert-butyl cp substituents shield the electrophilic zirconium center effectively from nucleophilic attack . complex <nUm> g crystallizes in space group P43 with cell constants a = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . the metallacycle 4a reacts with phenol to give the zirconoxycarbene complex Cp2Zr(OPh)OC[ = W(CO)5]C6H5 ( 10 ) . complex <nUm> crystallizes in space group P212121 with cell constants a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . At ambient temperature <nUm> reacts with the ylide Ph3P = CH2 to yield the zirconium enolate Cp2Zr(OPh)OCPh = CH2 ( 14 ) which serves as a carbon nucleophile in the aldol condensation reaction with benzaldehyde . the <nUm> to <nUm> transformation can be regarded as an organometallic equivalent of the elusive wittig olefination reaction of a carboxylate salt . 
the first examples of a new class of main - group metallacycles , 4,5-didehydro-2-thiastibolanes , have been synthesized . these compounds were prepared via transmetalation from zirconocene metallacycles . the x-ray crystal structures of the 1-chloro-4,5-dlmethyl-4,5-didehydro-2-thiastibolane ( 4a ) and the 1-bromo-4,5-diphenyl-4,5-didehydro-2-thiastibolane ( 5b ) are reported . 
the metathesis of Li2[X(C6H4)2] with <nUm> equiv of (C5H5)ZrCl3-2THF or (C5Me5)ZrCl3 offers a convenient method for the preparation of several binuclear zirconocenophane complexes [X(C5H4)2][(C5R5)ZrCl2]2 , where x = CH2 or SiMe2 and r = H or me . hydrolysis of [X(C5H4)2][(C5H5)ZrCl2]2 in the presence of aniline affords the corresponding oxo-bridged derivatives [X(C5H4)2] [(C5H5)ZrCl]2(m-O) . these compounds have been characterized by 1H and 13C NMR measurements and elemental analyses . the molecular structures of [SiMe2(C5H4)2][(C5Me5)ZrCl2]2 and [SiMe2(C5H4)2][(C5H5)ZrCl]2(m-O) were determined by x-ray diffraction methods and provided the opportunity to evaluate the structural response of the [SiMe2(C5H4)2]2- ligand to changes in the coordination environment of the two Zr centers . [SiMe2-(C5H4)2][(C5Me5)ZrCl2]2*1 / 2C7H8 crystallizes in a triclinic unit cell of PI symmetry with a = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , α = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , β = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , γ = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , V = <nUm> ( 8 ) A3 , z = <nUm> , and dcalcd = <nUm> g / cm3 , whereas [SiMe2(C5H4)2][(C5H5)ZrCl]2(m-O) crystallizes in a monoclinic crystal lattice of P21 / c symmetry with a = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , V = <nUm> ( 1 ) A3 , z = <nUm> , and dcalcd = <nUm> g / cm3 . full - matrix least - squares refinements ( based on F02 ) of diffractometry data converged with final discrepancy indices of R(F0) = <nUm> with s1 = <nUm> and R(F0) = <nUm> with s1 = <nUm> , respectively . 
reaction of the isodicyclopentadienide anion with RCpTiCl3 ( r = H , CH3 , t-Bu ) and Cp'TiCl3 in tetrahydrofuran solution at-78 ° C is shown to proceed stereoselectively with formation of endo titanocene dichloride complexes . when the same reactions are performed at <nUm> ° C up to the reflux temperature of the solvent , the stereoisomeric exo complexes are cleanly formed instead . control experiments have not led to the interconversion of these isomer pairs . comparable reaction of isodiCpLi with CpZrCl3 and Cp'ZrCl3 in boiling tetrahydrofuran also delivered only exo complexes . the structural parameters of several products , as defined by x-ray crystallographic analysis , are discussed . the endo complexes appear to be more sterically constrained than the exo isomers . their formation at low temperatures is thought to be kinetically controlled and to stem from electronic features imparted to the cp anion portion of the isodicyclopentadienyl ligand by its fused norbornyl framework . 
reaction of phenyl(trimethylsilyl)acetylene with hydridozirconocene chloride yields the b-CH agostic alkenylzirconocene chloride formula - omitted ( 2a ) . halogen exchange with lithium bromide or iodide produces the analogous alkenylzirconocene bromide 2b and iodide 2c , respectively . In contrast , hydrozirconation of (trimethylsilyl)acetylene gives Cp2ZrCl( — CH = CHSiMe3 ) ( 4 ) , exhibiting the bulky SiMe3 substituent at the b-position of the a-alkenyl ligand , which lacks the b-agostic metal-C-H interaction that is characteristic of <nUm> . the molecular structures of 2b and <nUm> were determined by x-ray diffraction . complex 2b crystallizes in space group P21 / n with cell constants a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . the alkenylmetallocene <nUm> crystallizes in space group P21 / c with cell parameters o = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . model calculations have confirmed that steric in addition to electronic factors are mainly responsible for the formation of the b-CH agostic interaction in the alkenylzirconocene complexes <nUm> . 
hydrozirconation of phenyl(trimethylsilyl)acetylene at ambient temperature yields mixtures of the b-CH agostic alkenylmetallocene complex [ inline formula omitted ] zirconocene dichloride ( 5 ) , and the metallacyclopentadiene Cp2ZrC(SiMe3) = CPhCPh = C(SiMe3) ( 3a ) . the last product probably is formed from 2a and [Cp2Zr(H)Cl] via hydride / chloride exchange , producing the intermediate [ inline formula omitted ] the intermediate [ inline formula omitted ] ( 4a ) , which loses dihydrogen and adds <nUm> equiv of Me3SiC = CPh to give 3a . photolysis of 2a also yields a mixture of 3a and <nUm> . complex 3a was characterized by x-ray diffraction . it crystallizes in space group C2 / c with cell parameters a = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . the reaction of 2a with lithioacetylides CLi = CR ( r = CH3 , ph ) produces metallacycles as well . the complexes [ inline formula omitted ] ( 3b,c ) are thought to be produced via b-CH agostic alkenylalkynylmetallocene intermediates [ inline formula omitted](4b,c) . intramolecular abstraction of the acidic agostic alkenyl proton by the a-alkynyl ligand directly leads to the formation of bis(alkyne)metallocene complexes ( 7b,c ) , which undergo rapid ring closure to give 3b and 3c , respectively . complex 3c ( r = ph ) was characterized by x-ray diffraction . it crystallizes in space group P21 / n with cell parameters a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and rw = <nUm> . from EHMO model calculations it is suggested that the “ anomalous ” hydrozirconation of diphenylacetylene , for example , which cleanly gives Cp2ZrCl2 and the metallacycle [ inline formula omitted ] also proceeds via intermediate b-CH agostic ( alkenyl ) Cp2Zr(X) type intermediates . 
the first structurally characterized transitionmetal complex of cyclobutene is described . the complex is formed by the elimination of methane from cyclobutylmethylzirconocene with subsequent trapping by trimethylphosphine . the reactivity of the complex with unsaturated organic molecules and its x-ray crystal structure are reported . 
the crystal and molecular structures of ( s-cis-2,3-dimethylbutadiene ) hafnocene ( 3b ) , (1,2-bis(methylene)cyclohexane)zirconocene ( 4a ) , and (1,2-bis(methylene)cyclohexane)hafnocene ( 4b ) have been determined from x-ray data . 3b crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group pnma with a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , V = <nUm> A3 , and dcalcd = <nUm> g cm-3 for z = <nUm> . full - matrix least - squares refinement of <nUm> parameters with <nUm> unique observed reflections converged at r = <nUm> . it is isostructural with the previously reported (s-ds-2,3-dimethylbutadiene)zirconocene complex ( 3a ) . 4a crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1 with a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , α = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , β = <nUm> ( 7 ) ° , γ = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and dcalcd = <nUm> g cm-3 for z = <nUm> . refinement of <nUm> parameters based on <nUm> reflections led to a final r of <nUm> . 4b crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21 / n with a = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 9 ) ° , V = <nUm> A3 , and dcalcd = <nUm> g cm-3 for z = <nUm> . refinement of <nUm> parameters with <nUm> reflections produced r = <nUm> . In all three complexes the diene is e4-bonded to the metallocene fragments with the metals in a ps-tetrahedral coordination . the bonds of the diene termini to the metals are noticeably shorter than those of the internal C atoms of the dienes . the respective bond lengths ( 3b , <nUm> (5)-2.641 ( 5 ) Å ; 4a , <nUm> ( 2 ) – <nUm> ( 6 ) Å ; 4b , <nUm> (8)-2.72 ( 1 ) Å ) are in a range typical for M-C σ and π bonds of the respective elements . together with the other geometrical parameters of the diene-metallocene frameworks they allow the following generalizations : ( a ) (s-cis-e4-diene)zirconocenes and -hafnocenes are best described as s2,p complexes , ( b ) the σ / π ratio in the metal-diene bonding is smaller for the zirconocene complexes than for their Hf analogues , ( c ) this ratio is smaller for 3b than for 4b , a trend which is similar in the previously reported (s-cis-e4-2,3-dimethylbutadiene)zirconocene ( 3a ) and 4a , and ( d ) , Zr-C bonds are slightly longer than their Hf counterparts . differences in the chemical behavior of corresponding ( s-cis - conjugated diene)zirconocene and -hafnocene complexes can be rationalized in view of their characteristic structural features . 
the reactivity of [(e5-C5H4CH3)2ZrH(m-H)]2 with various substituted acetylenes has been investigated . diphenylacetylene and phenylacetylene react with [(e5-C5H4CH3ZrH(m-H)]2 below <nUm> ° C to yield primarily (e5-C6H4CH3)2Zr(C4(C6H5)4) and the 2,5-diphenyl-substituted isomer of (e5-C5H4CH3)2Zr(C4(C6H5)2) , respectively . under appropriate conditions substantial hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene to trans-stilbene and phenylacetylene to ethylbenzene , respectively , is observed . these results suggest that at least two competing processes — zirconacyclopentadiene formation and acetylene hydrogenation — are present . complementary EPR studies for the reactions of [(e5-C5H4CH3)2ZrH(m-H)]2 with diphenylacetylene , 1-phenylpropyne , and 2-butyne have further revealed the formation of a paramagnetic zirconocene species (e5-C5H4CH3)2Zr(H)(RC ≡ CR ) . the possible participation of this adduct in the acetylene chemistry of [(e5-C5H4CH3)2ZrH(m-H)]2 is discussed . 
an electrochemical cell designed to work in the cavity of an ESR spectrometer at variable temperatures was used to study the electrochemical reduction of zirconocene compounds Cp2ZrX2 ( x = halogen ( hal ) ; cp = e5-C5H5 ) and Cp2Zr(CH3)2 in THF . it is shown that in each case zirconocene(III) species are formed . on the basis of their spectral parameters they are characterized as the anion radicals (Cp2ZrX2)- . for x = Cl , Br , and CH3 and as the monohalide Cp2ZrX for x = I . halogen hyperfine interactions are resolved for the first time . for x = Cl and Br , electrochemical reduction in the presence of PMe3 and PMePh2 yields spectra attributable to the species Cp2ZrX(PMe3) and Cp2ZrX(PMePh2) . 
the reactions of methylenetriphenyl-phosphorane with |Cp2Zr(H)Cl]x , Cp2Zr(CH3)2 , and Cp2Zr(C6H5)2 have been studied . At <nUm> ° C methylene transfer from CH2 = PPh3 to the hydridozirconocene chloride occurs producing methylzirconocene chloride and triphenylphosphine . In contrast to dimethylzirconocene , which turns out to be unreactive up to <nUm> ° C , diphenylzirconocene at <nUm> ° C reacts with the ylide to form Cp2Zr(C6H5)CHPPh3 ( 1c ) . this reaction proceeds through an (e2-aryne)zirconocene intermediate as revealed by a labeling experiment . the Cp2Zr(C6H5) - substituted ylide has been characterized by NMR spectra at various temperatures and an x-ray structure analysis . 1c crystallizes in space group pbca with a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , and z = <nUm> . the preferred conformation and a rather short Zr-C7 bond distance ( <nUm> ( 4 ) Å ) indicate substantial p-interaction of the Zr-C(ylide) linkage . 
photolysis of diphenylzirconocene ( 5 ) at low temperature ( <nUm> ° C ) in the presence of the isomerically pure dienes (Z,Z)- and (Z,E)-2,4-hexadiene ( 8a ) and (Z,Z)- and (Z,E)-1,4-diphenylbutadiene ( 8b ) , respectively , leads to the stereospecific formation of the corresponding ( s-trans-e4 - conjugated diene)zirconocene complexes 1a-ZZ , 1a-ZE , 1b-ZZ , and 1b-ZE . upon thermolysis , 1a-ZZ ( t1 / <nUm> ≈ <nUm> min at <nUm> ° C ) first rearranges to give 1a-ZE exclusively , which consecutively rearranges to a thermodynamic <nUm> / <nUm> mixture of <nUm> a EE / 3a-EE at higher temperature ( + <nUm> ° C ) . similarly , 1b-ZE undergoes a thermally induced geometrical isomerization at + <nUm> ° C to form 1b-EE / 3b-EE ( <nUm> / <nUm> ) . the same product mixture is obtained directly from 1b-ZZ at + <nUm> ° C . the observed stepwise loss of the stereochemical information at the terminal carbon centers of the conjugated diene ligands of <nUm> indicates a rearrangement process proceeding through a p-allyl-type intermediate ( 4 ) . this interpretation is supported by the result of an extended huckel calculation : an approximate transition state ( 10a ' ) for a related isomerization process with an unsubstituted butadiene system can be reached by rotating this ligand around a Zr - cterm bond ( <nUm> ° ) , lifting the exposed CH2 group by <nUm> ° , and rotating it <nUm> ° . A barrier of <nUm> kcal / mol was computed . the orbitals of 10a are in agreement with the formulation of an allyl complex . A low - lying LUMO predominantly localized at the exposed CH2 moiety indicates carbenium ion character at this carbon . terminal p-donor substituents at the butadiene ligand cause a drop of the rearrangement barrier to <nUm> kcal / mol , which can be explained by means of delocalization of carbenium p orbital character into filled wave functions of the p-donor residue . stereochemistry and calculations have thus revealed a third general mechanistic pathway for an intramolecular diene transition - metal complex isomerization : rearrangement through p-allyl-type intermediates <nUm> can be of importance in addition to the established diene rotation and topomerization mechanisms . 
parallel thermolysis ( at <nUm> ° C in solution ) and photolysis ( <nUm> ° C ) studies of [(e5-C5H4CH3)2ZrH(m-H)]2 , <nUm> , and {[SiR2(C5H4)2]ZrH(m-H)}2(R = ch3 , 2a ; r = C2H5 , 2b ; r = n-C3H7 , 2c ) have shown that these dinuclear zirconocene hydride complexes reductively eliminate H . In each case , this process is accompanied by the initial formation of a paramagnetic zirconocene hydride species , which exhibits a hydride doublet with A(1H) = <nUm> g in the corresponding solution EPR spectrum . the results from a low temperature gas chromatographic analysis of the gas mixture containing H , HD , and d2generated during the thermolysis of <nUm> in the presence of a large excess of d2are consistent with deuterium incorporation into the methylcyclopentadienyl rings and the hydride positions . further evidence for the involvement of the methylcyclopentadienyl rings during the thermolysis of <nUm> is provided by the fact that <nUm> equiv of h2are eliminated per equivalent of <nUm> . comparable experiments conducted on <nUm> , however , clearly reveal that the chelating [SiR2(C5H4)2]2- ligand significantly restricts the chemical participation of the rings . linking the rings with a dialkylsilyl bridge reduces the number of equivalents of h2evolved per equivalent of <nUm> to ca. two upon prolonged thermolysis and stabilizes the corresponding paramagnetic zirconocenophane hydride species produced during the initial reductive elimination step . A series of consecutive solution EPR experiments have demonstrated that this Zr(III)-H intermediate undergoes reversible H / d exchange at the hydride position . complementary NMR measurements have further confirmed that deuterium incorporation is restricted to only the hydride positions of <nUm> . the role of paramagnetic zirconocene hydride species in these H / d exchange reactions is discussed . 
the compounds cp <nUm> ScR ( cp = r = H , me , p-tol ) react readily with nitriles R'CN to provide azomethine complexes cp <nUm> ScNC(R)R ‘ containing a C = N double bond <nUm> – <nUm> cm <nUm> ). if is used , further reaction may occur to give products containing two nitriles . the related complex cp <nUm> HZr <nUm> will insert two nitriles in a stepwise manner ; however , the dimethyl analogue is unreactive toward nitriles . the compounds cp <nUm> ScNC(H)R may be hydrogenated under relatively mild conditions to yield the corresponding amide complexes this transformation is reversible ; addition of ethylene leads to dehydrogenation of the amide complex and production of ethane . the amide complexes may be independently synthesized by reaction of cp <nUm> ScR ( r = H , me ) and the corresponding amine , with resultant elimination of hydrogen or methane , respectively . cp <nUm> CH2NSc <nUm> CMe <nUm> will catalytically hydrogenate ( <nUm> atm of H <nUm> ) me <nUm> CCN to me <nUm> CCH <nUm> NH <nUm> ; however , termination occurs by insertion of the nitrile into the scandium - amide bond to form cp <nUm> ScNC(CMe <nUm> )NHCH <nUm> CMe <nUm> , the NC bond of which is not hydrogenated under these conditions . labeling experiments show that hydrogen can add reversibly across the Sc-N bond of the amide , and this step is believed to play a crucial role in the catalytic reaction . 
(e2-Benzophenone)zirconocene has been obtained by the thermolysis of (e2-benzoyl)phenylzirconocene . In the solid state this (e2-ketone)metallocene complex adopts a dimeric structure and crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21 / n with lattice parameters a = <nUm> ( 4 ) A , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) A , c = <nUm> ( 5 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , V = <nUm> ( 1.6 ) A3 , and z = <nUm> . In [(e5-C5H5)2Zr(e2-OC(C6H5)2)]2(3) , the two independent three - membered Zr-O-C rings , which contain short zirconium-oxygen bonds ( zr1 – O1 = <nUm> ( 2 ) , zr2 – O = <nUm> ( 2 ) A ) and long zirconium-carbon distances ( zr1 – C1 = <nUm> ( 3 ) , Zr2-C2 = <nUm> ( 3 ) A ) , are linked together by relatively weak zr1 – O ( <nUm> ( 2 ) A ) and zr2 – ol ( <nUm> ( 2 ) A ) bonds . In contrast to many other oligomeric (e2-ketone)- and (e2-aldehyde)MCp2 complexes , the central four - membered zr202- unit in <nUm> is nonplanar with a folding angle of <nUm> ° . In solution <nUm> reacts with electron - deficient transition metal or main - group metal hydrides to form <nUm> : <nUm> adducts containing the monomeric (e2-benzophenone)zirconocene unit . the reaction of <nUm> with (Cp2ZrH2)x yields the binuclear complex Cp2Zr(m-e1(O):e2-OC(C6H5)2)(m-H)ZrCp2H ( 17 ) . the corresponding <nUm> : <nUm> adduct between Cp2Zr(e2-OC(C6H5)2) and hafnocene dihydride undergoes a thermally induced “ dyotropic ” rearrangement to give an equilibrium mixture of Cp2Zr(m-e1(0):e2-0C(C6H5)2)(m-H)ZfCp2H ( 18 ) and Cp2Hf(m-e1(0):e2-OC(C6H5)2)(m-H)ZrCp2H ( 19 ) . the reaction of <nUm> with methylenetriphenylphosphorane proceeds with ring opening of the metallaoxirane structural subunit . transfer of one ylide hydrogen to the carbonyl carbon atom of the former e2-ketone ligand leads to the formation of the metallocene - substituted phosphorus ylide Cp2Zr(OCHPh2)(CHPPh3) ( 25 ) . 
the metathesis of lithium (diphenylphosphino)cyclopentadienide with bis(tetrahydrofuran)tetrachlorozirconium in benzene leads to the formation of [(C6H5)2P(C5H4)]2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) in <nUm> % yield . this functionalized canted zirconocene species readily displaces the norbornadiene from (norbornadiene)-tetracarbonylmolybdenum to give [(C6H5)2P(C5H4)]2ZrCl2Mo(CO)4 ( 2 ) in <nUm> % yield . the CO stretches observed in the infrared spectrum of <nUm> are consistent with cis-disubstituted molybdenum tetracarbonyl complexes L2Mo(CO)4 , where L2 = 2PPh3 or (CH2PPh2)2 . this heterobinuclear complex forms triclinic crystals of P1 symmetry from chloroform / hexanes . the refined lattice parameters are a = <nUm> ( 2 ) A , b = <nUm> ( 3 ) A , c = <nUm> ( 4 ) A , a = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , β = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , y = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° , V = <nUm> ( 7 ) A3 , and rcalcd = <nUm> g cm-3 . full - matrix least - squares refinement ( based on F02 ) converged with final discreptancy indices of R(F0) = <nUm> and R(F[?]2) = <nUm> . the zirconium - molybdenum separation in <nUm> of <nUm> ( 3 ) A rules out any direct metal - metal interaction . the structure of <nUm> is remarkable in that , despite the chelation of the molybdenum atom by <nUm> , the coordination spheres of both metals show very little difference from the individual mononuclear components , zirconocene dichloride and (bis(diphenylphosphino)methane)-tetracarbonylmolybdenum . the chloride atoms in <nUm> can be substituted by methyl groups via reaction with methylmagnesium bromide to give [(C6H5)2P(C5H4)]2Zr(CH3)2Mo(CO)4 ( 3 ) in <nUm> % yield . 
: reaction of tert-butyl isocyanide and cyclo-hexyl isocyanide with dihydride led to multiple insertions into the Zr-H bond and to simultaneous reductive coupling of iso-cyanides with the formation of an unusual zirconacycle : current interest in the reduction of carbon monoxide has led to studies of the reactivity of CO with various zirconocene hydrides which have resulted in the observation of C-C bond formation.la , bas well as simple CO reduction by these complexes.10Examination of the reactivity of zirconocene hydrides has recently been extended to reactivity with isocyanides , which are isoelectronic with CO.12Specifically , interest has focused on the question of whether CO insertion into a Zr-H bond is thermodynamically feasible and , by analogy , whether such a process occurs in the cp2ZrH2-isocyanide system . another aspect of this chemistry concerns the role that the cp ligand plays . it has been noted that alkyl sub-stituents on the cp ring increase the ligand to metal electronic donation , thereby heightening metal basicity . 
reduction of dichlorobis(175-cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) ( 3 ) with <nUm> equiv of sodium amalgam ( Na / Hg ) gives the dinuclear e5:e6-fulvalene complex <nUm> of composition and the <nUm> in <nUm> % yield each ; both compounds represent Ti (III) species . the chloro-bridged complex <nUm> undergoes quick oxidation upon exposure to air , thus yielding the Ti(IV) derivative ( 6 ) . reduction of <nUm> with lithium triethylhydridoboranate cleanly gives “ titanocene ” <nUm> , with the latter compound representing a good starting material for the synthesis of the sulfido-bridged fulvalene complex ( 7 ) . compound <nUm> in turn undergoes a sulfur / oxygen exchange reaction when treated with molecular oxygen ; in this case , the oxo- / sulfido-bridged derivative ( 8 ) is formed . 
reactions of the isodicyclopentadienide anion with TiCl3in tetrahydrofuran at <nUm> ° C , with ZrCl4in dimethoxyethane at reflux for <nUm> h , and with HfCl4in dimethoxyethane ( reflux , <nUm> h ) have been performed in order to assess the x-facial stereoselectivity of complexation to group <nUm> transition metals . In all three instances , a single complex was isolated . x-ray crystallographic analysis of the titanocene and zirconocene dichlorides demonstrate both to be the result of dual coordination to the exo surfaces . by NMR 1H comparison , the hafnocene is shown to be closely similar and therefore of the same stereochemistry . the three - dimensional features of the complexes are discussed . 
thermally in situ generated (i2-1,2-di-dehydrobenzene)zirconocene reacts with M(CO)6(M = W , Mo ) to give the benzannelated five - membered metal - lacyclic zirconoxycarbene complexes 4a,b . controlled hydrolysis of 4a ( m = W ) with CuS04*5H20 yields the tetranuclear Zr-O-Zr - bridged bis(carbene) complex [(C0)5W-C(Ph)0-Cp2Zr-0-ZrCp2-0C(Ph)-W(C0)5] ( 5a ) . the molecular structure of the molybdenum analogue 5b was determined by x-ray diffraction . 5b crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2 / c with cell parameters a = <nUm> ( 5 ) A , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) A c = <nUm> ( 2 ) A , and <nUm> = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° . 5b is characterized by a completely planar c-framework ( Zr-O-Zr* = <nUm> ° ) . the most remarkable structural feature of 5b is the trans arrangement of the voluminous (CO)5Mo-carbene units at the Zr-O-Zr bridge . this favored antiperiplanar conformation is unique among the family of early - transltion - metal Cp2M(X)-0-M(X)Cp2compounds . 
the ( s-cis- / s-trans-e4-butadiene)zirconocene equilibrium mixture ( <nUm> / <nUm> = <nUm> / <nUm> ) reacts with CpCo(CO)2at ambient temperature to give the metallacyclic fischer - type carbene complex Cp2Zr(C4H6)(OC = )Co - (CO)Cp , <nUm> . the (s-trans-diene)metallocene complex reacts much faster with the metal carbonyl than the more nucleophilic (S-cis-C4H6)ZrCp2isomer . the product of this nonnucleophilic carbene complex forming reaction , <nUm> , was characterized by x-ray diffraction . it crystallizes in the space group P21 / c with cell constants a = <nUm> ( 2 ) , b = <nUm> ( 4 ) , and c = <nUm> ( 3 ) A and β = <nUm> ( 2 ) ° . complex <nUm> is characterized by a rather short Co-C(carbene) bond length of <nUm> ( 4 ) A . At ambient temperature in solution <nUm> rapidly equilibrates with the starting components Cp2Zr(butadiene) and CpCo(CO)2 . At equilibrium the carbene complex is favored by <nUm> / <nUm> . substitution of a Cl on the cp ring of the CpCo moiety shifts the equilibrium ratio further to the side of the zirconoxycarbene complex : (e5-C5H5)2Zr-(C4H6)(OC = )(CO)(e5-C5H4Cl) ⇄ Cp2Zr(butadiene) + (e5-c5h4c1)co(co)2 ( > <nUm> / <nUm> ) . 
reaction of (butadiene)zirconocene with hexacarbonyltungsten yields the metallacyclic (tt-allyl)-zirconoxycarbene complex Cp2ZrOC[ = W(CO)5]C4H6 ( 2 ) . subsequent coupling with pinacolone gives the nine - membered metallacycle irarcs-Cp2ZrOC[ = W(CO)5]CH2CH = CHCH2CMe(CMe3)0 ( 3 ) . both compounds <nUm> and <nUm> show a very low fischer carbene complex reactivity . hydrolytic removal of the zirconocene moiety transforms the rather unreactive zirconoxycarbene complexes into conventional heteroatom - stabilized transition - metal carbene complexes . thus , treatment of <nUm> with water in tetrahydrofuran generates a hydroxycarbene tungsten complex in situ , which is efficiently trapped by added excess diazomethane to yield the enol ether CH2 = C4H6O = CHCH2CMe(CMe3)OH as the major reaction product . similarly , controlled hydrolysis of <nUm> in the presence of pyridine n-oxide gives C3H4O2 = CHCH2CMe(CMe3)OH . the reaction of <nUm> with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride trihydrate in tetrahydrofuran cleaves the metallacycle to give a zirconium - free acylmetallate anion ( Bu4N+ counterion ) which is readily O - alkylated by using meerwein 's reagent to produce H5C2OC[ = W(CO)5]CH2CH = CHCH2CMe(CMe3)OH ( <nUm> , ca. <nUm> % overall yield ) . similarly , the zirconoxycarbene complex <nUm> yields H6C2OC[ = W(CO)5]CH2CH = CH2 upon treatment with Bu4NF(H20)3 followed by alkylation with (H5C2)3OBF4- . 
high - resolution one- and two - dimensional solid - state CP / MAS spectra of microcrystalline bent metallocene complexes of the type (e5-RCp)2ZrL2 have been obtained at various temperatures ( L = Cl , r = H ( 1 ) , me ( 2 ) , et (3),tBu ( 4 ) ; L2 = s-cis-e4-C4H6 , R-H ( 5 ) ; L2 = s-cis- e4-C4H4Me2 , R-H ( 6 ) ; l2-s-cis- e4-C4H5Me , r = H ( 7 ) ; L2 = s-cis-e4-C4H6 , r = tBu ( 8 ) ; L2 = s-cis-e4-C4H6 , r = 1,1-dimethylpentyl ( 9 ) ; L2 = s-cis-e4-C4H5Me , r = tBu ( 10 ) ) . complexes 1-4 possess C2 molecular symmetry , while the overall symmetry of complexes <nUm> and <nUm> is close to Cs . In 7-9 there is no element of symmetry , and <nUm> yields diastereoisomers ( <nUm> : <nUm> ) . variable - temperature MAS spectra give evidence forRCp rotation and diene topomerization as fluxional processes occurring in the solid state . due to steric interaction with the methyl protons in <nUm> the rotation of the upper e5-bonded cyclopentadienyl ring was frozen out at T = <nUm> K ( DG* ≈ <nUm> kcal / mol ) and the five13C chemical shifts of this species cover a range of more than <nUm> ppm . due to less steric interaction the activation barrier for rotation of the lower cp ring is smaller ( DG* ≈ <nUm> kcal / mol ) . upon introduction of alkyl substituents at the e5-bonded rings the rotation barrier is significantly increased : in <nUm> it is around <nUm> kcal / mol . In contrast , movement of the e4-coordinated diene is largely independent of alkyl substituents and in 5-10 the barrier for this process is around <nUm> kcal / mol . 
the reactions of cp <nUm> ZrMe <nUm> with the diols 2,2-dimethylpropane-1,3-diol and 1,3-benzenedimethanol proceed with evolution of methane , affording the macrocyclic zirconocene dialkoxides cp <nUm> Zr(m-OCH <nUm> C-(CH <nUm> ) <nUm> CH <nUm> O ) <nUm> ZrCp <nUm> ( 1 ) and cp <nUm> Zr(m-OCH <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> CH <nUm> O ) <nUm> ZrCp <nUm> ( 2 ) , respectively . complex <nUm> crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P4 <nUm> mnm with a = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , z = <nUm> , and V = <nUm> ( 5 ) Å <nUm> . molecule <nUm> crystallizes in the trigonal space group R3 with a = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , z = <nUm> , and V = <nUm> ( 8 ) Å <nUm> . In the case of <nUm> , a disorder in the structural data is consistent with two possible conformations of the 12-membered dimetalated ring . molecular mechanics calculations in which the geometry at Zr is fixed were performed for the two possible conformers . the pseudocrown conformation is predicted to be thermodynamically more stable than the pseudochair form . In contrast , complex <nUm> adopts a pseudochair conformation . In addition , the disposition of the alkyl substituents on the oxygen atoms is endo for <nUm> and exo for <nUm> . these structural differences between <nUm> and <nUm> are considered and discussed . the nature of the Zr – O bonding in these complexes is discussed in terms of the extended huckel molecular orbital picture . the structural and theoretical data support the notion of significant p-bonding between Zr and oxygen . 
the reaction of a zirconocene acyl chloride with <nUm> equiv of trimethylaluminum results in the formation of the trinuclear Zr <nUm> Al complex [ cp <nUm> zr(e <nUm> (C,O)-OC-(CH <nUm> ) <nUm> ] <nUm> ( m-AlMe <nUm> )(m-Me) , which contains a trigonal - bipyramidal bridging methyl group . the complex crystallizes in the monoclinic system , in space group P2 <nUm> / n ( C <nUm> <nUm> h , no. <nUm> ) , with a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , V = <nUm> ( 9 ) Å <nUm> , and z = <nUm> . this is one of the few structures that contains a bridging methyl group with a near-trigonal-bipyramidal structure in which the metals occupy the axial positions and the three hydrogen atoms are in the equatorial plane . 
the effect of counterion on the kinetics and mechanism of ethylene polymerization by the zirconocene - boron catalytic system was examined using the density functional theory approach . A comparative study of three model catalytic species , namely , ethylzirconocene cation , Cp2ZrEt+ , and two ion pairs of composition Cp2ZrEt+A- ( A- = CH3B(C6F5)3- , B(C6F5)4- ) was carried out . it was shown that the nature of counterion affects mainly the ratio between the most stable b-agostic and nonagostic Cp2ZrEt+A- isomers , the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of ethylene addition to the Cp2ZrEt+A- ion pairs , and the chain propagation kinetics . the weaker the nucleophilicity of the counterion , the higher the fraction of the b-agostic isomer , the higher the exotermicity , and the lower the activation barrier to ethylene addition to Cp2ZrEt+A- , and the lower the activation energy of chain propagation . all possible pathways of the interaction between Cp2ZrEt+CH3B(C6F5) 3- and ethylene molecule were examined and compared . among all species of composition Cp2ZrEt+CH3 B(C6F5)3- , the nonagostic isomer was found to be the most reactive toward ethylene . 
the hydroxysilsesquioxanes (c-C5H9)7Si8O12(OH) ( I ) and (c-C5H9)7Si7O9 (OH)2OSiMePh2 ( II ) have been studied as model supports for silica - grafted aluminum alkyl species . treatment of AlMe3 with I gave polymeric { [(c-C5H9)7Si8O13] AlMe2}n ( 1a ) , which is readily transformed into the corresponding monomeric pyridine adduct , { [(c-C5H9)7Si8O13] AlMe2*Py ( 1b ) . when AlMe3 was reacted with II , noticeable amounts of the <nUm> : <nUm> product { [ (c-C5H9)7Si7O11- (OSiMePh2)](AlMe2)2}2 ( 2 ) and the bronsted acidic <nUm> : <nUm> product { [ (c-C5H9)7O11 (OSiMePh2)]2-Al-}{H+} ( III ) were obtained besides the main product of the reaction , { [ (c-C5H9)7Si7O11- (OSiMePh2)]AlMe}2 ( 3a-c ) . the main product is a mixture of three dimeric conformational isomers all with the aluminum methyls trans to each other . the difference of the conformers originates from the different orientation of the silsesquioxane ligands . reaction of the bronsted acid III with AlMe3 yielded the kinetic product { [ (c-C5H9)7Si7O11 (OSiMePh2)]2Al2Me2 ( 4 ) . the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of the three conformeric methyl aluminosil - sesquioxanes { [ (c-C5H9)7 Si7O11(OSiMePh2)]AlMe}2 ( 3a-c ) and their chemical isomer { [ (c-C5H9)7Si7 O11(OSiMePh2)]2Al2Me2 ( 4 ) has been investigated . isomerization experiments showed that 3a isomerizes to 3b , which subsequently isomerizes to 3c , affording the thermodynamically most stable mixture with a 3a:3b:3c ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> after <nUm> h at <nUm> ° C . isomerization of 3a to 3b is considerably faster than from 3b to 3c . direct conversion of 3a into 3c was not observed . complex <nUm> slowly isomerizes into 3c , which consecutively isomerizes into the thermodynamic most stable isomeric mixture ( <nUm> h at <nUm> ° C , ea = <nUm> kJ*mol-1 ) . treating Cp2ZrMe2 with the bronsted acid III gave clean transfer of a silsesquioxane ligand to zirconium , yielding [ (c-C5H9)7Si7O11 (OSiMePh2)]ZrCp2 ( 5 ) . the methyl aluminosilsesquioxanes 1a and 2-4 are not lewis acidic enough to effectively abstract a substituent x from Cp2ZrX2 ( x = me , CH2Ph , Cl ) . though , 3a-c and <nUm> definitely interact with Cp2ZrX2 . dependent on the substituent x , the zirconocene can accelerate the rate of isomerization over <nUm> orders of magnitude ( 3a , <nUm> h ; <nUm> , <nUm> h at <nUm> ° C ) . surprisingly , complex <nUm> also reacts with the strongly lewis acidic BC18F15 . As soon as all <nUm> has been converted into 3a-c , the accelerating effect stops , which demonstrates that lewis acids have no effect on the isomerization of 3a-c . complexes <nUm> , 3a , 3c , <nUm> , and <nUm> have been structurally characterized . 
the silsesquioxane - tethered fluorene ligand ( c-C5H 9)7Si8,O12CH2-9-Flu(H) and zirconocene complexes thereof , C5H3(SiMe 3)2[(c-C5H9)7Si 8O12CH2-9-Flu]ZrCl2 and [ ( c-C 5H9)7Si8O12CH 2-9-Flu]2ZrCl2 , have been used to optimize the synthetic strategies for the corresponding silica - tethered zirconocenes and to study their steric and electronic properties . 
A series of zirconocene complexes bearing 2,2-dimethyl-2-sila-4-pentenyl substituents ( and methyl-substituted olefin variants ) ( (e5-C5H5)2Zr(CH3)(CH 2SiMe2CH2CR1 = CR2R3 ) ( R1 , R2 , R3 = H , CH3 , <nUm> , 5-7 ) , (e5-C5H4CMe3)2 CH3Zr ( CH2SiMe2CH2 CH = CH2 ) ( 2 ) , { Me2Si(e5-C5 H4)2}Zr(CH3) ( CH2SiMe2 C2H3 = CH2 ) ( 3 ) , and { 1,2-(SiMe2)2(e5-C5H3 )2Zr(CH3) ( CH2SiMe2CH2CH = CH2 ) ( 4 ) ) have been prepared . methide abstraction with BC18F15 results in reversible coordination of the tethered olefin to the cationic zirconium center . the kinetics of olefin dissociation have been examined using NMR methods , and the effects of ligand variation for unlinked , singly [SiMe2] - linked , and doubly [SiMe2] - linked bis(cyclopentadienyl) arrangements have been compared ( DG ‡ values for olefin dissociation vary from <nUm> to <nUm> kcal*mol-1 measured over the temperature range 223-283 K ) . for the cation derived from <nUm> the kinetics for olefin dissociation and site epimerization ( inversion at zirconium ) can be distinguished . additionally , with this ligand system competitive binding of the olefin and the [CH3B(C6F5)3] anion is observed . methide abstraction from { 1,2-(SiMe2)2(e5-C5 H3)2}Zr(CH3) ( CH2CMe2CH2CH = CH2 ) results in rapid b-allyl elimination with loss of isobutene to cleanly afford the allyl cation [ { 1,2-(SiMe2)2(e5-C5 H3)2}Zr ( e3-CH2CH = CH2)]+ .

density functional calculations on a variety of alkyl-transition metal complexes R-M are reported . specifically , the following compounds have been studied : zirconocene complexes [Cp2Zr(H)R] , [Cp2Zr(Cl)R] , [Cp2ZrR]+ , and [Cp*2Zr(Cl)R] ; iron compounds [CpFe(CO)2R] and [ CpFe(CO) {P(CH3)3} ] ; dimethylamino-dithiocyanato-palladium complexes [ {(CH3)2NCS2}- Pd{P(CH3)3}R ] ; and cationic diimino palladium complexes [{NN}Pd(L)R]+ ( with {NN} = HN = CH-CH = NH or N,N'-(o,o'-bis-diisopropylphenyl)diiminoacenaphthalene , and L = nothing , cl- , C2H6O , C2H6S , CH2 , or C2H3N ) . the r groups considered are methyl , n-propyl , isobutyl , isopropyl , and tert-butyl , thus covering the whole range from primary groups to tertiary ones . it is shown that primary alkyl complexes are usually more stable then secondary and tertiary ones and that this is an electronic effect , due to the partial carbanionic character of the alkyl group . steric effects , which are usually invoked in the literature whenever this issue is considered , are shown to play only a minor role in many cases . notable exceptions occur in the case of extremely bulky compounds or for systems in which the metal-carbon bond is less polar . 
stereoselective reactions of zirconium biphenolate complexes of the general formula (BIP)-ZrCl2(THF)2 ( 1a-c ) , where BIP = 3,3'-iPr2-6,6'-Me2-1,1'-bi-2- phenolate ( a ) , 3,3'-tBu2-5,5'-Me2-1,1'-bi-2- phenolate ( b ) , or 3,3',5,5'-tBu4-1,1'-bi-2-phenolate ( c ) , with <nUm> equiv of the lithium or magnesium salts of various ansa - bis(indenyl) ligands give the ansa - zirconocenes rac-C2H4(Ind)2Zr(BIP) ( 2b ) , rac-Me2Si(Ind)2Zr(BIP) ( 3c ) , rac-Me2Si(2-Me-Ind)2Zr(BIP) ( 4c ) , rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2Zr(BIP) ( 5c ) , and rac-Me2Si(2-Me-Benz[e]Ind)2Zr(BIP) ( 6c ) in isolated yields of 60-75 % . reactions of C2H4(Ind)2Mg(THF)2 with 1a and 1b and of Me2Si(Ind)2Li2 with 1c give directly the pure diastereomers rac-2a , rac-2b , and rac-3c , respectively . more highly substituted indenyl ligands , on the other hand , give initially kinetically controlled mixtures of the rac- and meso-zirconocene BIP derivatives 4c , 5c , and 6c , from which the pure rac - derivatives are obtained as thermodynamically favored products by heating the reaction mixtures to <nUm> ° C for 5-7 h . the meso - to - rac isomerization of 6c is catalyzed by addition of TEMPO and is thus likely to occur by way of radical intermediates . crystal and molecular structures of 1b and 2b and of 1c and 6c indicate that formation of the racemo diastereomers is favored by repulsive interactions between biphenolate and ansa - bis(indenyl) ligands . 
the displacement of the MeB(C6F5)3- anion from seven different zirconocene methyl cations by neutral lewis bases , such as dimethylaniline , benzyldimethylamine , and dinbutyl ether , was investigated by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy . equilibrium constants for reactions with dinbutyl ether change by factors of less than <nUm> between the zirconocene contact ion pairs studied , despite substantial steric differences . rate constants of this displacement reaction , however , change by a factor of more than <nUm> between Me2Si(C5H4)2ZrMe-MeB(C 6F5)3- , the most " open " complex , and rac-Me2Si(2-Me-BzInd)2ZrMe-MeB(C6F 5)3- , the most highly substituted species studied . kinetic and stereochemical data indicate that lewis base - anion exchange proceeds by way of an associative mechanism , which occurs without side change of the zirconium - bound methyl group . DFT calculations support an associative substitution mechanism and propose five - coordinated reaction intermediates with the lewis base coordinated to the central coordination site . 
the reactions of zirconocene - alkyne complexes Cp'2Zr(L)(e2-Me3SiC2 SiMe3 ) { cp'2 = ( e5 -C5H5)2 : L = THF , <nUm> ; L = pyridine , <nUm> ; cp'2 = rac - ebthi , <nUm> , [ ebthi = 1,2-ethylene1,1'-bis(e 5-tetrahydroindenyl ) ] } with <nUm> equiv(or excess ) of bicyclo[2.2.1] hepta-2,5-diene ( NBD ) in THF at <nUm> ° C result in five - membered zirconacyclopentane complexes Cp2Zr(C14H16) ( 4 ) and rac(ebthi)Zr(C14H16) ( 5 ) ( C7H8 means two coupled NBDs ) in good yields . NMR spectra of complexes <nUm> and <nUm> show the C2 symmetry of the molecules , indicating that the two NBD components in the complexes are in exo-trans-exo conformation . an x-ray crystallographic structure determination of <nUm> confirms that the two NBD fragments are exo-trans-exo linked to form a racemate . both optical isomers are present in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio in the crystals . reactions of <nUm> and <nUm> with <nUm> equiv of NBD have also been investigated , and only zirconacyclopentane complex <nUm> was isolated from the reactions . the analogous zirconacyclopentane complexes Cp2Zr(C22H20) ( 6 ) and rac-(ebthi)Zr(C2H20) ( 7 ) ( C22 H20 means two coupled BNBDs ) are obtained from the reactions of <nUm> ( or <nUm> ) and <nUm> with an excess of 1,4-dihydro-1,4-methano-naphthalene ( BNBD ) , respectively . the x-ray structure of the orange complex <nUm> shows that the geometry of the Zr coordination sphere can be described as a distorted tetrahedron and similar to that of <nUm> . the zirconacyclopentane complex rac-(ebthi)Zr(C14H15N) ( 9 ) , bearing a free N coordinating site and a double bond , is formed from the coupling reaction of rac - ( ebthi ) C7H7NZr ( 8 ) with NBD . all these reactions are stereospecific , and all new complexes are characterized by NMR , MS , and elemental analysis . 
density functional theory ( DFT ) studies of the energetics of the isomers of C <nUm> H <nUm> -cyclocumulene ( 1 ) , ethynylcyclopropene ( 2 ) , diethynylmethane ( 3 ) , and their organometallic analogues obtained by replacing the CH <nUm> groups by cp <nUm> Ti and cp <nUm> Zr ( 4-6 ) - show that the relative energies of the hydrocarbons are dramatically altered in the transition - metal analogues . the metallacyclocumulenes are comparable in energy to <nUm> and <nUm> . the relative energies also explain the experimental observation that the metallacyclopropene ( 5 ) is more favorable for the Ti complex . substituents on the carbon skeleton help to fine - tune the energetics . the bonding situations in <nUm> and the recently characterized five - membered zirconacyclopentyne complex <nUm> are very similar and are in tune with their structures . 
methyl-versus-cloride exchange equilibria between different zirconocene complexes provide a sensitive measure of relative electron densities at the Zr centers of these complexes . As expected , methyl and trimethyl silyl substituents increase the electron density at the Zr center of a bis(cyclopentadienyl) Zr(IV) complex ; the same holds for a dimethyl silyl bridge . In bis(indenyl) complexes , on the other hand , electron density at the metal center is reduced and substituent and bridge effects are different from those observed in bis(cyclopentadienyl) Zr(IV) complexes . 
possible structural candidates for the active ( III ) and dormant ( IV ) species in dimethyl-zirconocene - catalyzed , MAO (methylaluminoxane)-activated olefin polymerization have been studied via density functional theory ( DFT ) . these species are [Cp2ZrMeAlMe3]+[MeMAO] - ( III ) and [Cp2ZrMe]+[MeMAO]- ( IV ) , respectively , where me = CH3 and cp = n5-C 5H5 . relative energies in gas phase and toluene solution as well as 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts have been calculated . these chemical shifts have been compared with 1H and 13C NMR data from new experimental investigations studying the interaction between Cp2ZrMe2 and MAO in toluene solution.1 by combining experimental and theoretical results , we have been able to identify the most likely candidates for both the dormant and active species . moreover , we are able to predict that an Al / Zr ratio of ~ <nUm> : <nUm> at <nUm> K is necessary in order for all of the Cp2ZrMe2 to bind to MAO as the structures we propose for III and IV . this ratio corresponds to the disappearance of the following species from solution : free Cp2ZrMe2 , the weak complex of Cp2ZrMe <nUm> and MAO ( I ) , and [ Cp2ZrMe(m-Me) cp 2ZrMe]+-[MeMAO]- ( II ) . such a mixture would have a IV / III ratio of ~ <nUm> : <nUm> . 
an ansa - zirconocene compound , [2,2'-meth-ylenebis(1,3-dimethylcyclopentadienyl)]zirconium dichloride ( 5 ) , bearing methyl substituents on the carbons adjacent to a bridgehead carbon , was synthesized by key steps of the catalytic pauson - khand reaction and the retro-Diels-Aider reaction . the crystal structure of <nUm> was determined . the small angle ( <nUm> ° ) between the two centroids of the cyclopentadienyls and a zirconium atom and the absence of any substituents on the positions β with respect to the bridgehead carbon indicate that the coordination site for catalysis is widely opened . compound <nUm> , when activated with MAO , showed good performance for copolymerization of ethylene with a bulky monomer such as norbornene . the activity and norbornene incorporation ability are much better than those of [Ph2C(Fluo)(Cp)]ZrCl2 . 
A remarkably stable diborate anion as the metallocene polymerization catalysts was investigated . the multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonding was obtained in the molecular structure of the amidodiborate anion . In regard with it , the treatment of zirconocene dimethyls that resulted in the obtaining of highly active alkene polymerization catalysts was reported . 
the reactions of [ cp ° 2ZrMe2 ] ( cp ° = C5EtMe4 ) with the thioglycolic acids HOOC(CH2-SCH2)nCOOH ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) resulted in evolution of methane and formation of the macrocyclic , dimeric zirconocene complexes [ cp ° 2Zr(OOCCH2SCH2COO)2ZrCp ° <nUm> ] ( 1 ) and [ cp ° 2Zr(OOCCH2SCH2CH2SCH2 COO)2ZrCp ° <nUm> ] ( 2 ) , which can act as metalloligands toward complex fragments of a second metal . both complexes were characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy , ESI mass spectrometry , and x-ray diffraction analysis . In solution at room temperature both complexes are dynamic , and the carboxylato groups alternate between mono- and bidentate bonding modes . for complex <nUm> the free energy of activation for this process was determined to be DG ‡ = <nUm> ± <nUm> kJ / mol by variable - temperature NMR experiments . compound <nUm> reacts with [Mo(CO)4(NBD)] ( NBD = norbornadiene ) to give the tetranuclear Zr / Mo complex <nUm> , the crystal structure of which showed that an C4MoO4 fragment is coordinated to one S and one O donor center of each bridging ligand of <nUm> . this heterobimetallic complex <nUm> was also characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy , and in contrast to <nUm> , it is not dynamic in solution at room temperature , owing to the coordination of the C4MoO4 fragments . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> also react with [PdCl2(CH3CN)2] to give the trinuclear Zr / Pd complex <nUm> and the tetranuclear Zr / Pd complex <nUm> . both complexes were characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy and by elemental analysis . 
the synthesis and use of the ansa - zirconocene complexes [ Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5 -C5H3R)]-ZrCl2 ( r = H ( 5 ) , me ( 6 ) , et ( 7 ) , iPr ( 8 ) , tBu ( 9 ) , SiMe3 ( 10 ) ) as catalysts in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene has been studied . the alkyl complexes [ Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5 -C5H3R)]-ZrMe2 ( r = H ( 11 ) , me ( 12 ) , et ( 13 ) , iPr ( 14 ) , tBu ( 15 ) , SiMe3 ( 16 ) ) have also been prepared . the reaction of 11-16 with BC18F15 gave the cationic species [ { Me2Si(e5-C5Me4)(e5 -C5H3R)}-ZrMe]+ ( r = H ( 17 ) , me ( 18 ) , et ( 19 ) , iPr ( 20 ) , tBu ( 21 ) , SiMe3 ( 22 ) ) . In the absence of cocatalyst , 17-22 have been shown to act as catalysts in the polymerization of ethylene . the molecular structures of <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies . 
preparation of zirconocene hydrido chloride complexes has been accomplished via addition of <nUm> equiv of tert-butyllithium to the corresponding zirconocene dichlorides . In this manner , both Cp*Cp''Zr(H)Cl and Cp''2Zr(H)Cl ( cp* = C5Me5 , cp'' = 1,3-(SiMe3)2C5H3 ) were prepared in high yield . further addition of tBuLi to Cp*Cp''Zr(H)Cl affords the isobutyl hydride complex Cp*Cp''Zr(CH2CHMe2)(H) , which upon addition of <nUm> atm of dihydrogen undergoes rapid hydrogenolysis yielding the monomeric dihydride Cp*Cp''ZrH2 . In the absence of dihydrogen , the zirconocene dihydride undergoes reversible C-H activation of a cyclopentadienyl trimethylsilyl group , affording the " tuck-in " derivative Cp*(e5-1-SiMe3C5H3-3-( e1-SiMe2-CH2))ZrH . addition of <nUm> equiv of tBuLi to the ansa - zirconocene tPr2Si(e5-3-SiMe3C5H 3)(e5-3,4-(SiMe3)2C5H 2)ZrCl2 results in the corresponding zirconocene isobutyl hydride complex , which upon exposure to H affords the dimeric dihydride [ iPr2Si(e5-3-SiMe3C5H 3)(e5-3,4-(SiMe3)2C5H 2)ZrH2]2 . In a similar procedure the substituted indenyl complexes rac-(1-CMe3-C9H6)Zr(H)Cl and rac-(1-CMe3-C9H6)Zr(CH2CHMe2 )(H) have been prepared . this synthetic methodology allows for the preparation of metallocene alkyl hydrides and dihydrides inaccessible by more traditional routes . 
formal [2+2] and [2+1] cycloaddition reactions between the azazirconaindenes 1a,b and aldehydes RCHO ( r = ph , -CH = CHMe - ( e ) , fc ) , heterocumulenes [ R-N = C = O ( r = ph , 1-naphthyl ) , Me-N = C = S , Cy-N = C = N-Cy ] , and the azide (PhO)2P(O)N3 afford stable pentavalent zirconocene compounds 2-8 , respectively . the single - crystal x-ray structure of <nUm> is reported . Zr-X ( x = C , O , N ) distances in <nUm> are in the range of Cp2Zr-X s-bonds in pentavalent zirconium complexes and not in that of p-X-coordination . this is in accord with a formal description for these compounds as iminium zirconate complexes . 
treatment of [Cp2TiCH3(thf)+] ( <nUm> , with [BPh4-] anion ) with 1,3-diisopropylimidazol-2-ylidene ( 4 ) at ambient temperature resulted in a rapid displacement of the thf ligand by the stable heterocyclic carbene to yield the arduengo carbene methyltitanocene cation complex 6a ( > <nUm> % isolated ) . the x-ray crystal structure analysis of 6a showed that the heteroatom - stabilized carbene ligand [ d(Ti-C(carbene) = <nUm> Å , d(Ti-CH3) = <nUm> Å ] was bonded to titanium in an orientation where the imidazol-2-ylidene ring lies in the major s-ligand plane of the bent metallocene moiety . A DFT calculation of 6a and a series of related model compounds has revealed that the arduengo carbene serves as a pure s-donor ligand to the titanocene moiety . the observed favored " in-plane " orientation of the ligand is steric in origin . consequently , complex 6a attains an analogous Cs - symmetric structure in solution , featuring symmetry - equivalent cp rings and a pair of diastereotopic isopropyl substituents as well as chemically differentiated imidazol-2-ylidene C4H = C5H groups . the reaction of the ion pair [(Cp2ZrCH3)+CH3B(C6F5] 3- ] ( 7 ) with <nUm> gave the analogous arduengo carbene zirconocene cation complex 6b ( > <nUm> % isolated , with [CH3B(C6F5)3-] anion ) . 
the reaction of BrC5Cl2H5Zr with <nUm> equiv of K(2,4-C7H11) and <nUm> equiv of dmpe was found to lead to the 18-electron half - open zirconocene Zr(C5H5)(2,4-C7H11)(dmpe) ( C7H11 = dimethylpentadienyl ; dmpe = Me2PC2H4PMe2 ) , which has been fully characterized . A structural study has revealed that the Zr-C bond distances for the open dienyl ligand are significantly shorter than those for the CH ligand . alternatively , through a similar reaction involving the use of only <nUm> equiv of a more selective (pentadienyl)magnesium reagent , the two dienyl anions serve as one - electron reducing agents , and the Zr (II) complex Zr(C5H5)(Br)(dmpe)2 is obtained , which has also been fully characterized . In the absence of dmpe , the reaction between BrC5Cl2H5Zr and <nUm> equiv of the magnesium reagent leads to an unusual C19H26Zr complex . the C2H3 ligand was formed from the coupling of two 2,4-C7H11 ligands , followed by the loss of one hydrogen atom , presumably abstracted by the third 2,4-C7H11 ligand . the C2H3 ligand bonds to the zirconium center through both e5-dienyl and e4- " diene " coordination , leading to an 18-electron complex . the structural parameters indicate that the diene coordination can be more appropriately described as enediyl coordination , leading to a formal Zr(IV) instead of Zr (II) complex . the presence of a high formal metal oxidation state would seem to explain the fact that in this complex , as opposed to Zr(C5H5)(2,4-C7H11)(dmpe) and many other related complexes , the M-C bond distances for the CH ligand are much shorter than those for the open dienyl ligand . 
the zirconocene - alkyne complex Cp2Zr(py)(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3 ) reacts with methyl vinyl ketone to yield the zirconadihydrofuran Cp2ZrOCMe = C2H3 ( 1 ) . In contrast , rac-(ebthi)Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) ( ebthi = 1,2-ethylene-1,1'-bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl) reacts with methyl vinyl ketone giving , for the first time , the 1,4-conjugated insertion product rac - (ebthi)ZrOCMe = CHCH2C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3) ( 2 ) in good yield . an x-ray crystallographic structure determination of <nUm> shows that the seven - membered ring is twisted in such a way to fit the steric demands of the " ebthi " and SiMe3 groups . treating rac-(ebthi)Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) with tert-butyl acrylate gives the zirconadihydrofuran rac - (ebthi)ZrOC(OtBu) = C2H3 ( 3 ) . the monomeric structure of <nUm> has been established by x-ray crystallography . A different type of zirconadihydrofuran , rac - (ebthi)ZrOCMe(CH = CH2 ) - C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3) ( 4 ) , results from the reaction with mesityl oxide . complexes analogous to <nUm> and <nUm> were observed consecutively by NMR in the reaction of Thi2Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3 ) ( thi = e5-tetrahydroindenyl ) with methyl vinyl ketone . this lets one conclude that the carbonyl insertion products ( e.g. <nUm> ) are formed first as intermediates . finally , rac-(ebthi)ZrCH2CHMe = C2H3 ( 5 ) , a zirconacyclopentene , is obtained from rac-(ebthi)Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) and isoprene . 
the Et3N - assisted condensation of the ferriomethyl-silanol Cp(OC)2Fe-CH2-SiMe2OH ( 1 ) with <nUm> equiv of Cp2MCl2 ( m = Ti ( 2a ) , Zr ( 2b ) ) leads to the formation of the iron fragment substituted heterosiloxanes Cp(OC)2Fe-CH2-SiMe2O-M(Cl)Cp2 ( m = Ti ( 3a ) , Zr ( 3b ) ) . the bis(siloxy) zirconium complex [Cp(OC)2Fe-CH2-SiMe2O]2-ZrCp2 ( 4 ) is obtained by further condensation of the M-Cl functionality of 3b with <nUm> . the new compounds have been identified spectroscopically , and in addition , 3b and <nUm> have been structurally characterized by single - crystal x-ray diffraction methods . 
the reaction of Cl4Ti with (chlorodimethylsilyl)(trimethylsilyl)cyclopentadiene results in the chemoselective elimination of Me3SiCl and cleanly affords ((chlorodimethylsilyl)cyclopentadienyl)titanium trichloride ( 2 ) . likewise , the reaction of Cl4Ti with (chlorodimethylsilyl)(trimethylsilyl)tetramethylcyclopentadiene ( 6 ) also results in the chemoselective elimination of Me3SiCl and cleanly affords ((chlorodimethylsilyl)tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)titanium trichloride ( 7 ) . this observation is in sharp contrast to the reaction of <nUm> with Cl4Zr , which results in the chemoselective elimination of Me3SiCl but affords a mixture of half - sandwich and zirconocene complexes . support of complex <nUm> or <nUm> on (aminomethyl)polystyrene ( AMPS , <nUm> % cross-linking , <nUm> wt % N , <nUm> mmol of N / g of support ) , where the mole ratio of amine content of the support to precursor catalysts was selected to be <nUm> : <nUm> , leads to the assembly of the constrained - geometry catalyst ( CGCs ) <nUm> or <nUm> , respectively . from the 29Si NMR , the presence of a single silicon species was observed in complex <nUm> , which has been attributed to the CGC form . however , for <nUm> two silicon resonances were observed , one of which has been attributed to the CGC form and the other to a titanium amide moiety . the Ti : Si : Cl ratio for both <nUm> and <nUm> was found to be <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> through elemental analyses . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> , in conjunction with MAO as the cocatalyst , were tested for ethylene homopolymerization and ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization . the thermal properties and the molecular weights of the resulting polymers were determined . the observation of ethylene-co-1-octene provides independent evidence for the formation of supported CGC from the synthetic protocol . 
binuclear siloxyaluminum methyl complexes of the type Me2Al(m-OSiR3)2AlMe2 react with protonated N,N-dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate , with release of CH4 , to form the dimethylaniline (DMA)-stabilized siloxyaluminum methyl cations Me2Al(m-OSiR3)2AlMe(NMe2 (C6H5)+ . these cations abstract a cl- ligand from CH Cl2Zr , to give the dinuclear cation {(C5H5)2ZrCl}2(m-Cl)+ , and a CH3- ligand from C12H16Zr , to give by way of the DMA - stabilized cation (C5H5)2Zr(CH3)NMe2(C 6H5)+ the CH - activation product (C5H5)2ZrCH2NMe(C6 H5)+ ; reaction with Me2Si(ind)2 ZrMe2 in toluene solution yields a moderately active catalyst for ethene polymerization . this reactivity of siloxyaluminum methyl cations is qualitatively similar to , although substantially lower than , that of a silica gel surface treated with trimethylaluminum and a cationizing agent . 
treatment of 6-(dimethylamino)-6-methylpentafulvene ( 2a ) with methyllithium in ether at <nUm> ° C leads to CH3 addition to the C6 - fulvene carbon atom to yield the [C5H4-CMe2N-Me2]Li reagent 3a , whereas treatment of 2a with MeLi in THF at <nUm> ° C results in deprotonation with formation of [ C5H4-C( = CH2 ) - NMe2]Li ( 4a ) . In contrast , treatment of 6-diethylamino-6-methylfulvene ( 2b ) with methyllithium under any of these conditions leads only to H+ - abstraction to give [ C5H4-C( = CH2 ) - NEt2]Li ( 4b ) . treatment of the reagents <nUm> with CpZrCl3 yields the enamino-Cp - substituted bent metallocenes [ e5-C5H4-C( = CH2 ) - NR2 ] CpZrCl2 5a ( r = CH3 ) and 5b ( r = C2H5 ) , respectively . analogous treatment of 4b with zirconium tetrachloride gave the doubly functionalized zirconocene complex [ e5-C5H4-C( = CH2)-NEt2]2ZrCl2 ( 6b ) . the complexes 5a , 5b , and 6b were characterized by x-ray diffraction . treatment of 3a with CpZrCl3 gave [e5-C5H4-CMe2-NMe2]Cp Cl2Zr ( 8a ) ; the analogous reaction with Cl4Zr gave [e5-C5H4-CMe2-NMe2] 2ZrCl2 ( 8b ) . both complexes <nUm> reacted with (butadiene)magnesium with replacement of both chloride ligands at zirconium . the probably generated (e4-butadiene)zirconocene complexes were , however , not stable under the applied reaction conditions , but reacted further by C-H activation at the N-CH3 group with intramolecular hydrogen transfer to the butadiene ligand to yield the cyclometalated products [ e5-C5H4-CMe2- N(CH3)-CH2-]Zr(L)(CH2CHCHCH3) 13a ( L = cp ) and 13b ( L = [e5-C5H4CMe2-NMe2] ) , respectively . complex 5a reacts analogously with (butadiene)magnesium to yield the C-H activation product [ e5-C5H4-C( = = CH2)-N(CH3 )-CH2-]ZrCp(CH2CHCHCH3) <nUm> . the 1-diethylaminoethenyl-Cp - substituted systems 5b and 6b react differently with (butadiene)magnesium . they form the stable e4-butadiene complexes s-trans-15 and s-cis15A / B ( from 5b ) and s-trans-17 and s-cis-17 ( from 6b ) , respectively . [N]CH activation was not observed in these cases . treatment of the cyclometalated products 13a , <nUm> , and <nUm> with BC18F15 gave active homogeneous ziegler - natta catalysts for ethene polymerization , whereas the systems 13b / BC18F15 and <nUm> / BC18F15 were close to inactive under comparable conditions . 
Cp2Zr(e2-benzocyclobutadiene)(PMe3) , a rare e2-cyclobutadiene complex , was investigated . the stabilization of a cyclobutadiene by a rare e2 coordination mode was described . the coupling reactions of the complex with alkynes , nitriles , and isocyanides yielded zirconocene cyclobutene derivatives , including a unique dewar-naphthalene structure . 
reduction of [ ZrCl2{e5-C5Me4(SiMe3 )}2 ] ( 1 ) with excess magnesium in tetrahydrofuran affords a mixture of the monomeric zirconocene hydride [ ZrH{e1:e5-C5Me4- (SiMe2CH2)}{e5-C5Me4( SiMe3 ) } ] ( 2 ) and the dimeric , tetranuclear Zr(III)- and Zr(IV) - magnesium hydride complexes <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . In the presence of bis(trimethylsilyl)ethyne ( btmse ) , a similar reduction yields the e2-alkyne complex [ Zr{e5-C5Me4(SiMe3)}2 - ( e2-btmse ) ] ( 5 ) as the major product and compounds 2-4 as minor impurities . upon thermolysis under vacuum , <nUm> undergoes a 2-fold hydrogen transfer from trimethylsilyl groups in the zirconocene intermediate to leaving btmse to afford [ Zr{e5:e1-C5Me4 (SiMe2CH2)}- <nUm> ] ( 6 ) and a mixture of alkenes (E)- and (Z)-Me3SiCH = CHSiMe3 ( e ≫ z ) . crystal structures of compounds <nUm> and 4-6 were determined by x-ray crystallography . 
the rate of reductive elimination as a function of alkyl ligand has been measured for a series of zirconocene alkyl hydride complexes , Cp*Cp''Zr(R)H ( cp* = e5-C5Me5 , cp'' = e5-C5H3-1,3-(SiMe3)2 , r = CH3 , C4H9 , C8H17 , CH2cC6H11 , CH2CHMe2 , CH2 - CMe3 ) , where the steric disposition of the alkyl ligand has been systematically varied . the rate of reductive elimination increases modestly as the steric bulk of the alkyl ligand is increased . this trend is attributed to ground state destabilization arising from unfavorable steric interactions between the alkyl ligand and the cyclopentadienyl substituents . the effect is magnified when more voluminous cyclopentadienyl ligands are incorporated into the metallocene framework . thus , the Cp*Cp'''Zr(R)H ( cp''' = e5-C5H2-1,2,4- (SiMe3)3 , r = CH3 , CH2 C3H7 , C8H17 ) series of alkyl hydride complexes lose alkane more readily than the corresponding Cp*Cp''Zr(R)H complexes . In addition , the rate of reductive elimination has also been examined for Cp*Cp''Zr(Ph)(H) and Cp*Cp''Zr(CH2Ph)H ( ph = C6H5 ) and is slower than the alkyl hydride series . the sluggish rates of reductive elimination are a result of ground state stabilization imparted by a strong zirconium-phenyl bond and by e2 coordination of the benzyl ligand , respectively . this interaction , along with the solid state structure of Cp*Cp''Zr(CH3)H , has been characterized by x-ray diffraction . the kinetic data led to the synthesis of Cp*2Zr(CH2CMe3)H , which undergoes reductive elimination of alkane and coordination of dinitrogen . 
the reactions of bridged tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl fragments with <nUm> molar equiv of potassium tert-butoxide allow the generation of a,o-oligosilyl dianions ( 1a , 2a , 3a , 4a ) . depending on the nature of the spacer between the oligosilyl units , these compounds can be used to generate either linear or cyclic derivatives . they are especially attractive for the formation of homo- and heterocyclosilanes , as exemplified by the synthesis of sila- , stanna- , and zirconocena-cyclosilanes . A linear bis(potassiumsilyl)acetylene ( 4a ) was used to bridge two zirconocene units , ( Cp2Zr(Cl)Si(SiMe3)2CCSi(SiMe3) 2Zr(Cl)Cp2 ) ( 11 ) . 
density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP level were performed to study the electronic structure of a recently synthesized zirconocene complex , Cp2ZrCHRCCCHR ( r = SiMe3 ) . through detailed bonding analyses and stability studies , we conclude that the originally proposed metallacyclopentyne form can not adequately describe the complex . instead , a resonance hybrid between a cumulene complex form and a metallacyclopentyne lewis structure is required to account for the structure and stability of the complex . 
the sequential reaction of 9-fluorenyllithium and CpNa with ( iPr ) 2NBCl <nUm> followed by the sequential treatment with LDA and ClZr <nUm> afforded [ ( η 5-C 13H 8)BN( i-Pr ) <nUm> ( η 5-C 5H 5H 4)ZrCl <nUm> ( 2e ) . the structure of 2e was determined by x-ray diffraction , which shows that the molecule has C s symmetry . on activation by excess methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) 2e was converted to an active catalyst for polymerization of ethylene and propylene . the polypropylene is syndiotactic ( <nUm> % rr triads ) . 
reaction of a particularly bulky silanol , (2,4,6-Me3C6H2)3SiOH , with Al2Me6 gives , instead of the otherwise preferred unreactive binuclear siloxalanes with two siloxy bridges , a binuclear siloxalane with one siloxy and one methyl bridge , Me2Al(m-OSi(2,4,6-Me3C6 H2)3)(m-Me)AlMe2 . this species reacts with zirconocene dichlorides under chloride / methyl exchange ; with the cationizing reagent PhMe2NH+B(C6 F5)4- it forms the B(C6 F5)4- salt of the mononuclear cation AlMe2(NPhMe2)2+ . 
A superphane consisting of one thiophene ring and one CpCo - stabilized cyclobutadiene ring , <nUm> , was prepared in an eight - step synthesis from 5-cyclodecynol protected with tert-butyldimethylsilyl , <nUm> . the first key step in this sequence was the reaction of <nUm> with zirconocene and subsequently with ClS to yield the tricyclic thiophene derivative <nUm> . the second key step was the ring closure of <nUm> with CpCo(COD) to give <nUm> . x-ray structural investigations of <nUm> and <nUm> confirmed the structural assignments . evidence for the close proximity of the CpCo - stabilized cyclobutadiene and the thiophene rings is also given by the electronic absorption spectrum of <nUm> and the oxidation potential ( <nUm> V ) . 
hydride abstraction reactions of the zirconocene cyclic organohydroborate complexes cp 2ZrH{(mH) 2BR <nUm> } ( r <nUm> = C 4H <nUm> ; C 3H <nUm> , <nUm> ) with B(C 8F <nUm> ) <nUm> were observed as a function of solvent . the reaction in poorly coordinating solvents , benzene and toluene , forms [ HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - salts of Zr-H-Zr hydrogen - bridged cations [ (m-H){Cp 2Zr(m-H) 2BR <nUm> } <nUm> ] + ( r <nUm> = C 4H <nUm> , <nUm> ; C 8H <nUm> , <nUm> ) , in which there is no direct metal - metal bonding between the bridged metals . the unsupported hydrogen - bridged bond in complex <nUm> was cleaved when it was dissolved in the coordinating solvent THF to produce the neutral complex <nUm> and the ionic complex [ cp 2Zr(THF){(m-H) 2BC 6H 14}][HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] . In the coordinating solvent , diethyl ether , the salts of [ cp 2Zr(OEt 2)X ] +[HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - ( x = OEt , <nUm> ; { ( -H ) 2BC 8H <nUm> } , <nUm> ) consisting of zirconocene cations with coordinated solvent ligands were isolated . the formation of <nUm> involves hydride insertion from zirconium into the carbon oxygen bond of one the coordinated ethers , resulting in the liberation of ethane and the formation of an ethoxyl group coordinated to zirconium . the diethyl ether molecules in the cations <nUm> and <nUm> are weakly coordinated to Zr and are displaced in THF solution . single - crystal x-ray structures of <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were determined . 
standard ligand - substitution reactions afforded moderate yields of ( PhC 5H <nUm> ) 2ZrCl <nUm> ( 1 ) , ( 1,3-Ph 2C 5H 3)CpZrCl <nUm> ( 2 ) , [ 1,3,-(C 6F <nUm> ) 2C 5H 3]CpZrCl <nUm> ( 5 ) , and [ 1,2,4-(C 6F <nUm> ) 2C 5H 3]CpZrCl <nUm> ( 6 ) . crystal structures of <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and [ ( C 6F 5C 5H <nUm> ] 2HfMe <nUm> ( 7 ) were obtained . physicochemical studies ( CV , IR ) show that C 6F <nUm> groups are strongly electron - withdrawing compared to phenyl groups . In ethylene-1-hexene copolymerization reactions using <nUm> , <nUm> , ( C 6F 5C 5H 4)CpZrCl <nUm> ( 3 ) , ( C 6F 5C 5H <nUm> ) 2ZrCl <nUm> ( 4 ) , and <nUm> ( toluene solution , methylalumoxane cocatalyst ) , C 6F <nUm> substituents decrease catalytic activity but increase comonomer incorporation compared to phenyl substituents . 
the alternating copolymerization of CO and ethene at the zirconocene centers Cp2Zr , Me2-SiCp2Zr , and rac-Me2SiInd2Zr was investigated by DFT methods . CO coordinates much more strongly than ethene but has a rather high insertion barrier . thus , propagation is slowed dramatically but the growing chains will not necessarily all incorporate CO . secondary alkyls insert CO more efficiently than primary alkyls . after the first CO insertion , subsequent olefin and CO insertions will alternate . olefin insertion will be very slow at high CO pressures , but at low [CO] the olefin and CO insertion barriers are comparable and are lower than that of the first CO insertion . use of CO as a quenching and chain - counting method appears to be safe , provided a high pressure of CO is employed and the quenched reaction is not worked up at low temperature . 
the dual - site zirconocene dichlorides rac - and meso-SiMe2(3- benzylindenyl)(indenyl)ZrCl2 have been synthesized and used , after a methylaluminoxane activation , in propene polymerization . these diastereomers produce isotactic polypropenes with similar microstructures and molar masses under equivalent polymerization conditions . 
the complexes [ Zr(e2-Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe 3)(e5-C5Me4R)2 ] ( r = me ( 5 ) , H ( 6 ) , SiMe3 ( 7 ) ) reacted smoothly with terminal alkynes HC ≡ CR ( ŕ = CMe3 , SiMe3 , ferrocenyl ( fc ) , ph ) to give the agostic alkenyl-alkynyl complexes [ zr(e1- C ≡ CR){e3-C(SiMe3) = CH(SiMe 3)}(e5-C5Me4R)2 ] ( r / ŕ = me / CMe3 ( 5a ) , me / SiMe3 ( 5b ) , H / CMe <nUm> ( 6a ) , H / SiMe3 ( 6b ) , H / fc ( 6c ) , H / ph ( 6d ) , SiMe <nUm> / CMe3 ( 7a ) , SiMe3 / fc ( 7c ) ) . complex 7a , formed in situ from <nUm> and HC ≡ CCMe3 , dimerized tert-butylethyne exclusively to give the head - to - tail dimer Me3CC ≡ CC(CMe <nUm> ) = CH2 , and when all the terminal alkyne was consumed , <nUm> was restored . complex <nUm> reacted similarly with 1-hexyne , phenylethyne , and (trimethylsilyl)ethyne , affording the respective alkenyl-alkynyl complexes , which also changed back to <nUm> on evaporation of the reaction solutions ; none of these terminal alkynes was dimerized with 5-7 . heating of complex <nUm> with CLi ≡ CSiMe3 in toluene or THF yielded the diamagnetic zirconate complex Li[Zr(e1-C ≡ CSiMe3)(e2- Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3)(e5-C 5HMe4)2 ] ( 6e ) and its solvatomorph Li[Zr(e1-C ≡ CSiMe3)(e2-Me 3SiC ≡ CSiMe3)(e5-C5HMe 4)2]*C4H8O ( 6f ) , respectively . the lithium cation in 6e and 6f is placed in a position at the side of the alkynyl triple bond and close to C3 of the e2-Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ligand , apparently interacting with both moieties . all presented complexes were characterized by the standard spectral methods , and the structures of 5a , 6a , 6c , 6d , and 6e were determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . 
A series of metallocene - containing silsesquioxanes with alkenylsilyl and trimethylsilyl groups , cp' <nUm> M[(c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Si <nUm> O <nUm> ](OSiMe <nUm> r ) ( 2b-d , 3b-d , 4d , 5d : cp' = cp ( cyclopentadienyl ) , cp* ( pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ) ; m = Ti , Zr , Hf , r = methyl , vinyl , allyl ) , have been synthesized . the structures of the complexes cp <nUm> M[(c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Si <nUm> O <nUm> ](OSiMe <nUm> CH <nUm> CH = CH <nUm> ) ( m = Zr ( 3d ) , Hf ( 5d ) ) have been unambiguously established by single - crystal x-ray diffraction analyses . silylation or germylation of the zirconocene - containing silsesquioxane monosilanol cp <nUm> Zr[(c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Si <nUm> O <nUm> ](OH) ( 3a ) or its hafnocene derivative cp <nUm> Hf[(c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> -Si <nUm> O <nUm> ](OH) ( 5a ) , which can be prepared by the careful reaction of the silsesquioxane trisilanol ( c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Si <nUm> O <nUm> ( OH ) <nUm> ( 1a ) with zirconocene dichloride or hafnocene dichloride , yields the new series of metallocene - containing silsesquioxanes cp <nUm> Zr[(c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Si <nUm> O <nUm> ](OSiMe <nUm> H ) ( 3e ) , cp <nUm> -Zr[(c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Si <nUm> O <nUm> ](OGeMe <nUm> ) ( 3f ) , and cp <nUm> Hf[(c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Si <nUm> O <nUm> ](OSiMe <nUm> H ) ( 5e ) . the reaction of 3e with <nUm> equiv of hydrogen chloride results in the formation of the dimethylsilyl-containing silsesquioxane disilanol ( c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Si <nUm> O <nUm> ( OH ) <nUm> ( OSiMe <nUm> H ) ( 1e ) , indicating the applicability of metallocene moieties as protecting groups of two adjacent silanol groups . silsesquioxanes bearing alkenylsilyl groups can be easily converted to derivatives with ethoxysilyl groups , cp <nUm> M[(c-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> Si <nUm> O <nUm> ] [ OSiMe <nUm> ( CH <nUm> ) <nUm> SiMe <nUm> ( OEt ) ] ( m = Ti ( <nUm> g ) , Zr ( <nUm> g ) ) , by the hydrosilylative reaction . the preliminary examination of the catalytic activity of these metallocene - containing silsesquioxanes toward the epoxidation of cyclohexene by tert-butyl hydroperoxide revealed that titanocene - containing silsesquioxanes ( 2b-d ) show modest catalytic activity . the presence of alkenylsilyl groups has been found to accelerate the reactions , especially in the case of titanium - bridged silsesquioxanes . 
the zirconocene methyl cations [ ( C 5R 5)ZrMe(ClC 6D <nUm> ) ] [ B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( C 5R <nUm> = C 5H <nUm> ( 1a ) , C 5H 4Me ( 1b ) ) react with PhSiH <nUm> in the dark to yield [ { ( C 5R <nUm> ) 2Zr(m-H) } 2][B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] <nUm> ( 5a , b ) and a mixture of ph xMe yH zSi products . the reaction proceeds by initial Zr-C / Si-H s-bond metathesis via a four - center transition state in which Si is β to Zr . In the presence of light , significant amounts of [ { ( C 5R <nUm> ) 2Zr(m-Cl) } <nUm> ] [ B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] <nUm> ( 4a,b ) are formed by photochemical reaction of ( C 5R <nUm> ) 2ZrH + species with the chlorobenzene solvent . the azazirconacycle [ rac-(EBI)Zr{e 2(C,N)-CH 2CHMe(6-phenyl-2-pyridyl) } ] [ B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( <nUm> , EBI = 1,2-ethylene-bis-indenyl ) does not react with PhSiH <nUm> at <nUm> ° C . however at <nUm> ° C , <nUm> deinserts propene to afford the η 2-pyridyl complex [ rac-(EBI)Zr{e 2(C,N)-(6-phenyl-2-pyridyl)}][B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 6 ) , which is catalytically isomerized to [ rac-(EBI)Zr{e 2(C,N)-2-(2-pyridyl)phenyl}][B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 7 ) by PhSiH <nUm> . the key step in this process is Zr-G / Si-H s-bond metathesis of <nUm> with PhSiH <nUm> via a transition state in which Si is α to Zr . the less crowded azazirconacycle [ cp 2Zr{e 2(C,N)-CH 2CHMe-(6-methyl-2-pyridyl) }][B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 3 ) reacts with PhSiH <nUm> directly to afford [ { cp 2Zr(SiPhH <nUm> ) } <nUm> ] - [ B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] <nUm> ( 8 ) via a transition state in which Si is α to Zr . steric factors may play a role in determining the selectivity of these reactions . 
the sterically shielded cation rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-t-Bu-C 5H2)2ZrMe+ , generated by reaction of rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-t-Bu-C5H2) 2ZrMe2 with methylalumoxane ( MAO ) or with dimethyl-anilinium or trityl perfluorotetraphenylborate , differs from other , more open zirconocene methyl cations in that it does not form the symmetric AlMe3 adduct rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-t-Bu-C5H 2)2Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2+ . instead , the unsymmetric ternary adduct rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C 5H2)2ZrMe(m-Me)AlMe3-NMe 2Ph+ is formed in the presence of dimethylaniline and trimethylaluminum . UV / vis and 1H NMR characteristics of hydrocarbon solutions containing rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-t-Bu-C5H 2)2ZrMe+ ⋯ B(C6F 5)4- or rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-t-Bu-C 5H2)2ZrMe+ ⋯ MAOMe- indicate that cation - anion association in these ion pairs is unusually weak . 
the rather exotic and uncommon five - membered metallacyclocumulenes ( 1-metallacyclopenta-2,3,4-trienes ) Cp'2M(e4- RC4R ) ( cp' = substituted e5-cyclopentadienyl ) are formed by " cis " complexation of titanocene or zirconocene fragments with 1,3-butadiynes or by coupling of two s-acetylide groups in the coordination sphere of the metals . examples of these complexes , cp 2M(e4-RC4R) ( m = Zr , r = t-Bu ; m = Ti , r = t-Bu , r = ph ) , Cp*2M(e4-RC4R') ( m = Zr , r = R' = Me3Si , me , ph , t-BuMe2Si ; r = t-Bu , R' = C = C-t-Bu ) , ( e6-C5H 5BX)2Zr-(e4-RC4R) ( x = i-Pr-2N , r = ph ; x = ph , r = ph , et ) , ( e5 : n 1-C5Me4SiMe2N-t-Bu ) Ti(e4-RC4R) ( r = t-Bu , SiMe3 ) , and [ cp 2Zr]3[1,3,5-(e4-t-BuC4) 3C6H3 ] , are discussed with regard to their genesis , synthesis , dynamics , structures , and bonding . these compounds are compared with the also uncommon and very similar five - membered metallacyclopentynes ( 1-metallacyclopent-3-ynes ) Cp'2M(e 4-R2C4R2 ) ( m = Zr : cp' = cp , R2 = t-Bu / H , Me3Si / H , H ; cp' = t-BuC5H4 , R2 = H ; m = Ti : cp' = cp , R2 = H ) formed by analogous " cis " complexation of 1,2,3-butatrienes , in terms of their chemistry , structures , and bonding . furthermore , reactions in which metallacyclocumulenes were assumed to be intermediates are described , together with the reactivity of metallacyclocumulenes toward different complexes and substrates : e.g. metal complexes , carbon dioxide , diisobutylaluminum hydride , and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane . upon complexation with a second transition - metal complex fragment either bridging formal m- " cis " or m-mtrans " complexes of 1,3-butadiynes and 1,2,3-butatrienes were formed . 
the zirconocene-ethylene complex and (Z)-1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)-1,2,3- butatriene reacted to give a mixture of 1-zirconacyclopent-3-yne and 1-zirconacyclohept-3-yne . A zirconocene - alkyne complex gave , on the other hand , 1-zirconacyclohept-2-en-5-yne , which was structurally characterized as the major product along with a lesser amount of 1-zirconacyclopent-3-yne . 
A series of chiral ansa zirconocene compounds that feature ( i ) [ me 2Si ] and [ me 4Si <nUm> ] bridges and ( ii ) two tert-butyl substituents on each cyclopentadienyl ring , namely , rac- [ me 2Si(CpBu <nUm> t ) <nUm> ] - ClZr <nUm> , rac - [ me 2Si(CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]Zr(Ph)Cl , rac - [ me 2Si(CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]ZrMe <nUm> , rac - [ me 2Si(CpBu <nUm> t ) 2],Zr(CO) <nUm> rac - [ me 4Si <nUm> ( CpBu <nUm> <nUm> ) 2]ZrCl <nUm> , and rac - [ me 4Si <nUm> ( CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]Zr(CO) <nUm> , has been synthesized . In each case , the complex exists as the racemo isomer due to inter-ring steric interactions between the bu t substituents proximal to the ansa bridge that destabilize the meso isomer . rac - [ me 4Si 2-(CpBu <nUm> t ) 2ZrCl <nUm> is the first structurally characterized ansa zirconocene complex with a [ me 4-Si <nUm> ] bridge that adopts a racemo geometry . IR spectroscopic studies on the dicarbonyl complexes ( cp 1,3-Bu <nUm> t ) 2Zr(CO) <nUm> rac - [ me 2Si(CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]Zr(CO) <nUm> , and rac - [ me 4Si <nUm> ( CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]Zr(CO) <nUm> demonstrate that the [ me 2Si ] and [ me 4Si <nUm> ] ansa bridges have opposite electronic influences in this system , with the [ me 2Si ] bridge exerting an electron - withdrawing effect and the [ me 4-Si <nUm> ] bridge exerting an electron - donating effect . the [ me 2Si ] and [ me 4Si <nUm> ] bridges also exert a different influence with respect to olefin polymerization , with { rac - [ me 2Si(CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]ZrCl <nUm> / MAO } being a more active catalyst system for polymerization of ethylene than is either { ( cp 1,3-Bu <nUm> t ) 2ZrCl <nUm> / MAO } or { rac - [ me 4Si <nUm> ( CpBu <nUm> t ) 2]ZrCl <nUm> / MAO } . 
A 1-zirconacyclopent-3-yne complex ( 1 ) reacted with " zirconocene " to give a symmetrical , bimetallic 1,2,3-butatriene complex ( 6 ) in which butatriene coordinates to two equivalent zirconocene units . treatment of <nUm> with trimethylphosphine gave the phosphine - stabilized zirconocene-1 complex ( 2 ) , which was transformed into <nUm> by addition of triethylborane . 
the catalytic system of Cp2ZrCl2 and n-BuLi ( <nUm> equiv with respect to Zr ) promotes hydrosilation of styrene derivatives in the markovnikov addition manner , which is the reverse regioselectivity compared to that for Zr - catalyzed olefin hydrosilation with the standard protocol ( Zr / n-BuLi = <nUm> / <nUm> ) . 
the reaction of sodium metal with cp 2ZrCl <nUm> and RGaCl <nUm> in hexane affords cp 2Zr(GaR) <nUm> ( r = -C 6H 3-2,6-(2,4,6-i-Pr 3C 6H <nUm> ) <nUm> ) as deep green - black air - sensitive crystals . essentially , cp 2Zr(GaR) <nUm> is isoelectronic with the well - known 18-electron zirconocene dicarbonyl , cp 2-Zr(CO) <nUm> , complex . the title compound is the first example of an organometallic compound containing Ga-Zr bonds ( Ga-Zr = <nUm> Å ) . 
the synthesis ( 4a-d ) and structure ( 4a,c ) of the four crystalline , water - stable , hydrocarbon- and perfluorocarbon (PFC)-soluble fluorous zirconocene(IV) dichloride precatalysts [ Zr-{n5-C 5H4SiMe3-n(RF)n } 2Cl2 ] ( n = <nUm> , RF = C2H3 2C6F13 ( 4a ) , C8F17 ( 4b ) , C7F5H2 ( 4c ) ; n = <nUm> , RF = CH 2C6F5 ( 4d ) ) , possessing one to three fluorous alkyl or aryl groups attached to the cyclopentadienyl ligand through a silicon atom and an additional methylene ( 4c,d ) or ethylene ( 4a ) spacer or no spacer at all ( 4b ) , are reported . A nonfluorous analogue of 4a , [ zr{n5- C5H4-SiMe2C8H17 } 2Cl2 ] ( 4e ) , was prepared for comparison , and 4a was easily converted to its dimethyl derivative [ Zr{n5-C5H 4SiMe2CH2CH2C6F 13}2Me2 ] ( 5a ) . the ethylene polymerization activities of the zirconocene dichlorides were compared to those of the known bis-{(trimethylsilyl)cyclopentadienyl}zirconium dichloride [ zr{n5- C5 H4SiMe3}2Cl2 ] ( 4f ) , in both toluene and fluorous biphasic solvent ( FBS ) systems . In the case of 4b a PE with a bimodal molecular weight distribution and a significantly lower molecular weight was obtained . polymerization data and polymer properties for 4a-d , compared to data for 4f , show a marked influence of the fluorous groups and the alkyl spacer ( e.g. methylene in 4c or ethylene in 4a ) . FBS conditions result in PE with a higher average molecular weight . evidence on the nature of the active species formed when these precatalysts were treated with an excess of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) is presented . 
treatment of bis(propynyl)zirconocene with BC6F 5)3 results in a linear C-C coupling of the alkynyl ligands to form the zwitterionic complex <nUm> . its treatment with excess RC ≡ N yields an organometallic methylenecyclopropene derivative ( 6 ) . this reaction topologically requires a very endothermic substituted butenyne to methylenecyclopropene cyclization to become energetically feasible by suitable stabilization effects . A DFT study has revealed that the <nUm> → <nUm> conversion is probably triggered by nitrile addition to the metal with formation of a planar-tetracoordinate carbon intermediate , featuring coordination of the three - membered carbocycle through one of its carbon-carbon σ bonds . 
evaluation of the steric and electronic influence of a family of silyl-and alkyl-substituted indenyl liganda on zirconium and iron centers has been accomplished by a combination of x-ray diffraction , IR spectroscopy , solution NMR dynamics , and electrochemical measurements . three tetrasubstituted , bis-indenyl zirconocene dichloride complexes have been characterized by x-ray diffraction and adopt a gauche ligand conformation such that the interactions between tertiary substituents on adjacent rings are minimized . similar solid state conformations were also observed in two of the corresponding iron compounds . evaluation of the electronic environment about each zirconium center was achieved by measurement of the CO stretching frequencies of the dicarbonyl derivatives . simple inductive effects govern the electronic properties of each zirconocene where silyl groups are relatively electron withdrawing and alkyl groups electron donating . for the most hindered zirconocene dicarbonyl derivatives , population of three vibrationally distinct rotamers has been detected by IR spectroscopy . independent assessment of these stereoelectronic parameters by variable - temperature NMR spectroscopy and electrochemistry with the analogous series of iron complexes provided the same relative ordering of the indenyl ligands . 
the structures and relative energies of onsa - zirconocene bis-amide complexes were studied by DFT computations . x-ray crystal structures and experimental trends in DE rac - meso values for a series of zirconocenes with terminal and chelated bis-amide ligands were reproduced with reasonable accuracy by B3LYP / LANL2DZ / / B3LYP / LANL2MB . In the absence of overriding steric interactions , the most stable conformation of Zr{PhN(CH <nUm> ) 3NPh } rings in zirconocenes is the twist conformation . for ( C 5H <nUm> ) 2Zr{PhN(CH <nUm> ) 3NPh } ( 5 ) , the twist conformer is <nUm> kcal / mol more stable than the chair and <nUm> kcal / mol more stable than the boat . rac - (MBSBI)Zr{PhN(CH <nUm> ) 3NPh } ( rac-3 ; MBSBI = me 2Si(2-Me-4,5- benzindenyl ) <nUm> ) is <nUm> kcal / mol more stable than the meso isomer because the latter species must undergo a combination of distortions to accommodate the favored twist conformation of the Zr{PhN - ( CH <nUm> ) 3NPh } ring . these distortions include a significant η 3-slip and an exaggerated angle between the C6 and C5 ring planes for one benzindenyl ligand and a subtle flattening of the Zr{PhN(CH <nUm> ) 3NPh } ring . In contrast , rac - (MBSBI)Zr{PhN(CH <nUm> ) 2NPh } ( rac-7 ) is only <nUm> kcal / mol more stable than the meso isomer . In this case , the Zr{PhN(CH <nUm> ) 2NPh } ring adopts an envelope conformation in which one N-P / i ring lies in the N-Zr-N plane and steric interactions on the crowded side of the meso metallocene unit are minimized . these results provide insight into the origin of rac / meso selectivity in chelate - controlled syntheses of ansazirconocenes based on the reaction of Zr bis-amide compounds with lithium arcsa-bis-indenyl and cyclopentadienyl reagents . 
summary : In reactions of the zirconocene 2-vinylpyridine complex cp 2Zr(2-vipy) ( 1 ) with iBu2AlH and iBu2AlF the isostructural complexes [ cp 2Zr(m-e1:e2-2-CH2CH- C5H4N)-(m-W][iBu2Al] ( 3 ) and [ Cp2Zr(m-e1:e2-2-CH 2CH-C5H4N)(m-F)][iBu 2Al ] ( 5 ) were formed . these complexes can serve as models for the transfer of fluorine from zirconium to aluminum ( Zr-F with Al-H to Zr-H and Al-F ) found in the reaction of rac - (ebthi)ZrF2 with iBu2AlH to form the dimeric complex [ rac-(ebthi)ZrH(m- H)]2 ( 6 ) . the compounds are important in obtaining an understanding of the activation of zirconocene fluoro complexes by ' BusAl and of the role of iBu2AlH in activation processes for the catalytic polymerization of olefins . 
C1 - bridged and Me2Si - bridged 2,5-dimethylcylcopentadienyl ansa - zirconocene complexes , [ Me(H)C(C5H4)(2,5-Me 2C5H2)]ZrCl2 ( 6 ) , [ ( CH 3CH2CH2)(H)C(C5H4)(2,5- Me2C5H2)]ZrCl2 ( 9 ) , [(Me)(H)C(2,5-Me2C5H2)2]ZrCl <nUm> ( 13 ) , and [ Me2Si(2,5-Me2C5H2) 2]ZrCl2 ( 15 ) , are prepared by using 2-bromo-3-methoxy-2,5- dimethylcyclopentene ( 7 ) as a starting material . solid structures of <nUm> and <nUm> were determined by x-ray crystallography . the C1 - bridged zirconocene complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> are highly active for ethylene / norbornene copolymerization with high incorporation of norbornene , while the Me2Si - bridged complex <nUm> shows relatively low activity . complex <nUm> shows the highest activity and the highest incorporation of norbornene among the complexes , but the molecular weight of the obtained polymer is relatively low . 
density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP level have been performed to investigate the mechanism of the zirconocene - catalyzed addition of the ortho C-H bond of a-picoline to propene to produce 2-Me-6- iPr-pyridine . the computational results support the proposed mechanism , which involves ( i ) 2-Me-pyridine dissociation from [ cp 2Zr(2-Me-6-pyridyl)(2-Me-pyridine) ] + followed by the insertion of propene into the Zr-C bond of the η 2-pyridyl complex cp 2Zr(e 2-2-Me-6-pyridyl ) + ( 1 ) to yield the azametallacycle cp 2Zr{e 2-C,N-CH 2CHMe-(2- me-6-pyridyl ) } + ( 2 ) , ( ii ) hydrogenolysis of <nUm> to produce cp 2Zr(H)(2-Me-6- iPr-pyridine)+ ( 3 ) , ( iii ) ligand substitution of <nUm> by a-picoline to release 2-Me-6- iPr-pyridine and form cp 2Zr(H)(2-Me-pyridine) + ( 4 ) , and ( iv ) C-H activation of <nUm> to release H <nUm> and regenerate <nUm> . consistent with the experimental results , the 2-Me-pyridine dissociation from [ cp 2Zr(2-Me-6-pyridyl)(2-Me-pyridine) ] + followed by the propene insertion of <nUm> and the hydrogenolysis of <nUm> are calculated to be the rate - determining steps . the calculations provide new insights into the role of the cocatalyst H <nUm> , the origin of the regioselectivity of the C-H activation and insertion steps , and the preference for a-picoline / propene coupling over propene hydrogenation . 
starting from zirconocene bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complexes Cp'2Zr(L)(e2btmsa) via the 2-vinylpyridine complexes Cp'2Zr(2-vipy) a novel synthetic method for zirconocene difluoride and alkyl monofluoride complexes was elaborated . examples with selected different ligand systems cp'2 [ cp2 = bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl) ; ebthi = 1,2-ethylene-1,1'- bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl) ; (thi)2 = bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl) ; Me2Si(e5- C5H4)2 = dimethylsilylbis-(e5- cyclopentadienyl ) ; (i)2 = bis(e5-indenyl) ; ebi = 1,2-ethylene-1,1'-bis(e5-indenyl) ; and me 2Si(e5-C9H10)2 = dimethylsilyl-1,1'-bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl) ] were synthesized . In the series of these investigations new complexes ( i ) 2Zr(THF)(e2-btmsa) ( 1 ) , rac - (ebi)Zr(THF) ( e2-btmsa ) ( 2 ) , (thi)2Zr(2-vipy) ( 3 ) , me 2Si(e5-C5H4)2Zr(2- vipy ) ( 4 ) , (i)2Zr(2-vipy) ( 5 ) , and rac-(ebthi)-Zr(2-Ph-vipy) ( 6 ) were prepared as starting materials . different methods for preparation of the zirconocene difluorides rac - (ebthi)ZrF2 ( 7 ) , ( thi ) 2ZrF2 ( 8 ) , Me4C2(e5- C5H4)2ZrF2 ( 9 ) , and me 2Si(e5-C9H10) 2ZrF2 ( 10 ) and the monofluorides Cp2Zr(F) ( CH2CH2-2-Py ) ( 11 ) , rac-(ebthi)-Zr(F)(CH 2CH2-2-Py ) ( 12 ) , (thi)2Zr(F)(CH 2CH2-2-py ) ( 13 ) , Me2Si(e5-C 5H4)2Zr(F)(CH2CH2-2-py) ( 14 ) , and Me2Si(e5-C9H10) 2ZrF(Me) ( 15 ) are reported and compared . the molecular structures of the bis-e5-tetrahydroindenyl complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were confirmed by x-ray crystal structure analysis . 
enolizable ketones and thiols have been investigated as potential transfer agents for methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) polymerization mediated by the cp <nUm> ZrMe <nUm> / B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> system . addition of 1-10 equiv of acetophenone , acetone , or thiophenols inhibits polymerization , while the system tolerates the presence of tert-butylthiol ( tBuSH ) . In this case , a moderate decrease in the molecular weight of the PMMAs is observed . the stoichiometric reactivity of these organic acids toward the cationic ester enolate complex [ cp <nUm> Zr(THF)(O(tBuO)C = CMe <nUm> ) ] + [ MeB-(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - ( 1 ) , which models the active species for MMA polymerization , has been investigated . ketones undergo aldolization reactions with <nUm> to generate species that are inactive in MMA polymerization . thiols readily cleave the Zr-O bond of <nUm> to give [ cp <nUm> Zr(SR)(THF) ] + cations ( r = tBu , <nUm> ; SC <nUm> H <nUm> -p-Cl , <nUm> ; SC <nUm> H <nUm> -o-OMe , <nUm> ) . the crystal structure of <nUm> has been determined . In the presence of a tert-butyl ester R'CO <nUm> tBu , thiolato complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> smoothly decompose into the corresponding cationic carboxylato complex [ cp <nUm> Zr(THF)(O <nUm> CR' ) ] + ( R' = iPr , <nUm> ; CH <nUm> , <nUm> ) and thiol RSH , with release of isobutene . tert-Butylthiolato complex <nUm> and the in situ combination cp <nUm> Zr(StBu)Me / B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> polymerized quantitatively MMA in toluene to yield PMMAs with narrow dispersity ( m n / m w = <nUm> - <nUm> ) , but with molecular weight much higher than the expected m n values , consistent with poor initiation efficiency and / or instability . 
A series of 2-R 2P - substituted indenes , where r 2P = ph 2P , cy 2P , iPr 2P , and tBu(H)P , were obtained via Pd - catalyzed reactions of 2-bromo-1H-indene ( or 1H-inden-2-yl trifluoromethane sulfonate ) with r 2PH / et <nUm> N . analogous indenes bearing me 2P , tBu(Cl)P , and tBu 2P substituants at position <nUm> were obtained through the reaction of 1H-inden-2-ylphosphonous dichloride with MeLi , tBuMgCl , and tBuMgCl / tBuLi - CCuN , respectively . diethyl 1H-inden-2-ylphosphonate , prepared via the Ni - catalyzed arbuzov reaction of 2-bromo-1H-indene with P(OEt) <nUm> , was found to be a convenient starting material for the synthesis of 2-H 2P - substituted indene . 1H-Inden-2-yl(phenyl)phosphine , prepared via the Pd - catalyzed arylation of 2-H 2P - substituted indene by PhI , turned out to react with 2-bromo-1H-indene in the presence of Pd(PPh <nUm> ) <nUm> and et <nUm> N to form di(1H-inden-2-yl)(phenyl)phosphine in almost quantitative yield . analogously , di(1H-inden-2-yl)(tert-butyl)phosphine was prepared via catalytic reaction of tBuPH <nUm> with <nUm> equiv of 2-bromo-1H-indene . triethylamine - promoted condensation of indenes bearing P(H) tBu and ClP tBu fragments gave a mixture of cis- and trans-bis-indenyldiphosphines . zirconium complexes ( 2-R 2P-indenyl ) 2ZrCl <nUm> ( r 2P = ph 2P , me 2P , cy 2P , iPr 2P , tBu 2P ) , as well as ansa - zirconocenes RP(2-indenyl) 2ZrCl <nUm> ( r = ph , tBu ) , were obtained in good yields from ClZr 4(THF) <nUm> and lithium salts of the respective 2-P - substituted indenes . ansa - zirconocene ( tBuP ) 2(2-indenyl) 2ZrCl <nUm> including a P 2R <nUm> bridge was synthesized in a similar manner and isolated as the pure rac - isomer . 
reactions of alkyllithium compounds RLi ( r = me , et , i-Pr , Np ) with BC18F15 result in the formation of the alkylborate salts Li[RB(C6F5)3] . metathesis reactions of these with ph3 - CCl and chloride salts of ( ph 3P)2N+ , PMePh3+ , and HNMe2Ph+ proceed with varying degrees of success , as shown by NMR spectroscopy and electrospray mass spectrometry , and the compounds [PPN][EtB(C6F5)3] , [PMePh3] [NpB(C6F5)3]3 , and [ HNMe 2Ph][NpB(C6F5)3] have been characterized crystallographically . all three anions assume the expected pseudotetrahedral structures with normal B - aryl bond lengths and R-B-aryl and aryl - B - aryl bond angles . the compound [HNMe2Ph] [ NpB(C 6F5)3 ] reacts with Cp2ZrMe <nUm> , (Indenyl)2ZrMe2 , and SBIZrMe2 to give propylene polymerization catalysts that are significantly more active and give higher molecular weight polypropylene than do the catalysts obtained using BC18F15 . thus the [ NpB(C6F 5]- anion is for steric reasons more weakly coordinating than is [MeB(C6F5)3]- . 
A kinetics study of b-methyl elimination reactions of the compounds Cp2ZrNp(m-Me)B-(C6F5)3 ( in various solvents ) and Cp*2ZrNp(m-Me)B(C6F 5)3 ( in CD2Cl2 ) shows that the reactions are accelerated by polar solvents and by steric crowding in the cp* system , results consistent with previous findings and conclusions that the methyl migrations are accompanied in a concerted process by borate anion departure from the inner coordination sphere of the metal ion . surprisingly , however , the isobutyl compound Cp*2Zr(i-Bu)(m-Me)B(C 6F5)3 , which is expected to undergo / ? -methyl elimination by analogy with an extensive literature on chain transfer processes during propylene polymerization , undergoes very rapid b-hydrogen elimination only . 
the synthesis of mono- and 1,1'-diphosphaferrocenes bearing thienyl or phenyl substituents at the PCa carbon is described . monophosphaferrocenes can be obtained using a " one - pot " procedure involving the oxidative coupling of phenyl- or thienyl-capped octa-1,7-diynes with zirconocene . this route implies a cp transfer from a Zr species to the iron centers . these novel compounds have been characterized by x-ray diffraction study , and their optical and electrochemical behaviors have been elucidated . these data revealed that the optical gaps vary with the substitution pattern and the nature of the metallocene ( mono vs diphosphaferrocenes ) , whereas their electrochemistry is mainly controlled by the structure of the metallocene . the lowest gaps are obtained with thienyl-substituted mono- and diphosphaferrocenes . compared to the corresponding oligomers featuring phosphole units , these phosphaferrocene - based compounds exhibit higher thermal stability and higher HOMO-LUMO separation . 
cationic methyl- and phenylzirconocene species readily undergo insertion of CO2 into the zirconium-carbon bond , giving the corresponding dimeric carboxylato complexes <nUm> and <nUm> in quantitative yield . <nUm> was structurally characterized , displaying a bridging acetate ligand . 
In the reaction of the decamethylzirconocene-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complex Cp*2Zr(e2-Me3-SiC 2SiMe3 ) ( 1 ) with i-Bu2AlH , CH bond activation , an electrophilic substitution , and alumination of the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand resulted in formation of the e5-C5Me4CH2-Al(i-Bu) 2H ligand . the final product contains an alkenyl complex that shows an agostic C-H ⋯ Zr interaction , Cp*Zr[ - C(SiMe3) = CH(SiMe3)](m-H)[e5-C5Me 4CH2-Al(i-Bu)2 ] ( 2 ) . heating complex <nUm> gives the heterobimetallic complex Cp*Zr[ - C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe 3)Al(i-Bu)(m-H)(CH2-e5-C 5Me4 ) ] ( 3 ) , which is formed by an intramolecular reaction , analogous to intermolecular reactions of titanocene- and zirconocene - alkyne complexes with i-Bu2AlH , which yield the well - known heterobimetallic complexes with tetracoordinated planar carbon atoms . both complexes were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystal structure analysis . complex <nUm> catalyzes the ethene polymerization and the ring - opening polymerization of e-caprolactone . 
thermolysis of the cyclometalated zirconocene hydride ( η 5- C 5H 3-1,3-(SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> ) ( η 5-C 5H 3-3-SiMe3-1-e 1- SiMe 2CH 2)ZrH , at <nUm> ° C in benzene-d <nUm> or toluene-d <nUm> , resulted in H / d exchange arising from reversible C-H activation of sp 2-hybridized bonds . more careful inspection of the isotopic exchange reactions by NMR spectroscopy revealed formation of zirconocene aryl hydride complexes in equilibrium with the cyclometalated hydride compound . In contrast , activation of (dimethylamino)pyridine ( DMAP ) was complete at <nUm> ° C and afforded the ortho-metalated (dimethylamino)pyridyl hydride . performing the thermolysis of the cyclometalated zirconocene hydride in alkane solvents resulted in activation of a second [SiMe3] group on the opposite cyclopentadienyl ring , forming the C 2-symmetric double-cyclometalated complex ( η 5-C 5H 3-1,3-(SiMe <nUm> ) 2)(e 5-C 5H 3-3-SiMe3-1-e 1-SiMe 2CH <nUm> ) 2Zr . isotopic labeling studies demonstrated that neopentane reductive elimination to yield the cyclometalated hydride proceeds through a cyclometalated assisted pathway , while the analogous extrusion of benzene occurs by direct C-H bond reductive coupling , possibly a consequence of the lower orbital reorganization energy associated with the sp2 - hybridized carbon . activation of DMAP follows a different course , where the nucleophilicity of the heterocycle induces reductive elimination and subsequent ortho metalation . In contrast , conversion of the cyclometalated zirconocene hydride to the double-cyclometalated derivative most likely occurs by a-bond metathesis , highlighting the various pathways available for carbon-hydrogen bond activation . 
combined car - parrinello and QM / MM dynamic simulations have been carried out in order to investigate the polymer chain propagation and termination processes in ethylene polymerization catalyzed by zirconocene with the counteranion [CH3B(C6F5)3]- included . A complete account is given not only of the potential energy profile ( PEP ) but also of the free energy profile ( FEP ) for the first and second steps of ethylene insertion , as well as of the chain termination . solvation effects were included on the basis of a continuum model . special attention was given to the counteranion mobility in the catalytic process and the possible differences between PEP and FEP . two different modes of attack by ethylene , cis and trans to the counteranion [CH3B(C6F5)3] - , were considered . In general , the FEPs differ from the PEPs in the barrier height and the shape . the FEP gives a higher barrier over PEP due to entropic contributions . the transition state of ethylene uptake by the metal center , the ethylene p-complex , and the ethylene insertion transition state are all clearly present on the FEPs . this is not always the case for the PEPs , especially for the trans pathway . the calculated FEPs for the chain propagation indicate that the cis pathway is preferred over the trans pathway for both the first and second insertions . for the energetically favorable cis pathway , the ethylene insertion into the Zr-Ca bond rather than the ethylene uptake by the metal center is the rate - determining step for both PEP and FEP ( with / without solvation effects included ) . free dynamic simulations without any constraint on the process after ethylene insertion show that the counteranion can recoordinate to the metal center again in a period of less than <nUm> ps . In comparison with the estimated time scale of the chain propagation , the counteranion which was displaced by ethylene in the ethylene uptake process has sufficient time to recombine with [Cp2ZrR]+ again before a new monomer approaches to the metal center . this is in good agreement with very recent experiments . the energetically most favorable pathway for the chain termination corresponds to the cis approach , with a free energy barrier of <nUm> kcal / mol . 
reduction of the hafnocene diiodide ( η 5-C 5Me 4H ) 2HfI <nUm> with excess sodium amalgam under <nUm> atm of dinitrogen yielded the hafnocene dinitrogen complex [ ( η 5- C 5Me 4H ) 2Hf ] <nUm> ( μ <nUm> , η <nUm> : η 2-N <nUm> ) . x-ray diffraction has established a strongly activated , side-on bound , bridging N <nUm> ligand with an N-N bond length of <nUm> Å . exposure of the dinitrogen compound to <nUm> atm of dihydrogen at <nUm> ° C resulted in rapid hydrogenation of the N <nUm> ligand , affording the hydrido hafnocene diazenido complex [ ( η 5-C 5Me 4H ) 2-HfH ] <nUm> ( μ 2,e <nUm> : η 2-N 2H <nUm> ) . confirmation of N <nUm> hydrogenation has been provided by NMR and IR spectroscopic studies and x-ray diffraction . pseudo-first-order observed rate constants for H <nUm> addition have been measured by monitoring the disappearance of a principally LMCT band centered at <nUm> nm [ ( η 5-C 5Me 4H ) 2Hf ] 2-(m 2,e <nUm> : η 2-N <nUm> ) as a function of time . the hafnocene complex hydrogenates dinitrogen approximately <nUm> times faster than the corresponding zirconocene compound . divergent chemistry from zirconium is observed upon thermolysis of [ ( η 5-C 5Me 4H ) 2HfH ] <nUm> ( μ 2,e <nUm> : η 2-N 2H <nUm> ) , which results in cyclopentadienyl methyl group cyclometalation rather than N-N bond scission . 
the reaction of dimethylzirconocene with nitrosobenzene gave the hydroxylaminatozirconium complex <nUm> . its structure in the solid state was characterized as the n-inside isomer [ e2(O,N)-ON(CH 3)Ph](CH3) - ZrCp2 ( 6a ) by x-ray diffraction . dynamic 1H NMR spectroscopy indicated a rapid enantiomerization process of the chiral system 6a in solution , probably taking place via a rapid equilibration with a reactive e1(O) isomer . 
the reactions of the zirconocene compounds [ ( e5-C 5H5)e5-C5H5SiMe 5C6H5)ZrMe2 ] ( 1 ) and [ e5C5H4SiMe2C6H 4Me)2ZrMe2 ] ( 2 ) with either B(C 6F5)3 or the trityl salt [Ph3C] +[B(C6F5)5]- in CD 2C12 were monitored by NMR spectroscopy . In the case of the cationic products [ ( e5-C5H4SiMe 2C6H5)ZrMe]+[MeB(C6F 5)3]- ( 4a ) and [ ( e5-C <nUm> H4SiMe2C6H4Me ) 2ZrMe]+ X- ( 4a ) and [ ( e5-C 5H4SiMe2C6H4Me ) 2ZrMe)2ZrMe]+ X- ( 5x , x = [MeB(C6F5)3]- ; 5b , x = [ B(C 6F5)4]- ) , coordination of the arene , bonded through Si to the cyclopentadienyl ring , to the cationic zirconium was observed . however , this coordination is rather weak , and stronger lewis donors such as the anion or the starting material replace the coordinated arene moiety . the solid - state structures of <nUm> and <nUm> were determined by x-ray crystallography . density functional computations ( B3LYP / ECP1 and B3LYP / II level ) have revealed that the phenyl groups in [ e5-C5H5)(e- C5H4SiMe2C6H5)ZrMe + ( 10 ) , [ ( e5-C5H4SiMe 2C6H4Me)2Zr]2+ ( 11 ) , and [ ( e5-C5H4SiMe2C 6H5Zr]2+ ( 12 ) are coordinated via one of the arene carbon atoms . the structural assignments are supported by the good agreement between the experimental NMR shifts and the computed ( GIAO-B3LYP / II level ) shifts in the case of the cationic compound ( 10 ) . the structure of the dicationic compound <nUm> differs significantly from that of <nUm> , indicating a strong influence of the para substituent of the arene ring . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> validate previously suggested models for solvent ( arene ) adducts in kaminsky - type polymerization . 
we present a DFT study of the monometallic group transfer polymerization ( GTP ) of methyl acrylate ( MA ) catalyzed by Sm - based and Zr - based metallocenes . the processes examined are the generation of the catalytically active species , the subsequent C-C coupling reaction , and the ring opening of a metallacyclic stable intermediate , resting state of the polymerization process , obtained from the C-C coupling . the mechanism for a neutral zirconocene , a cationic zirconocene , and a neutral samarocene are compared . the isoelectronic neutral samarocene and cationic zirconocene systems share many features , which explains their similar behavior in both the C-C coupling ( no energy barrier on the potential energy surface ) and the MA - assisted opening of the metallacycle . an analysis of the factors driving polymer stereoregularity in the processes catalyzed by the neutral samarocene and the cationic zirconocene has led to identifying a relationship between stereoregularity and the relative disposition of the acrylate and enolate ligands , as well as the direction of the incoming MA molecule in the opening of the metallacycle resting state . on the basis of these discoveries a kinetic model has been developed , which has proved successful in qualitatively predicting stereoregularity . 
the well - known zirconafuranone , obtained by the reaction of the decamethylzirconocene bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complex cp* 2Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) with carbon dioxide , rearranges upon thermolysis to a complex with the [ C 5Me4-CH2-CH(Me3Si)C( = C = O ) ] 2- ligand resulting from an electrophilic substitution of a hydrogen atom at one of the methyl groups of a cp* ligand , a cleavage of the CO bond in the starting zirconafuranone , and a movement of the Me3Si groups from b-carbon to oxygen . another example of the functionalization of a pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand by carbon dioxide was found with a complex obtained by the reaction of Cp*2ZrCl2 with magnesium in the presence of the butadiyne t-BuC ≡ CC ≡ Ct-Bu . this complex reacts by formally inserting <nUm> equiv of carbon dioxide into each of two CZr bonds , but yields a dinuclear complex with twofold functionalized cp* ligands acting as bridging dicarboxylato ligands , [ O2C-CH 2-C5Me3-CH2-CH(t-Bu)C( = C = CH-t-Bu)- CO2]3- . both complexes result from a simple method of functionalization of cp* ligands of zirconocene complexes and were characterized by NMR and x-ray crystal structure analysis . 
isotopically labeled zirconocene methyl neopentyl complexes of the formula ( CpR n ) 2Zr-(CH 3)(CH 2C(CH <nUm> ) 2CD <nUm> ) are obtained via reaction of CHLi 2C(CH <nUm> ) 2CD <nUm> with ( CpR n ) 2Zr(CH <nUm> ) - ( Cl ) . addition of B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> to ( CpR n ) 2Zr(CH 3)(CH 2C(CH <nUm> ) 2CD <nUm> ) results in b-methyl elimination , forming the ion - paired species [ ( CpR n ) 2Zr(CH <nUm> ) ] [ CH 3B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] along with isotopologs of isobutene . the relative amounts of d 3- and d 0-isobutene afford the isotope effect for b-methyl elimination . for cp 2Zr(CH 3)(CH 2C(CH <nUm> ) 2CD <nUm> ) ( cp = ( n 5-C 5H <nUm> ) ) , a kinetic deuterium isotope effect of <nUm> has been measured at <nUm> ° C . comparable deuterium kinetic isotope effects have been observed for four other zirconocene methyl neopentyl compounds : [ Cp*(C 5Me 4H)-Zr ] ( cp* = ( n 5-C 5Me <nUm> ) ) , [ cp* 2Zr ] , [rac-(EBI)Zr] ( EBI - ethylenebis(indenyl) ) , and [(THP)Zr] ( THP = 1,2-(SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> ( n 5-3,5-C 5H(CHMe <nUm> ) 2)(n 5-C 5H <nUm> ) ) . the direction and magnitude of these effects are consistent with g-agostic assistance in the transition state for b-methyl elimination , the microscopic reverse of a-agostic assistance in the transition state for olefin insertion into the zr-methyl bond . 
reactions of group <nUm> metallocene dihydrides , ( r nCp ) 2MH <nUm> ( r nCp = alkyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl ; m = Zr , Hf ) , with olefins afford stable metallocene alkyl hydride complexes of the general formula ( r nCp ) 2M(CH 2CHR' 2)(H) ( R' = H , alkyl ) . for sterically crowded , monomeric dihydrides , cp* 2ZrH <nUm> ( cp* = η 5-C 5Me <nUm> ) , cp*(e 5- C 5Me 4H)ZrH <nUm> , cp*(e 5-C 5Me 4Et)-ZrH <nUm> , cp* 2HfH <nUm> , and cp*(e 5-C 5H 3-1,3- ( CMe <nUm> ) 2)HfH <nUm> , second - order rate constants for olefin insertion have been measured . for cp* 2HfH <nUm> , the relative rates of olefin insertion have been found to be 1-pentene > styrene ≫ cis-2-butene > cyclopentene > trans-2-butene > isobutene . the rate of isobutene insertion into cp*(e 5-C 5Me 4H)ZrH <nUm> is <nUm> × 1Q <nUm> times greater than that for cp* 2ZrH <nUm> at <nUm> ° C , demonstrating the striking steric effect for isobutene insertion imposed by a tenth methyl substituent on the two cyclopentadienyl ligands . A primary k H / k d of <nUm> at <nUm> ° C and a linear free energy correlation to σ ( ρ = <nUm> ) for para-substituted styrene insertion indicate that insertion into a Zr-H bond proceeds via rate - determining hydride transfer to coordinated olefin , with small positive charge buildup at the b-carbon of the inserting styrene . the rates of b-H elimination for the series ( r n-Cp ) 2Zr(CH 2CHR')(H) have been measured via rapid trapping of the intermediate zirconocene dihydride with 4,4-dimethyl-2-pentyne . key observations for b-H elimination are ( a ) primary kinetic deuterium isotope effects ( k H / k d = <nUm> - <nUm> ) and ( b ) a linear free relationship for the phenethyl hydride series cp*(e 5-C 5Me 4H)Zr(CH 2CH 2-p-C 6H 4-X)(H) ( x = H , CH <nUm> , CF <nUm> , OCH <nUm> ) , which correlates better to o than σ + ; p = <nUm> . the rate of b-H elimination slows with more substituted , hence more sterically crowded , cyclopentadienyl ligands . equilibration of a series of Cp*(CpR n)Zr(CH 2CHMe 2)(H) and Cp*(CpR n)Zr(CH 2CH 2CH 2CH 3)(H) with free isobutene and 1-butene has established the relative ground - state energies of isobutyl and n-butyl complexes . these data , in combination with the free energies of activation for b-H elimination , allow free energy profiles to be constructed for insertion and b-H elimination for each olefin . 
the second - order rate constants for the insertion of cyclohexene into substituted bis(indenyl)zirconocene dihydrides , ( η 5-C 9H 5-1,3-R <nUm> ) 2ZrH <nUm> ( r = SiMe <nUm> , CHMe <nUm> ) , to yield the cyclohexyl hydride complexes have been measured . comparison of these values to the corresponding tetrahydroindenyl derivatives ( η 5-C 9H 9-1,3-R <nUm> ) 2ZrH <nUm> reveals significantly faster insertion reactions for the bis(indenyl) compounds . accordingly , primarily s-donating ligands such as PMe <nUm> , PEt <nUm> , and tetrahydrothiophene coordinate to ( η 5-C 9H 5-1,3-(CHMe <nUm> ) <nUm> ) 2ZrH <nUm> to form ( η 5-C 9H 5-1,3-(CHMe <nUm> ) <nUm> ) 2ZrH 2(L) compounds , one of which ( L = PMe <nUm> ) has been structurally characterized . In contrast , the more electron - rich zirconocene tetrahydroindenyl dihydrides exhibit weaker binding in solution . taken together , these results establish an " indenyl effect " in zirconocene hydride chemistry likely arising from increased electrophilicity of the metal center , rather than a change in hapticity along the reaction coordinate . 
zirconocene precatalysts with sterically bulky alkyl groups were designed as model systems for the propagating species in zirconocene - catalyzed alkene polymerization . specialty alkyllithium reagents Li(CH2CEt <nUm> ) and Li(CH2CMe2CH2Ph) were prepared and utilized in the synthesis of dialkyl and methyl-alkyl zirconocenes of the form CpCp*ZrR2 , Cp2Zr(CH3) ( r ) , and CpCp*Zr(CH3) ( r ) ( cp = ( e5-C5H <nUm> ) ; cp* = ( e5-C5Me5 ) ; r = CH2CMe3 , CH2SiMe3 , CH 2CEt3 , CH2CMe2CH2Ph ) . these new zirconocene alkyls were isolated and fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy and in some cases by x-ray diffraction . the molecular structures determined display the bent - sandwich coordination mode common for zirconocenes . the steric influence of the alkyl group on the observed structural parameters is reflected in slightly expanded C-Zr-C or C-Zr-Cl angles in the equatorial plane and long zirconium - alkyl bond distances . 
the cyclobutylene-bis(2-indenyl)zirconium dichloride complex ( 4 ) , derived from an intramolecular photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of bis[2-(methylethenyl)indenyl]zirconium dichloride ( 3 ) , was reacted with methyllithium or phenyllithium to yield the corresponding cyclobutylene-bis(2- indenyl ) - zirconium dimethyl ( 12 ) or diphenyl ( 13 ) complex , respectively . insertion of carbon monoxide into the zr-phenyl linkage of <nUm> yielded the " o-inside " e2-benzoyl ansa - zirconocene complexes 18-syn / anti , which were characterized by x-ray diffraction . tert-Butyl isocyanide insertion into the Zr - CH3 bond of <nUm> gave the " n-inside " e2-iminoacyl metallocene isomers 17-syn and 17-anti ; the latter was characterized by x-ray diffraction . under kinetic control tert-butyl isonitrile insertion into <nUm> gave the " n-outside " e2-iminoacyl metallocene isomers 25-syn / 25-anti , which rearranged to 17-syn / anti at <nUm> K with gibbs activation energies of DG rearr = <nUm> / <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal*mol-1 , respectively . the analogous rearrangement of the " n-outside " to " n-inside " isomers of the corresponding cyclobutylene- bis(cyclopentadienyl)Zr-(e2-iminoacyl) reference systems ( 23-syn / anti to 24-syn / anti ) is much faster ( <nUm> K : DGrearr = <nUm> / <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal*mol-1 ) . similar differences in the kinetic " n-outside " to thermodynamic " n-inside " e2-iminobenzoyl metallocene isomerization were observed for the tert-butyl isonitrile insertion products of the cyclobutylene-bis(2-indenyl) ZrPh2 ( 13 ) and cyclobutylene-bis(C5H4)ZrPh <nUm> ( 15 ) systems , which indicates a pronounced influence of the covering phenylene groups on the s-ligand chemistry in these rigid ansa - metallocene systems . 
ethylene polymerization using catalysts derived from activation of zirconocene aluminohydride complexes with either methyl aluminoxane or B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> is reported . variable - temperature NMR spectra of mixtures of cp* 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> or cp' 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> and excess B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> reveal the formation of di- or polynuclear metallocenium ion - pairs featuring terminal or both terminal and bridging borohydride counteranions HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> arising from hydride abstraction . At higher T , ion - pairs featuring the terminal HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> counterion decompose , and the AlH <nUm> that is liberated degrades B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> to furnish mixtures of ( C 6F <nUm> ) nAlH 3-n and , in the case of cp* 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> , a new ion - pair partnered with the diborohydride counteranion [ cp* 2ZrH][(m-H) 2B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] . the latter compound was independently prepared from cp* 2-ZrH <nUm> and HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> and is active in ethylene polymerization ; however it is <nUm> times less active than the catalyst formed from cp* 2ZrH 3AlH <nUm> and B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> and so can not account for the multisite behavior of the latter combination . there is evidence of chemical exchange between " free " or terminal HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> and excess B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> in these mixtures , and on the basis of model studies with [ nBu 4N][HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] and B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> , this involves reversible formation of [ nBu 4N][(C 6F <nUm> ) 3B)(m-H)B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , which can be detected by 19F NMR spectroscopy in solution at low T . 
the reactions of the zirconocene compounds [ ( e5-C 5H5)2-Zr(CH2C6H 4R)2 ] ( r = F ( 1 ) , CMe3 ( 2 ) , me ( 3 ) ) with either BC18F15 or the trityl salt [ ph 3C]+[B(C6F5)4] - in CD2Cl2 were monitored by NMR spectroscopy . In all cases , the cationic compound [ ( e5-C5H 5)2-Zr(e2-CH2C6H 4R)]+ was obtained , irrespective of the activator used ( BC18F15 or the trityl salt ) . whereas NMR studies suggest a e2-coordination of the benzyl ligand to the cationic zirconium metal , detailed DFT studies revealed that in CD 2Cl2 this is only the case if one solvent molecule is coordinated via the lone pair of one chlorine to the metal . without this coordination , a e3-coordination is more likely to occur . computed NMR shifts at the B3LYP / IGLO II level corroborate this observation , which is in concert with a detailed NBO analysis of the cationic zirconocene compounds . 
the molecule Cp(3-Me3Si-6,6-dmch)ZrI2 ( cp = e5-cyclopentadienyl ; 3-Me3Si-6,6-dmch = e5-3-trimethylsilyl-6,6-dimethylcyclohexadienyl ) has been synthesized , and the molecular and electronic structures have been investigated . photoelectron spectroscopy shows that substitution of a trimethylsilyl group in place of a hydrogen atom on the 6,6-dmch ligand destabilizes all of the ionizations of Cp(3-Me3Si-6,6-dmch)ZrI2 by ca. <nUm> - <nUm> eV compared to those of Cp(6,6-dmch)ZrI2 . density functional calculations accurately reproduce the experimental structure of the molecule and agree with the observed shift of all ionizations to lower energies . interestingly , the ionizations are calculated to shift to lower energies without the expected increase in electron density at the metal center . this apparent contradiction is understood from analysis of one - center and two - center charge effects in the molecule . As a consequence of these charge effects , the silyl substitution makes the 3-Me3Si-6,6-dmch ligand a slightly better donor and , surprisingly , also a better acceptor ligand than the 6,6-dmch ligand . 
gently warming the e6,e5-bis(indenyl) zirconium dimethoxyethane compound ( e6-C9H 5-1,3-(SiMe3)2)-(e5-C 9H5-1,3-(SiMe3)2)Zr(DME) ( 1-DME ) to <nUm> ° C resulted in C-O bond scission to yield an equimolar mixture of the zirconocene ethylene compound ( e5-C9H 5-1,3-(SiMe3)2)2Zr(e 2-CH2 = CH2 ) and the corresponding zirconium bis(methoxide) complex ( e5-C9H5-1,3- (SiMe3)2)2Zr(OMe)2 . monitoring the relative rates of 1-DME versus 1-DME-d10 cleavage by 1H NMR spectroscopy established no kinetic isotope effect ( kH / k d = <nUm> ) , eliminating the possibility of C-H activation in or prior to the rate - determining step . computational studies support a pathway involving rate - determining DME dissociation from the e6 , e5-bis(indenyl)zirconium complex followed by facile e6 to e5 indenyl haptotropic rearrangement and C-O bond scission . corresponding C-S bond cleavage chemistry has been investigated for three thioethers and the mechanism of bond activation compared to the oxygen congeners . 
the cp - alkenyl and cp - dienyl ligand systems <nUm> and <nUm> were prepared by fulvene routes . subsequent transmetalation gave the respective (Cp-propenyl)2- , (Cp-butenyl)2- , ( cp - pentadienyl ) 2- , and Cphexadienyl)2ZrCl2 and - ClHf <nUm> complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> . In the crystal these complexes favor metallocene conformations that feature the alkenyl and dienyl substituents far separated from each other at the open front side of the bent metallocene wedge . photolysis in the solid state consequently did not result in an intramolecular C-C coupling reaction but led to e / z isomerization of the alkenyl units . In solution rapid conformational metallocene equilibration takes place . photolysis of the (Cp-alkenyl)2ZrCl2 complexes <nUm> in solution very efficiently resulted in the formation of the cyclobutylene-bridged ansa - zirconocene isomers <nUm> by rapid intramolecular [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition reaction by means of a dynamic topochemical reaction control . photolysis of the (Cp-dienyl)2ZrCl2 and - Cl2Hf complexes ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) in solution proceeded analogously to efficiently yield the cyclooctadienylene bridged ansa - metallocenes ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) by formal dynamic topochemical [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition reaction control . 
the effect of the metal on elementary chain propagation and termination reactions in hafnocene- and zirconocene - catalyzed olefin copolymerization processes has been systematically studied by quantum chemical methods . two consecutive monomer insertions , parallel with the competing chain termination reactions , were studied for copolymerization of ethene with propene , 1-butene , and 1-hexene . for the purpose of a comparative study , analogous species along the reaction pathway were studied for each metallocene / monomer combination . effects due to incorporation of a comonomer were analyzed as a function of both the central metal and the comonomer size . In accordance with the general experimental observations of zirconocenes producing lower molecular weight polymer than the hafnocenes , differences in activation energies for chain propagation and termination are smaller for the zirconocene . for the zirconocene , the activation energy is particularly low for b-hydrogen elimination after secondary comonomer insertion . 
reactions of (phenylethynyl)lithium with substituted cyclopentenones gave the corresponding phenylethynyl-substituted cyclopentadienes 1,2-R 2-4-(PhC ≡ C)C5H2 ( r = me ( 1a ) , ph ( 1b ) ) , which underwent subsequent deprotonation and transmetalation with ClZr <nUm> to yield the corresponding alkyne - functionalized zirconocene complexes { e5-[1,2-R2-4-(PhC ≡ C)C 5H2]}2ZrCl2 ( r = me ( 2a ) , ph ( 2b ) ) . thermal treatment of 2a,b with C4O4Ru in refluxing benzene afforded the trinuclear complexes ( 3,4-R2C5H 2)2(m3-C4Ph2)Ru 3(CO)6(m-CO)2 ( r = me ( 3a ) , ph ( 3b ) ) and the dinuclear complex ( 3,4-Ph2C5H2 ) 2(m-C4Ph2)Ru2(CO) 5(m-CO) ( 3c ) , via the unexpected cleavage of the two Cp'-Zr bonds . the crystal structures of 2b and 3a,c were determined by x-ray diffraction . 
bis(cyclopentadienyl)aluminum and -gallium species of the type (Pytsi)ECp2 [ e = Al ( 2a ) , Ga ( 2b ) ; pytsi = C(SiMe3) 2SiMe2(2-C5H4N) ] have been prepared from NaCp and respective dichlorides (Pytsi)ECl2 in isolated yields of <nUm> % ( 2a ) and <nUm> % ( 2b ) . In addition to applying standard methods of characterization ( NMR spectroscopy , CHN analysis , and MS ) , the molecular structures of both compounds were solved by single - crystal x-ray crystallography . reactions between 2a or 2b with Zr(NMe2)4 in benzene , followed by addition of an excess of ClSiMe3 , gave the first ansa - zirconocene dichlorides with aluminum ( 4a ) or gallium ( 4b ) in bridging position . the gallium compound 4b was isolated in a yield of <nUm> % and characterized by NMR spectroscopy , CHN analysis , and mass spectrometry . the aluminum species 4a could not be obtained in an analytically pure form ; it was characterized by NMR spectroscopy , and its molecular structure was determined by single - crystal x-ray analysis . the angle between the two planes of the cp ligands in 4a was found to be <nUm> ° , which is larger than in cp 2ZrCl2 ( α = <nUm> ° ) and smaller than in silicon - bridged ansa - zirconocene dichlorides ( e.g. , Me2Si(C 5H4)2ZrCl2 : α = <nUm> ° ) . crystallization attempts of 4a from DCCl3 solutions gave crystals of the new species (Pytsi)AlCl[(C5H4)ZrCp] ( 7 ) , which was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single - crystal x-ray analysis . In comparison to the pytsi - containing species 2a and 2b , the less sterically protected compound [ 2-(Me2NCH2)C6H 4]AlCp2 ( 6 ) , which was prepared from NaCp and [ 2-(Me 2NCH2)C6H4]AlCl2 in yields of <nUm> % and characterized by standard methods ( NMR , CHN , and MS ) , reacted with Zr(NMe2)4 to give the known Cp2Zr(NMe 2)2 . the targeted ansa - species was not formed , as judged by 1H NMR spectroscopy . the gallium - bridged compound 4b and cp 2ZrCl2 , respectively , had been tested for polymerizations of ethylene utilizing MAO as an activator ( <nUm> equiv of MAO ; <nUm> or <nUm> mmol of precatalyst ; <nUm> or <nUm> psi ) , resulting in activities of <nUm> to <nUm> for 4b and of <nUm> to <nUm> kg PE ( mol zr)-1h-1atm-1 for Cp2ZrCl2 . 
reactions of the five - membered metallacyclocumulenes Cp2M(e 4-t-Bu-C4-t-Bu ) ( m = Ti , Zr ) with the lewis acid i-Bu 2AlH were studied . Cp2Ti(e4-t-Bu-C 4-t-Bu ) ( 1 ) reacts with i-Bu2AlH to give a heterobimetallic complex which was isolated as the THF adduct cp 2Ti[m-e1:e2-t-BuCC-CHC-t-Bu)(m-H) (i-BuAl)(THF) ] ( 4 ) . the reaction of the corresponding zirconocene compound Cp2Zr(e4-t-Bu-C4-t-Bu) ( 2 ) with i-Bu 2AlH results in a cleavage of the central C = C bond of the metallacyclocumulene C4 chain and formation of the dinuclear complex <nUm> and the dinuclear acetylide [ (Cp2Zr)2(m-C ≡ c-t- bu)2 ] . In addition to the formation of <nUm> and the acetylide species an elimination of the butadiyne takes place , which gives in the subsequent interaction with i-Bu2AlH the zwitterionic aluminum cluster <nUm> . alternatively , complex <nUm> is also formed in the direct reaction of the butadiyne with a 3-fold excess of i-Bu2AlH . the molecular structures of <nUm> and <nUm> were confirmed by x-ray analysis . 
we have used QM / MM molecular dynamics simulations of the olefin - bound borate ion pair of the mainstay zirconocene catalyst ( [ Cp2Zr(C 2H5)(C2H4)]+[CH 3B(C6F5)3]- ) to examine the effects of the counteranion on the active catalyst . free energy perturbation / molecular dynamics calculations show that the a-agostic configuration is stabilized by <nUm> kcal mol-1 when the counteranion is present , which we attribute to the larger counteranion - dipole interaction of the more polar a-agostic structure . 
In this paper , we compare the electronic structure of the hafnacycloallene complex Cp2HfC4RR'2R'' ( 5Hf ) , which was previously described by erker et al. , with those of the titanium , zirconium , and hafnium complexes Cp2M(e4-RHC 4HR ) ( <nUm> m ; i.e. metallacyclopent-2,3,4-trienes , metallacyclocumulenes ) and Cp2M(e4-R2C4R2) ( <nUm> m ; i.e. 1-metallacyclopent-3-ynes ) using density functional theory ( BP86 / LANL2DZ ) calculations . moreover , the e3-phenylallenyl zirconocene complex 7Zr , which was synthesized by wojcicki et al. , is included for the comparison . these calculations and extended huckel calculations show that the bonding in complex 5Hf is remarkably similar to that of complexes <nUm> m and 7Zr . an analysis of the structural parameters and bonding reveals that the unique interaction of the internal carbon atoms along with the terminal carbon atoms with the bent - metallocene moiety is the reason for the unusual stability of these metallacycles . the molecular orbital analysis further suggests that complex 5Hf can react with another metal fragment to give the bimetallic complexes <nUm> and <nUm> . the electronic structures of complexes <nUm> m , <nUm> m , 5Hf , and 7Zr have been comparatively studied to get a general understanding of the bonding in these metallacycles . 
the e isomer of a [5]cumulene derivative , 2,2,9,9-tetramethyl-3,8- diphenyldeca-3,4,5,6,7-pentaene ( 1 ) , which was previously believed to be unisolable owing to very fast e / z isomerization , was isolated and structurally characterized . the z isomer was trapped as the transition - metal complex <nUm> , and the molecular structure was determined . DFT calculations and an electrochemical study on <nUm> are also described . 
ansa - zirconocene amides incorporating a Me2C - linked cyclopentadienyl-dicarbollyl or indenyl-dicarbollyl ligand were conveniently prepared from direct deboration of the corresponding carboranyl metal complexes using diamines as deboration agents . this represents a new methodology for the preparation of metal dicarbollides . 
the first well - defined zirconocene complexes processing vinyl-imine and keteniminate species have been achieved from zirconacyclopentenes or zirconacyclopentadienes and <nUm> equiv of Ph2CHCN . multifunctional effect of Ph2CHCN is observed for the first time in one system . this process proceeds via the azazirconacyclopentadiene intermediate and its intramolecular proton transfer . moreover , b,b'-C-C bond cleavage of tetra-alkyl-substituted zirconacyclopentadienes is observed for the first time under the appropriate conditions . 
the potassium salt of <nUm> was transmetalated by reaction with (Cp-allyl)ZrCl3(dme) , yielding the complex (NC-nacnac)Cp- allylZrCl2 ( 2 ) . addition of <nUm> molar equiv of B(C6F 5)3 gave [ (C6F5)3B-NC- nacnac]Cp - allylZrCl2 ( 3 ) , and the subsequent addition of <nUm> molar equiv of BC12F10H to <nUm> gave the hydroborated species [ ((C6F5)3B-NC-nacnac)Cp-(CH 2)3-B(C6F5)2]ZrCl <nUm> ( 4 ) . the hydroboration of <nUm> with <nUm> molar equiv of HB(C 6F5)2 gave an insoluble product . this product was fully characterized by 11B and 13C solid - state NMR and IR , which showed that the hydroboration followed by intermolecular adduct formation ( R-B(C6F5)2- - -NC- - -R' ) occurs , resulting in an organometallic polymer ( 5 ) . In addition to the CN - free [nacnac]Cp - allylZrCl2 ( 6 ) , the hydroborated derivative [ (nacnac)Cp-(CH2)3-B(C6F5) <nUm> ] ( 7 ) was also prepared . complexes 2-7 were activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and gave active catalysts for ethylene polymerization . the polymers produced were linear and had high molecular weight , with polydispersities ( PDI ) of less than <nUm> , indicating that the catalysts are single site . the presence of the allyl group on the cp ring was found to increase the molecular weight of the materials produced . In addition to discrete complexes , an organometallic polymer ( 5 ) was formed . this compound is air stable and , while not very soluble , polymerizes ethylene with good activity . 
reactions ofCp2Zr(m-Cl)(m-C 2B 10H 10)Li(OEt 2)2 ( 1 ) with various n-heterocycles derived from pyridine were studied . treatment of <nUm> with pyridine , 2-bromopyridine , <nUm> , 4-lutidine , quinoline , and 2-(1-hexynyl)pyridine generated a-C-H activation ( s-bond metathesis ) products Cp2Zr(e2-C , N-C5H4N)(s-C2B10H11) ( 2 ) , Cp2Zr[e2-C,N-(6-Br-C 5H 3NN)](s- B10C2H11 ) ( 3 ) , Cp2Zr[e2-C,N-(4,6-Me2-C5H2N)] ( s-C2B10H11 ) ( 4 ) , Cp2Zr(e2-C,N-C9H6N)(s-C2B10H11) ( 5 ) , and Cp2Zr- { e2-C,N-[6-(nBuCtC)-C 5H 3NN]}(s-C2B10H11) ( 7 ) , respectively . on the other hand , reaction of <nUm> with acridine gave the addition product 1,2-[Cp2Zr(10,9-C13H9N)]-1,2-C 2B 10H <nUm> ( 6 ) in <nUm> % isolated yield . complex <nUm> reacted with 3-(1-hexynyl)pyridine to afford a-C-H activation species Cp2Zr{e2-C,N-[5-(nBuCtC)C 5H 3NN]}(s-C2B10H11) ( 8a ) andCp2Zr{e2-C,N-[3-(nBuCtC)C 5H 3NN]}-(s- B10C2H11 ) ( 8b ) in a molar ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> , as determined by the 1H NMR spectrum . In the presence of CuI , however , the CtC insertion products zirconacyclopentenes 1,2-[Cp2ZrC(2-C5H4N)dCR]-1,2-C 2B 10H <nUm> [ r = bun ( 9 ) , ph ( 10 ) ] were obtained in 74-77 % yields . it is suggested that the coordination of pyridine to the Zr atom is crucial for a-C-H activation ( s-bond metathesis ) . the presence of CuI can alter the reaction path by preventing the coordination of pyridine to the Zr atom , which blocks the a-C-H activation path , leading to the alkyne insertion reaction . all complexes were characterized by 1H , 13C , and 11B NMR spectra as well as elemental analyses . their structures were further confirmed by single - crystal x-ray analyses . 
we have applied 3D-QSAR chemometric tools to analyze the polymerization activity of a series of analogous zirconocene catalysts with different substitution patterns in the cyclopentadienyl rings . the selection of the most stable conformers was performed by means of a conformational analysis of the different catalysts in a step previous to the QSAR study . the calculated QSAR model has been assessed in robustness following a progressive scrambling protocol that helps to check redundancy in the descriptor space . this model presents a good predictive ability as tested with a set of four catalysts . the final model is controlled mostly by steric contributions , which can be related to the weakness of the catalyst - cocatalyst interaction . 
A highly efficient and convenient method for the monozirconation of silyl- or tert-butyl-substituted 1,3-butadiynes using the negishi reagent has been developed . the resulting zirconium butadiyne complexes undergo two syn-SE2 reactions with various aldehydes to yield the cis-[3]cumulenic diols with moderate to high diastereoselectivities . the silyl substituents at the butadiyne terminus show remarkable influence on the diastereoselectivity . 
the new 1,3-disiloxo-bridged dichloro zirconocene [ { ( η 5- C 5H <nUm> ) 2-m,m-1,3-(Me 2SiOSiMe <nUm> ) 2}ZrCl <nUm> ] ( 2 ) has been synthesized and fully characterized . complex <nUm> , combined with MAO , polymerizes propene and 1-hexene with high 1,2-regioselectivity , yielding oligomers containing vinylidene end groups produced via a b-hydrogen elimination reaction . 
kinetics associated with the [ (SBI)Zr(CH 2SiMe <nUm> ( C 6H 4)NMe 2)][MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] (1a)-catalyzed polymerization of 1-hexene in a mixed toluene-d <nUm> / chlorobenzene-d <nUm> solvent at <nUm> ° C were investigated via 1H NMR and compared to the kinetics associated with the (SBI)ZrMe(MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ) (1c)-catalyzed polymerization of 1-hexene under identical conditions . In the presence of 1-hexene , both catalysts form an identical propagating species , (SBI)Zr(poly-1-hexyl)(MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ) ( 1b ) , but the concentration of 1b during 1a - catalyzed polymerization is only ca. <nUm> % of the anticipated value . under reaction conditions , 1b reacts reversibly with the model complex p-TMS-C 6H 4-NMe <nUm> ( 2 ) to yield the outer - sphere ion pair tentatively identified as [(SBI)Zr(poly-1-hexyl)(2)] [ MeB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] ( 1e ) , which acts as an essentially dormant site during 1-hexene polymerization . warming of 1b in the absence of additives generates the well - defined hydridoborate complex (SBI)ZrMe(HB(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ) ( 1d ) , which does not reinitiate in the presence of 1-hexene . b-Hydride elimination of 1b in the presence of additives such as 1,2-dichloroethane and <nUm> results in catalyst decomposition . 
A number of 2-methyl-4-aryl-5-methoxy-6-alkylindenes and C 2-symmetric me 2Si - bridged ansa - zirconocenes based on them were synthesized . zirconocenes were obtained by means of highly effective and scalable racemo - selective synthetic approach based on the use of a Zr tert-butyl amide complex . the structure of m-(bis-[e 5-6-tert-butyl-5- methoxy-2-methyl-4-tert-butylphenyl-1H-inden-1-yl]dimethylsilanediyl ) dichlorozirconium(IV) ( 14 ) has been established with x-ray analysis . the introduction of a methoxy group into the indenyl fragment of zirconocene significantly improved its catalytic performance ( i.e. , its activity , stereoselectivity , molecular mass potential , and thermal stability ) in the polymerization and copolymerization of propylene in comparison with the benchmark spaleck - zirconocene . the role of the methoxy group is proposed to stabilize the cationic catalytic intermediates , which was confirmed using DFT calculations . 
reaction of zirconocene-carboryne in situ generated from cp 2Zr(m-Cl)(m-C 2B 10H <nUm> ) Li(OEt <nUm> ) <nUm> with various alkenes RCH = CH <nUm> in refluxing toluene gave the monoinsertion products 1,2-[Cp 2ZrCH ( r ) CH 2]-1,2-C 2B 10H <nUm> ( r = aryl ) or 1,2-[Cp 2ZrCH 2CH(R)]-1,2-C 2B 10H <nUm> ( r = alkyl ) in good to high isolated yields with very high regioselectivity , depending on the polarity of the alkenes . this reaction offered an efficient route to zirconacyclopentanes with a carborane auxiliary , which can be viewed as a carborane version of zirconacyclopentanes . they are thermally very stable and chemically inert toward unsaturated organic molecules such as alkenes , alkynes , nitriles , CO , and CO <nUm> . all complexes have been fully characterized by various spectroscopic techniques . some have been further confirmed by single - crystal x-ray analyses . 
A new zirconocene bis(arsenide) derivative , cp 2Zr(AsMes <nUm> ) <nUm> ( <nUm> ; cp = cyclopentadienyl , mes = 2,4,6- trimethylphenyl ) , has been prepared by the metathetical reaction of <nUm> equiv of LiAsMes <nUm> with cp 2ZrCl <nUm> and structurally characterized . efforts to prepare cp 2ZrCl(AsMes <nUm> ) ( 2 ) by reaction of <nUm> equiv of LiAsMes <nUm> with cp 2ZrCl <nUm> yielded a mixture of products that could not be separated , including <nUm> and <nUm> , as identified by 1H NMR spectroscopy . compound <nUm> thermally decomposes with formation of As 2Mes <nUm> , suggestive of reductive elimination to form an As-As bond . further evidence for reductive elimination comes from effective interception of a putative zirconium (II) intermediate with diphenylacetylene to give cp 2Zr(C 4Ph <nUm> ) . 
the C1 - symmetric metallocenes rac-[1-(9-e5- fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl)ethane ] zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) and rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6- cyclopenta-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl)ethane]hafnium dichloride ( 2 ) are known to produce elastic polypropylene . they were investigated concerning their temperature stability during the polymerization of propene . after activation of these complexes with triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) / [ CPh 3][B(C6F5)4] , first polymerization experiments ( 80-100 C ) afforded moderate to high activities . however , at these polymerization temperatures , the molecular weights of the produced polymers are significantly decreased , resulting in a waxy appearance and , therefore , a loss of the elastic behavior . the main reason for this behavior , especially for the more significant decrease of the molecular weight in the case of hafnocene <nUm> compared with zirconocene <nUm> , was revealed to occur due to a fast b-methyl transfer reaction . hence , hafnocene <nUm> can form polymer chains with a high selectivity toward allylic chain ends . these macromonomers can be used in the catalytic insertion polymerization for the formation of new grafted copolymers . initial copolymerization experiments with ethene were conducted . 
the reaction of the seven - membered azazirconacycloallene <nUm> with ph 2CHCN was carried out to yield a zirconocene complex with three fused rings and a keteniminate ligand . further reactivity toward propargyl bromide or propionyl chloride shows that the keteniminate ligand can be replaced by halogen atoms ( Br or Cl ) . In addition , the reaction of the strained four - membered zirconacycle <nUm> with Ph2CHCN gives zirconocenes possessing vinyl-imine and keteniminate species . 
A series of group VI metal complexes bearing a group IV metallocenyldiphosphine moiety and a pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand have been prepared and structurally characterized . reactions of trinuclear complexes with C8K give the corresponding neutral chloride - bridged complexes . further reaction of the resulting chloride - bridged complex with ArBNa F4 gives the corresponding monocationic chloride - bridged complex . on the other hand , reactions of the neutral chloride - bridged complexes with n-BuLi give the corresponding chloride - bridged alkyl complexes , where the group IV metallocene(III) moiety and the coordinatively unsaturated group VI metal(II) center are in close proximity . spectroscopic and crystallographic studies of the reaction of a chloride - bridged alkyl complex with CO or a protic acid indicate that further disproportionation takes place at the alkyl zirconocene(III) moiety . 
the electro- and spectroelectrochemical behavior of diverse (multi)ferrocenyl five - membered heterocyclic compounds , including furan , thiophene , pyrroles , phospholes , etc. is discussed , giving a close insight into the electron transfer processes of these organometallic compounds in their mixed - valence state , whereby electronic and structural modification of the heterocyclic connecting units and / or of the redox - active ferrocenyl termini directly influences the electron transfer properties . In addition , the structural features of these compounds can be correlated with their electrochemical behavior , allowing calculation of the effective electron transfer distance within a specific series of molecules . tendencies in molecular wire molecules based on bi- , ter- , quarter- , quinque- , and sexithiophene connecting building blocks and the appropriate pyrrole derivatives are discussed as well . the consequences of introducing an additional redox - active transition - metal building block , such as a titanocene or a zirconocene moiety , respectively , into the heterocyclic ring , on the electrochemical behavior of the resulting five - membered heterocycles are also highlighted . 
the title complex Cp2ZrCl(CH2PPh2) reacts with BC18F15 under specific conditions by phosphinomethyl transfer to give the phosphane - stabilized salt [ cp 2ZrCl+][Ph2PCH2B(C6F 5)3- ] . x-ray crystal structure analysis showed the P-Zr coordination . this salt is trapped by phenyl isocyanate in an in situ three - component reaction to yield the respective P / zr+ frustrated lewis pair ( FLP ) addition product . In contrast , a mixture of cp 2ZrCl(CH2PPh2) / B(C6F 5)3 and benzaldehyde under similar conditions gives the P / B FLP addition product . the Cp2ZrCl(CH2PPh <nUm> ) / BC18F15 system may form a P / B adduct [ Cp2ZrCl(CH2PPh2)*B(C 6F5)3 ] or a P / zr+ adduct [ cp 2ZrCl*PPh2CH2B(C6F 5)3 ] . from the former it seems to show P / B FLP reaction and from the latter P / zr+ FLP behavior ; the outcome is dependent on the specific reagent and reaction conditions chosen . 
A DFT study on the carboxylation of hafnocene and ansa - zirconocene dinitrogen complexes with CO2 indicates that the most favorable initial CO2 insertion into M-N ( m = Hf , Zr ) proceeds by a stepwise path rather than a concerted [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] path . the calculated results explain the regioselectivity of the N-C formation in experiments . In addition , a comparative analysis of ring tension and charge distribution unveils the different activities of N-N bond cleavage in the CO and CO2 direct N-C bond formation reactions . 
the chemoselective C-O bond functionalization of benzofuran with an aluminum dihydride may be catalyzed by zirconocene dichlorides . the reaction proceeds with the formal addition of a C-O bond to , and elimination of dihydrogen from , aluminum . the product of C-O bond alumination reacts with benzaldehyde via insertion of the carbonyl into the newly formed Al-C bond . 
zirconium - mediated multicomponent reactions of silyl-butadiynes with two molecules of aryl nitriles are described , which provide rapid access to polysubstituted pyrimidines in a regioselective manner and in one pot . employing aliphatic nitriles results in coupling of only one nitrile , leading to the formation of enynyl ketones after hydrolysis . A zirconocene monoyne complex undergoes similar reactions with nitriles to form highly substituted pyrimidines . 
the reaction of [Cp2ZrMe][MeB(C6F5) <nUm> ] ( 1 ) with 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene and 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene , respectively , in C6D5Cl at <nUm> ° C results in irreversible formation of the cationic Cp2Zr+-allyl complexes [ Cp2Zr(e3-CH2C(CH 2R)CH2)]+ ( 2a , 3a ) and [ Cp2Zr(e 3-CH2C(Me)CHR)]+ ( 2b , 3b ) ( 2a,b , r = CH(CH 3)2 ; 3a,b , r = C4H7 2CH3 ) and release of methane . the Cp2Zr +-allyl complexes were characterized with regard to their structures and rearrangement dynamics of their allyl ligands by NMR spectroscopy . variable - temperature 1H NMR experiments show that the allyl ligands of complexes 2a,b and 3a,b are fluxional . the fluxional behavior in these complexes is mainly due to a mechanism that involves e3 to e1 isomerization , rotation of the allyl carbon-carbon π unit about the carbon-carbon σ bond , and reversion to the e3- allyl coordination mode , when both the allyl syn / anti hydrogen exchange and apparent cp ligand exchange occur . the rotation of the C-C unit about the allyl carbon-carbon σ bond also results in a reversal of the e3-allyl coordination face relative to the Cp2Zr + moiety . A second mechanism which may account for the apparent cp ligand exchange in the Cp2Zr+-allyl complexes under investigation consists of rotation of the e3-coordinated allyl ligand about the metal - allyl bond . the free energy of activation for the exchange processes , as estimated from the coalescence temperature of the two cp ligands , is between <nUm> and <nUm> kJ / mol . aside from the intramolecular allyl exchange processes described above , this study also shows that the e1- and e3-coordinated allyl forms of a particular Zr - allyl complex coexist in solution and that the equilibrium composition of these species is temperature dependent . the Cp2Zr+-allyl complexes described in this paper serve as models for similar cationic cp 2Zr+-allyl intermediates implicated in zirconocene - catalyzed alkene polymerization reactions . 
A general method for the synthesis of multiply substituted pyrroles through zirconocene - mediated coupling of two alkynes and an azide in the presence of ClCu has been achieved . 
(m-Ethylene)bis(zirconocene chloride ) ( la ) is formed rapidly in nearly quantitative yield upon hydrozirconation of vinylzirconocene chloride , 5a . In contrast , the slow reaction of (b-styryl)zirconocene chloride ( 5d ) with oligomeric hydridozirconocene chloride ( 4 ) gives an equimolar mixture of Cp2ZrCl2 ( 6 ) , Cp2ZrCl(CH2CH2Ph) ( 7 ) , and the novel binuclear (olefin)zirconocene complex Cp2ZrCl(CH = CHPh)ZrCp2 ( 8 ) . the latter crystallizes in space group P21 / n with cell constants a = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 9 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 6 ) Å , and β = <nUm> ( 3 ) ° . the molecular structure of <nUm> is characterized by an almost planar bridging olefinic ligand . the Zr(l)-C ( l ) σ bond is short ( <nUm> ( 7 ) Å ) . Zr-C bond distances of <nUm> ( 7 ) and <nUm> ( 7 ) Å are found for the zr(2)-(e2-alkenyl) moiety . the chemistry of <nUm> is dominated by the reactive Zr-C σ bond . carbon monoxide is rapidly inserted with preservation of a binuclear structure to form <nUm> . reactions with protic reagents point to the formation of mononuclear ( η 2styrene)zirconocene as a reactive intermediate . 
the reaction of dipiperidinoacetylene ( pipC ≡ cpip , pip = NC 5H10 , 1a ) with [Cp2Ti(e2-btmsa)] ( 2 ) or with [Cp2Zr(e2-btmsa)(py)] ( 4 ) ( btmsa = bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene , py = pyridine ) afforded the metallacyclopentadienes [Cp2M(C4pip4)] ( <nUm> , m = Ti ; <nUm> , m = Zr ) , which in the solid state exhibit twisted five - membered metallacycles with an unusual half - chair conformation . In contrast , the sterically more demanding decamethyltitanocene ( Cp*2Ti ) and -zirconocene ( Cp*2Zr ) complex fragments can only accommodate one alkyne ligand . thus , the titanacyclopropene [ Cp*2Ti(C 2pip2 ) ] ( 7 ) was isolated from the reaction of 1a with [Cp*2Ti(e2-btmsa)] ( 6 ) or with [Cp*2TiCl] in the presence of magnesium , whereas the zirconacyclopropenes [Cp*2Zr(C2X2)] ( 8a , x = pip ; 8b , x = NC5H9-4-Me ; 8c , x = NEt2 ) were prepared by the reduction of [Cp*2ZrCl2] with magnesium in the presence of 1a , bis(4-methylpiperidino)acetylene ( 1b ) , and bis(diethylamino)acetylene ( 1c ) , respectively . NMR studies showed that complexes <nUm> are in equilibrium with their tucked-in tetramethylpentafulvene-diaminovinyl isomers [ Cp*(e6-C5Me4CH 2)Zr(CX = CHX ) ] ( 9 ) in solution , which are formed by intramolecular C-H - bond activation and hydrogen transfer from one cp* methyl group to the alkyne ligand . thermodynamic and kinetic parameters were derived by variable - temperature NMR spectroscopy and DFT experiments . the molecular structures of <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , 8a , [8a*MgCl2]2 , 8b , and 8c were established by x-ray diffraction analyses . 
hydrozirconation of phenylacetylene followed by a reaction with ((trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)lithium gave the respective (s-alkenyl)(s- alkynyl)zirconocene complex 6a . its treatment with a catalytic amount of BC18F15 ( <nUm> mol % ) at room temperature resulted in efficient s-ligand coupling with the formation of the isomeric five - membered zirconacycloallenoid complex 9a . two similar examples with different substituents R1 ( SiMe3 , tBu ) were also investigated . all three new zirconacycloallenoids ( 9a-c ) were characterized by x-ray diffraction . the addition reaction of carbon dioxide to the zirconacycloallenoid complex 9c and two related examples from the literature were studied . the carbon dioxide addition products were also characterized by x-ray crystal structure analysis . 




cationic (C5H4R)2ZrAr+ aryl species ( 2a-d : r = H ; Ar = o-tolyl ( a ) , 2-Me-4-F-C6H3 ( b ) , 3-F-C6H4 ( c ) , ph ( d ) ; 2e : r = me , Ar = ph ) are generated by the reaction of a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of ( C5H4R ) 2ZrAr2 and ( C5H4R ) 2ZrMe2 with <nUm> equiv of [CPh3][B(C 6F5)4 ] via methide abstraction and ligand exchange steps . complex 2d and the Cp2HfAr+ analogues ( 2f,g : Ar = o-tolyl ( f ) , ph ( g ) ) are generated by the reaction of cp 2MAr2 with [C6Me6H] [ B ( C 6F5)4 ] . NMR studies suggest that these metallocene aryl cations exist as ( C5H4R ) 2M(Ar)(RCl)+ solvent adducts in chlorocarbon solution . NMR and DFT studies show that the (C5H4R)2Zr(Ar) (RCl)+ species contain b-C-H-Zr agostic interactions involving an ortho-aryl hydrogen . the " endo " isomers , in which the b-agostic interaction occupies the central coordination site , are ca. <nUm> kcal / mol more stable than the " exo " isomers , in which the b-agostic interaction occupies a lateral site . the aryl agostic interactions are weaker for Hf than Zr , and Cp2Hf(Ph)(C 6D5Cl)+ ( 2g*C6D 5Cl ) does not contain an agostic interaction . 
the synthesis and structure of novel 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl substituted cyclopentadienes ( <nUm> / <nUm> ) and of their zirconocene dichloride derivatives [ Zr(e5-C5H4C2H 4CF3)2Cl2 ] ( 6 ) and [ Zr(e-C 5H3-1,2-(C2H4CF3) 2}2Cl2 ] ( 7 ) is reported . these precatalysts have been investigated toward their properties in the methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) assisted polymerization of ethylene . the results can be compared to the polymerization properties of the non-fluorinated analogue [ Zr(Eta ; -C 5H4C2H4CH3 ) 2Cl2 ] ( 11 ) . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> produce high - density polyethylene ( HDPE ) and are among the most active precatalysts for donor functionalized nonbridged metallocenes . an unprecedented temperature independence of the molar mass distribution is observed for the polymerization with <nUm> . 
the Cp2ZrCl(m-1,4-diphenylbutenyne)PX2 complexes 7a [-P(C6H5)2] and <nUm> [ -P(C6F 5)2 ] insert tert-butylisonitrile into the Zr - c(sp <nUm> ) σ bond to yield the n-inside e2-iminoacyl zirconocene complexes 13a and 13b . x-ray crystal structure analysis of complexes 13a and 13b revealed the presence of a chiral atropisomeric structure with a torsion angle of <nUm> ° ( 13a ) and <nUm> ° ( 13b ) , respectively , around the central iminoacyl / alkenyl c(sp2) - c(sp2) σ bond . In solution an analogous chiral structure is observed . the barrier of interconversion of the enantiomeric atropisomers of 13a and 13b was determined at DG ‡ ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( 13a ) and DG ‡ ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( 13b ) by temperature - dependent dynamic NMR spectroscopy . reaction of 7a and <nUm> with methyllithium followed by treatment with BC6F5 <nUm> gave the corresponding cationic zirconocene complexes 12a and 12b . these complexes took up <nUm> mol equiv of tert-butylisonitrile to yield the cationic n-inside e2-iminoacyl zirconocene systems 14a and 14b as isonitrile adducts . the cationic complexes 14a and 14b are also axially chiral . the barriers of enantiomerization ( DG ‡ ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( 14a ) , DG ‡ ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ( 14b ) ) were also determined by dynamic NMR spectroscopy . 
2,5-Bis(alkynylsilyl)-l-zirconacyclopentadienes <nUm> were formed highly regio- and chemoselectively in excellent yield by the homocoupling reaction of <nUm> equiv of bis(alkynyl)silanes <nUm> mediated by a low - valent zirconocene species ( negishi reagent ) generated in situ from Cp2ZrBu2 . single - crystal x-ray structural analysis of 2,5-bis(phenylalkynyldimethylsilyl)- 1-zirconacyclopentadiene ( 3a ) revealed a sandwich - type conformation . hydrolysis or halogenation of these zirconacyclopentadienes <nUm> afforded multisubstituted stereodefined Si - bridged conjugated systems . skeletal rearrangement of these 2,5-bis(alkynylsilyl)-1-zirconacyclopentadienes with aromatic substituents afforded zirconacyclohexadienesilacyclobutene fused ring compounds <nUm> . using these zirconacyclopentadienes <nUm> as starting reactive organometallic reagents , interesting cyclic compounds such as bis(alkynylsilyl)benzene derivatives and bis(alkynylsilyl)thiophene derivatives could be prepared in high yield . further applications of these alkynylsilyl-substituted compounds for more complicated products and functional materials can be expected . 
exposure of a series of zirconocene amido and hydrazido hydride complexes , (e5-C5Me4)2Zr(NHR)H ( r = 1Bu , NMe2 , me , H ) , to <nUm> atm of D2 gas at <nUm> ° C produced isotopic exchange in both the N-H and Zr-H positions . In general , the relative rates of 1,2-elimination can be rationalized on the basis of groundstate effects , whereby amido compounds with the strongest N-H bonds , as judged by the corresponding free amine , undergo the slowest isotopic exchange . for the compound with the strongest N-H bond in the series , ( e5- C5Me4H)2Zr(NH2)H , the barrier for 1,2-elimination is sufficiently high such that s-bond metathesis becomes the dominant intermolecular exchange pathway . for the other amido zirconocene hydrides , the rate constants for deuterium exchange into the N-H position are faster than for the Zr-H position . this behavior is a result of a faster intramolecular isomerization process driven by an equilibrium isotope effect favoring N-D over Zr-D bond formation . computational studies on a related model compound , (e5-C5H5)2Zr(NH tBu)H , successfully reproduce these observations and support a pathway involving the formation of rare d0 dihydrogen complexes . 
the lithium salts of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octamethylfluorenyl ( flu'' ) and 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9-nonamethylfluorenyl ( flu* ) were reacted with Zr and Hf half - sandwich complexes to generate mixed-ligand-metallocenes Cp''Flu''ZrCl2 ( 1 ) , Cp''Flu*ZrCl2 ( 2 ) , and Cp*Flu*HfCl2 ( 3 ) ( cp'' = 1,3-(SiMe 3)2C5H3 , cp* = C 5Me5 ) . reaction of the metallocene dichlorides with MeLi yielded the dimethyl derivatives Cp''Flu*ZrMe2 ( 4 ) and Cp''Flu*HfMe2 ( 5 ) . reduction of the zirconocene dichlorides in the presence of CO gas yielded the dicarbonyl derivatives Cp''Flu''Zr(CO)2 ( 6 ) and Cp''Flu*Zr(CO) <nUm> ( 7 ) , which represent the first examples of zirconocene dicarbonyls containing a fluorenyl ligand derivative . structural characterization of the zirconocene dichloride <nUm> and the dicarbonyls <nUm> and <nUm> revealed that the methylated fluorenyl ligands adopt an e5-coordination and display a twisted tricyclic core in each case . A spectroscopic study of a small series of zirconocene dicarbonyl analogues indicates that the methylated fluorenyl ligands are strong electron donors and similar in this regard to heptamethylindenyl ( ind* ) and cp* . 
zirconocene - alkene complexes Cp2Zr(PMe3)(CH <nUm> = CHR ) reacted with chlorodiphenylphosphine to form zircono-ethylphosphine derivatives with high regioselectivity , which could be converted into various b-functionalized alkyldiphenylphosphine oxides in the presence of ClCu . 
oligosilyl-substituted alkyne complexes of group <nUm> metallocenes have been prepared by reaction of group <nUm> metallocene dichlorides with magnesium in the presence of the respective alkyne . depending on the alkyne substitution pattern , either metallacyclopentadienes or metallocene alkyne complexes were formed . In order to suppress the oxidative coupling process , PMe3 was added to obtain the metallocene alkyne complex base adducts . the reaction of 1,4-bis[tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl]butadiyne with zirconocene caused the formation of a 1,4-bis[tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl] - substituted zirconacyclocumulene . reactions of zirconacyclopentadienes with iodine proceeded to the expected 1,4-diiodobuta-1,3-dienes . 
systematic exploration of zirconocene ( Cp2ZrII ) chemistry since the 1980s has offered a wide range of useful methods for organic synthesis . many of these reactions are stoichiometric in zirconium , and even if several catalytic reactions are known , the development of catalytic zirconocene chemistry is of continuing interest . In this paper , the study of reactions catalytic in zirconium , i.e. alkyne dimerization and cyclotrimerization , is presented . these reactions are carried out by employing the recently introduced lanthanide - originated zirconocene equivalent . the use of <nUm> mol % of cp 2ZrCl2 , together with La metal or mischmetall as reductant and AlCl3 as transmetalating agent , leads to an efficient formation of dienes from disubstituted alkynes . under the same conditions , monosubstituted alkynes underwent cyclotrimerization reactions to afford benzene derivatives . this reaction also occurs efficiently in the absence of AlCl3 . it was postulated that the catalytic cyclotrimerization did not proceed through a typical insertion of the alkyne into the zirconacyclopentadiene intermediate . this unprecedented reaction takes place in the presence of zirconocene and lanthanide species , possibly involving a bimetallic polarization process . 
we have carried out a combined QM / MM study to rationalize the factors that can affect the performance of C1 - symmetric ansa - zirconocene catalysts that contain bridged cyclopentadienyl ( cp ) and fluorenyl ( flu ) ligands in olefin homo- and copolymerization . two growing chains with different b-C ( tertiary or secondary ) and two olefins ( propene and ethylene ) have been used for this purpose . our calculations indicate that chain transfer has a higher barrier than chain propagation in EE ( ethylene homopolymerization ) , PP ( propylene homopolymerization ) , and PE ( propylene complexation to a metal with a propyl chain ) systems . however , the two processes are competitive in EP ( ethylene complexation to a metal with a 2-methylpropyl chain ) system . substituents on the carbon in a C-H link weaken the C-H bond . this in turn determines the order EP < EE < PP < PE for the heat of reaction of the b-hydrogen transfer process , giving rise to the chain termination , where the process with the most negative reaction heat is the more thermodynamically favorable . it is further argued that the barriers for the termination process must follow the same order of EP < EE < PP < PE . for the insertion process the barrier increases with the number of substituents on the olefin and the cb atom of the growing chain as PP > PE ∼ EP > EE . the different propensity of the four systems for termination and propagation results in the higher barrier of termination for EE , PP , and PE , whereas the barriers are similar for EP . our analysis explains why ethylene / propylene homopolymerization affords high molecular weight polymers , whereas ethylene / propylene copolymerization affords low molecular weight polymers . 
thermal decomposition of Cp2ZrPh2 in the presence of the buta-1,3-diynes RC = CC = CR ( r = ph , SiMe3 ) can lead to seven- or five - membered metallacycles . In both cases a stable benzo - fused seven - membered zirconacyclocumulene arising from a 2-fold insertion of the triple bonds of the dialkyne in the in situ generated zirconocene benzyne is formed . In the case of Me3SiC = CC = CSiMe3 a second minor complex is isolated : a 3-alkynyl-substituted zirconaindene arising from a β monoinsertion of one acetylenic function of the conjugated diyne in the zirconocene benzyne . No stable 2-alkynyl-substituted zirconacycle was isolated . this a monoinsertion complex is an intermediate in the exchange of the metalated moiety with a main - group atom ( e.g. , antimony ) in a zirconacyclocumulene , explaining the formation of a 2-alkynyl-substituted stibaindene . In the thermal decomposition of Cp2Zr(Me)SCH2R4 ( R4 = ph , p-MeOC6H4 ) in the presence of PhC = CC = CPh , only the α monoinsertion of one triple bond of the diacetylenic reagent in the transient zirconathiirane is observed . the 2-alkynyl-substituted five - membered zirconathiolane is isolated as a bis-sulfonium zirconocene - ate dimer . x-ray diffraction studies corroborate the molecular structure of all these zirconacyclic complexes and stibacycle . 
four neutral zirconocene bis(ester enolate ) and non-zirconocene bis(alkoxy) complexes have been employed for ring - opening polymerizations and chain transfer polymerizations of l-lactide ( L-LA ) and e-caprolactone ( e-CL ) . all c2v- , C2- , and Cs - ligated neutral zirconocene bis(ester enolate ) complexes effectively polymerize e-CL at <nUm> ° C with high ( > <nUm> % ) initiator efficiencies . the Cs - ligated complex ph 2C(Cp)(Flu)Zr[OC(OiPr) = CMe2]2 ( 1 ) also promotes highly efficient polymerization of L-LA and is at least <nUm> times more reactive than the c2v.,- and C2 - ligated analogues . the L-LA polymerization by <nUm> exhibits living characteristics , producing PLA with quantitative isotacticity ( no sign of monomer epimerization ) and controlled molecular weight . this polymerization follows firstorder kinetics with respect to both [L-LA] and [1] , consistent with a monometallic , coordinationanionic propagation mechanism . the structurally characterized non-zirconocene bis(alkoxy) complex [ ( 2,6-iPr2C6H 4)N(CH2)3N(2,6-iPr2C 6H4)]Zr(OiPr)2[O = C(NMe 2)CHMe2 ] ( 2 ) has been synthesized in quantitative yield from the reaction of the zirconium bis(amido) precursor with isopropyl isobutyrate . complex <nUm> behaves as a single - site catalyst for polymerizations of both e-CL and L-LA , unlike the comparative homoleptic zirconium tetraisopropoxy complex , which shows multisite behavior for the same processes . both the zirconocene <nUm> and the non-zirconocene <nUm> catalyze efficient chain transfer polymerization in the presence of iPrOH as a chain transfer reagent ( CTR ) for the catalytic production of PLA and PCL , respectively ; however , the metallocene system is more robust ( in terms of ligand stability and maintaining the polymerization rate ) toward an excess of a protic CTR than the present non-metallocene system . 
menthyl-substituted group <nUm> metallocene dihalides of type Cp'2MX2 ( cp' = e5-menthyl- C5H4 ) have been known so far for m = Ti , Zr , and x = Cl ( 1-Ti , 1-Zr ) . A gap in knowledge is closed now by the expansion to hafnium ( 1-Hf ) and the preparation of complexes with x = F ( 4-Ti , 4-Zr , 4-Hf ) . In a first catalytic application 1-Ti is used in the enantioselective buchwald hydrosilylation of imines and compared to (S,S)-(ebthi)TiF2 . also the variation of the ligand to ( e5-8-phenylmenthyl-C 5H4 is realized with a zirconocene dichloride ( 3-Zr ) . the reduction of 1-Ti afforded compound <nUm> , a dimeric titanium (III) complex , [Cp'2Ti(m-Cl)2TiCp'2] . such a species is assumed to be an intermediate in the ring - opening reaction of epoxides with titanocene dichlorides as precatalysts . 
we report the first crystallographically characterized dimethylaniline complex of a group <nUm> metallocene . [(IPCF)ZrMe(NMe2Ph)][B(C 6F5)4 ] shows strongly coordinated NMe 2Ph which does not interchange in solution . DFT calculations suggest that the Zr-N bond is <nUm> kJ mol-1 stronger than the Zr-Me-Zr bond in [[(IPCF)ZrMe]2(m-Me)][MeB(C6F5) <nUm> ] , the structure of which is also reported ( IPCF = me 2C(C5H4)(fluorenyl) ) . 
attempts to synthesize zirconocene hydrido alkoxide species , cp 2Zr(H)OR , via several synthetic pathways consistently failed to yield the targeted complexes , which seem prone to undergo disproportionation into Cp2ZrH2 and a bisalkoxide complex . reaction of cp 2ZrH2 with HOR , Me3SiOR , or Ph2CO yielded the corresponding bisalkoxide complexes Cp2Zr(OR) <nUm> , of which Cp2Zr{OC(H)Ph2}2 was characterized by an x-ray diffraction study . insertion of vinyl ethers into Cp2ZrH2 yielded Cp2Zr(OR)2 and Cp2Zr(Et)OR . attempted hydrogenation of Cp2Zr(Me)OR or reaction of Cp2Zr(BH4)OR with NEt3 did not yield the targeted complexes . Cp2Zr(H)OC6H5 and Cp2Zr(H)OC6F5 could be obtained , however , as transient species by b-H elimination from Cp2Zr(tBu)OR , ligand exchange between Cp2ZrH2 and Cp2Zr(OC 6F5)2 , or protonation in the presence of olefin to yield the corresponding hydrozirconation products . In hydrozirconation reactions of styrene both species are highly regioselective . the alkoxide substituent failed to inhibit b-H elimination in hydrozirconations of trans-3-hexene or b-OR elimination in reactions with vinyl ethers . on the other hand , it imparted a vastly increased thermal stability to the tert-butyl complexes Cp2Zr(tBu)OR , which were stable for up to several months in solution , before they isomerize to the respective isobutyl complexes . cp 2Zr(iBu)OC6H5 was characterized by x-ray crystallography . 
summary : the reaction dynamics of b-hydrogen transfer in the zirconocene olefin polymerization catalyst was modeled using DFT path sampling . trajectories were found to cross the reaction barrier at a broad range and showed that Zr-H bonding increases during the reaction due to dynamic effects and a Zr-(e2-C2H4) fluctuation is critical to inducing the transfer . 
the reactions of a C,N - chelated ( (LCN)2M , where LCN is 2-((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl and m is Sn ( I ) or Pb ( 2 ) ) stannylene and plumbylene with di-n-butylbis(rf-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium ( h ) were studied . In the case of the stannylene , the trinuclear carbene - like complex [ ( lcn ; )2Sn]2Cp2Zr ( 4 ) was isolated as the major product . the second product isolated resulted from transmetalation of the C,N - chelating ligand from tin to zirconium , followed by 1-butene coupling to the coordinated aryne ( C,N - chelating ligand ) ( 5 ) . In the lead case , the major product was the complex S . byproducts were elemental lead , the free ligand ( LCNH ) , butane , and 1-butene . the oxidation of <nUm> by oxygen gave the six - membered trioxa trizircona cyclic complex ( 6 ) and an eight - membered tetraoxa tetrastanna cyclic complex ( 1 ) . 
s-Symmetric propylene polymerization catalysts <nUm> with a bridged cyclopentadienyl and fluorenyl architecture are known to produce syndiotactic polymers . on the other hand , related C1 - symmetric catalysts , such as <nUm> , that are obtained from <nUm> by the introduction of a bulky substituent ( tert-butyl ) on the cyclopentadienyl ring afford isotactic polymers . In this study we employ DFT calculations in order to analyze several aspects of olefin polymerizations catalyzed by the fluorenyl-based C1 - symmetric zirconocene <nUm> . modeling of the propagation in naked cationic systems , disregarding the noncoordinating counterion , yields information on the factors that affect streoselectivity ( and ultimately stereoregularity ) , regioselectivity , and reactivity of the " crowded " site of the zirconocene relative to the " open " one . several hypotheses are investigated , with the aim to rationalize the experimental observation that <nUm> affords isotactic polymers whereas <nUm> gives rise to syndiotactic polymers . we provide in addition an analysis of the stability of dormant species <nUm> produced from <nUm> propylene mis - insertions . for this task , the need to include explicitly the counterion in the modeling seems to be inevitable . comparative studies of the energetics of b-H elimination to the metal or b-H transfer to the monomer , relative to insertion into a Zr - secondary C bond , indicate that dormant species <nUm> are prone to b-H elimination . 
chemistry of reduced bis(indenyl)hafnium compounds has been explored . sodium amalgam reduction of 075-C9H5-1,3-(SiMe3)2)2HfCl2 was studied in several different solvents . while reduction in toluene resulted in decomposition , performing the reaction in the presence of THF or 1,2-dimethoxyethane ( DME ) yielded n 6,n 5-bis(indenyl)hafnium solvent ( THF or DME ) complexes arising from ligand - in - duced haptotropic rearrangement . using less coordinating solvents such as diethyl ether or 2,5-dimethyl THF furnished a rare example of a structurally characterized hafnocene(III) complex , ( n 5-C9H5-1,3- (SiMe3)2)2HfCl . an unusual sodium chloride complex of n 6,n 5-bis(indenyl)hafnium , [ ( n 6-C9H5-1,3- (SiMe3)2)( ? 5-C9H5-1,3,-(SiMe3)2)HfCl]2Na[Na(DME)3] , was also isolated and crystallographically characterized as a byproduct from synthesis of the DME compound . the reactivity of the t]6,t]5- bis(indenyl)hafnium THF compound as an isolable source of Hf (II) was also evaluated . addition of H or N,N-dimethylaminopyridine ( DMAP ) resulted in facile oxidative addition , while C-O cleavage of THF was observed upon mild heating . preparation of the corresponding hafnocene dicarbonyl derivatives allowed comparison of the electronic properties of the new complexes as compared to their zirconocene congeners . 
reaction of the zirconocene dichloride cp flu * ClZr <nUm> ( cp = 1,3-(SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> , flu = C <nUm> me <nUm> ) with i BuLi ( i BuLi = CHLi <nUm> CHMe <nUm> ) resulted in elimination of isobutylene and formation of cp ( η <nUm> η <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> H)ZrH ( 1-syn-1,2-DH * FD ) , possessing an η <nUm> : η <nUm> -dihydrofluorenediyl ligand derived from ametal - to - benzo ring hydride transfer . this species undergoes reversible hydride transfer and exists in equilibrium with only one of its three other possible isomers ( 1-syn-3,4-DHFD ) . compound l-syn-l,2-DHFD catalyzes the cyclization of 1,5-hexadiene to methylenecyclopentane , and its reaction with excess isobutylene leads to the elimination of isobutane and formation of the cyclometalated zirconocene isobutyl species ( η <nUm> : η <nUm> -C s H <nUm> -l-SiMe <nUm> CH <nUm> -3-SiMe <nUm> )(e <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> )Zr i bu ( 2 ) . reaction of cp flu ClZr <nUm> with i BuLi directly generated the cyclometalated zirconocene species ( η <nUm> : η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> -l-SiMe <nUm> CH <nUm> -3-SiMe <nUm> )(e <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> Zr i bu ( 3 ) ; however , reaction of the dichloride cp flu ClZr <nUm> with i BuLi in the presence of hydrogen generated the dihydrofluorenediyl monohydride derivative cp ( η <nUm> : η <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> H <nUm> )ZrH ( 4 ) . treatment of the cyclometalated isobutyl species <nUm> with H <nUm> led to partial hydrogenation of the flu ligand and formation of the monohydride cp ( η <nUm> : η <nUm> -C <nUm> me <nUm> H <nUm> )ZrH ( 5 ) , which contains a hexahydrof-luorenediyl ligand . partial hydrogenation of the flu ligand proceeded exclusively via an intramolecular pathway , as evidenced by the all - exo configuration of the methyl groups on the saturated benzo ring . structural characterization of l-syn-l,2-DHFD , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> revealed a highly strained η <nUm> : η <nUm> -coordination mode for the dihydro- and hexahydrofluorenediyl ligands . 
zirconocene-l-aza-l,3-diene complexes , [ me 2Si(C 5H <nUm> ) 2]Zr[N(Ar)CH = CHCH(Ph) ] ( Ar = ph , 2a ; Ar = / J-MeOC 5H <nUm> , 2b ) and cp 2Zr[N(Ar)CH = CHCH(Ph) ] ( Ar = ph , 3a ; Ar = p-MeOC 6H <nUm> , 3b ) , have been synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy . x-ray crystal structure determinations of compounds 2a and 3a,b reveal folded five - membered - ring moieties for the zirconacycles . DFT calculations and variable - temperature NMR experiments for complex 2a establish a rapid ring - flipping process at room temperature , with the conformation bearing a pseudoequatorial ph group more stable by <nUm> kcal / mol . kinetic studies on ketone insertion into these zirconocene complexes show second - order reactions , and the insertion is more favorable in the presence of a [ me 2Si ] ansa bridge , a less electron - rich substituent on the nitrogen , and a more basic ketone . one of the insertion products , namely cp 2Zr[N(Ph)CH = CHCH(Ph)CPh 2O ] ( 5a ) , has also been characterized by x-ray crystallography . 
In this work , the reversible chain transfer to Al in ethene polymerization catalyzed by Cp*2ZrCl2 / MAO was studied via comparison of the polymerization in the presence and absence of trimethyl-aluminum ( TMA ) contained in commercial MAO . it was found that the weight distributions of the products were narrower , in the presence of TMA , at low Al / Zr ratios taken in these experiments . PDIs of about <nUm> or lower were attainable at temperatures up to <nUm> ° C . we propose that a fast to moderate reversible chain transfer between Cp*2ZrR+ and TMA ( similar to a catalyzed chain growth mechanism ) is the origin of the low polydispersity . simulation of the polymerization with the proposed mechanism confirmed this hypothesis ; the qualitative results are consistent with the experimental trends . 
reaction of zirconocene-carboryne precursor Cp2Zr(m-Cl)(m- C2B10H10)Li(OEt2)2 with various kinds of alkynes R1C = CR2 in refluxing toluene gives the monoinsertion products 1,2-[Cp2ZrC(R1) = C(R 2)]-1,2-C2B10H10 in good to very high isolated yields with very good chemo- and regioselectivity . this reaction offers an efficient route to zirconacyclopentenes incorporating a carboranyl unit , a carborane version of zirconacyclopentadienes . all complexes have been fully characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and single - crystal x-ray analyses . 
deprotonation of 6-dimethylamino-6-methylpentafulvene ( 3a ) with methyl lithium yielded the (l-dimethylaminoethenyl)Cp lithium reagent 4a . its treatment with zirconium tetrachloride under carefully controlled reaction conditions gave the corresponding bis(enamino-Cp)ZrCl2 complex 5a . the product 5a is very sensitive to acid - catalyzed mannich condensation . photolysis of 5a ( HPK <nUm> , pyrex filter ) resulted in a rapid intramolecular [2+2]cycloaddition reaction to yield the cis-bis-(dimethylamino)cyclobutylene-bridged ansa - zirconocene complex 7a in a photostationary equilib - rium ( 5a:7a ≈ <nUm> : <nUm> ) . after acid - catalyzed mannich conversion of the minor component ( 5a to 6a ) the new photoproduct 7a was isolated pure by fractional crystallization . the complexes 5a and 7a were both characterized by x-ray diffraction . 
reaction of [(2-phosphino)ethenyl]zirconocene chloride ( 1 ) with CpM(CO)3Cl ( m = Mo , W ) in THF yielded the[(3-phosphino)propenoyl] dicarbonyl(cyclopentadienyl)metals { CpM(CO)2[(CO)CR = CRPPh <nUm> ] } ( 2 ) . when the reaction between [(2-phosphino)ethenyl]zirconocene chloride ( 1 ) and CpMo(CO)3Cl was carried out in the presence of a catalytic amount of C4Cl2H6N2Pd , [(3-phosphino)propenoyl]dicarbonyl(cyclopentadienyl)molybdenum , { CpMo(CO) 2[(CO)-CR = CRPPh2 ] } , was exclusively observed . when [(2-phosphino)ethenyl]zirconocene chloride ( 1 ) and MeCpW(CO)3Cl were reacted in the presence of a catalytic amount of ClCu , [(3-phosphino)propenoyl] dicarbonyl(methylcyclopentadienyl)tungsten , [ MeCpW(CO)2[(CO)CR = CRPPh2 ] ] , was formed . their structures are determined by x-ray diffraction analysis . 
A comparative quantum chemical study has been performed to shed light on the fundamental differences between hafnocenes and zirconocenes concerning reactions between the metals and a-olefin monomers , namely , ethene , propene , 1-butene , and 1-hexene . analogous species along the a-olefin polymerization pathways were studied for bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconocene and hafnocene , taking into account the structural variations of the first two monomer insertion steps and of the competitive chain - termination reactions . the results were analyzed as a function of both the metal and the monomer , the metal showing more distinct differences . the most notable difference in the reactions of the zirconocene and hafnocene can be seen in b-hydrogen transfer to metal , activation energies for which are significantly higher for the hafnocene . 
Bis(vinyl-Cp)zirconium dichloride ( 6 ) undergoes a clean intramolecular photochemically induced [2+2] cycloaddition reaction to yield the cyclobutylene-bridged ansa - zirconocene isomer ( 7 ) when irradiated with UV light ( HPK <nUm> , pyrex filter ) at ambient conditions . both the open and the ansabridged isomers ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) were characterized by x-ray diffraction . the corresponding bis(2-vinylindenyl)ZrCl2 complex ( 12 ) also closes rapidly and completely to the ansa - metallocene ( 13 ) upon photolysis . the bis(2-butadienylindenyl)ZrCl2 complex ( 20 ) undergoes a formal [4+4] cycloaddition reaction upon photolysis to yield its ansa - metallocene isomer <nUm> , exhibiting an eight - membered carbocyclic bridging unit . the metallocene complexes prepared and characterized in this study give very active ethene polymerization catalysts upon activation with excess methylalumoxane . 
frustrated lewis pairs , highly active in heterolytic dihydrogen splitting , were used as active and very selective hydrogenation catalysts for organometallic substrates . conjugated dienamines fixed at the ferrocene framework and at the zirconocene nucleus were selectively 1,4-hydrogenated under catalytic conditions at ambient temperature . 
hydrozirconation of 1-alkynyl pinacolboronates , <nUm> , with HZrCp2Cl provides gem - borazirconocenes <nUm> . the latter when treated with BrCu gives the homocoupled (1E,3E)-2,3-dibora-1,3-butadienes , <nUm> , in good yield ( 62-67 % ) . the reaction works even for hindered <nUm> ( r = t-Bu ) . structure <nUm> was assigned on the basis of NMR . suzuki - miyaura coupling of 3a ( r = n-Bu ) with PhI in the presence of CsF leads to the replacement of both boron groups by phenyl and hydrogen to give <nUm> in <nUm> % yield . zirconocene - mediated coupling of <nUm> leads to diastereomeric products : (1E,3E)-1,3-dibora-1,3-butadienes , <nUm> , in 7-26 % isolated yields and (1E,3E)-1,4-dibora-1,3-butadienes , <nUm> , in 17-34 % isolated yields . the two isomers can be separated by selective precipitation of <nUm> from the reaction mixture in pentane ( <nUm> ° C ) followed by silica gel chromatography to give pure <nUm> . the reaction does not work when r in <nUm> is the t-Bu group . assignments of structures for <nUm> and <nUm> were done on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments . In addition , a single - crystal x-ray analysis of 5a showed it to be a highly planar and linearly oriented molecule . suzuki - miyaura coupling of 4a proceeded to replace the terminal boron group exclusively , while the internal boron group of 4a remained intact . 
Titanium(IV) and zirconium(IV) bent - sandwich complexes containing the new donor substituted [2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl]cyclopentadienyl ( CpN ) ligand are described . CpNH ( <nUm> ; C7H9NiPr <nUm> ) is prepared from sodium cyclopentadienide and 2-chloro-1-(diisopropylamino)ethane . the highly moisture - sensitive metallocene dichlorides Cp2NTiCl2 ( 2 ) and Cp2NZrCl2 ( 3 ) are synthesized by reaction of CpNLi with Cl4Ti and Cl4Zr , respectively . In combination with the cocatalyst methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) they are precursors for ethylene polymerization catalysts . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> react with <nUm> equiv of ClH with protonation of the amino groups to give the air- and moisture - stable metallocene dichloride dihydrochlorides Cp2NTiCl2*2HCl ( 4 ) and Cp2NZrCl2*2HCl ( 5 ) , which also are found to be precatalysts for the polymerization of ethylene . the dimethyl compounds Cp2NTiMe2 ( 6 ) and Cp2NZrMe2 ( 7 ) can be obtained by reaction of <nUm> and <nUm> with <nUm> equiv of methyllithium . the dibenzyl complexes Cp2NTiBz2 ( 8 ) and Cp2NZrBz2 ( 9 ) are formed analogously with a stoichiometric amount of benzylmagnesium bromide . the diphenoxy complex Cp2NTi( OPh)2 ( 10 ) is synthesized by reaction of <nUm> with <nUm> equiv of lithium phenoxide . the dialkyl compounds 6-8 and the diphenoxy compound <nUm> show a remarkable activity in the catalytic dehydrocoupling of phenylsilane . Zr(NMe2)4 reacts with <nUm> equiv of CpNH ( 1 ) to give the zirconocene derivative Cp2NZr(NMe2)2 ( 11 ) in quantitative yield . the structure of <nUm> has been determined by a single - crystal x-ray diffraction study . the effects of the (dialkylamino)- and (dialkylammonio)-ethyl substituents in metallocene - type compounds of titanium and zirconium are described . 
zirconocene olefin complexes Cp2Zr(PPh2Me)-(e2-RCH = CH2 ) ( r = H , et , ph ) react rapidly with <nUm> equiv of [HB(C6F5)2]n to give the zwitterionic products Cp2Zr{e3-[CH(R)CH2BH(C6F 5)2 ] } ( r = H ( 2a ) , et ( 2b ) , ph ( 2c ) ) and the borane - phosphine adduct Ph2MeP* BC12F10H . spectroscopic and structural evidence confirms an interaction between zirconium and the b-carbon attached to boron , resulting in pentacoordinated carbon . 
the thermal decomposition of dibutylzirconocene ( 1 ) at room temperature affords paramagnetic butylzirconocene(III) ( 11 ) , zirconocene(III) hydride ( 12 ) , the diamagnetic butenylzirconocene(IV) hydride dimer 5a , and the 1,1-bis(cyclopentadienyl)-2-methyl-3-(zirconocenyl hydride)-1-zirconacyclobutane(IV) dimer <nUm> . initially , decomposition furnishes crotylzirconocene(IV) hydride ( 3a ) , followed by 1,1-bis(cyclopentadienyl)-2-ethyl-1-zirconacyclopropane(IV) ( 2a ) and 1,1-bis(cyclopentadienyl)-3,4-diethyl-1-zirconacyclopentane(IV) ( 4a ) , listed in the order of appearance . this order suggests that the primary decomposition reaction is a g-H abstraction , which leads to the formation of 1,1-bis(cyclopentadienyl)-2-methyl-1-zirconacyclobutane(IV) ( 6a ) . the latter was not observed experimentally but is postulated on the basis of secondary products . reactions leading to the above compounds are discussed from mechanistic and thermochemical points of view . the reported compounds have been characterized by either EPR or multidimensional , multinuclear NMR spectroscopy . compound 3a has also been synthesized independently from zirconocene chloride hydride and crotylmagnesium bromide and undergoes the same rearrangements into 2a and then 4a . the allyl analog 3b , synthesized from zirconocene chloride hydride and allylmagnesium bromide , exhibits the same behavior and rearranges into 1,1-bis(cyclopentadienyl)-3,4-dimethyl-1-zirconacyclopentane ( 4b ) . 
A one - pot regioselective synthesis of tricyclic 1,1-diphosphines involving , first , insertion reaction of 2,3-dihydrophosphole ( 3 ) into the zirconium-carbon bond of a generated in situ zirconocene benzyne and , then , an exchange reaction between the resulting tricyclic metalated phosphine <nUm> and various dichlorophosphines is reported . one of these 1,1-diphosphines , 15a ( bis-(sulfide) adduct ) , is characterized by single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies . 
when it is first treated with n-butyllithium at <nUm> ° C , zirconocene dichloride is an effective reagent for the cyclization of some 2-bromo a,o-dienes at <nUm> ° C . the products are carbo-and heterocyclic five - membered rings with adjacent methylene and methyl substituents . reductive cyclization to form zirconacyclopentanes , followed by b-bromo elimination , is indicated as the order of steps in the reaction mechanism . use of catalytic zirconocene dichloride with excess butylmagnesium chloride in diethyl ether at <nUm> ° C is effective only for cyclization of 2-bromo-1,6-heptadiene . 
the synthesis and properties of two soluble , weakly coordinating derivatives of the tetrakis-(perfluoroaryl)borate anion B(4-C6F4TBS)4- and B(4-C6F4TIPS)4- ( TBS = tert-butyldimethylsilyl and TIPS = triisopropylsilyl ) are reported . reaction of the trityl salts of the above anions with a variety of zirconium and thorium L2MMe2 complexes in benzene or toluene affords the cationic ion - paired methyl complexes L2MMe+X- or the corresponding hydrido complexes L2MH+X- ( L2 = bis(cyclopentadienyl)- or cyclopentadienylamido-type ligand ) when the reaction is carried out under dihydrogen . the solid state structure of the complex (Me5Cp)2ThMe+B(C6F5) 4- has been characterized by x-ray diffraction . the BC24F20 -- based zirconocenium methyl complexes L2MMe+ are unstable at room temperature with respect to , among other factors , intramolecular C-H activation of the ligand framework . In general , the thermal stabilities of the B(C6F4TBS)4 -- and B(C6F4TIPS)4 -- derived complexes are greater than those of the corresponding BC24F20 -- and MeB(C6F5)3 -- derived analogues . the relative coordinative tendencies of MeB(C6F5)3- , B(C6F5)4- , B(C6F4TBS)4- , and B(C6F4TIPS)4- are estimated from the solution spectroscopic information and the structural dynamics of the ion - pairs and follow the order MeB(C6F5)3- > B(C6F4TBS)4- ≈ B(C6F4TIPS)4- > B(C6F5)4- . the coordination of the neutral metallocene precursors to the cationic metallocenes is found to compete with counteranion coordination . arene solvent coordination to the zirconium constrained geometry cation [(Me4Cp)SiMe2(NtBu)]ZrMe+ is also observed when B(C6F5)4- is the counteranion . (1,2-Me2Cp)2ZrMe+B(C6F 4TBS)4- undergoes slow decomposition under an inert atmosphere to afford [(1,2-Me2Cp)2ZrF]2(m-F)+B(C 6F4TBS)4- , which has been characterized by x-ray diffraction . the olefin polymerization activity and thermal stability of the zirconocene catalysts reaches a maximum when B(C6F4TBS)4- and B(C6F4TIPS)4- are used as counteranions . the polymerization activity of the zirconium constrained geometry complex also reaches a maximum in aromatic solvents when B(C6F5)4- is used as the counteranion , apparently due to solvent coordination . 
As modifications of the effective catalyst precursor [dimethylsilanediylbis(benz[e]indenyl)]-zirconium dichloride , the ansa - zirconocene complexes Me2Si(cyclopenta[c]phenanthryl)2ZrCl2 , Me2Si(cyclopenta[l]phenanthryl)2ZrCl2 , Me2Si(2-methylcyclopenta[l]phenanthryl)2ZrCl2 , and Me2Si(2-methyltetrahydrobenz[e]indenyl)2ZrCl2 have been synthesized . when activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , these complexes give highly active catalysts for the polymerization of propene to polymers with high isotacticities and molecular weights . 
alkyl- and aryllithium reagents add cleanly to the electrophilic carbon center C6 of 6-(N,N-dimethylamino)fulvenes to yield the corresponding substituted cyclopentadienyllithium systems Li[C5H4-CR1R2NMe2] . subsequent treatment with ZrCl4*2THF gives the corresponding cp - functionalized zirconocene dichlorides . these were reacted with methyllithium to give the ( C5H4CR1R2NMe2 ) 2Zr(CH3)2 complexes 11a ( R1 = R1 = CH3 ) and 11b ( R1 = CH3 , R2 = ph ) , respectively . treatment of <nUm> with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane was carried out to generate the corresponding alkylmetallocene cations ( 12 ) , which turned out to be unstable under the reaction conditions applied ( <nUm> ° C ) with regard to liberation of <nUm> equiv of methane by CH activation at a methyl group adjacent to nitrogen and formation of the spiro - metallocene complex systems <nUm> . CH activation may be a major reaction pathway open to alkylzirconocene cation systems under suitable reaction conditions . 
new zirconocene complexes cp *[Cp(CH2)n-NMe2]ZrCl2 ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) and Cp[Cp(CH2)nCH(CH3)2] - ClZr <nUm> ( n = <nUm> , <nUm> ) catalyze , in conjunction with <nUm> equiv of n-BuLi , dehydrocoupling polymerization of phenylsilane to afford high-molecular-weight poly(phenylsilanes) ( mw > <nUm> ) . 29Si NMR reveals that the microstructure of the resulting polymers is predominantly syndiotactic . 
diacetylenic phosphanes are cleanly transformed when reacted with zirconocene into zirconacyclopentadiene phosphiranes . these new cyclic systems are the source of a variety of unsaturated phosphorus compounds like phospharadialene or alkenyl alkynyl phosphanes . 
the migration of a Zr center between adjacent carbon atoms of a Zr - bound alkyl group is investigated by a density functional study of alternative reaction paths available to a C10H10Zr - alkyl cation . this migration is found to occur by the classical reaction route , i.e. by b-H transfer , olefin rotation , and reinsertion into the Zr-H bond without loss of the olefin ligand , rather than by a concerted Zr / H exchange . the activation barrier is determined to decrease from <nUm> kJ / mol for the degenerate isomerization of a zirconocene ethyl cation to <nUm> kJ / mol for the isomerization of a primary to a secondary zirconocene propyl cation and <nUm> kJ / mol for its back - reaction . it is further reduced to <nUm> kJ / mol for the isomerization of a primary to a tertiary zirconocene isobutyl cation and <nUm> kJ / mol for its reverse , which model the isomerization process competing with stereoregular chain growth in zirconocene - based catalysts . the facility with which the zirconocene isobutyl cation transfers its b-H atom is connected with a particularly soft stretching vibration of the agostic b-C-H bond . substantial stabilization of positive charge at the b-carbon atom by two alkyl substituents appears to be the cause . reaction paths by which an olefin ligand in an intervening isomerization intermediate can change its coordination from one enantioface to the other have also been identified . 
reaction of Cp2M(PMe3)2 complexes ( m = Ti , Zr ; cp = e5-C5H5 ) with the n-(p-tolyl)-diphenylketenimine Ph'N = C = CPh2 ( ph' = p-MeC6H4 ) in a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio affords the ketenimine - containing metallocene derivatives Cp2M(e2-(C,N)-Ph'N = C = CPh2)(PMe <nUm> ) ( m = Ti ( 1 ) ; Zr ( 2 ) ) . the ketenimine ligand reacts in the same way with the " Cp*2M " species ( cp* = e5-C5Me5 ) generated from the reduction of the corresponding Cp*2MCl2 complexes with LitBu ( <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio ) to give the related complexes Cp*2M(e2-(C,N)-Ph'N = C = CPh2 ) ( m = Ti ( 3 ) ; Zr ( 4 ) ) . the molecular structure of <nUm> shows a titanium atom bonded to two e5-cyclopentadienyl rings and a e2 -(C,N) - bonded ketenimine ligand . reaction of " Cp*2Ti " with the ketenimine ligand in a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio gives 1,1,5,5-tetraphenyl-3-(p-tolyl)-2-(p-toluidino)-3-aza-1,4-pentadiene , which probably results from the coupling , followed by hydrolysis , of two ketenimine molecules coordinated to one titanocene moiety . protonation of <nUm> with Et3NHCl or H2O ( <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio ) affords the intermediate species Cp*2Ti(X)(e2-(C,N)-Ph'N = C(H) - CPh <nUm> ) ( x - Cl ( 5 ) ; OH ( 6 ) ) , which on hydrolysis evolves to give the enamine Ph'N(H)-CH = CPh2 as the final product . finally , <nUm> reacts reversibly with H to give the hydride enamidate complex Cp*2Ti(H)(e1-Ph'N-CH-CPh2) ( 7 ) . the structures of the different compounds have been determined by IR and NMR spectroscopic methods . 
the dimethylzirconocene complex [(Cp-CMe2-PAr2)2ZrMe2] , 2a ( Ar = p-tolyl ) , was treated with <nUm> molar equiv of BC18F15 to yield the salt [ (Cp-CMe2-PAr2)2ZrMe+MeB(C 6F5)3- ] , 3a . the x-ray crystal structure analysis of 3a shows that both -PAr2 units are intramolecularly coordinated to zirconium in a close to C2 - symmetric arrangement with the [Zr] - CH3 group placed in the central position in the bent metallocene s-ligand plane . treatment of 2a with <nUm> equiv of BC18F15 generates the highly reactive dication system [(Cp-CMe2-PAr2)2Zr2+] ( <nUm> with two MeB(C6F5)3- anions ) . the highly electrophilic cation <nUm> abstracts chloride from , e.g. , dichloromethane solvent to yield [(Cp-CMe2-PAr2)2Zr-Cl+] ( <nUm> , with MeB(C6F5)3- anion ) . the same cation ( 5' , with ClB(C6F5)3- anion ) was obtained from the reaction Of[(Cp-CMe2-PAr2)2ZrCl2] ( 1Ia ) with BC18F15 . the C2 - symmetric , internally -PAr2 - stabilized dication adds acetonitrile or 2,6-dimethylphenyl isocyanide to give the respective C2 - symmetric donorligand adducts in which the -PAr2 coordination to zirconium is retained . the complexes 3a ( DG ‡ enant ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal / mol ) and <nUm> ( DG ‡ enant ( <nUm> K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal / mol ) show dynamic NMR spectra due to an intramolecular enantiomerization process proceeding with a rate - determining cleavage of the Zr-P linkages . complex <nUm> was also characterized by an x-ray crystal structure analysis . 
this paper reports the convenient " one - pot " synthesis of a bifunctional - me <nUm> cp ̂ phenolate - ligand and the efficient " one - step " synthesis of the corresponding Ti IV and Zr IV complexes . the reaction of 2-bromo-4-methylphenol with <nUm> equiv of n BuLi followed by addition of 2,3,4,5-tetramethyl-2-cyclopentenone produces the bifunctional mono-Cp phenol ligand precursor 2-(tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)-4-methylphenol ( (TCP)H <nUm> , <nUm> ) . reaction of <nUm> with Ti(CH <nUm> -Ph ) <nUm> at <nUm> ° C in toluene cleanly generates (TCP)Ti(CH <nUm> ph ) <nUm> ( 2 ) , while the corresponding reaction with Zr(CH <nUm> ph ) <nUm> at higher temperatures affords the chelated C <nUm> -symmetric zirconocene ( TCP ) <nUm> Zr ( 3 ) . In solution at room temperature , the two benzyl groups of <nUm> are magnetically equivalent , however , in the solid state , x-ray diffraction reveals that one benzyl group is coordinated in a normal η <nUm> -fashion and the other in an η <nUm> - mode . the small Cp-(centroid)-Ti-O angle of <nUm> ° in <nUm> indicates sterically open features in common with amido-based " constrained geometry " polymerization catalysts . low - temperature NMR - scale reactions of <nUm> with B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> and ph <nUm> C + B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> - indicate the formation of the corresponding cationic complexes (TCP)TiCH <nUm> ph + PhCH <nUm> B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> - ( 4 ) and (TCP)TiCH <nUm> ph + B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> - ( 5 ) . upon activation with ph <nUm> C + B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> - , complex <nUm> is highly active for ethylene , propylene , and styrene polymerization . 

the diels - alder cycloaddition reaction between enoyl-oxazolidinones <nUm> and dienes is efficiently catalyzed by zirconocene bis(triflate) catalysts ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) in CCl2H2 or nitroalkane solvents . the use of chiral catalyst [S]-8 led to significant asymmetric induction in the adducts derived from dienophiles <nUm> and cyclopentadiene , but only in nitroalkane solution at low temperatures and at lower catalyst loadings . the binding of acryloyloxazolidinone 3a to <nUm> was studied in detail by 1H , 13C , and 19F NMR spectroscopy in both CD2Cl2 and nitroalkane solvent . these studies reveal that two isomeric , five - coordinate , monotriflate complexes ( 9a and 9b ) are formed from 3a and <nUm> in both solvents . the minor isomer ( 9a ) has the carbamate C = O coordinated to the metal at a central site , while in the major isomer ( 9b ) it is coordinated to a lateral site . In nitromethane solvent , the ratio of 9a:9b ≈ <nUm> : <nUm> at <nUm> ° C , while in CD2Cl2 the ratio is ∼ <nUm> : <nUm> . these studies , along with the sense of asymmetric induction observed , suggest that it is the minor isomer 9a that reacts most rapidly and selectively with dienes under catalytic conditions . the binding of 3a to <nUm> is strongly favored in nitromethane solvent with keq = <nUm> ± <nUm> at <nUm> ° C . thermodynamic parameters for substrate binding were derived from VT 1H NMR spectroscopic studies ( DHo = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ; DSo = <nUm> ± <nUm> cal mol-1 K-1 ) . complexes 9a and 9b interconvert predominantly by an intramolecular process ( as revealed by VT NMR studies at different concentrations of 3a and <nUm> as well as 2D-EXSY spectra ) , while free triflate ion ( formed via complexation of 3a to <nUm> ) undergoes rapid , associative exchange with bound triflate in residual complex <nUm> ( as independently revealed by VT 19F NMR studies involving <nUm> and [nBu4N][OTf] ) . the rates of both of these processes were studied by VT 19F NMR spectroscopy . the activation parameters for triflate exchange involving <nUm> are DH ‡ = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 and DS ‡ = <nUm> ± <nUm> cal mol-1 K-1 while the barrier to interconversion between 9a and 9b is <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 at <nUm> ° C with DH ‡ = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 and DS ‡ = <nUm> ± <nUm> cal mol-1 K-1 . diels - alder reactions of 3a with , e.g. , cyclopentadiene in nitroalkane or dichloromethane solvent are very rapid , even at low catalyst loadings and low temperatures , and rates of reaction can not be conveniently monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy . however , the enantioselectivity was shown to vary with conversion , indicating that non-Curtin-Hammett conditions apply . 
the reaction of 1,4-diazadienes RN = CHCH = NR with the titanocene and zirconocene complexes of bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene cp <nUm> M(L)(e <nUm> -Me <nUm> CSi <nUm> SiMe <nUm> ) ( m = Ti , without L ( 1 ) ; m = Zr , L = THF ( 2 ) , pyridine ( 3 ) ) is a general and new method to obtain 1-metalla-2,5-diazacyclopent-3-ene complexes cp <nUm> m(e <nUm> -1:4-RNCH = CHNR ) ( m = Zr , r = 2,6- i Pr <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> ( 4a ) , 4-Me-C <nUm> H <nUm> ( 4b ) , cy ( 4c ) ; m = Ti , r = 2,6- i Pr <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> ( 5a ) , 4-Me-C <nUm> H <nUm> ( 5b ) , cy ( 5c ) ) . In the analogous reaction with differently substituted azines RR'C = NN = CRR' the products depend strongly on the metals used , Zr and Ti , as well as on the substituents r and R' . with r = R' -Me and m = Ti , a substitution of the alkyne by the azine and a subsequent CH activation to the 1-titana-2,3-diazacyclopent-3-ene species <nUm> was observed . using r = ph and R' = H the acetylene was also substituted and , by a reductive coupling of two azine molecules , the paramagnetic binuclear Ti (III) complex ( cp <nUm> Ti ) <nUm> [ m-(e <nUm> -2:3,6:7-PhHC = NNCHPhCHPhNN = CHPh ) ( 7 ) was formed . with m = Zr and r = ph and R' = H no substitution of the acetylene was observed , but one of the C = N double bonds of the azine inserts into the Zr-C bond of the zirconacyclopropene moiety of the starting acetylene complex to yield the 1-zircona-2-azacyclopent-4-ene species <nUm> , which is additionally stabilized by n-coordination of the second imino group as a substituent in α position to the metal . using r = R' = ph , the central N-N single bond of the azine is cleaved by both of the metals and the bis(imido) complexes cp <nUm> M(-N = CPh <nUm> ) <nUm> ( m = Zr ( 9 ) , Ti ( 10 ) ) were isolated . the central C-C bond of <nUm> is cleaved in a subsequent reaction with CpCo(C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> and , after an activation of the N-N bond of the azine , the heterobimetallic complex ( cp <nUm> Ti)(m-N = CHPh ) <nUm> ( CpCo ) ( 11 ) was formed . In the reaction of benzaldehyde azine with CpCo(C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> the isoelectronic homobimetallic bis-(alkylideneamido) complex (CpCo)(m-N = CHPh ) <nUm> ( CpCo ) ( 12 ) was prepared . In reactions of <nUm> and <nUm> with CpCo(C <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> heterobimetallic complexes of this type analogous to complex <nUm> were not obtained . all new complexes have been characterized by spectroscopic methods , and additionally , 4a , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were characterized by single - crystal x-ray structure analysis . 
the doubly lithiated aminals bis(lithiomethyl(methylamino))methane [LiCH2N(Me)]2CH2 ( 1a ) and bis(lithiomethyl-isopropylamino)methane [LiCH2N(i-Pr)]2CH2 ( 1b ) react with cp - and cp*- ( cp* = C5Me5 ) substituted zirconocene chlorides in toluene to give Cp2ZrCH2N-(R)CH2N(R)CH2 ( 2a , r = me ; 2c , r = i-Pr ) and Cp*2ZrCH2N(R)CH2N(R)CH2 ( 2b , r = me ; 2d , r = i-Pr ) . an interaction of the nitrogen atoms of the metallacycles with the zirconium centers in the solid state ( 2a , 2b ) and in solution ( 2a , 2c ) is deduced from structural studies and from the 1H NMR spectra at variable temperatures ( DG ‡ = <nUm> ± <nUm> kJ mol-1 for the ring inversion process in 2c ) . isonitriles CNR ( r = t-Bu , me ) and CO insert in one of the zirconium methylene s-bonds of 2b and 2d and yield Cp*2Zr[N(R2)CCH2N(R1)CH 2N(R1)-CH2 ] ( 3a , R1 = me , R2 = t-Bu ; 3b , R1 = i-Pr , R2 = t-Bu ; 3c , R1 , R2 = me ) and the zirconium enolates Cp*2Zr(H)[OC = CHN(R)CH2N(R)CH2 ] ( 4a , r = me ; 4b , r = i-Pr ) , respectively . further insertion of isonitriles does not occur . complexes 2a and 2c are unaffected by isonitriles or CO . the molecular structures of 2a , 2b , and 3a have been studied by x-ray diffraction . the resulting structural information of the complexes 2a and 2b provides valuable insight into the nature of the Zr ← N interaction within the metallacycles , which is discussed briefly . 
bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) dimethylzirconium ( cp* <nUm> ZrMe <nUm> ) and bis(1-(-)-neomenthylindenyl) dimethylzirconium ( ( NMIn ) <nUm> ZrMe <nUm> ) upon activation by tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane are efficient catalysts for the carboalumination of a variety of 1-alkenes and nonconjugated dienes . the organoalane products can be oxidized to alcohol products , which are isolated in 50-90 % yield . ( NMIn ) <nUm> ZrMe <nUm> carboaluminates 1-alkenes and dienes with moderate ( 55-65 % ) enantioselectivities . In contrast , ethylenebis(tetrahydroindenyl) dimethylzirconium ( (EBTHI)ZrMe <nUm> ) and related zirconocenes give low activities and selectivities in the carboalumination reaction . study of the interaction of zirconocene methyl cations with trimethylaluminum by <nUm> H NMR shows that [(EBTHI)ZrMe][MeB(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] forms a stable bis(m-methyl) aluminum adduct . zirconocene methyl cations derived from cp* <nUm> ZrMe <nUm> and ( NMIn ) <nUm> ZrMe <nUm> react slowly with large excesses of trimethylaluminum to form weakly bound trimethylaluminum adducts . the difference in trimethylaluminum binding to the cationic zirconocene centers is consistent with the significantly lower activity observed when (EBTHI)ZrMe <nUm> is used as the precatalyst . 
formal [3+2] cycloaddition reactions between various aldehydes and 2-phosphino-1-zirconaindene ( 1 ) lead to stable anionic zwitterionic zirconocene complexes . extension of this method to the reaction of internal or terminated aldehyde containing dendrimers with <nUm> allows the preparation of the first dendrimers and multidendritic macromolecules containing zwitterionic [ phosphonium anionic zirconocene(IV) ] complexes . 
the ( e2-diaryl ketone)zirconocene dimers 17a and 17b ( aryl = phenyl or p-tolyl ) react with the group <nUm> metallocene dihydride complexes [RCp2MH2] ( RCp2M = Cp2Zr , (MeCp)2Zr , or Cp2Hf ) to yield the dimetallic compounds [ (m-e1-O:e2-C,O-Ar2CO)ZrCp <nUm> / H2MRCp2 ] 18a-f . these systems contain a dimetallabicyclic framework in which the two metal centers are bridged by the e2-diaryl ketone ligand oxygen atom and a m-hydride ligand . the remaining hydride ligand is trans-oriented to the m-H moiety at the MRCp2 unit . the complexes 18a-c were characterized by x-ray diffraction . treatment of the complexes <nUm> with BC18F15 results in the selective abstraction of the terminal hydride ligand to form the dimetallic cation complexes [ (m-e1-O:e2-C,O-Ar2CO)ZrCp 2(m-H)MRCp2]+ 19a-f ( with BC18F15H - anion ) . the complexes <nUm> contain the intact ( e2-diaryl ketone)ZrCp2 unit to which a (H-MRCp2)+ cation is formally attached . they exhibit a planar dimetallabicyclic framework , in which the two group <nUm> metal centers are connected by means of the e2-ketone oxygen atom and the m-hydride ligand . the complexes 19a,b and e were characterized by x-ray crystal structure analyses . the complexes <nUm> behave chemically as adducts of the highly reactive (RCp2M-H)+ cations with a metallaoxirane matrix . ethene is polymerized by the systems <nUm> with high catalyst activities . 
A series of zirconocene dihydride complexes of the general form [(RnCp)2ZrH2]x having substituted cyclopentadienyl ligands has been prepared by hydrogenation of the corresponding dimethyl complexes . the most sterically crowded members ( Cp*(e5-C5HMe4)ZrH2 , ( cp* = ( e5-C5Me5 ) ) , Cp*{e5-C5H3-1,3-(CMe 3)2}ZrH2 and { e5-C5H3-1,3-(CMe3) 2}2ZrH2 ) are monomeric ; those less crowded members ( [ Cp*{e5-C5H4(CMe 3)}ZrH2]2 , [Cp*(THI)ZrH2]2 ( THI = e5-tetrahydroindenyl ) , and [ { e5-C5H3-1,3-(CHMe2) 2}2ZrH2]2 ) are predominantly dimeric in benzene solution . Cp*{e5-C5H3-1,3-(CHMe 2)2}ZrH2 and (e5-C5HMe4)2ZrH2 exist as equilibrium mixtures of monomer and dimer in benzene solution . the hydride ligands rapidly exchange with D2 , affording the dideuteride complexes . deuterium incorporation into some of the substituents on the cyclopentadienyl rings of the monomeric dihydride complexes is also observed . the x-ray structures of Cp*2HfH2 , Cp*{e5-C5H4(CMe 3)}ZrCl2 , Cp*{e5-C5H3-1,3-(CHMe 2)2}ZrCl2 and { e5-C5H3-1,3-(CMe3) 2}2ZrCl2 are reported . 
the reaction of zirconocene dichloride with <nUm> equiv of butyllithium and 1-trimethylsilyl-propyne yields yellow 1,1-bis(cyclopentadienyl)-3,4-dimethyl-2,5-bis(trimethylsilyl)zirconacyclopenta- 2,4-diene , <nUm> . the metathesis reaction of <nUm> with Cl3P gives a mixture of 1-chloro-and 1-cyclopentadienyl-3,4-dimethyl-2,5-bis(trimethylsilyl)-1-phosphacyclopenta-2,4- diene , which was allowed to react in THF with distilled calcium . crystallization of the product from THF solution gave dimeric bis(tetrahydrofuran-O)dicalcium bis[3,4-dimethyl-2,5-bis-(trimethylsilyl)-1-phosphacyclopenta-2,4-dienide] cyclopentadienide chloride , <nUm> . the metathesis reaction of <nUm> with AsCl3 yielded nearly quantitatively 1-chloro-3,4-dimethyl-2,5-bis-(trimethylsilyl)-1-arsacyclopenta-2,4-diene , <nUm> . 3,4-Dimethyl-2,5-bis(trimethylsilyl)-1-arsacyclopentadienyl bis(tetrahydrofuran-O)calcium chloride , <nUm> , was isolated from the reduction of <nUm> with distilled calcium . 
five new indenyl zirconium metallocenes with 2-alkyl and 2-aryl substituents were synthesized and characterized . for the synthesis of the ligand the di-Grignard reagent 1,2-bis(magnesiomethyl)benzene dichloride was explored as a synthon to 2-substituted indenes . this procedure provides access to a variety of functionalized 2-indenylmetallocenes such as bis(2-ferrocenylindene)zirconium dichloride and bis(2-adamantylindenyl)zirconium dichloride . crystallographic characterization of bis[2-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)indenyl] zirconium dichloride revealed an anti conformation with a coplanar orientation of the dimethylamino substituent to the aryl ring in the solid state . the polymerization behavior of all five zirconocene dichlorides in liquid propylene was studied in the presence of MAO at various temperatures , and the results were compared to those for the known catalyst system bis-(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride / MAO ( M1 / MAO ) . the productivity of the 2-arylindene metallocenes in propylene polymerization was on the order of 100-7000 kg of PP / ( ( mol of Zr ) h ) . In contrast , the (2-adamantylindenyl)metallocenes exhibited very low productivities of <nUm> kg PP / ( ( mol of Zr ) h ) in propylene polymerization . 
the reaction of [CPh3][B(C6F4R)4] with [Cp'2-ZrH2]2 ( cp' = C5H4SiMe3 ) gives the new binuclear hydrido complexes [Cp'4Zr2H3][B(C6F 4R)4J ( r = F , SiPr3i ) , which are highly active initiators for the polymerization of isobutene and isobutene - isoprene copolymerizations at near - zero concentrations of ionizing solvents . the structure of the trinuclear hydride [ Cp'5(e1:e5-C5H 3-SiMe3)Zr3H4J+[B(C 6F4SiPri3)4]- is reported . 
A variety of stable five - coordinate organo-zirconocene-ate complexes , 2-4 , <nUm> , 12a,b , <nUm> , and <nUm> , have been prepared and structurally characterized . the reaction process is based on both ( i ) the nucleophilic attack of tertiary phosphines on acetylenic reagents and ( ii ) the ability for 16-electron d0-zirconocene(IV) complexes to coordinate two electron donor ligands . we have shown that the nature of the heteroelement directly bonded to the triple bond of the terminal acetylenic system directs the nucleophilic attack of the phosphine ; in all cases only one regioisomer is observed . surprisingly , the nucleophilic attack of the phosphine in 1a occurs on propargyl derivatives 19-21 to give the corresponding zwitterionic zirconate complexes 22-24 . the reactivity of 12a with ClH and MeI has been tested . 
the new precursors M(NMe2)2Cl2(dme) ( m = Zr ( 3 ) , Hf ( 4 ) ) react with the dilithium derivative of the silyl-bridged bis(1-indenyl) ligand bearing pendant 4-pentenyl groups Li2-[3,3'-5R2-SBI] ( 2 ) in toluene at <nUm> ° C to provide the corresponding bis(dimethylamido) metallocenes with rac / meso ratios of 6-7 : <nUm> . subsequent treatment of the substantially racenriched zirconocene mixture with excess TMS-Cl in dichloromethane in the presence of a catalytic amount of anhydrous ClH provides rac-[3,3'-5R2-SBI]ZrCl2 ( 7 ) in <nUm> % isolated yield free from its meso isomer . similar reactions of Li2[SBI]*OEt2 and of Li2[EBI]*OEt2 with <nUm> and <nUm> also lead to selective formation of the rac - metallocenes with rac / meso ratios as high as <nUm> : <nUm> for [SBI]Zr(NMe2)2 ( 10 ) . sodium amalgam reduction of rac-[3,3'-5R2-SBI]ZrCl2 ( 7 ) in THF results in the intramolecular tail - to - tail coupling of the pendant olefins to provide the crystallographically characterized a,a'-disubstituted zirconacyclopentane <nUm> in <nUm> % isolated yield . In contrast , reduction of rac-[3,3'-5R2-SBI]HfCl2 ( 8 ) ( prepared from <nUm> and Cl4Hf in toluene ) leads to both the symmetric a,a'-disubstituted and the unsymmetric a,b'-substituted hafnacyclopentanes ( <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ) in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio . zirconacycle <nUm> reacts with [HNMe2Ph]+[OTf]- to give the monotriflate <nUm> , in which one of the 4-pentenyl arms is released and the other is formally protonated at its terminal carbon atom to give this thermally stable secondary alkyl complex . formation of <nUm> is best understood as proceeding through a mono-olefin intermediate <nUm> , which can be trapped with 2-butyne to form the corresponding zirconacyclopentene <nUm> . reaction of <nUm> with the organometallic lewis acid BC18F15 results in the formal abstraction of a hydride from the 3-position of one arm to form [HB(C6F5)3]- and a THF - bound p-allyl cation <nUm> , in which one pendant alkene is also free .

In the presence of excess PhCH2SiH3 <nUm> reacts rapidly to give products . 
effective cocatalysts need not contain metalloid / metal-carbon bonds and the properties of the resulting metallocenium cation - anion pairs are sensitive to both the counteranion core structure and the metallocene ancillary litigation . the perfluoroaryloxide salts of the formula Ph3C+Al(OC6F5)4- and Ph3C+M(OC6F5)6- ( m = Nb , Ta ) were synthesized and characterized . In combination with sterically encumbered zirconocene dimethyl complexes , they yield active ethylene polymerization catalysts .

conductive films were grown on silicon , germanium , and OSi <nUm> / Si structures by chemical vapor deposition using bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium dichloride ( titanocene dichloride ) and bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride ( zirconocene dichloride ) . the composition and properties of the films were then modified by annealing in an atmosphere of organosilicon compounds . films were also produced by deposition from mixtures of titanocene or zirconocene dichloride and organosilicon compounds . the elemental and phase compositions of the films were determined by auger electron spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction analysis . 
the investigation of the intermolecular composition distribution of an ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers using DSC method has been carried out . the known methods : step crystallization ( SC ) and successive self - nucleation / annealing ( SSA ) have been adapted for this purpose , and particularly , the optimal condition of the process have been chosen to enable the best fractional crystallization of the copolymer . the method has been applied for fractionation of two ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers synthesized with supported vanadium and zirconocene catalysts and having similar concentrations of 1-hexene . although metallocene catalysts are known from their more homogeneous structure of active sites in comparison to multi-site ziegler - natta catalysts , the copolymers obtained over both catalytic systems gave DSC curves resolved into several peaks but with different melting points . using the thomson - gibbs equation , comparable average lamellar thickness of the separated peaks has been calculated . the amounts of copolymer fraction with defined lamellar thickness have been determined . it was obtained that the copolymer produced from the metallocene system contains a thinner and more homogeneous lamella thickness than that obtained with ziegler - natta vanadium catalyst supported on the same carrier . 
the heterometallic zirconocene(III) aluminum hydride complex (Cp2ZrH)2HAlCl2 · C2H4O · CH was synthesized by reduction of Cp2ZrCl2 with lithium aluminum hydride in the presence of Cp2TiBH4 and 1,4-dioxane , and its structure was established by x-ray diffraction analysis . 
the use of two different types of metallocene catalysts in the dehydrogenative coupling of phenylsilane to produce poly(phenylsilane) was investigated . the metallocene catalysts were first synthesized ( i ) through the reaction of zirconcene dichloride with n-butyllithium in toluene and ( ii ) through the reaction of zirconocene dichloride with sec-butyllithium in toluene . after the catalyst synthesis , phenylsilane was added in situ commencing polymerization of the phenylsilane to poly ( phenylsilane ) through dehydrogenative coupling in each case . the resulting poly(phenylsilanes) were characterized by 1H NMR , GPC , FTIR , and UV / vis , and were shown to be successful photoinitiators for a variety of acrylate and methacrylate type monomers . 
activities of ethylene / a-olefin copolymerization were found to increase with silane - modified silica - supported MAO using ansazirconocene catalyst . the increase in activities was less pronounced when higher a-olefins were used . however , silane modification resulted in the narrower molecular weight distribution of polymers . 13C NMR revealed that ethylene incorporation in all systems gave polymers with the similar triad distribution .

density functional theory with hybrid exchange - correlation functional B3P86 is used to calculate the molecular structures of neutral Fe (II) complexes formed in the LFeCl <nUm> / AlMe <nUm> system ( L = tridentate bis(imine)pyridyl ligand ) . A simplified model of the LFeCl <nUm> complex is used in calculations , where L is replaced by three NH <nUm> ligands . parameters of geometric and electronic structures of the complexes ( NH <nUm> ) 3FeMe(m-Me)AlMe <nUm> ( I ) and ( NH <nUm> ) 3FeMe(m-Me) 2AlMe <nUm> ( IIA and IIB ) , which are the structures where the Fe-Me and Fe-m-Me groups are in one or two perpendicular planes , respectively , were determined . complexes II , which were earlier identified using 1H NMR spectroscopy , are more stable than complex I . complex IIB is strongly polarized ( the distances r(Fe-m-Me) and r(Al-m-Me) are <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ) and coordinatively unsaturated due to the transfer of the methyl group from ( NH <nUm> ) 3FeMe <nUm> onto AlMe <nUm> . it has significant electron density deficit in the coordination sphere of the transition metal [ ( NH <nUm> ) 3FeMe ] q ( q = +0.80e ) . the energetic profile of the reaction of ethylene addition to the Fe-Me bond for the complexes ( NH <nUm> ) 3FeMe <nUm> , IIA and IIB , was calculated . it was shown that , compared to ( NH <nUm> ) 3FeMe <nUm> , a drastic decrease in the activation energy of ethylene addition is observed in the case of IIB ( from <nUm> to <nUm> kJ / mol ) . the reason for the more efficient activation of the complexes LFeMe <nUm> by a weak lewis acid ( AlMe <nUm> ) and for the increased reactivity of the metal - alkyl bond in complex IIB compared to the zirconocene complex cp 2ZrMe <nUm> is discussed . 
the surface compounds of zirconium in OSi <nUm> / MAO / cp 2ZrMe <nUm> ( I ) and OSi <nUm> / cp 2ZrMe <nUm> ( II ) catalysts were studied by the IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO at 93-293 K . it was found that the bridging and terminal complexes of CO were formed on the surface of the catalysts at <nUm> K ; the adsorption of CO was reversible . At <nUm> K , CO was irreversibly inserted into the Zr-Me bond with the formation of various acyl compounds of zirconium ; these compounds were characterized by absorption bands in the region 1495-1750 cm <nUm> in the IR spectrum . these data suggested the heterogeneity of the surface composition of zirconocene catalysts I and II . catalyst I , which was active in ethylene polymerization , contained surface zirconium complexes that can be considered as the precursors of active centers for ethylene polymerization . 
since the nineteenth century , many synthetic organic chemists have focused on developing new strategies to regio- , diastereo - and enantioselectively build carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds in a predictable and efficient manner . ideal syntheses should use the least number of synthetic steps , with few or no functional group transformations and by - products , and maximum atom efficiency . one potentially attractive method for the synthesis of molecular skeletons that are difficult to prepare would be through the selective activation of C-H and C-C bonds , instead of the conventional construction of new C-C bonds . here we present an approach that exploits the multifold reactivity of easily accessible substrates with a single organometallic species to furnish complex molecular scaffolds through the merging of otherwise difficult transformations : allylic C-H and selective C-C bond activations . the resulting bifunctional nucleophilic species , all of which have an all-carbon quaternary stereogenic centre , can then be selectively derivatized by the addition of two different electrophiles to obtain more complex molecular architecture from these easily available starting materials . 

the systematic syntheses of 1- and 2-substituted silylindenes , with a wide variety of substitution patterns on the silyl moiety , and their corresponding zirconocene dichlorides are presented . the rac- and meso-diastereomers of the 1-substituted zirconocene dichlorides can in most cases be separated . instable zirconocenes were observed for certain substitution patterns . two of the obtained zirconocene dichlorides , bis[2-(dimethylsilyl)indenyl]zirconium dichloride ( 4a ) and bis[2-(trimethylsilyl)indenyl]zirconium dichloride ( 4b ) , were characterised by single crystal x-ray diffraction . on the basis of DFT results , the two compounds are geometrically similar , i.e. the additional methyl group on the silyl moiety only affects the conformational energy profile . differences in their catalyst performance in the homopolymerisation studies with ethane are thus attributed to conformational control . for the remaining complexes , sterically less demanding silyl groups seem to be favoured with respect to the catalyst performance . all the 2-isomers have lower polymerisation activities than the unsubstituted bis[indenyl]zirconium dichloride / MAO system . curiously , the rac-bis[1-(dimethylphenylsilyl)indenyl]zirconium dichloride / MAO system is found to be the most active catalyst in ethene homopolymerisations .

dimethylzirconocene complexes [ ZrMe2(C5H 4R)2 ] ( r = H or CH3 ) were treated with catechol to give the (catecholato)zirconocene complexes . low - temperature NMR spectra indicated dimeric metallatricyclic structures for these complexes and the corresponding (ethene-1,2-diolato)- and (but-2-ene-2,3-diolato)-zirconocenes . dynamic temperature - dependent NMR spectroscopy revealed that all these complexes underwent a thermally induced degenerate rearrangement process , similar to the reorganization reaction of some sharpless catalyst precursors , with gibbs activation energies close to <nUm> kJ mol-1 . A labelling experiment showed the intramolecular nature of this automerization . ( 4-tert- butylcatecholato)zirconocene formed two diastereoisomeric dimers which did not interconvert on the NMR time - scale ( DG ‡ inter > <nUm> kJ mol-1 ) although the intramolecular rearrangement was observed [ DG ‡ intra(241 K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kJ mol-1 ] . the intermolecular equilibration process probably proceeding via monomeric (catecholato)zirconocene was monitored in the case of the bulky (4-tert-butyl-catecholato)bis(tert-butylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium system by dynamic NMR spectroscopy at high temperature [ DG ‡ inter(364 K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kJ mol-1 ] . 
the complexes [Zr(cp)2(PR2)X] ( cp = e-C 5H5 ; r = SiMe3 ; x = Cl , <nUm> ; PR2 , <nUm> ; or me , <nUm> ) and [ Zr(e-C5H4R)2(PR 2)Y ] ( Y = Cl , <nUm> ; or PR2 , <nUm> ) were obtained from [{Li(m-PR2)(thf)2}2] <nUm> ( thf = tetrahydrofuran ) and [Zr(cp)2Cl2] or [ Zr(e-C 5H4R)2Cl2 ] , respectively . each of <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> was treated with a variety of reagents causing scission of the Zr-P bond . two types of reactions were observed : ( i ) substitution or ( ii ) insertion . examples of ( i ) are the reaction of ( a ) complex <nUm> with mel to afford [Zr(cp)2I(PR2)] <nUm> , ( b ) <nUm> with LiOR' ( R' = C6H2But2-2,6-Me-4 ) , SiMe 3(N3) , mel or EtOH yielding [Zr(cp)2Cl(Z)] ( z = OR' , <nUm> ; N3 , <nUm> ; or I , <nUm> ) or [ {Zr(cp)2Cl} 2(m-O) ] <nUm> , respectively and ( c ) <nUm> with ( AlMe3 ) <nUm> to furnish [AlMe2(m-PR2)]2 <nUm> . the x-ray structure of <nUm> shows a planar nearly square Al2P <nUm> ring [ Al-P <nUm> and <nUm> Å , P-Al-P'89.4(1) , Al-P-Al' <nUm> ° ] , a configuration which is retained in hydrocarbon solution ( 1H and 29Si NMR spectroscopy ) . type ( ii ) reactions were those between ( a ) <nUm> and a diazoalkane N 2CR'R'' yielding [ Zr(cp)2Cl{e2- N(CR'R'')N(PR2) } ] ( R' = R'' = ph , <nUm> ; or R' = H , R'' = CO2Et , <nUm> ) , ( b ) <nUm> or <nUm> with CS2 , affording [Zr(cp)2{S2C(PR2)}X] ( x = Cl , <nUm> ; or me , <nUm> ) , and ( c ) <nUm> with white phosphorus to give [ Zr(cp)2{P(PR 2)PP(PR2)P } ] <nUm> . each of the complexes <nUm> and <nUm> reacted with sulphur to furnish [{Zr(cp)2(m-S)}2] , which was also obtained by thermolysis of <nUm> . the thermolysis of <nUm> , <nUm> or <nUm> led to elimination of SiMe3X ( x = Cl or me ) . 
zirconocene derivatives with interannular MeN(CH2 CH2)2 , C5H3N(CH2)2-2,6 or C6H4(CH2)2-1,3 bridges were synthesised by the reaction of the corresponding disodium salts with Cl4Zr . the crystal structure of dichloro[m-phenylenedimethylenebis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)]zirconium was determined by x-ray crystallography . the compound crystallizes in space group P212121 with cell parameters : a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> and R' = <nUm> . 
dipotassium benzene-1,2-diselenolate , C6H4(SeK)2-1,2 obtained from the reaction of potassium tert-butoxide with a (benzene-1,2-diselenolato)zirconocene , was treated with C6H4[SeCH2(CH2OCH2) nCH2X]2-1,2 ( x = Cl , n = <nUm> <nUm> , n = <nUm> <nUm> , n = <nUm> <nUm> or x = Br n = <nUm> <nUm> ) leading to tetraselenacrown ethers C6H4[SeCH2(CH2OCH2) nCH2Se]2-C6H4 ( n = <nUm> <nUm> , n = <nUm> <nUm> or n = <nUm> <nUm> ) in a moderate yield ( 10-20 % ) . this yield can be increased by using the ' caesium effect ' from benzene-1,2-diselenol ( 18-40 % ) . these macrocyclic compounds are able to complex heavy metals [ especially mercury (II) ions ] via their selenium atoms . the mercury complexes have been characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy . the molecular structures of the tetraselenacrown ether <nUm> and the mercury complex of macrocycle <nUm> have been established by x-ray diffraction .

allenyl carbenoids ( 3-chloro-1-lithioalk-1-ynes ) insert into zirconacyclopentanes and zirconacyclopentenes to afford cyclic e3-allenyl / prop-2-ynyl zirconocene complexes which give allenyl , alkynyl or cyclised - alcohol products on addition of aldehydes activated with boron trifluoride-diethyl ether . 
the phosphine stabilized ethylene complex of zirconocene , Cp2Zr , reacts with <nUm> equiv. of BC18F15 to form the girdle - type zwitterion Cp2Zr+(PPh3Me)CH2CH 2B-(C6F5)3 <nUm> , which serves as an ethene polymerization catalyst either with or without added BC18F15 .

low temperature NMR studies indicate that the dicationic salts [Zr(e-C5H4CMe2C6H4Me-p)2]2+[MeB(C6F5)3]-2 and [Zr(e-C5H4CMe2Ph)2]2+ [MeB(C6F5)3]2- are formed when the neutral compounds [Zr(e-C5H4CMe2Ph)2Me2] and [Zr(e-C5H4CMe2C6H4Me-p)2Me2] and [Zr(e-C5H4CMe2Ph)2Me2] are treated with <nUm> equivalents of BC18F15 . 
six zirconocene enolate radical cations and one hydroquinone biszirconocene radical cation have been generated and characterised in solution by standard and fast scan cyclic voltammetry . the electroanalytical results along with those from product analysis of preparative one - electron oxidations indicate that the sterically congested radical cations undergo a mesolytic Zr-O bond cleavage process . the kinetics of the mesolytic Zr-O bond cleavage yielding zirconocene cations and the lifetime ( t1 / <nUm> ) of the zirconium enolate radical cations in dichloromethane at room temperature are determined . 
the dimerization and ion - pair formation enthalpies of advanced silicon bridged bisindenyl zirconocenes have been estimated at the density functional ( DFT ) level of theory . according to our calculations ( based on molecular mechanics geometry optimization with subsequent DFT geometry relaxation ) , a properly designed bisindenyl ligand sphere helps to avoid catalyst dimerization and reduces coordination of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) anions to cationic sites . interestingly , we also found a correlation between the dipole moment of the active species considered here and their catalytic performance . these results suggest that an appropriate substituent pattern favours complexation of propylene monomers as the dominant mechanism to stabilize electron deficient active sites due to a diminution of particular intermolecular forces which yield catalytically inactive resting states . 
diffusion coefficients for ion pairs containing zirconocene cations and fluorinated tetraphenyl- or methyltriphenylborate anions in benzene solutions are substantially smaller than those expected for monomeric species and indicate that ion quadruples are present in these solutions . 
the new compounds [ Zr{Me2C(e-C5H4) 2}(cis-e-C4H6) ] ( 2* ) , [ Zr{Me2C(e-C5H4)2}Ph <nUm> ] ( 3 ) , [ Zr{Me2C(C5H4)2}-(cis-e 4C4H4Me2 ) ] ( 4* ) , [ Zr{Me2C(e-C5H4) 2}(cis-e4-PhC4H4Ph) ] ( 5 ) , [ Zr{Me2C(e-C5H4)2Cl} 2-m-O ] ( 6* ) , [ Zr{Me2-C(e-C5H4)2}{e 3-C4H6B(C6F5) <nUm> } ] ( 7 ) , [ Zr{Me2C(e-C5H4) 2}{exo-e3-C4H6B(C 6F5)3}PMe3 ] ( 8* ) , [ Zr{Me2C(e-C5H4) 2}-{endo-e3-C4H6B(C 6F5)3}C6H5N ] ( 9* ) , and [ Zr{Me2C(e-C5H4)2}{Endo- and exo-e3-C4H6B(C6F 5)3}NC'Bu ] ( 10a ) and ( 10b ) have been prepared . an asterisk indicates the crystal structure has been determined . the photoelectron spectra of <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined and assigned with the assistance of density functional methods . the factors relating to the relative stability of cis- and frans-butadiene structures for <nUm> and <nUm> are discussed . 
Di-Iithiation of +ac(R)-1-methyl-9-[2-(2-indenyl)-1-naphthyl]fluorene , +ac(R)-6 , generates an axially chiral fluorenyl ligand , (a-S)-lO , which on reaction with Cl4Zr enantiospecifically provides the planar chiral ansazirconocene (p-S)-[1-(1-methyl-9-fluorenyl)-2-(2-indenyl)-naphthalene]zirconium dichloride , (p-5)-8 ; single crystal x-ray structures have been determined for the racemic awsa - zirconocene rac-8 and the related C8 - symmetric ansazirconocene <nUm> . 
the applications of stoichiometric transition metal complexes in organic synthesis were discussed . the organometallic mediated reactions which have relevance to organic synthesis were analyzed . it was shown that reactions of alkynes with diethyl zirconocene followed by a chloroformate produces a,b-unsaturated esters . it was also shown that with the chromium complexed on one face of the ring system , selective reduction of the indolene double bond can be achieved . 
the ligand to metal charge transfer ( LMCT ) transitions of racemic siloxy substituted ethylene bridged bis(indenyl) - type zirconocenes were studied using UV / VIS spectroscopy in combination with ab initio hartree - fock and hybrid density functional B3LYP methods . clear correlations between the experimental LMCT absorption energies and theoretical HOMO-LUMO energy gaps were observed . the LMCT absorption energies were analysed as a function of the ligand structure . hydrogenation of the indenyl ring and position of the siloxy substituent have strong influences on HOMO-LUMO energy gaps , and consequently on the observed absorption energies . 
imines which do not react with grignard reagents reacted with EtMgBr in the presence of a catalytic amount of Cp2ZrCl2 to give ethylated products in excellent yields ; the stoichiometric reaction of the imines and the zirconocene-ethylene complex did not give the ethylated product , whereas addition of MeMgBr or BuMgCl to the mixture afforded the ethylated product after hydrolysis . 
density functional computations ( BP86 / ECP1 and B3LYP / II level ) have revealed that the phenyl group in [ Zr(e-C5H5)(e-C5H4 CR2C6H5)Me]+ ( r = H ) is coordinated to the Zr atom via one of the phenyl carbon atoms , rather than via an agostic Zr-H contact , as suggested previously . A stationary point with such an agostic interaction is the transition structure for phenyl rotation with a barrier higher than <nUm> kJ mol-1 ( B3LYP / II level ) , consistent with results from dynamic NMR spectroscopy for a closely related compound ( r = me ) . the structural assignments are supported by the good accord between the computed ( GIAO-B3LYP / II level ) and experimental NMR chemical shifts . A second dynamic process with a very similar activation barrier is indicated to involve dissociation of the coordinated phenyl moiety from the Zr atom and inversion at the latter . the same structural motif ( i.e. e1-bonded aryl group ) is also found for the [ Zr(e-C5H4CH2C6H5 )2]2+ dication . 
the bis(phosphinoenolato) zirconocene <nUm> , prepared from the phosphino camphor derivative 3-exo-PPh2C10H15O <nUm> , represents the first C2 - symmetric chiral diphosphine containing an early transition metal centre tethered to the phosphino groups via an enolato linkage . it allows the selective assembly of lewis - acid early - late bimetallic combinations , as exemplified with the Zr / Cu and Zr / Ag complexes <nUm> and <nUm> . the monophosphinoenolato titanocene <nUm> was also prepared . reactions of <nUm> or <nUm> with [Pd(dmba)(m-Cl)]2 ( dmba = o-C6H4CH 2NMe2 ) or [PdCl2(SEt2)2] led to complete transfer of the functional ligand to the Pd (II) centre , with formation of [(dmba)Pd(PPh2C10H14O)] <nUm> or cis-[Pd(PPh2C10H14O)2] <nUm> and [Cp2ZrCl2] / [Cp2TiCl2] , respectively . A heterobimetallic Zr / Pd intermediate complex <nUm> of this rearrangement could be detected . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were prepared independently by reaction of <nUm> with [Pd(dmba)(m-Cl)]2 or [ Pd(SEt2)2Cl <nUm> ] , respectively , which first afforded complexes <nUm> and <nUm> which were then treated with KH . the crystal structures of <nUm> , <nUm> and 8*THF* H2O have been determined by x-ray diffraction . 
the reaction of but 3Al with ArBH2O2 ( Ar = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl ) leads , via the intermediate [ but 2Al(O)BAr(OH)]2 <nUm> , to the crystallographically characterised boralumoxane Al(But 2Al)(ButAl)2 ArBO2 <nUm> which is able to activate Cp2ZrMe2 to effect catalytic ethene polymerisation .

addition of diazoalkane derivatives RCH(N2) [ r = CO2Et ( a ) , SiMe3 ( b ) ] on a-phosphino zirconocene complexes <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> affords stable N - metal phosphazine compounds 3a,b , 5a,b and 7a,b , respectively . the single crystal x-ray structure of 3a is reported and shows an s-transoid ( e ) geometry for the phosphazine substructure P1-N1-N2-C9 with a zirconium - to - nitrogen distance in the range of that of Cp2Zr-N s-bonds in zirconate complexes , which reveals a zwitterionic canonical form for 3a . 
silsesquioxane tethered fluorene ligands [R7Si8O12X]-9-Flu(H) ( r = c-C6H11 , x = -(1) r = c-C5H9 , x = CH2 ( 2 ) , CH2 ( 3 ) , C7H6 ( 4 ) ) , (c-C5H9)7Si8O12CH2-9-Flu(9-EMe3) ( e = Si ( 5a ) , Sn ( 5b ) ) and zirconium dichlorides Cp'[(c-C5H9)7Si8O12CH2-9-Flu]ZrCl2 ( 6b , cp' = 1,3-C5H3(SiMe3)2 ) , Cp*[(c-C5H9)7Si8O12-X-9-Flu]ZrCl2 ( x = CH2 ( 6a ) , CH2 ( 7 ) , C7H6 ( 8 ) ) and [(c-C5H9)7Si8O12CH2-9-Flu]2ZrCl2 ( 9 ) have been applied as models for silica - tethered ancillary ligands and silica tethered - zirconocenes . immobilization of zirconocenes containing a pendant anchorable functionality , Cp'[Me2(EtO)SiCH2Flu]ZrCl2 ( 10 ) and Cp[C5Me4SiMe2OEt]ZrCl2 ( 11 ) was considerably hampered by competitive Zr – Cl and Si – OEt bond splitting . when activated with MAO ( methylalumoxane ) , <nUm> – <nUm> yield active ethylene polymerization systems . 
the novel dimer [ Cp(2)Zr[upper bond start]([minus sign in circle])S([plus sign in circle])CH(Ph)CH[double bond]C[upper bond end]PPh(2)](2) , the first example of a structurally characterised sulfur - bridged binuclear zirconathiolane complex , was prepared , characterised by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography , and some aspects of its solution behaviour were studied . 
whereas the rates of propene polymerisation catalysed by zirconocene ion pairs are strongly anion - dependent , hexene polymerisations are not ; the findings demonstrate the existence of very different kinetic regimes for two closely related reactions . 
the hydrozirconation of alkynes with zirconocene hydro-chloride and the dimethylzinc - mediated addition of alkenylzirconocenes to diphenylphosphinoyl imines can be greatly accelerated with microwave irradiation , resulting in a convenient and rapid one - pot process for the preparation of synthetically useful allylic amines . 
the diphenyl-ansa-zirconocene complex <nUm> adds BC12F10H at the C[?]C double bond of its pendent cp - allyl functional group to yield <nUm> . during <nUm> days at room temperature the – BC12F10 group takes part in an electrophilic substitution reaction at the adjacent cp - ring to form <nUm> with formation of one equivalent of benzene . complex <nUm> was characterized by x-ray diffraction . 
the systematic syntheses of 1- and 2-substituted silylindenes , with a wide variety of substitution patterns on the silyl moiety , and their corresponding zirconocene dichlorides are presented . the rac- and meso-diastereomers of the 1-substituted zirconocene dichlorides can in most cases be separated . instable zirconocenes were observed for certain substitution patterns . two of the obtained zirconocene dichlorides , bis[2-(dimethylsilyl)indenyl]zirconium dichloride ( 4a ) and bis[2-(trimethylsilyl)indenyl]zirconium dichloride ( 4b ) , were characterised by single crystal x-ray diffraction . on the basis of DFT results , the two compounds are geometrically similar , i.e. the additional methyl group on the silyl moiety only affects the conformational energy profile . differences in their catalyst performance in the homopolymerisation studies with ethane are thus attributed to conformational control . for the remaining complexes , sterically less demanding silyl groups seem to be favoured with respect to the catalyst performance . all the 2-isomers have lower polymerisation activities than the unsubstituted bis[indenyl]zirconium dichloride / MAO system . curiously , the rac-bis[1-(dimethylphenylsilyl)indenyl]zirconium dichloride / MAO system is found to be the most active catalyst in ethene homopolymerisations . 
insertion of (E)-(1,2-dihalovinyl)lithium into zirconacyclopentenes was followed by elimination of halide to afford an alkyne which inserts intramolecularly into the resulting carbon – zirconocenium bond to give a methylenecyclopentene , whereas insertion of (2-haloethynyl)lithium gives the same product via a zirconocene alkenylidene . 
titanocene and zirconocene carbene complexes of a phosphorus equivalent of an arduengo 's carbene have been synthesized in the coordination sphere of titanocene and zirconocene and exhibit a nucleophilic character which has been exploited in the synthesis of 1,3-diphosphafulvenes . 
the compound [HNMe2Ph][NpB(C6F5) 3](Np = C5H11 ) reacts with dimethylzirconocenes to give active propylene polymerization catalysts which are significantly more active and give higher molecular weight polypropylene than do the catalysts obtained using BC18F15 ; the [ BC18F15Np ) anion is for steric reasons more weakly coordinating than is [MeB(C6F5)3] . 
the vinylidene phosphine (Prn2P)2C = CH <nUm> ( 1 ) undergoes schlenk dimerisation on treatment with an excess of any of the alkali metals Li , Na or K to give the butane-1,4-diide complexes [(L)M{(Prn2P)2CCH2}]2 [ (L)M = (THF)2Li ( 6 ) , (THF)3Na ( 7b ) , (DME)2K ( 8b ) ] , after recrystallisation . whereas the reaction between the analogous phenyl derivative (Ph2P)2C = CH2 and K results in cleavage of a P-C bond , <nUm> reacts smoothly with K to give <nUm> , with no evidence for P-C cleavage . compound <nUm> is an excellent ligand transfer reagent : metathesis reactions between either <nUm> or its phenyl analogue [ (THF)2Li{(Ph 2P)2CCH2}]2 ( 2 ) and two equivalents of Cp2ZrCl2 in THF give the corresponding dinuclear zirconocene derivatives [ Cp2Zr(Cl){(R2P) 2CCH2}]2 in good yields [ r = ph ( 11 ) , Pr n ( 12 ) ] . compounds <nUm> , 7b , 8b , <nUm> and <nUm> have been characterised by multi-element NMR spectroscopy and , where possible , by elemental analysis ; compounds <nUm> , 7b , <nUm> and <nUm> have additionally been characterised by x-ray crystallography .

this tutorial review surveys recent advances in the field of zirconium promoted coupling reactions of unsaturated molecules ( and / or organolithium compounds ) and heterosubstituted alkenes . this reaction has recently emerged as a powerful tool in organic chemistry to access a variety of synthetically useful building blocks not easily available by other methods . In particular , three different reaction pathways are discussed : i ) the reaction involving alkyne - zirconocene and aryne - zirconocene complexes which allows access to dienyl and aryl zirconocene complexes ; ii ) the reaction of alkene - zirconocene complexes and enol ethers which has shown to be highly dependent on the structure of the enol ether used , allowing the synthesis of simple vinyl zirconocenes or multicomponent coupling products , and ; iii ) the reaction involving imine - zirconocene complexes which supposes a new entry to allylic amines . 
the zirconocene enolate complex bis(2-propenolato)ZrCp <nUm> ( 1 ) reacts with two molar equivalents of the 1,2,3,4-O-tetramethyl-a-d- glucopyranoside ( 2 ) with liberation of two equivalents of acetone to yield cleanly the bis(carbohydrate)zirconcene complex ( 3 ) . alternatively <nUm> and the " bifunctional " glucose derivative 3-O-benzyl-1,2-O-isopropylidene- glucofuranoside ( 4 ) react to the corresponding zirconadioxacyclopentane - type metallacyclic product that was isolated as the respective dimer ( 5 ) featuring a sequence of linearly anellated five- , four- , five - membered metallacycles . both carbohydrate zirconocene complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by NMR experiments as well as by x-ray diffraction . 
In these days a renaissance of metallacycles as an increasingly important class of organometallic compounds for synthetic and catalytic applications is evident , making such very attractive for a plethora of investigations . titanocene and zirconocene bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complexes , regarded as three - membered metallacycles ( 1-metallacyclopropenes ) , present a rich chemistry towards unsaturated molecules . by elimination of the alkyne these complexes form by reaction with unsaturated compounds five - membered titana- and zirconacycles , all of which are relevant to stoichiometric and catalytic C-C coupling and cleavage reactions of unsaturated molecules . 
the complete sequence of steps of a tentative catalytic cycle for intramolecular hydroamination / cyclisation ( IHC ) of 4,5-hexadien-1-ylamine ( 1 ) by a prototypical cationic [Cp2ZrCH3]+ zirconocene precatalyst ( 2 ) has been examined by employing a gradient - corrected DFT method . the predicted smooth overall reaction energy profile is consistent with the available experimental data , thereby providing further confidence in the proposed mechanism . following activation of the precatalyst by protonolytic cleavage of the Zr-Me bond , the catalytically active amidoallene-Zr complex undergoes addition of an allenic CC linkage across the Zr-N s-bond . the alternative exo- and endocyclic pathways show similar probabilities for the sterically less encumbered reactants { <nUm> + <nUm> } investigated herein . however , steric factors are expected to exert control on the regioselectivity of ring closure . on the other hand , the metathesis - type transition states for subsequent protonolysis are indicated to be less sensitive to steric demands . formation of the six - membered azacycle-Zr intermediate through intramolecular CC insertion into the Zr-N s-bond is predicted to be turnover limiting . the factors that govern the regioselectivity of the aminoallene IHC have been elucidated . 
bis(cyclopropylethynyl)zirconocene shows a bisected conformation in the crystal : the magnitude of the stabilizing conjugation of the Cp2Zr lewis acid centre with the cyclopropyl substituent across the connecting C ≡ C triple bond is assessed by DFT calculations and a comparison with a series of cationic organic and organometallic reference systems . 
the rich chemistry of substituted bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium and hafnium complexes bearing side-on coordinated dinitrogen ligands is highlighted in this perspective . our studies in this area were initially motivated by the desire to understand side-on vs. end-on dinitrogen coordination in bimetallic zirconocene and hafnocene N < inf > <nUm> < / inf > compounds . In the cases where η < sup > <nUm> < / sup > ,e < sup > <nUm> < / sup > -dinitrogen compounds were isolated , both structural and computational data have established significant imido character in the metal-nitrogen bonds . this additional bonding interaction , which is diminished in end-on complexes bearing both terminal and bridging N < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ligands , facilitates dinitrogen functionalization by non-polar reagents including dihydrogen , carbon-hydrogen bonds and weak bronsted acids such as water and ethanol . In hafnocene chemistry , where unwanted side-on , end-on isomerization is suppressed , cycloaddition of phenylisocyanate to coordinated N < inf > <nUm> < / inf > has also been accomplished . for N-H bond forming reactions involving H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > , kinetic measurements , in addition to isotopic labelling and computational studies , are consistent with dinitrogen functionalization by 1,2-addition involving a highly ordered , four - centred transition structure . 
A tethered ethylenebis(indenyl) zirconocene was covalently immobilized on H - terminated Si(111) surfaces using UV - mediated alkene hydrosilylation , thus making possible the development of structured catalytic surfaces with highly controlled properties . 
A new family of hydroxytris(pentafluorophenyl)borate anions [ B(C 6F5)3OH]- associated with organic and aprotic cations c+ ( imidazolium , pyrrolidinium and phosphonium ) has been prepared by a general one - pot synthesis that implies the chloride borate analogues [B(C6F5)3Cl] -[c]+ . the [c]+[B(C6F 5)3OH]- salts have been isolated and fully characterized . the borate anion [ BC6F5 3OH]- has been shown to protonate the Zr-Me bond in the Cp2ZrMe2 complex forming CH4 and the first published example of anionic [ Cp2Zr(Me)OB(C6F 5)3]- species . standard spectroscopic methods demonstrate the covalent character of the Zr metal center and the anionic character of the boron atom . this protonolysis methodology using [ B(C 6F5)3OH]- anion affords a new route for the incorporation of a covalently bonded anionic functionality on organometallic complexes . this provides a new way to immobilize transition metal complexes in ionic liquids . 
A high yield of the tetraphosphaladderene , anti-tetraphosphatricyclo[4.2.0.02,5]octa-3,7-diene , is obtained from reaction of the zirconocene 1,3-diphosphabicyclo[1.1.0]butane with Ph2SbCl3 in THF or CCl2H2 . exploration of the reaction pathway using density functional theory suggests that an envelope - type adduct of Ph2SbCl and 1,3-diphosphabicyclo[1.1.0]butane plays a pivotal role in the reaction . the zwitterionic character of this intermediate species allows it to act simultaneously as both an ene and an eneophile , and a symmetry - allowed bimolecular reaction leads to the tetraphosphaladderene species via a spirocyclic intermediate . 
new neutral and ionic functionalised zirconocene dichloride compounds have been isolated and characterised . the ionic zirconocene exhibits excellent cytotoxicity against a range of human tumour cell lines , which represents the first active anticancer zirconocene dichloride compound . 
1,4-Bis[trimethylsilyl(ethynyl)]naphthalene ( 1a ) and 1,4- bis[trimethylsilyl(ethynyl)]anthracene ( 1b ) undergo diastereoselective coupling with Cp2Zr(py)(Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) to give trimeric macrocycles in good yield .

we report the polymerisation of isobutene with the intramolecular aryl stabilised zirconocene cations [ e5-Cp-(e5-C 5H4-CMe2C6H4Me)ZrMe ] + ( 3 ) , [ ( e5-C5H4-CMe 2C6H4Me)2ZrMe]+ ( 4 ) and dication [ ( e5-C5H4-CMe2C 6H4Me)2Zr]2+ ( 5 ) ( cp = C 5H5 ) which were generated in situ by the reaction of the corresponding dimethyl compound with the cation generating agent ( CGA ) B(C 6F5)3 . whereas the cationic compounds gave polyisobutene in moderate yields , the dicationic compound gave polyisobutene in excellent yields and high molecular weight . computational studies of the cationic and dicationic compounds were undertaken to ascertain the nature of the cationic initiator . judging from natural charges and bond critical points , the coordinated monomer is more strongly polarised in the case of the dication <nUm> , compared with the monocation <nUm> . furthermore , in the case of the cationic compound <nUm> , decomposition into the allylic compound was computed . we found that the activation barrier of this process is <nUm> kJ mol-1 , which is too high for a direct C-H activation by the Zr-Me group .

reaction of the amido-bridged zirconium complex ( CpSiMe 2NSiMe2Cp)ZrCH3 ( 1 ) ( cp = C5H <nUm> ) with half an equivalent of BC6F5 <nUm> or Ph3CB(C6F5)4 afforded the binuclear zirconium complexes [ ( CpSiMe2NSiMe 2Cp)Zr)2(m-CH3)][RB(C6F 5)3 ] ( 2a , r = CH3 , 2b , r = C6F <nUm> ) with a methyl group as the bridge between the two zirconium atoms . In the presence of one equivalent of BC18F15 or Ph3C(C6F5)4 , <nUm> was transformed to the zwitterionic complexes [(CpSiMe2NSiMe2Cp)Zr] [RB(C6F5)3] ( 3a , r = CH3 , 3b , r = C6F5 ) which are free of a metal - bound s-alkyl ligand . 2b is stable with Me3Al while 3b combined with me 3Al to form a hetero - binuclear complex [ ( CpSiMe2NSiMe 2Cp)Zr(m-CH3)]Al(CH3)2][B(C 6F5)4 ] ( 4 ) as shown by NMR spectroscopy at room temperature . treatment of 2a or 3a with an excess of Me3Al led to (CpSiMe2NSiMe2Cp)Zr(C6F5) ( 5 ) through a group exchange process . 2b , 3a and <nUm> have been characterized by x-ray diffraction studies . 2a , 2b , 3a and 3b were highly active catalysts for ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with 1-octene in the presence of trialkylaluminium , but the binuclear zirconium complexes ( 2a and 2b ) showed higher activities than their mononuclear counterparts 3a and 3b . polymerization activities varied with the trialkylaluminiums and increased with the trialkylaluminium concentration applied in the system . the product existed mainly in the form of Al(PE)3 with polymeric chains , and its molecular weight and distribution were greatly influenced by the type and amount of trialkylaluminium applied in the catalytic system .

starting from 1,1'-diacetylferrocene the ortho-amino,a- dimethylamino[3]ferrocenophane system <nUm> was prepared . this was converted to the o-imino,a-Cp - derivative <nUm> . subsequent treatment with e.g. an excess of methyllithium followed by ClZr <nUm> ( NMe <nUm> ) <nUm> ( thf ) <nUm> and me <nUm> ClSi <nUm> eventually gave the [3]ferrocenophane based cp - amido zirconium complex 11b . In a similar way the [3]ferrocenophane derived fluorenyl-Cp ansa - zirconocene dichloride complex <nUm> was obtained . the 20-methylalumoxane ( MAO ) system is an active homogeneous ziegler - natta catalyst for ethylene polymerization . the 11b-MAO system reacts efficiently with an ethene-1-octene mixture to yield a mixture of linear polyethylene plus the ethene-1-octene copolymer . the compounds <nUm> , <nUm> , 10b , 11b , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> were characterized by x-ray diffraction . 
A number of half - zirconocene anilide complexes of the type Cp*ZrCl <nUm> [ N(2,6-R <nUm> <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> )R <nUm> ] [ r <nUm> = i Pr ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) , me ( 2 ) ; r <nUm> = me ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) , bn ( 3 ) ] and Cp*ZrCl[N(2,6-Me <nUm> C <nUm> H <nUm> )Me ] <nUm> ( 4 ) ( cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ) were synthesized from the reactions of Cp*ZrCl <nUm> with the lithium salts of the corresponding anilide in diethyl ether at room temperature . all new zirconium complexes were characterized by <nUm> H and <nUm> C NMR and elemental analysis . molecular structures of complexes <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> were determined by single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis . upon activation with Al i bu <nUm> and ph <nUm> CB(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> , complexes 1-4 exhibit good catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization , and produce polyethylene with a moderate molecular weight . among these zirconium complexes , complex <nUm> shows the highest catalytic activity while complex <nUm> shows the lowest catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization . complexes 1-3 also exhibit moderate catalytic activity for copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene , and produce copolymers with relatively high molecular weight and reasonable 1-hexene incorporation . In addition , the activation procedure of these catalyst systems were studied by <nUm> H NMR spectroscopy . 
facile activation of nitrous oxide is achieved using a series of fluoroarylboranes , BC18F15 , PhB(C6F5)2 , MesB(C6F5)2 , BC18F15O , B(C6F4-p-H)3 , B(C6H4-p-F)3 and 1,4-(C6F5)2BC6F4B(C6F5)2 in the presence of the basic , bulky phosphine tBu3P . room temperature reaction yields mono- and biszwitterionic species of the form tBu3P(N2O)B(C6F5)2R ( r = C6F5 <nUm> , ph <nUm> , mes <nUm> , C6F5O <nUm> ) , tBu3P(N2O)BR3 ( r = C6F4-p-H <nUm> , C6H4-p-F <nUm> ) and tBu3P(N2O)B(C6F5)2C6F4(C6F5)2B(ON2)PtBu3 <nUm> . N2O activation is similarly achieved using Cy3P and B(C6F4-p-H)3 yielding the zwitterionic species Cy3P(N2O)B(C6F4-p-H)3 <nUm> . reaction of <nUm> with [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] results in facile transfer of the robust tBu3P(N2O) fragment to the stronger lewis acid Ph3C+ generating [tBu3P(N2O)CPh3][B(C6F5)4] <nUm> . similarly exchange reactions with titanocene and zirconocene cations generate transition metal and phosphine stabilized nitrous oxide salts , of the form [tBu3P(N2O)MCp2Me][MeB(C6F5)3] , ( m = Zr <nUm> , Ti <nUm> ) . the alkoxy zirconocene cation [Cp*2Zr(OMe)]+ forms an FLP in the presence of tBu3P which reacts with N2O providing a direct synthetic route to the corresponding salt [tBu3P(N2O)ZrCp*2(OMe)][B(C6F5)4] <nUm> . kinetic studies of the self - exchange reaction of tBu3P(N2O)B(C6H4-p-F)3 with B(C6H4-p-F)3 were carried out acquiring information regarding the mechanism of exchange . 
A method for the preparation of bifunctional carbosilane dendrons has been developed and used to synthesize first- and second - generation dendrons containing [ cp <nUm> MCl <nUm> ] end - groups ( m = Ti , Zr ; cp = cyclopentadienyl ) and Si-Cl focal - point bonds . these dendrons have been fully characterized in solution and , in the case of the zirconium derivatives , immobilized on an amorphous silica surface and tested as ethylene polymerization catalysts . the immobilization was quantitative and quite stable under the conditions of the catalysis . 
1-Pentene and 4-methyl-1-pentene ( 4M1P ) have been polymerised using several C2 - symmetric ansa - zirconocene catalysts rac-X(2-R 1,4-R2-Ind)2ZrCl2 [ x = C 2H4 , R1 = R2 = H ( 1 ) ; x = SiMe <nUm> , R1 = R2 = H ( 2 ) ; x = SiMe2 , R1 = me , R2 = H ( 3 ) ; x = SiMe2 , R1 = H , R2 = ph ( 4 ) ; x = SiMe2 , R1 = me , r <nUm> = ph ( 5 ) ] with MAO as cocatalyst . the effects of polymerisation conditions as well as substituents on the indenyl ligand were studied . except for the poly-1-pentenes synthesized with <nUm> and <nUm> at low temperatures , low molecular weight isotactic polymers were generally obtained . compared to their behaviour in propylene polymerisation , the relative activity and selectivity of catalysts 1-5 are considerably different for 1-pentene and 4M1P polymerisation . of the five catalysts , <nUm> and <nUm> showed the highest activities for both 1-pentene and 4M1P polymerisation , while <nUm> resulted in the lowest activities , especially for 4M1P polymerisation . subsequently , a cs- and several C 1-symmetric zirconocenes , (R1)2C(3-R 2-Cp)(2,7,-R3-Flu)ZrCl2 ( R1 = me , R2 = R3 = H ( 6 ) ; R1 = R2 = me , R3 = H ( 7 ) ; R1 = me , R2 = t-Bu , R3 = H ( 8 ) ; R1 = me , R2 = R3 = t-Bu ( 9 ) ; r <nUm> = ph , R2 = t-Bu , R3 = H ( 10 ) ; R1 = ph , R2 = R3 = t-Bu ( 11 ) , were tested in 1-pentene and 4M1P polymerisation with MAO as cocatalyst . the effect of substituents on the bridge , the cyclopentadienyl ( cp ) and fluorenyl ( flu ) ligand , was studied relative to the polymerisation temperature and type of monomer . the molecular weights of the polymers were considerably higher than those of the poly-1-pentenes and P4M1Ps obtained with C2 - symmetric zirconocenes ( 1-5 ) . the catalytic activities and polymer molecular weights strongly depend on the fluorenyl substituent and the bridge , while the type of substituent on the cp ligand has a strong influence on the tacticity of the polymers . 
A methylzirconocene cation ( with a [ B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] - counterion ) transfers a methyl cation equivalent to diphenylphosphino-alkynes to generate ( η <nUm> -alkyne)ZrCp <nUm> complexes bearing the [ RCCPPh <nUm> me ] + ligand . two examples of the PMe <nUm> ligand stabilized [ ( me <nUm> P)Cp <nUm> zr(e <nUm> -RCCPPh <nUm> me ) + ][B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> - ] salts were characterized by x-ray diffraction .

an efficient protocol for the highly regioselective opening of aliphatic zirconacyclopentadienes is reported . the one - pot process involves a zirconocene - mediated cyclization of 1,6-diynes and highly selective cleavage of the metallacycles with NBS and enables a concise synthesis of the tetrahydrofuran - core of the leupyrrins . 
the reaction of η 2-iminozirconocene chloride complexes with trimethylsilylethynyl lithium leads to rapid C-C coupling at room temperature to yield the corresponding five - membered aza-zirconacycloallenoids . such compounds were also obtained by trapping of in situ generated zirconocene with alkynyl imines . 
A series of novel monochloro half - zirconocene complexes containing phosphine oxide-(thio)phenolate chelating ligands of the type , ClCp'Zr[X-2-R1-4-R2-6-(Ph2PO)C 6H2]2 ( cp' = CH , 2a : x = O , R1 = ph , R2 = H ; 2b : x = O , R1 = F , R2 = H ; 2c : x = O , R1 = tBu , R2 = H ; 2d : x = O , R1 = R2 = tBu ; 2e : x = O , r <nUm> = SiMe3 , R2 = H ; 2f : x = S , R1 = SiMe3 , R2 = H ; cp' = C5Me5 , <nUm> g : x = O , R1 = SiMe3 , R2 = H ) , have been synthesized in high yields . these complexes were identified by 1H {13C} NMR and elemental analyses . structures for 2b , 2c and 2f were further confirmed by x-ray crystallography . structural characterization of these complexes reveals crowded environments around the zirconium . complexes 2b and 2c adopt six - coordinate , distorted octahedral geometry around the zirconium center , in which the equatorial positions are occupied by three oxygen atoms of two chelating phosphine oxide - bridged phenolate ligands and a chlorine atom . the cyclopentadienyl ring and one oxygen atom of the ligand are coordinated on the axial position . complex 2f also folds a six - coordinate , distorted octahedral geometry around the Zr center , consisting of a Cp-Zr-O ( in PO ) axis [ <nUm> ° ] and a distorted plane of two sulfur atoms and one oxygen atom of two chelating phosphine oxide - bridged thiophenolate ligands as well as a chlorine atom . when activated by modified methylaluminoxane ( MMAO ) , all the complexes exhibited high activities towards ethylene polymerization at high temperature ( <nUm> ° C ) , giving high molecular weight polymers with unimodal molecular weight distribution . the formation of 14-electron , cationic metal alkyl species might come from the Zr-O ( in phenol ring ) bond cleavage based on the DFT calculations study . 
the synthesis and crystal structure of a zirconocene derivative with a-Keggin mono-aluminum - substituted polyoxotungstate , [ a-PW 11Al(OH)O39ZrCp2]26- ( cp = C5H5- ) ( 1 ) , which was obtained by the reaction of a-Keggin mono-aluminum - substituted polyoxotungstate with a biscyclopentadienylzirconium(iv) complex , is described herein . analytically pure , homogeneous , yellow crystals of the tetra-n-butylammonium salt of polyoxoanion <nUm> , [(n-C4H9)4N] 6[a-PW11Al(OH)O39ZrCp2] <nUm> ( TBA-1 ) , were obtained from the ca. <nUm> : <nUm> reaction of [ ( n-C 4H9)4N]4[a-PW 11{Al(OH2)}O39 ] with Cp2Zr(OTf) 2*THF ( OTf = O3SCF3- ) in acetonitrile solution under an argon atmosphere , followed by precipitation from water and crystallization from acetonitrile . TBA-1 was characterized based on x-ray structure analysis , elemental analysis , thermogravimetric / differential thermal analysis ( TG / DTA ) , fourier transform infrared ( FTIR ) , and solution ( 31P , 27Al , 19F , 1H , and 13C ) nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy . single - crystal x-ray structure analysis revealed that the two {PW11AlO40} units are bridged by two " bent sandwich " Cp2Zr 2+ fragments with C2 symmetry . each zirconium center was bound to a terminal oxygen atom of the aluminum and tungsten sites and an edge - sharing oxygen atom at the Al-O-W linkage . further , the stability towards water was investigated by NMR ( 31P , 1H , and 13C ) and FTIR spectroscopy . the e5- cyclopentadienylzirconium fragments were not eliminated from the surface of [a-PW11{Al(OH2)}O39]4- even after <nUm> h exposure to <nUm> equiv. of water . 
zirconocene , in situ generated by treatment of zirconocene dichloride with two molar equiv. of n-butyl magnesium chloride , is trapped by the enynes R-CC-C(Me)CH <nUm> ( r = -SiMe <nUm> , 7c ; r = tert-butyl , 7b ) to give the zirconacycloallenoids 6b and 6c , respectively . compound 6c adds an additional equivalent of the enyne 7c to form the seven - membered alkyne insertion product <nUm> which itself exhibits a typical zirconacycloallenoid structure . acetonitrile insertion into the Zr-C bond of 6c also results in the formation of a seven - membered metallacycloallenoid , isolated as the respective enamido tautomer <nUm> . compound 6c reacts with two molar equiv. of benzaldehyde to give a nine - membered cyclic allene . compound 6b adds one molar equiv. of the enyne 7c to yield the nine - membered metallacycle <nUm> that contains two metal bonded allenoid moieties inside the ring structure . 
low temperature photolysis in PhMe or MeC6H11 of various zirconocene(IV) alkyls , aryls , chlorides , cyclopentadienyls , or hydrides [Zr(e-C5H5)2(R)X] leads to the e.s.r . characterisation of a number of ZrIII complexes : [ Zr(e-C 5H5)2R ] ( 1 ) and [ Zr(e-C5H 5)R2 ] as well as their phosphine adducts , [ Zr(e-C 5H5)2Cl ] , and a ZrIII hydride ( 2 ) ; the primary photo - products from [ Zr(e-C5H5) 2R2 ] ( e.g. , r = CH2Ph ) are ( 1 ) and R* , with ( 2 ) derived from ( 1 ) by a dark reaction . 
copper - mediated electrophilic imination of alkenylzirconocenes generated in situ from alkynes and zirconocenes is accomplished under mild reaction conditions . the reaction can be used to prepare various 2-azadienes . 
diffusion NMR spectroscopy was applied to investigate all individual components and combinations thereof for the Cp2ZrMe2 / MAO ( DMAO ) / TBP ( MAO = methylaluminoxane , DMAO = AlMe3 depleted MAO , TBP = 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol ) ternary system , selected as a prototypical catalytic pool for homogeneous olefin polymerisation . both MAO and DMAO were found to self - aggregate in C6D6 with the latter having a higher propensity . TBP reacts with DMAO affording MeAl(2,6-di-tert-butylphenoxide) <nUm> and causing a structural modification of DMAO , whose aggregates become much larger . the actual dimensions and self - aggregation tendency of (D)MAO , which depend on Al concentration and the possible presence of TBP , turned out to carry over to [ Cp2Zr(m-Me)2AlMe 2]MeMAO ( 1 ) OSIP ( outer sphere ion pair ) and [ Cp2Zr +Me ⋯ MeMAO- ] ( 2 ) ISIP ( inner sphere ion pair ) that form upon activation of Cp2ZrMe2 . once the intrinsic self - aggregation tendency of MAO has been subtracted , OSIP <nUm> and ISIP <nUm> behave exactly as analogous ion pairs with borate ions : ISIP <nUm> does not self - aggregate , whereas OSIP <nUm> exhibits the same self - aggregation trends of zirconocene OSIPs with borate counterions . 
functional group transformations at the group <nUm> metallocene framework have been demonstrated , which have provided relatively straightforward access to otherwise synthetically challenging derivatives . the pendant nitrile group in Ti and Zr metallocene complexes of the type [ ( e5-C 5Me5)(e5-C5H4CMe 2CH2CN)MCl2 ] was converted into an intramolecularly bound ketimido moiety by alkylation , which took place not only at the nitrile , but also at the metal centre . the choice of an alkylating reagent ( alkyl / aryl lithium , grignard reagent ) was crucial : e.g. , <nUm> equiv. of MeMgBr effected the alkylation only at the metal , yielding selectively complexes [ (e5-C5Me5)(e5-C 5H4CMe2CH2CN)MMe2 ] , while the use of PhMgBr , PhLi , or MeLi instead gave selectively the ketimido complexes . organyl lithium reagents were , however , not compatible with the titanocene derivatives . the metal - bound ketimides were subsequently cleaved off by the reaction with ClH , which afforded metallocene dichlorides with a pendant imino group . these compounds were easily protonated again at the nitrogen atom to produce a cationic iminium moiety . aqueous hydrolysis of the imine or its respective hydrochloride proved to be viable in the case of Zr and it finally afforded a pendant ketone group attached to the zirconocene framework . 
A conjugated enyne reacts with in situ generated zirconocene to yield a five membered zirconacycloallenoid that was characterized by x-ray diffraction . 
In two consecutive equilibria the compound (Cp*)2Zr(OMe) <nUm> undergoes insertion of CO2 to form the mono- and bis-hemicarbonates . both equilibria are exothermic but entropically disfavoured . magnetisation transfer experiments gave kinetic data for the first equilibrium showing that the rate of insertion is overall second order with a rate constant of <nUm> ± <nUm> M-1 s-1 , which is substantially higher than those reported for other early transition metal alkoxides , which are currently the best homogeneous catalysts for dimethyl carbonate formation from methanol and CO2 . activation parameters for the insertion reaction point to a highly ordered transition state and we interpret that as there being a substantial interaction between the CO2 and the metal during the C-O bond formation . this is supported by DFT calculations showing the lateral attack by CO2 to have the lowest energy transition state . 
the recently reported cationic titanocene complex [ cp <nUm> TiMe(OH <nUm> ) ] + was subjected to detailed computational studies using density functional theory ( DFT ) . the calculated NMR spectra revealed the importance of including the anion and the solvent ( CD <nUm> Cl <nUm> ) in order to calculate spectra which were in good agreement with the experimental data . specifically , two organic solvent molecules were required to coordinate to the two hydrogens of the bound OH <nUm> in order to achieve such agreement . further elaboration of the role of the solvent led to bader 's QTAIM and natural bond order calculations . the zirconocene complex [ cp <nUm> ZrMe(OH <nUm> ) ] + was simulated for comparison . this journal is 
an ansa - zirconocene bearing methyl substituents at all positions adjacent to the bridgehead [ (-C(Ph)HC(Ph)H-)(e5-2,5-Me2C 5H2)2ZrCl2 ] ( 4 ) was prepared in high yields ( <nUm> % ) through the reductive dimerization of 1,4-dimethyl-6-phenylfulvene utilizing ZrCl2*DME generated in situ . the structure of <nUm> was subsequently confirmed using x-ray crystallography . <nUm> exhibited excellent catalytic performance with regard to 1-decene oligomerization , which was carried out with the intention of preparing lubricant base stocks . high activities ( <nUm> × <nUm> g mol-1 Zr h-1 activity ; TON = <nUm> <nUm> ; TOF = <nUm> s-1 ) were observed at temperatures as high as <nUm> ° C and the oligomer distribution was appropriate for lubricant application . the simulated distillation ( SIMDIS ) data confirmed that a wide range of oligomers were formed , ranging from the dimer ( 2-mer ) to 20-mer . A minimal amount of the dimer and oligomers larger than the 10-mer was formed ( <nUm> and <nUm> wt % , respectively ) . alternatively , a typical unbridged complex such as (e5-nBuC5H4)2ZrCl2 primarily produced dimers ( <nUm> wt % ) , whereas the ansa - zirconocene (EBI)ZrCl <nUm> primarily produced oligomers larger than 10-mer ( <nUm> wt % ) . the methyl substituents at the positions adjacent to the bridgehead in <nUm> played a significant role in the catalytic performance . 

the copolymerization of 2-methyl-1,5-hexadiene ( MHD ) with propylene has been studied with different single - site group <nUm> metal catalysts . systems based on ansa - zirconocene precursors such as rac-{Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind} Cl2Zr ( 1 ) and C1- or CS - symmetric ansa-{CpCR2Flu}ZrCl2 ( <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ) , once activated by MAO , are highly active ( 20-600 kgpol g cat-1 h-1 at 60-70 ° C ) and yield copolymers in which MHD is cyclopolymerized as methylene-(1-methyl)-1,3-cyclopentane ( MMCP ) units . 13C NMR studies revealed , depending on the symmetry of the precatalyst used , either highly isotactic ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) or syndiotactic ( 3 ) polypropylene ( PP ) backbones , with isolated MMCP units . fully trans-diastereoselective cyclopolymerization of MHD was observed with <nUm> / MAO , while a mixture of trans and cis MMCP rings was observed with <nUm> and <nUm> / MAO . the amount of MMCP units in PP ( <nUm> - <nUm> mol % ) can be controlled by the amount of MHD in the feed . In contrast , the constrained geometry catalyst system based on {C5Me4SiMe2NtBu}TiCl2 ( 4 ) and MAO showed a much lower productivity ( ca. <nUm> kgpol gcat <nUm> h-1 at <nUm> ° C ) and yielded a regioirregular , atactic copolymer in which MHD is simply vinyl-inserted in quite moderate amounts ( <nUm> mol % ) . 
two new phenyl capped cyclopenta[c]chalcogenophenes ( PhCPTPh and PhCPSPh ) were synthesized by zirconocene mediated coupling and characterized by single crystal x-ray diffraction ( SCXRD ) . replacement of sulfur by selenium destabilized the HOMO level and increased the structural rigidity . the crystal structures of both the compounds were found to be nearly planar . PhCPSPh , though isostructural with PhCPTPh , packed in a very - ordered and specific pattern by Se ⋯ π interactions between two neighboring molecules . hirshfeld surface analysis supported the crystal structure study . theoretical calculations exhibited very close reorganization energies of <nUm> and <nUm> eV for PhCPTPh and PhCPSPh , respectively .

dibutyl zirconocene - mediated trans-selective cyclization of methoxyallyl-ene followed by the reaction with electrophiles is a convenient method for the synthesis of functionalized cyclopentane derivatives . ring - closing metathesis of the obtained cyclopentane derivative yielded a common building block for the synthesis of sesquiterpene analogues with unnatural trans-[3.4.0]bicyclo-nonane skeleton .

single - site polymerization catalysts enable exquisite control over alkene polymerization reactions to produce new materials with unique properties . knowledge of catalyst speciation and fundamental kinetics are essential for full mechanistic understanding of zirconocene - catalyzed alkene polymerization . currently the effect of activators on fundamental polymerization steps is not understood . progress in understanding activator effects requires determination of fundamental kinetics for zirconocene catalysts with noncoordinating anions such as [B(C6F5)4]- . kinetic NMR studies at low temperature demonstrate a very fast propagation rate for 1-hexene polymerization catalyzed by [(SBI)Zr(CH2SiMe3)][B(C 6F5)4 ] [ where SBI is rac-Me 2Si(indenyl)2 ] with complete consumption of 1-hexene before the first NMR spectrum . surprisingly , the first NMR spectrum reveals , aside from uninitiated catalyst , Zr - allyls as the sole catalyst - containing species . these Zr - allyls , which exist in two diastereomeric forms , have been characterized by physical and chemical methods . the mechanism of Zr - allyl formation was probed with a trapping experiment , leading us to favor a mechanism in which Zr - polymeryl undergoes b-H transfer to metal without dissociation of coordinated alkene followed by s-bond metathesis to form H and Zr - allyl .

we have used computer - assisted sperm analysis ( CASA ) to evaluate the spermicidal activity of <nUm> metallocene dihalides ( vanadocene dichloride [VDC] , titanocene dichloride [TDC] , zirconocene dichloride [ZDC] , molybdocene dichloride [MDC] , hafnocene dichloride [HDC] , vanadocene dibromide [VDB] , bis[methylcyclopentadienyl] vanadium dichloride [VMDC] , and vanadocene diiodide [VDI] ) ; <nUm> vanadocene di-pseudohalides ( vanadocene diazide [VDA] , vanadocene dicyanide [VDCN] , vanadocene dioxycyanate [VDOCN] , vanadocene dithiocyanate [VDSCN] , and vanadocene diselenocyanate [VDSeCN] ) ; and <nUm> disubstituted derivatives ( vanadocene ditriflate [VDT] , vanadocene monochloro oxycyanate [VDCO] , and vanadocene monochloro acetonitrilo tetrachloro ferrate [VDFe] ) . whereas the metallocene complexes containing titanium , zirconium , molybdenum , and hafnodium were inactive , all <nUm> vanadocene complexes elicited potent spermicidal activity at nano-micromolar concentrations with an order of efficacy VDSeCN > VDSCN > VDB > VMDC > VDCN > VDA > VDC > VDOCN > VDI > VDT > VDFe > VDCO without disrupting the acrosomal membrane , as determined by high - resolution low - voltage scanning electron microscopy . the sperm- immobilizing activity of the vanadocene complexes was rapid and irreversible , since the treated sperm underwent apoptosis as determined by the flow cytometric annexin V binding assay , DNA nick end - labeling , and confocal laser scanning microscopy . these results provide unprecedented evidence that metallocene complexes containing vanadium(IV) , especially VDSeCN , may be useful as contraceptive agents.Computer - assisted sperm analysis was used to evaluate the spermicidal activity of <nUm> metallocene dihalides , <nUm> vanadocene di-pseudohalides , and <nUm> disubstituted derivatives . the metallocene complexes containing titanium , zirconium , molybdenum , and hafnodium were inactive . however , in high - resolution low - voltage scanning electron microscopy , all <nUm> vanadocene complexes elicited potent spermicidal activity at nano-micromolar concentrations with the following order of efficacy : vanadocene diselenocyanate vanadocene dithiocyanate vanadocene dibromide vanadium dichloride vanadocene dicyanide vanadocene diazide vanadocene dichloride vanadocene dioxycyanate vanadocene diiodide vanadocene ditriflate vanadocene monochloro acetonitrilo tetrachloro ferrate vanadocene monochloro oxycyanate , without disruption of the acrosomal membrane . the sperm - immobilizing activity of the vanadocene complexes was rapid and irreversible due to induction of apoptosis . the potent spermicidal activity of metallocene complexes containing vanadium may provide the basis for the development of novel vaginal contraceptive agents . studies are underway to further evaluate the mechanisms involved in the induction of vanadocene - mediated apoptotic pathways . 
A method is presented by which it is possible to obtain estimates of dose rate in the body as a function of depth for a person at the air - ground interface of a semi-infinite half space of air which is uniformly contaminated with a radioactive photon emitter . the method involves calculating the photon flux density as a function of energy in an infinite air medium and using the computed spectrum as a source incident upon the reference man phantom . interactions of the photons in the body are followed by monte carlo techniques and resulting dose rates determined at <nUm> initial photon energies ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> MeV . dose rates at other initial photon energies may be obtained by interpolation . perturbations of the surface dose rate from one - half the equilibrium value far inside the cloud due to the change in density and composition at the air - ground interface are shown to be small . perturbations in the dose rate due to the presence of the phantom are considered in detail .

the distribution of the d electrons over the corresponding orbitals in transition - metal complexes is a central concept in the theory of metal - ligand bonding . the description requires the assignment of an axis of quantization , which is unambiguous in symmetric environments but not clear - cut in the now commonly encountered case of a low - symmetry coordination environment . As the d-electron population can be derived from accurate diffraction data using the methods of charge - density analysis [ holladay et al. ( 1983 ) . acta cryst. A39 , 377-387 ] , the need for an appropriate procedure is relevant in this area of crystallography . several criteria for the choice of coordinate system based on the resulting orbital populations are discussed . they are tested on a cobalt atom in a trigonal bipyramidal site and applied to transition - metal sites in cutt - alanylvaline , and an open zirconocene . the population of the d-orbital cross terms for the different coordinate - system orientations is used to judge the results . In the cases examined , the intuitively most reasonable coordinate system corresponds to the one with smaller value of the sum of the populations of the d-orbital cross terms .

transition metals are known to stabilize high - energy species and to activate otherwise unreactive ones . the zirconocene unit stabilizes highly strained alkynes and alkenes , allowing their use in selective carbon-carbon bond - forming reactions . this unit also increases the reactivity of unactivated molecules , enabling them to participate in nontraditional transformations . A general route has been developed that allows a wider variety of unsaturated fragments to participate in these reactions . the use of these zirconocene complexes in organic synthesis has led to the development of novel routes to a number of polyfunctionalized organic molecules . 
triphenylmethyl salts of the very weakly - coordinating borate anions [CN{B(C6F5)3}2]- ( 1 ) , [H2N{(C6F5)3}2] - and [ M{CNB(C6F5)3} 4]2- ( m = Ni , Pd ) have been prepared in simple one - pot reactions . mixtures of (SBI)ZrMe2 / <nUm> / AlBu <nUm> i ( SBI = rac-Me2Si(Ind)2 ) are 30-40 times more active in ethylene polymerizations at 60-100 ° C than BCl2ISZr / MAO . the quantification of anion effects on propene polymerization activity at <nUm> ° C gives the order [CN{B(C6F5)3}2] - > [ H2N{(C6F5)3} 2]- ≈ BC6F5 <nUm> - ≫ [MeB(C6F5)3]- . the highest productivities were of the order of ca. <nUm> × <nUm> g PP ( mol zr)-1 h-1 [C3H6]-1 , about <nUm> - <nUm> times higher than with BC6F5 <nUm> - as the counter anion . the titanium system CGCTiMe <nUm> / <nUm> / AlBu <nUm> i gave activities that were very similar to the zirconocene catalyst . the concentration of active species [C*] as determined by quenched - flow kinetic techniques indicates typical values of around <nUm> % , independent of the counter anion , for both the borate and MAO systems . pulsed field - gradient spin echo and nuclear overhauser effect NMR experiments on systems designed to be more realistic models for active species with longer polymeryl chains , (SBI)M(CH2SiMe3)(m-Me) BC18F15 and [ (SBI)MCH2SiMe <nUm> + ... BC6F5 <nUm> - ] ( m = Zr , Hf ) , demonstrated the influence of bulky alkyl chains on the ion pair solution structures : while the MeB(C6F 5)3 compound exists as a simple inner - sphere ion - pair , the BC6F5 <nUm> - compound is an outer - sphere ion pair ( OSIP ) , a consequence of the relegation of the anion into the second coordination sphere by the g-agostic interaction with the alkyl ligand . the OSIP aggregates to ion hextuples ( <nUm> mM ) or quadruples ( <nUm> mM ) . implications for the polymerization mechanism are discussed ; the process follows an associative interchange ( I a ) pathway . 
ethylene and propylene polymerization on immobilized catalysts of composition MMT-H2O / AlR3 / Zr - cene ( MMT = montmorillonite ) and on the corresponding homogeneous catalysts of composition Zr-cene-MAO ( Zr - cene = rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 , rac-Me2Si(Ind) 2ZrCl2 , rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind) 2ZrCl2 , rac-1-(9-e5-Flu)2-(5,6-Cp2-Me-1- e5-Ind)Et]ZrCl2 ) is considered . here , the activating support for the zirconocenes is montmorillonite containing methylaluminoxane or isobutylaluminoxane synthesized directly on the monmorillonite surface by the partial hydrolysis of an alkylaluminum ( AlMe3 , Al(i-Bu)3 , Al(i-Bu)2H ) with the mobile water of the support ( MMT-H 2O / AlR3 ) . the MMT-H2O / AlR3 supports are demonstrated to be effective activators for ansa - zirconocenes . the catalytic properties of the immobilized systems ( process kinetics and efficiency , the molar mass of the resulting polymer , and the structure of the macromolecules ) depend on the activating support and the zirconocene precatalyst . the complexes of the MMT-H2O / Al(i-Bu)3 support with all zirconocene precatalysts are more active in propylene polymerization than the same complexes of MMT-H2O / AlMe3 . the zirconcenes immobilized on MMT-H2O / AlR3 afford polyethylene and polypropylene with a higher molar mass than the corresponding homogeneous systems . furthermore , immobilization causes activesite heterogeneity . As compared to the homogeneous single - site catalysts of composition Zr-cene-MAO , the corresponding catalysts immobilized on MMT-H2O / AlR3 / Zr - cene are more stereospecific in the case of rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl <nUm> ( C <nUm> symmetry ) and are less stereospecific in the case of rac-[1-(9-e5-Flu)2-(5,6-Cp-2-Me-1-e5-Ind)Et] Cl2Zr ( C s symmetry ) .

A new zirconocene ansa-Me2Si-(2Me-4-p-Tol-cyclopenta[b]indol-3- yl)2ZrCl2 complex ( I ) , in which the cp ligand is fused with the indole ring , has been synthesized and studied by x-ray diffraction anal- ysis . light brown crystals are triclinic , space group P1 ; m = <nUm> , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A3 , z = <nUm> , rcalc = <nUm> g / cm3 . the structural parameters of complex I are compared with the known bis-indenyl zirconium complexes : rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( II ) and rac-Me 2Si(2Me-2Ph-1-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( III ) and analogous substituted rac-Me2Si(2,5-Me2-3Ph-6-Cp[b]Tp) 2ZrCl2 ( IV ) and rac-Me2Si(2,5-Me 2-1Ph-4-Cp[b]Py)2ZrCl2 ( V ) . complex I alkylated by the grignard reagent ( MgMe2 ) in the presence of the Al-iso-Bu3 cocatalyst is an effi- cient catalyst for the polymerization of propylene into isotactic polypropylene . 
density functional theory was used to study gas - phase reactions between the Cp2*ZrMe+ cations , where cp* = C 5H5 ( 1 ) , Me5Cp = C5Me5 ( 2 ) , and flu = C13H9 ( 3 ) , and the ethylene molecule , Cp2*ZrMe+ + CH2 → Cp2*ZrPr+ → Cp2*ZrAllyl + + H . the reactivity of the cp2* ZrMe+ cations with respect to the ethylene molecule decreased in the series <nUm> > <nUm> ≈ <nUm> . substitution in the cp ring decreased the reactivity of the Cp2*ZrMe+ cations toward ethylene , in agreement with the experimental data on the comparative reactivities of complexes <nUm> and <nUm> . the two main energy barriers along the reaction path ( the formation of the C-C bond leading to the primary product Cp2*ZrPr+ and hydride shift leading to the secondary product Cp2*Zr(H 2)Allyl+ ) vary in opposite directions in the series of the compounds studied . for flu ( 3 ) , these barriers are close to each other , and for the other compounds , the formation of the C-C bond requires the overcoming of a higher energy barrier . A comparison of the results obtained with the data on the activity of zirconocene catalysts in real catalytic systems for the polymerization of ethylene led us to conclude that the properties of the catalytic center changed drastically in the passage from the model reaction in the gas phase to real catalytic systems .

the copolymerization of ethylene with propylene in the liquid propylene initiated by ansa - metallocenes of the C <nUm> symmetry , rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1- e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride and rac-[1-(9- e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1-e5- indenyl)ethane]hafnium dichloride , activated by methylaluminoxane has been studied . triisobutylaluminum has been used as a cocatalyst . the propylene-ethylene copolymers thus prepared contain 5-60 mol % ethylene units . the reactivity ratios have been measured . In the case of the zirconocene - based catalyst , the molecular mass of the copolymers decreases with an increase in the content of ethylene units . the reverse situation is observed in the case of the hafnocene - based catalytic system . the copolymers are characterized by the low T g values ( down to <nUm> ° C ) . incorporation of a small amount of ethylene units ( <nUm> mol % ) results in a rise in the elastomeric behavior of the polymers . 
the quantum - chemical model formerly designed is described , which explains the high reactivity of the d 0-transition metal-carbon s-bond in concerted reactions including polymerization of olefins . In this model , the energy of transition from the ground singlet state to the excited singlet or triplet state corresponding to the transfer of electron density from the metal-carbon bond to vacant d-atomic orbitals correlates with its relative elongation after which a change in the valence state of a metal begins . this change is caused by the difference in the geometries of valence s- , p- , and d-atomic orbitals having close energies ; as a result , at a certain bond elongation , partial uncoupling of electrons involved in bonding takes place so that one of them becomes localized on d-atomic orbital . this process facilitates formation of the reactive state of the bond of the biradical type and leads to a reduction in the energy barrier of the insertion of an olefin molecule into this bond . lower energies of this barrier correspond to lower values of DE(S <nUm> → S j ) and DE(S <nUm> → T j ). As shown at the example of zirconocenes cp 2ZrMe2 and Me2CCp2ZrMe2 , alongside with a reduction in the energy barrier of olefin insertion into the Zr-Me bond of the cationic complex being formed , the characteristic absorption band in the spectrum of the corresponding neutral derivative shifts to the long - wave region . this band is attributed to the transfer of the electron density from the Zr-Me bond to the Zr atom . analysis is performed of the causes for bathochromic shifts of the long - wave absorption band for adduct formation in the systems including metallocene and Al - containing cocatalyst . 
the compositional heterogeneity of ethylene-1-hexene copolymers synthesized with various types of supported catalysts , namely , the titanium - magnesium catalyst Cl4Ti / Cl2Mg and the zirconocene catalyst OSi 2(MAO) / Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 , is studied via the method of successive self-nucleation-annealing ( SSA ) with the use of differential scanning calorimetry . on the basis of the data on the temperatures of individual peaks on SSA curves , the thickness of lamellas composed of macromolecules with a certain degree of short - chain branching is estimated . the copolymer synthesized with the zirconocene catalyst has a narrower range of fusion and does not contain large lamellas composed of molecules with a low degree of short - chain branching . with the use of the broadness index , it is shown that the copolymer synthesized with the zirconocene catalyst has a more uniform distribution of the comonomer than does the copolymer synthesized with the titanium - magnesium catalyst . for the copolymers synthesized with the titanium - magnesium catalyst , the compositional heterogeneity increases with an increase in the content of 1-hexene . 


the free - radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate initiated by the three - component system ferrocene - zirconocene dichloride-benzoyl peroxide has been studied . the kinetic features of the process , the interaction between components of the initiation system , and the molecular characteristics of the polymers have been investigated .

the effects of the nature of metallocene ( ferrocene , titanocene dichloride , and zirconocene dichloride ) and its content in benzoyl peroxide - metallocene initiating systems on the kinetics of polymerization of methyl methacrylate have been studied . the kinetic features of polymerization and changes in the molecular characteristics of poly(methyl methacrylate ) indicate that the process occurs via the complex - radical mechanism . on the basis of quantum - chemical calculations , a scheme describing the formation of complex - radical centers of chain propagation for the benzoyl peroxide - ferrocene system is proposed . 
anchored aluminoxanes are synthesized by the reaction of aluminum alkyls AlMe3 and Al(i-Bu)3 with water contained in the intracrystalline cavities of synthetic and natural zeolites ( NaY ( Si : Al = <nUm> ) , HZSM-5 ( Si : Al = <nUm> or <nUm> ) , NH4ZSM-5 ( Si : Al = <nUm> ) , NaZSM-5 ( Si : Al = <nUm> ) , and clinoptilolite - containing tuff ) and are used for the synthesis of heterogenized complexes of ansa - zirconocenes ( rac-C2H 4(Ind)2ZrCl2 , rac-Me2Si(Ind) 2ZrCl2 , and rac-[1-(9-e5-Flu)-2-(5,6- cyclopenta-2-Me-1-e5-Ind)C2H4]ZrCl <nUm> ) active in the polymerization of propylene . the nature of the zeolite support determines the content of zeolite water and affects the formation of anchored alkylaluminoxanes and the activity of immobilized catalysts . among the studied catalytic systems supported on zeolites , NaY and NaZSM-5 are the most efficient for the polymerization of propylene . PP synthesized with the supported zirconocene catalysts has a higher molecular mass and a wider molecular - mass distribution than those in the case of the corresponding homogeneous catalyst . the index of isotacticity and the content of pentads mmmm in PP prepared with immobilized metallocenes with the C <nUm> symmetry , such as rac-C2H4(Ind) 2ZrCl2 and rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl <nUm> , are likewise higher . the stereoselectivity of supported catalysts depends on the zeolite nature .

the bulky substituted cyclopentadienyllithium derivatives , CLi 5H4(CHMeR) ( r = C6H5 ( 1 ) , 1-naphthyl ( 2 ) , 9-anthryl ( 3 ) ) , were synthesized from the reaction of 6-phenylfulvene , 6-(1-naphthyl)fulvene or 6-(9-anthryl)fulvene with LiMe . the ansa-bis(cyclopentadiene) ligands Me2Si(C5HMe 4)(C5H4(CHMeR)) ( r = C6H5 ( 4 ) , 1-naphthyl ( 5 ) , 9-anthryl ( 6 ) ) , and their lithium derivatives Li 2(Me2Si(C5Me4){C5H 3(CHMeR) } ) ( r = C6H5 ( 7 ) , 1-naphthyl ( 8 ) , 9-anthryl ( 9 ) ) have been prepared . the zirconocene complexes , [ Zr(e5-C5H5){e5-C 5H4(CHMeR)}Cl2 ] ( r = C6H5 ( 10 ) , 1-naphthyl ( 11 ) , 9-anthryl ( 12 ) ) and [ Zr{e5-C 5H4(CHMeR)}2Cl2 ] ( r = C 6H5 ( 13 ) , 1-naphthyl ( 14 ) , 9-anthryl ( 15 ) ) , were synthesized by the reaction of lithium derivatives 1-3 and [ zr(e 5-C5H5)Cl3 ] or Cl4Zr , respectively . the reaction of the lithium ansa - derivatives 7-9 and zirconium tetrachloride yielded the ansa - zirconocene complexes , [ Zr(Me2Si(e 5-C5Me4){e5-C5H 3(CHMeR)})Cl2 ] ( r = C6H5 ( 16 ) , 1-naphthyl ( 17 ) , 9-anthryl ( 18 ) ) . the zirconocene complexes have been tested in the polymerization of ethene and propene . the polymerization of propene with the ansa - zirconocene catalysts 16-18 gave polypropylene with <nUm> % mmmm pentads and the symmetric zirconocene catalysts 13-15 30-60 % mmmm pentads . 
protocols for obtaining defined zirconocene complexes with polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes with mono- , di- , and trisilanol functionality ( SIPOSS , DIPOSS , and TRIPOSS ) were established . the TRIPOSS silanolates binding one zirconocene and one chlorozirconocene moiety , [ {(c-C5H9)7Si7O9O3} Zr2Cl(c5-C5H4R)4 ] ( <nUm> , r = bu ; <nUm> , r = H ) , were obtained by reacting the silanol with the respective zirconocene dichloride and triethylamine in CCl2H2 in a <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio , an excess of the zirconocene dichloride being required to suppress intramolecular dehydration of TRIPOSS . the related SIPOSS complex , [{(c-C5H9)7Si8O12O}2-Zr(c5-C5H4Bu)2] ( 3 ) , was prepared similarly at the stoichiometric ratio of [ZrCl2(c5-C5H4Bu)2] / SIPOSS / NEt3 equal to <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> . when employed in the <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> ratio , the same reagents afforded only the impure complex [{(c-C5H9)7Si8O12O}ZrCl(c5-C5H4Bu)2] ( 4 ) , contaminated with <nUm> and unreacted [ZrCl2(c5-C5H4Bu)2] . finally , the zirconocene complexes with SIPOSS and DIPOSS moiety , [ {(c-C5H9)7Si8O12O} 2Zr(c5-C5H5)2 ] ( 5 ) and [(c-C5H9)7Si7O9(OSiMe3)O2}-Zr(c5-C5H5)2] ( 6 ) , respectively , were obtained by reacting [ZrMe2(c5-C5H5)2] with stoichiometric amounts of the appropriate silanols . all complexes were characterized by 1H , 13C , 29Si NMR and IR spectra , and by elemental analysis from XPS spectra . preliminary ethene polymerization experiments showed that compounds <nUm> or <nUm> when combined with an excess of methylaluminoxane were nearly as active as [ZrCl2(c5-C5H5)2] whereas compound <nUm> was by about one order of magnitude less active . 
complex [ Zr{e5-C5Me4(SiMe 2H)}2Cl2 ] ( 1 ) was prepared by the reaction of lithium salt of 2,3,4,5-tetramethyl-1-(dimethylsilyl)cyclopenta-2,4-diene with [ZrCl4] in boiling THF . the reduction of <nUm> with excess magnesium in THF in the presence of excess bis(trimethylsilyl)- acetylene ( btmsa ) afforded the bivalent metal ansa-disilylene complex with p-coordinated btmsa [ Zr(e2-btmsa){e5-C5Me4(SiMe 2)}2 ] ( 2 ) . the dehydrocoupling of SiMe2H groups was accompanied by a hydrogen transfer to releasing btmsa to give a mixture of cis- and trans- 1,2-bis(trimethylsilyl)ethene . chlorination of <nUm> with ClPb <nUm> afforded ansa-[Zr{e5-C5Me4- (SiMe2)}2Cl2 ] ( 3 ) and liberated btmsa . the crystal structures of complexes , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined by x-ray crystallography . 
chiral amino-functionalized silicon - bridged indene derivatives 4a-4c were synthesized from 3-(2-(N,N-dialkylamino)ethyl)indenes 2a-2c . the C-Si coupling reactions are regioselective , leading exclusively to the formation of 1,3-disubstituted isomers in a rac / meso ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> , as indicated by NMR spectroscopy . the solid - state structure of the dimethylsilyl-bridged bisindene (R,R)-4a is described . the formation of corresponding ansa - zirconocenes via amine elimination chemistry was monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy . 
this article highlights some of our recent efforts and presents new data on the importance of cyclopentadienyl substituent effects on group <nUm> metallocene dinitrogen chemistry . reactions such as the coordination of N to an isolated titanium sandwich complex , alkali - metal reductions of zirconocene dihalide complexes , alkane reductive elimination reactions , and the hydrogenation of zirconium dinitrogen complexes are all extremely sensitive to the groups present on the cyclopentadienyl rings . these results are promising for the future of N fixation , as the reactivity of a specific metallocene can be dramatically altered by subtle manipulations in ligand substituents . 
the 15-thia-15-deoxy analogue of prostaglandin E1 methyl ester has been prepared by the zirconocene chloride mediated conjugate addition of an n-pentyl ethynyl sulfide derived anion to an appropriately substituted cyclopentenone . similar methodology has also been used to prepare other 3-(3'-thia-1'-octenyl)-cyclopentanones . 
CO insertion and C-C reductive elimination involved in the carbonylation of the metallacyclic zirconocene complex , 1,1-bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)-1- zirconaindan ( r ) , have been theoretically studied with the aid of DFT calculations at the B3LYP level . it is found that the c(sp3)- c(sp2) reductive elimination is preferred over c(sp <nUm> ) - c(sp2) , and importantly , this preference for C-C reductive elimination directs the CO insertion into the Zr - c(sp2) bond rather than the Zr - c(sp3) bond , even though the CO insertion into the former bond is kinectically less favorable than into the latter bond , a result related to that the CO insertion is found to be reversible . 

the synthesis and spectroscopic studies of metalloporphyrin dimers having 1,3-butadiyne linker attached to the beta pyrrolic positions of the linked porphyrins are reported . bromoethenyl metalloporphyrins were synthesized by zirconocene - promoted bromomethylenation of beta formyl metalloporphyrins . bromoethenyl metalloporphyrins were dehydrohalogenated by potassium tertbutoxide to give beta ethynyl or 2-ethynyl metalloporphyrins . it is the first documented example of zirconocene - promoted bromomethylenation of beta formyl metalloporphyrins . bromoethenyl metalloporphyrins were also synthesized by halo - wittig route . 2-ethynyl metalloporphyrins were self dimerized to give metalloporphyrin dimers having 1,3-butadiyne linking bridge . FTIR , raman spectroscopy , UV - visible , elemental analysis , 1H NMR and mass spectrometry were used to characterize the compounds . 
the purpose of this paper is to summarize mode of action of cisplatin on the tumor cells , a brief outlook on the metallocene compounds as antitumor drugs as well as the future tendencies for the use of the latter in anticancer chemotherapy . molecular mechanisms of cisplatin interaction with DNA , DNA repair mechanisms , and cellular proteins are discussed . molecular background of the sensitivity and resistance to cisplatin , as well as its influence on the efficacy of the antitumor immune response was evaluated . furthermore , herein are summarized some metallocenes ( titanocene , vanadocene , molybdocene , ferrocene , and zirconocene ) with high antitumor activity . 
ethylene polymerization was done to form polyethylene nano-composite with nanoaluminum nitride using zirconocene catalysts . results show that the catalytic activity is maximum at a filler loading of <nUm> mg nanoaluminum nitride . differential scanning calorimeter ( DSC ) and x-ray diffraction ( XRD ) results show that percentage crystallinity was also marginally higher at this amount of filler . thermal behavior of polyethylene nanocomposites ( <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> ) mg was studied by DSC and thermal gravimetric analyzer ( TGA ) . morphology of the component with <nUm> mg aluminium nitride is more fibrous as compared to <nUm> mg aluminium nitride and higher filler loading as shown by SEM images . In order to understand combustibility behavior , tests were performed on microcalorimeter . its results showed decrease in combustibility in polyethylene nanocomposites as the filler loading increases . 
two commercial nanoclays were used here as catalytic fillers for production of polyethylene ( PE ) and linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) nanocomposites via in situ polymerization with zirconocene / MAO catalyst . it was found that both types of nanoclays designated as clay A and clay B can improve thermal stability to the host polymers as observed from a thermal gravimetric analysis ( TGA ) . the distribution of the clays inside the polymer matrices appeared good due to the in situ polymerization system into which the clays were introduced during the polymer forming reaction . upon investigating the clays by x-ray diffractometer ( XRD ) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ) , it was observed that the crucial differences between the two clays are the crystallite sizes ( A < B ) and the amounts of amine group ( A < B ) . the higher amount of amine group in clay B was supposed to be a major reason for the lower catalytic activity of the polymerization systems compared to clay A resulting from its deactivating effect on zirconocene catalyst . however , for both clays , increasing their contents in the polymerization systems reduced the catalytic activity due to the higher steric hindrance occurring . 
polypropylene was synthesized using binary metallocene catalysts , rac-ethylenebis-(1-e5-indenyl)-zirconium dichloride ( rac - Et(Ind) 2ZrCl2 : cata A ) and zirconocene dichloride ( cp 2ZrCl2 : cata B ) , in the presence of ZnEt2 . the results indicated that ZnEt2 was an effective agent in modulating isotactivity of polypropylene . moreover , it was found that the [mmmm] pentad value of polypropylene prepared in the presence of diethyl zinc decreased to <nUm> , and the new peaks of [rmmr] and [ rmrr + mmrm ] appeared , in contrast to the peaks from polyproplene obtained in the absence of diethyl zinc . therefore , the possible reason was the occurrence of chain - shuttling polymerization in the CataA / CataB / ZnEt2 catalyst system . 
In our experiments , monospheres ( balls of silica , diameter 200-250 nm ) , carbon fibers ( diameter <nUm> nm , length 0.5-3 mm ) and carbon nanotubes ( diameter 15-25 nm , length <nUm> mm ) were used as fillers . before polymerization , the fillers were separated by ultrasound and then treated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the MAO reacts partially with the OH - groups of the silica and the formation of methane . catalytically active centers are formed after adding the zirconocenes or other transition metal complexes . the thickness of the polyolefins can be controlled by the pressure of ethene or propene and by the polymerization time . by this method , highly filled nanocomposite polypropenes can be obtained with a silica content of up to <nUm> wt % . such combined materials are stiff and hard . every particle is surrounded by a thin film of polyolefin with a thickness of <nUm> to <nUm> nm . carbon fibers and carbon nanotubes can be covered also within isotactic or syndiotactic polypropene . because of the hydrophobic character of the carbon surface , the polymer is drawing on the fiber . this leads to a reinforced combined polymer with special properties . 
different metallocene catalysts were used to synthesize propene / 1-hexene and ethene / styrene copolymers . for the propene / 1-hexene copolymerization , [Me2Si(2-Me-4-PhInd)2]ZrCl2 and [Me2Si(2-Me-4-NaphthylInd)2]ZrCl2 give high activity and random copolymers . In contrast for the ethene / styrene copolymerization , silyl-bridged zirconocenes produce polymers with only a low amount of styrene units . here , isopropyl-bridged C2 and CS symmetric zirconocenes incorporate high amounts of styrene up to <nUm> mol % . A comparison was carried out in respect of the catalyst activity and its ability to incorporate styrene as well as of the properties of the resulting polymers , such as molar masses , melting and glass transition temperatures . 
metallocene complexes Cp2TiCl2 , cp 2ZrCl2 , Cp2Zr(NnBu2) <nUm> , Cp2Ti(e 1-OC(O)C6H 5)2 and Cp2Zr(e 1-OC(O)C 6H5)2 were supported on ClMg <nUm> / SiCl4-n (n-C6H13O)n carrier and used for ethylene polymerization . the supported complexes result in highly active catalysts when treated with different aluminum alkyl-based co-catalysts . these catalysts are able of tuning the final properties of the produced polyethylenes . mixed composites of metallocenes and conventional ziegler - natta catalysts supported on the same carrier were also studied . A supported zirconocene Cp2Zr(e 1-OC(O)C 6H5)2 on Cl2Mg / SiCl4-n (n-C6H13O)n resulted in a highly active catalyst that eject control on the molecular weight , crystallinity and morphology of the resultant polyethylene . 
background : monomeric group IVB ( Ti , Zr and Hf ) metallocenes represent a new class of antitumor compounds . there is literature on the general biological activities of some organotin compounds . unfortunately , there is little information with respect to the molecular level activity of these organotin compounds . we recently started focusing on the anti-cancer activity of organotin polymers that we had made for other purposes and as part of our platinum anti-cancer effort . methods : for this study , we synthesized a new series of metallocene - containing compounds coupling the metallocene unit with dienestrol , a synthetic , nonsteroidal estrogen . this is part of our effort to couple known moieties that offer antitumor activity with biologically active units hoping to increase the biological activity of the combination . the materials were confirmed to be polymeric using light scattering photometry and the structural repeat unit was verified employing matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy results . results : the polymers demonstrated the ability to suppress the growth of a series of tumor cell lines originating from breast , colon , prostrate , and lung cancers at concentrations generally lower than those required for inhibition of cell growth by the commonly used antitumor drug cisplatin . conclusion : these drugs show great promise in vitro against a number of cancer cell lines and due to their polymeric nature will most likely be less toxic than currently used metal - containing drugs such as cisplatin . these drugs also offer several addition positive aspects . first , the reactants are commercially available so that additional synthetic steps are not needed . second , synthesis of the polymer is rapid , occurring within about <nUm> seconds . third , the interfacial synthetic system is already industrially employed in the synthesis of aromatic nylons and polycarbonates . thus , the ability to synthesize large amounts of the drugs is straight forward . 

lithium dimesitylgermanedithiolate reacted with titanocene or zirconocene dichloride to give 2,2-dimesityl-1,3-dithia-2-germa-4-titanacycle ( 3a ) and its zirconocene analogue ( 3b ) , which afforded a stable 2,3,4,5-tetrathiagermolane ( 4 ) in treatment with ClS . the reaction of 3b with Ph2GeCl2 gave unsymmetric 1,3,2,4-dithiadigermetane ( 5 ) . the bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl) derivative of cis-2,3-di-t-butyl-2,3-diphenyl-1,4-dithia-2,3-disila-5-titanacyclopentane ( 7a ) obtained from lithium 1,2-di-t-butyl-1,2-diphenyldisilane-1,2-dithiolate reacted with electrophilic reagents ( Cl2S , ClS , ClSe , R2GeCl2 ) to give the corresponding heterocycles . 
novel zirconium - iron dinuclear complexes , [ FcSiMe <nUm> ( r <nUm> r <nUm> Cp)ZrCl <nUm> cp ] ( fc ; ferrocenyl , r <nUm> = r <nUm> = H ; 2a , r <nUm> = me , r <nUm> = H ; 2b , r <nUm> = r <nUm> = me ; 2c , r <nUm> = ph , r <nUm> = H ; 2d ) , [ FcSiMe <nUm> Cp{ZrCl <nUm> ( me <nUm> cp ) } ] ( 3a ) , hafnium - iron dinuclear complex , [ FcSiMe <nUm> Cp{HfCl <nUm> ( me <nUm> cp ) } ] ( 3b ) and zirconium - iron trinuclear complex , [ ClZr <nUm> ( FcSiMe <nUm> cp ) <nUm> ] ( 4 ) , were synthesized and complexes 2d and <nUm> were characterized by an x-ray diffraction method . olefin polymerizations were conducted by using these multimetallic zirconocene catalysts with the coexistence of methylaluminoxane or tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borates . the maximum catalytic activities of complexes <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> were observed at low temperatures ( 15-45 ° C ) in ethylene polymerization , contrary to the conventional zirconocene catalyst ( [ ClZr <nUm> cp <nUm> ] ) , showing the maximum activity at between 70-80 ° C . A detailed investigation of ethylene polymerization and NMR measurements of the active species suggested that the interesting behavior of these complexes arose from an electronic cooperative effect between the zirconium and iron atoms . it was also revealed that complexes <nUm> were highly reactive toward propylene or diene in the copolymerization of ethylene and propylene or terpolymerization of ethylene , propylene and diene . 
dialkylzirconocenes in situ generated such as Cp2Zr(n-Bu)2 , Cp2ZrEt2 , and Cp2Zr(t-Bu)(i-Bu) are thermolyzed to afford zirconocene - alkene complexes . In the cases of Cp2Zr(n-Bu)2 and Cp2Zr(t-Bu)(i-Bu) , Cp2Zr-alkene complexes generated from them tend to act as a " Cp2Zr " equivalent , since the initially generated alkene is often replaced by another p-bond containing compound . In the presence of alkynes , for example , alkyne complexes may be generated . on the other hand , Cp2Zr(ethylene) tends to serve as an intermediate since the ethylene moiety is often incorporated in the final organic products . ring expansion and contraction , ligand substitution , transmetallation , migratory insertion , stereoisomerization , regioisomerization , oxidative addition involving these Cp2Zr-alkene and Cp2Zr - alkyne complexes as well as their structures are reviewed . 
this account describes recent development in carbon-carbon bond cleavage reactions and selective transformation of 5-membered zirconacycles , including zirconacyclopentanes , zirconacyclopentenes , and zirconacyclopentadienes . these zirconacycles can be prepared by coupling of unsaturated compounds such as alkenes and / or alkynes , but the zirconacycles also undergo b,b'-C-C bond cleavage , which has been further applied to organic transformation reactions . combination of the b,b-C-C bond cleavage and the C-C bond formation on zirconocene provided a highly selective and novel transformation . vinylzirconation of alkynes , regioselective allylzirconation of alkynes , and coupling of alkynes with nitriles or ketones were achieved by this method . zirconacyclopentadienes prepared symmetrically or unsymmetrically were converted into naphthalene , diene , and benzene derivatives . preparation of benzene derivatives from three different alkynes was performed by combination of C-C bond cleavage and C-C bond formation on zirconocene in one - pot in high yield with excellent selectivity . 
bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium chloride hydride ( schwartz reagent ) proved to be an efficient radical chain carrier for radical reduction of organic halides . treatment of 1-bromoadamantane with Cp2Zr(H)Cl in THF at <nUm> ° C in the presence of triethylborane furnished adamantane quantitatively . radical cyclization of 2-haloalkyl allyl ethers afforded five - membered products under the same reaction conditions . reduction with Cp2Zr(H)Cl generated in situ from Cp2ZrCl2 and sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminium hydride ( Red-Al ) also proceeded smoothly . moreover , the reduction could function by using a catalytic amount of cp 2ZrCl2 . A zirconocene - olefin complex also induced reductive radical cyclization of 2-haloalkyl allyl ethers in THF . this complex served as a single electron transfer reagent to promote the radical cyclization . furthermore , the cyclization reaction in DME afforded 3- tetrahydrofuranylmethylzirconium efficiently . 
one - pot synthesis of cyclohexene derivatives from two alkynes and one maleic acid derivative could be achieved . two alkynes were treated with [ cp 2ZrBu <nUm> ] to give zirconacyclopentadienes . addition of <nUm> equiv of H 2O followed by the reaction with maleic anhydride at <nUm> ° C in toluene for <nUm> h afforded the cyclohexene derivatives in high yields . the corresponding titanacyclopentadiene did not give the desired product under the same conditions . In the case of Hf , only <nUm> % of the product was obtained . dienylzirconocene , which could be prepared by the addition of one equiv of EtOH or t-BuOH to the zirconacyclopentadiene , also reacted with maleic anhydride to give the cyclohexene derivative in <nUm> and <nUm> % yield , respectively . 

the reaction of dilithiated silylene-bridged cp - ligands , whose silylene had one or two vinyl substituents , with Cl4Zr gave racemo - rich mixtures of the complex RR'Si(C5H2-2,4-Me2)2ZrCl <nUm> ( <nUm> : r = vinyl , R' = me , rac / meso = <nUm> / <nUm> , <nUm> : r = R' = vinyl , rac / meso = <nUm> / <nUm> ) . the pure racemic complex 1-rac was isolated after several recrystallization processes in a satisfactory yield ( <nUm> % , rac / meso > <nUm> / <nUm> ) and was structurally characterized . polymerization of propylene with 1-rac / MAO gave highly isotactic polypropylene . 
when aromatic halides were treated with alkylmagnesium reagents ( which have b-hydrogens ) and a catalytic amount of zirconocene dichloride , dehalogenation proceeded smoothly in high yields . the stoichiometric dehalogenation using dialkylzir - conocenes also proceeded with high selectivities . 
A zirconocene-ethylene complex C p2Zr(CH2 = CH2 ) - ( PMe3 ) reacted with R3EX ( e = Si , Ge , Sn ; r = ph or bu ; x = Cl , OE1 , or OER3 ) to give R3EEt in high yields after hydrolysis . the reaction mixture of the ethylene complex with Bu3SnCl further reacted with phenylacetylene to give homoallyltin compounds . when the reaction mixture was treated with Ph3SnCl or Ph3GeCl instead of phenylacetylene , Ph3SnEt or Ph3GcEt was obtained in high yields after hydrolysis via the replacement of the b-SnBu3 moiety . 
nonbridged zirconocene dichlorides , ( 1,2-Me <nUm> -4-RC <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( r = me ( 3 ) , ph ( 4 ) , p-FC <nUm> H <nUm> ( 5 ) , 2-furyl ( 6 ) , 2-thienyl ( 7 ) , and fc ( 8 ) ) , and meso- and rac-(1-Me-3-PhC <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) , in the presence of MAO show a high catalytic activity ( <nUm> - <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> gPP / molZr · h ) in the polymerization of propylene and produce almost an atactic elastomeric polymer of high molecular weight ( m w = <nUm> - <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> ). In contrast , rac-(1-Me-3-t-BuC <nUm> H <nUm> ) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> ( 12 ) shows very low activity and produces a rather high isotactic polymer of low molecular weight . 
the introduction of furyl groups to the position next to the silylene bridge of an ansa - zirconocene catalyst was found to remarkably enhance the catalytic activity and the molecular weight of PP during the isospecific polymerization of propylene . 
A C2 - symmetric afwa - zirconocene complex which has a Si-Cl moiety on its bridge was immobilized on O2Si by the reaction of the Si-Cl anchor with Si-OH on the solid surface . the prepared solid catalyst was found to be effective for isospecific propene polymerization . it exhibited higher productivity compared to a catalyst prepared using the zirconocene without a Si-Cl anchor . the effect of pretreatment of silica surfaces with Me3SiCl on catalyst performance is also described . 
zirconocene - mediated coupling of bis(methoxyethynyl)-disilanes ( 1a and 1e-g ) led to zirconacycles ( 2a and 2e-g ) , which were converted into 3,4-dialkylidene- and 3,4-benzo-1,2-disilacyclobutanes ( 3a and 6e-g ) via protonolysis and transmetallation with tin followed by diels - alder reaction . their Si-Si bonds were reactive toward palladium catalyst to give bissilylation and silyl-Heck products ( <nUm> and <nUm> ) . 
novel zirconocene or hafnocene - containing silsesquioxanes with a vinyl group Cp2M{[(vinyl)Me2Si](c-C5H9)7Si7O12} ( cp = cyclopentadienyl , m = Zr , Hf ) were synthesized , as well as a derivative with a trimethylsilyl group Cp2Zr[(Me3Si)(c-C5H9)7Si7O12] . A derivative containing a dimethylethoxysilyl group was also synthesized . 
DFT calculations clearly show that a zirconocene-ethylene complex , cp <nUm> Zr(C <nUm> H <nUm> ) , easily reacts with hydrosilane , HSi <nUm> , to afford either cp <nUm> Zr(H)(C <nUm> H <nUm> HSi <nUm> ) or cp <nUm> Zr(SiH <nUm> )(C <nUm> H <nUm> ). In the transition state , the Si-H anti-bonding s*-orbital of HSi <nUm> overlaps well with the p-back donating molecular orbital between Zr d π and C <nUm> H <nUm> p* orbitals . 
Cp2ZrEt2 reacted with one equiv of Cp2ZrX2 ( x = Cl or Br ) in THF to afford ethylene-bridged bimetallic zirconocene complexes , (Cp2ZrX)2(CH2CH2) ( x = Cl ( 2a ) , or Br ( 2b ) ) , in high yields . the structure of 2b was determined by x-ray analysis . reactions of 2a-b with various anions Y- gave a series of ethylene-bridged bimetallic zirconocene complexes , (Cp2ZrY)2-(CH2CH2) ( Y = ph , me , bu , CH2SiMe3 ) in good to high yields . 
new stereorigid bridged zirconocene having an indenyl group and a fluorenyl group as ligand was synthesized and investigated as an ethylene / 1-hydroxy-10-undecene copolymerization catalyst . this catalyst using MAO as a cocatalyst promoted polymerization to produce copolymers having high molecular weight ( mw : <nUm> ) and high polar monomer content ( <nUm> mol % ) , displaying higher polymerization activities at higher temperature . 
the reaction of zirconocene - alkyne complexes prepared from cp <nUm> ClZr <nUm> with BuLi and an alkyne with CMoO <nUm> yielded 2,3-disubstituted-5-ethylcyclopentenone derivatives by incorporation of once eliminated butene with excellent regioselectivity . 
zirconium - mediated cyclization of an allyl-ene compound afforded organozirconium intermediate , which after alkylation ( allylation and acylation ) afforded either dienes or unsaturated ketones . these are considered to be precursors further elaboration of which should yield functionlized steroids . 
dimerization of aryl-substituted terminal alkynes on indenyl zirconium complexes occurred in a selective way . 1,4-Aryl-1,3-diene derivatives were formed exclusively after hydrolysis . it is in sharp contrast to the reaction on [Cp2Zr] complexes . 
organometallic complexes are useful tools in synthetic organic chemistry . we investigated a novel synthetic method for ring construction using organometallic complexes and synthesized natural products and biologically active substances using these methods . metalacycles formed from an early transition metal and diene , enyne , and diyne are stable under the reaction conditions and they are easily converted into compounds with functional groups by the addition of various agents . we have developed a novel synthetic method of heterocycles from enyne and diene using Cp2ZrBu2 . the total syntheses of (-)-dendrobine , (+-)-mecembrane , and (+-)-mecembrine were achieved using this procedure . to synthesize these natural products as a chiral form , a novel palladium - catalyzed asymmetric allylic amination was developed , and chiral 2-arylcyclohexenylamine derivatives were synthesized . from these compounds , the total syntheses of (-)-mesembrane , (-)-mesembrine , (+)-crinamine , (-)-haemanthidine , and (+)-pretazetine were achieved . by further development of this procedure , a chiral 2-siloxymethylcy-clohexenylamine derivative could be synthesized and the novel synthesis of indole derivatives was developed from this compound . from this indole derivative , (-)-tsubifoline and (-)-strychnine were synthesized . 
novel zirconium - mediated carbon-carbon bond - forming reactions were developed . the allylic , g-alkoxyallylic , allenyl , and g,g- dialkoxyallylic zirconium species can be prepared from corresponding ethers under mild conditions through the addition of a zirconocene - butene complex to the carbon-carbon multiple bond of the ethers and subsequent b-elimination of the alkoxyl group . the g,g-dialkoxyallylic zirconium species reacts with carbonyl compounds at the b-position of the zirconium atom like a ketene dialkyl acetal in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of lewis acid and gave cyclopropane and / or cyclobutane derivatives . intramolecular reaction of allylic zirconium species with acetal also develops as a ring contraction reaction of carbohydrates and morpholine derivatives . this method is useful for the construction of chiral highly functionalized carbocycles and pyrrolidines . the intramolecular ester transfer reaction through the zirconium - mediated coupling reaction of alkenyl carbamates gave g-aminobutyric acid derivatives and pyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acids . 
four isomers of 5,7-dodecadien-l-ol were previously proposed as being the sex pheromone of the pine moth . the isomers were stereoselectively synthesized from 1-hexyne and tetrahydropyranyl ether of 5-hexyn-l-ol . the ( 5Z , 7Z ) - isomer was synthesized by a chodkiewic cadiot reaction followed by hydroboration , and other three isomers by novel synthetic methods including the addition of zirconocene hydride [ schwarz 's reagent C10ClH11Zn ] to control the regioselective coupling reaction . the 5,8- and 5,9-dodecadien-l-ol were also synthesized by similar methods for comparison of their characteristics with the endogenous sex pheromone . 
stability of various fluorinated BPh4 anions in ion - pair metallocene catalyst systems has been studied . XPS measurement shows that the incorporation of electron - withdrawing fluorine substituents decreases the electron density of boron drastically . the anions can be classified into three types according to the reactivity associated with its lewis basisity . i.e. , the number of fluorine substituents : ( 1 ) the anion without any fluorine substituent that reacts with Cp2ZrR with phenyl group transfer , ( 2 ) those with <nUm> – <nUm> fluorine substituents that react with trialkyl aluminium , and ( 3 ) those with <nUm> and <nUm> fluorine substituents that undergo no side reactions . practically , the stability of the anion is one of the most important requirements for the application of the ion-pair(non-MAO) metallocene catalyst . 
we have synthesized polyethylene and polypropylene copolymers having cyclopentane units in the main chain by copolymerization of ethylene and propylene , respectively , with cyclopentene ( CPE ) or 1,5-hexadiene ( HD ) using metallocene catalyst . among the obtained copolymers , poly ( ethylene-co-HD ) , which has 1,3-cyclopentane units in the main chain , shows isomorphism with a transition of the crystalline structure from orthorhombic to hexagonal . we used this finding for the molecular design of a liquid crystalline polyolefin . A liquid crystalline phase was discovered in poly(methylene-1,3-cyclopentane) ( PMCP ) , which was obtained by cyclization polymerization of HD using zirconocene catalysts . PMCPs clearly showed a birefringent texture which indicates a nematic liquid crystalline phase . A high cyclization selectivity of inserted HD units , a high trans-content of the 1,3-cyclopentane unit , and a low molecular weight without crosslinking were necessary to induce the liquid crystalline phase . 
dinuclear complexes attracted attention as ethylene and olefin polymerization catalysts because they frequently show different catalytic properties than their mononuclear analogues . most of the known dinculear catalysts are composed of the same transition metal centers . herein we synthesized novel dinuclear complexes by the olefin metathesis reaction and used them as the catalysts for olefin polymerization . olefin metathesis of the zirconocenes with alkenyl group affords the dinuclear Zr complexes having a bridging spacer with various lengths . the dinuclear complexes show higher catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization than the corresponding mononuclear complexes . heterodinuclear complexes containing early and late transition metals were synthesized by facile cross-metathesis reaction . they promote polymerization of ethylene to afford polyethylene with various branched structures depending on the combination of the metal centers . the polymerization mechanism includes formation of ethylene oligomers on the late transition metal center followed by copolymerization of ethylene with those oligomers on early transition metal center .

the reactions of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) or I2 with the living zirconium - polyolefin bond ( Zr-PO ) using zirconocene catalyst system were examined . although the reaction of MMA with the living Zr-PP does not proceed , I2 readily reacts with the living Zr-PO , such as atactic polypropylene ( ataPP ) , iso poly(1-hexene) and syndiotactic poly(propylene) ( synPP ) , quantitatively to give the terminal iodized polyolefins ( PO-I ) . moreover , PO-poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) block copolymers could be obtained by the reaction of MMA with living Sm-PO , which was formerly prepared by the transformation of PO-I by Cp2*Sm . 
A five - membered metallacycloallene complex , 1-zirconacyclopenta-2,3-diene , was prepared from low - valent zirconocene and 2,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)but-1-en-3-yne . the complex reacted with carbonyl compounds to afford alkynyl alcohols after hydrolysis via C = O insertion into Zr-C bond . similarly , nitriles inserted into the Zr-C bond to give the corresponding ketones after hydrolysis . the insertion of C = O and CN selectively took place at zirconium- sp3 carbon of the metallacycle . 
cp - bonded alkyl substituents may change the structural and chemical features of group <nUm> bent metallocene complexes considerably . increased solubility appears to make in situ generated ( MeCp ) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ClHZr an improved hydrozirconation reagent . the use of methylcyclopentadienyl ring systems allows the detection of the dynamic behaviour of the doubly acetylide bridged [ ( MeCp ) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > Zr-C-C-Ph ] - dimer . steric interaction between bulky cp - bonded tert-alkyl groups and the substituents at the internal carbon atoms of a conjugated diene ligand causes hindered (RCp)-metal rotation in many (diene)zirconocene and -hafnocene complexes ( DG+ r o t ≈ <nUm> kcal / mol ) . due to the preferred chiral cp - rotameric conformation of the ( me < inf > <nUm> < / inf > C-Cp ) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > m bent metallocene systems this dynamic feature can readily be detected in solution by NMR spectroscopy . the ( cp - CHMePh ) < inf > <nUm> < / inf > ClZr < inf > <nUm> < / inf > / alumoxane - system catalyzes the stereospecific polymerization of propene . catalysts derived from rac-[(1-phenylethyl)cyclopentadienyl]-zirconocene dichloride produce isotactic polypropylene via enantiomorphic - site and chain end control . 
mono- and bis(e-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium complexes show interesting stereochemical featureswith regard to their use in organometallic and organic synthesis as well as in catalysis . an example is described where the zirconocene unit serves to stabilize a planar tetracoordinate carbon center . next , various building blocks ( a metal carbonyl , an organic carbonyl compound , a conjugated diene , plus one or two organic alkylating electrophiles ) are assembled at the Cp2Zr - moiety and stereoselectively coupled to give new functionalized heteroatom stabilized carbene complexes or directly organic products . chiral (R*Cp)2Zr - derived metallocene / alumoxane ziegler - type catalysts have been used for propene polymerization . it is shown that chain end control and enantiomorphic site control are not operating independently for determining the product stereochemistry . additivity effects have been disclosed in a series of [Cp-CHRlR2]2rCl2 - derived olefin polymerization catalysts with regard to the degree of stereocontrol exercised by the chiral metallocene unit . finally , the preparation of the new chiral lewis acid “ (diboma-Cp)zirconium trichloride ” and applications in enantioselective catalysis are described . 
cationic zirconocene or hafnocene complexes serve as a novel class of lewis acid with unique reactivities , which are to be exploited in organic synthesis . four categories of reactivities are discussed , that is , ( A ) C-F bond activation / cleavage , ( B ) coordinative activation of ether linkages , ( C ) carbonyl activation , and ( d ) C-O bond cleavage via zirconocene alkoxide . 
co-cyclisation of alkenes with alkenes or alkynes and zirconocene gives zirconacycles which are further elaborated by the consecutive insertion of allyl , propargyl , or allenyl metal carbenoids and electrophiles . insertion of other carbenoids give the first zirconacyclohexanes with the potential for further elaboration . 
most synthetic applications of organo(chloro)zirconocenes involve the use of terminal zirconocenes derived from hydrozirconation of monosubstituted or symmetrical triple or double bonds . In our studies to effect stereoselective hydrozirconations of internal alkynes and alkenes , we have explored the alkoxy-directed hydrozirconation of homoallylic and bis-homoallylic alcohols . the discovery of a new method to prepare zirconocene hydrides in situ from readily available , air - stable zirconocene dihydride has allowed us to demonstrate for the first time that kinetic hydrozirconation products of internal , non-functionalized alkenes can be formed in preference over isomerized , thermodynamic products . 
the zirconocene - catalyzed rearrangement of epoxy esters to give 2,7,8-trioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octanes ( ABO - esters ) adds a new modification to carboxylic acid chemistry . acid / base - sensitive a-amino , a-hydroxy and b-bromo acid derivatives are converted in high yield to ABO - esters using this protocol . this strategy is complementary to the OBO - ester technology , and orthogonal methods for the deprotection of ABO - and OBO - esters have been developed . using chiral epoxy alcohol derivatives , a convenient and general asymmetric synthesis of bicyclic ortho esters can be achieved . new applications of ABO - esters in organic synthesis include conjugate additions to a,b-unsaturated ortho esters and their use as homoenolate equivalents as well as the preparation of tertiary alcohols .

A novel series of para-diiodobenzene derivatives , 3,6-diiodo-4,5-dialkyl-phthalic acid dimethyl esters , were prepared via cycloaddition of two TMS-substituted alkynes and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate , which was mediated by zirconocene . after iodination , three new compounds of 3,6-diiodo-4,5-dimethyl(dipropyl , dibutyl)-phthalic acid dimethyl esters ( 3a , 3b , 3c ) were synthesized in high region - selectivity and yields , and characterized by NMR . the crystal structures were determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction . the crystal of 3a ( C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > I < inf > <nUm> < / inf > O < inf > <nUm> < / inf > , mr = <nUm> ) belongs to the triclinic system , space group P1 with a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> A , α = <nUm> , β = <nUm> , γ = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A < sup > <nUm> < / sup > , z = <nUm> , F(000) = <nUm> , d < inf > c < / inf > = <nUm> mg / m < sup > <nUm> < / sup > , μ = <nUm> mm < sup > <nUm> < / sup > , T = <nUm> K , S = <nUm> , r = <nUm> and wR = <nUm> for <nUm> observed reflections with I > 2s(I) ; the crystal of 3b ( C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > I < inf > <nUm> < / inf > O < inf > <nUm> < / inf > , m < inf > r < / inf > = <nUm> ) is of triclinic system , space group P1 with a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> A , α = <nUm> , β = <nUm> , γ = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A < sup > <nUm> < / sup > , z = <nUm> , F(000) = <nUm> , d < inf > c < / inf > = <nUm> mg / m < sup > <nUm> < / sup > , μ = <nUm> mm < sup > <nUm> < / sup > , T = <nUm> K , S = <nUm> , r = <nUm> and wR = <nUm> for <nUm> observed reflections with I > 2s(I) ; the crystal of 3c ( C < inf > <nUm> < / inf > H < inf > <nUm> < / inf > I < inf > <nUm> < / inf > O < inf > <nUm> < / inf > , m < inf > r < / inf > = <nUm> ) belongs to the monoclinic system , space group P2 < inf > <nUm> / c < / inf > with a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> A , β = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> A < sup > <nUm> < / sup > , z = <nUm> , F(000) = <nUm> , dc = <nUm> mg / m < sup > <nUm> < / sup > , μ = <nUm> mm < sup > <nUm> < / sup > , T = <nUm> K , S = <nUm> , r = <nUm> and wR = <nUm> for <nUm> observed reflections with I > 2s(I) . 
hexaterf-butylcyclotrigermane , the only peralkylcyclotrigermane reported to date , reacts with the heavier chalcogens or aryl isocyanides by insertion into one Ge-Ge bond to provide the ring - enlarged four - membered cycles . hexakis(2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl)cyclotristannane ( 21 ) , first described by masamune and sita , is now easily accessible by treatment of tin (II) chloride with 2,4,6-triisopropylphenylmagnesium bromide . heating of <nUm> to ca. <nUm> ° C leads to an equilibrium between <nUm> and its cleavage products bis(2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl)stannylene ( 22 ) and tetrakis(2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl)distannene ( 23 ) , both of which can be trapped by various addition reactions . the reactions of <nUm> with the heavier chalcogens provide strong evidence for a true tin - tin double bond in distannene <nUm> . with transition metal substrates stannylene <nUm> reacts by substitution or insertion to give some new stannylene complexes . treatment of the intermediate zirconocene with <nUm> leads to a very airsensitive product , whose spectral data indicates the formation of the first transition metal complex of a distannene . attempts to prepare a more stable distannene of type <nUm> by replacement of the 2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl groups by the bulkier 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenyl groups remained unsuccessful as yet , because in this case aryl / alkyl rearrangements take place . 
trialkylsilanols were reported to modify and also to improve the catalytic performance in ethylene polymerization when added to zirconocene / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) systems . In order to obtain more information about the chemistry involved , a new stable catalytic precursor was investigated in this work . the precursor bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)bistriphenylsilanolatozirconium(IV) [ZrCp2(OSiPh3)2] was compared to ZrCp2(CH3)2 and ZrCp4 , which can generate ZrCp2(OSiPh3)2 in situ on triphenylsilanol addition . In ethylene polymerization , ZrCp2(OSiPh3)2 exibits a comparable activity and a larger stability than dicyclopentadienylzirconium complexes . on addition of triphenylsilanol to zirconocenes , the productivity increased and the molecular weight sharply decreased , thus suggesting the occurrence of ligand substitution in solution . the reported results are discussed with reference to the proposed mechanism of ethylene polymerization with the conventional ZrCp2Cl2 / MAO system . 

NQR ( nuclear quadrupole resonance ) spectroscopy is potentially one of the best ways of characterizing the bonding of metal cations such as zirconocene cations and Ag + to halogen donor atoms in weakly coordinating anions and neutral ligands such as halocarbons . known coordination of organoiodine atoms to silver ions was studied by <nUm> I NQR spectroscopy in [ Ag(p-C <nUm> H <nUm> I <nUm> )](PO <nUm> F <nUm> ) , [ Ag(o-C <nUm> H <nUm> I <nUm> )]NO <nUm> , [ Ag(CH <nUm> I <nUm> ) <nUm> ]PF <nUm> , and the explosive [ Ag(CH <nUm> I <nUm> )]NO <nUm> ; a possible case of iodocarbon coordination to a mercury atom in C <nUm> Cl <nUm> HgCl-CH <nUm> I <nUm> was also investigated . both the low - frequency ( ca. <nUm> MHz ) and the high - frequency ( ca. <nUm> MHz ) NQR signals were detected for each compound , and , for the first time , the quadrupole coupling constants e <nUm> qq zz / h and asymmetry parameters η of coordinated organohalogen atoms were obtained . As compared to the free iodocarbons , substantial ( <nUm> - <nUm> % ) reductions of e <nUm> qq zz / h and substantial increases in η ( to about <nUm> - <nUm> % ) were found in the iodocarbon complexes of silver , but not of mercury . from approximate theoretical analysis of the data , it appears that the electronic interaction of silver and iodine is quite substantial .

recent advances in polymerization of allyl and diallyl monomers catalyzed by homogeneous ziegler - natta catalysts are reviewed . zirconocene catalysts are effective for copolymerization of ethylene or propylene with Al - masked allyl monomers , as well as homopolymerization of allylsilanes . phosphine - sulfonate Pd complexes promote the copolymerization of ethylene with various polar allyl monomers , in the absence of a masking agent . late transition metal catalysts promote stereoselective cyclopolymerization of diallyl monomers having various polar functional groups . the cyclopolymerization of alkyl-substituted diallyl monomers by Pd diimine complexes affords the polymer having alternating oligomethylene and trans-1,2-cyclopentene groups .

A mechanism model based on ligand rotation hindered by the propagation chain has been proposed to qualitatively explain the observed phenomena . 
the metallocene dihalides are a relatively new class of small , hydrophobic organometallic anticancer agents that exhibit antitumour properties against numerous cell lines including leukemias P388 and L1210 , colon <nUm> and lewis lung carcinomas , B16 melanoma , solid and fluid ehrlich ascites tumours and several human colon and lung carcinomas transplanted into athymic mice . titanocene dichloride I has been the most widely studied metallocene and the drug is currently in phase II clinical trials . formation of metallocene - DNA complexes has been implicated in the mechanism of antitumour properties of the metallocenes , as both titanocene dichloride <nUm> and vanadocene dichloride <nUm> inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis , and titanium and vanadium accumulate in nucleic acid - rich regions of tumour cells . however , in contrast to the well characterized platinum - based anticancer drugs , the active species responsible for antitumour activity in vivo has not been identified and the mechanism whereby irreparable DNA damage and / or structural modification of DNA or other cellular targets occurs is poorly understood . this review will focus on recent studies that have been carried out in order to identify the biologically active species and more fully understand the molecular level mechanism of action of the metallocene dihalides . studies with nucleotides , oligonucleotides , DNA and proteins including topoisomerases , protein kinase C and transferrin have provided important insight into potential cellular transport mechanisms and the interaction of metallocenes with biomolecular targets . new structure activity studies including the design of hydrolytically stable metallocenes and the preparation of highly water soluble amino acid analogues have not led to improved anticancer activity of titanocene dichloride <nUm> . the vastly different chemical and hydrolytic stability of each of the metallocenes points to a unique mechanism of action of each metallocene in vivo .

TCQ - promoted reductive elimination of arylzirconate [ LiCp2ZrAr(RC = CR ) ] , which was prepared by the reaction of zirconocene - alkyne complexes with aryllithium compounds , afforded trisubstituted alkenylzirconocenes . this reaction can afford multi-substituted olefins with high stereoselectivity . 
stereoselective ring transformation of 2-vinylheterocycles to vinylcarbocycles was efficiently carried out by the use of a zirconocene equivalent ( " Cp2Zr " ) . the transformation proceeded through an intramolecular allylation of z-allylic zirconocene species to the epoxide or aziridine ring . 
zirconium - mediated synthetic methods of a series of heterocyclic compounds were reviewed . discussion was focused on the reactions including the other metals , such as Cu , Ni , Li , and so on . these enable us to synthesize a series of heterocycles having N , O , Si , S , Sn , etc. in the ring skeletons . the key point of the reaction is transmetalation from Zr to the other employed metals , which have a crucial role for reactivity and selectivity of the reaction . 
the phenyl sulfide bridged zirconocene complex [ ( C5H 5)Cl2ZrC5H4CH2(C 6H4-p)]2S has been synthesized by treating the dilithium salts of the phenyl sulfide bridged cyclopentadienyl ligand with two equivalents of C5H5ZrCl3(DME) and characterized by 1HMNR and elemental analysis . homogenous ethylene polymerization by this complex has been conducted systematically in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the influence of the molar ratio [MAO] / [Cat] , the catalyst concentration , time and temperature have been studied in detail . the highest catalytic activity of <nUm> is up to <nUm> × <nUm> g PE / mol*Cat*h . higher temperature is favorable for increasing the catalytic activity for <nUm> . high temperature gel permeation chromatography ( HT - GPC ) proves the production of polyethylene with a broad molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) , which is reached <nUm> . 
the thioether bridged zirconocene complex [ ( C5H 5)Cl2ZrC5H4CH2CH 2]2S has been synthesized by treating the dilithium salts of the thioether bridged cyclopentadienyl ligand with two equivalents of C 5H5ZrCl3(DME) and characterized by 1HMNR and elemental analysis . homogenous ethylene polymerization by this complex has been conducted systematically in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the influence of the molar ratio [MAO] / [Cat] , the catalyst concentration , time and temperature have been studied in detail . the catalytic activity of <nUm> is <nUm> × <nUm> g PE / mol*Cat*h . higher temperature is favorable for increasing the catalytic activity for <nUm> . A high concentration of the catalysts drops the catalytic activity as well as the molecular weight of polyethylene for the complex . high temperature gel permeation chromatography ( HT - GPC ) proves the production of polyethylene with a broad molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) . 
this work describes the synthesis and characterization of new organometallic species , an unprecedented mononuclear zirconium complex bearing a tetraalkylated s-indacene ligand , and secondly , its respective dicarbonyl complex obtained by reduction with Mg / Cl2Hg . theoretical calculations of these two compounds were carried out to gain further understanding of these novel molecular systems . 
systems including diphenylzinc , metallocene , and methylaluminoxane , at various combinations has been attempted , as initiating systems for homo- and copolymerization of styrene and various styrene related comonomers including : substituted styrenes , styrene derivatives , a-olefins , dienes and more recently cycohexenes including norbornene . the used metallocenes were those containing titanium , zirconium and for comparatives reasons hafnium . the metallocene efficiency towards syndiotactic polystyrene polymerization showed the order : titanocene > zirconocene > hafnocene . while the polymerization as well the copolymerization of styrene with related to styrene compounds resulted to be much influenced by both electrical and steric hindrance effect . for styrene substituted derivative those group or element having I+ inductive effect depending its position at styrene 's its phenyl ring favours homopolymerization as well their copolymerization with styrene . the steric hindrance also showed a determinant influence on reactivity , so methyl and tert-butyl group , having a I+ effect , when at para-position improve activity and stereoregularity of their polymerization processes . but when placing at orto - position showed a very low capacity to polymerize . the present and previous results indicate that polymerization processes are initiated by monomer coordination to active metal species either of the binary metallocene - MAO or of the ternary Ph2Zn-metallocene-MAO . 
the two different kinds of impregnation ( in situ and ex situ ) were used in the heterogeneous copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene for production of LLDPE / silica composite . for the ex situ impregnation , MMAO cocatalyst was immobilized firmly onto the silica support through washing and drying step before introducing the powder of MMAO / silica support into the copolymerization system . for the in situ impregnation , MMAO was only contacted with silica support for the short period of time before bringing all of the slurry of MMAO / silica support into the copolymerization system . by comparing the catalytic activity between two methods , it was found that the in situ impregnation provided the higher one beneficial from the lower interaction between MMAO and silica due to lower contacting time . the lower interaction enhanced the reactivity of MMAO toward zirconocene catalyst during activation process thus leading to the higher catalytic activity . the said interaction can be proven by thermal gravimetric analysis ( TGA ) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) analysis . In addition , the obtained polymers were further characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , 13C - NMR spectroscopy ( NMR ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) . 
different mesoporous titanias synthesized by hydrolysis and polycondensation reactions of tetrabutyl titanate with various hydrolysis ratios ( H 2O / Ti by mole ) were employed as supports for zirconocene / MAO catalysts in ethylene / 1-olefin copolymerization . the pure anatase phase of titania was detected by x-ray diffraction ( XRD ) and the morphology was seen by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . the titania obtained was then impregnated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . the amounts of [Al]MAO were measured by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy ( EDX ) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) . the copolymerization of ethylene / 1-hexene ( EH ) and ethylene / 1-octene ( EO ) was performed using titania - supported zirconocene / MAO catalysts . upon polymerization , it was found that the high surface area of titania apparently exhibited high polymerization activity due to large amounts of [Al]MAO present as seen by EDX and XPS . the obtained copolymer was further characterized by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance ( 13C NMR ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) . it revealed that based on 13C NMR , the random copolymer was obtained for both EH and EO systems . however , EH copolymer exhibited higher melting temperature ( T m ) than EO copolymer indicating that the EH system had less comonomer incorporation . 
Nano-TiO2 and its modification with gallium ( nano-TiO2-Ga ) and zirconium ( nano-TiO2-Zr ) were used here as nanofillers in production of linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) . the nanoparticles were immobilized by modified-methyl aluminoxane ( MMAO ) to be a catalytic filler prior to introducing into the in situ polymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene using zirconocene catalyst , and consequently produced LLDPE / O2Ti nanocomposites . it was found that the modified nano-TiO2 by Ga and Zr can hold more amount of MMAO on the surface than the unmodified one . this is because the modified particles have a stronger interaction between MMAO and the surface , as observed by thermal gravimetric analysis ( TGA ) . however , the stronger interaction leads to lower catalytic activities for the polymerization systems . observing from the molecular weight distribution ( MWD ) of the resulting products , it was found that the modified nano-TiO2 with Ga can produce the LLDPE / O2Ti nanocomposites with bimodal MWD . this result was due to the heterogeneity of the surface after modification , which can generate the multiple active sites for the catalyst , leading to multimodal properties of the polymer . 


coulson ( ZINDO ) , mulliken ( MP2 / 6-31G* ) and natural ( MP2 / 6-31G* ) population analyses of several large molecules were performed by the fragment reassociation ( FR ) method . the agreement between the conventional ZINDO ( or conventional MP2 ) and FR - ZINDO ( or FR - MP2 ) charges of these molecules was excellent . the standard deviations of the FR - ZINDO net atomic charges from the conventional ZINDO net atomic charges were <nUm> for C5H11 ( <nUm> atoms ) , <nUm> for NH2-C16O2H28-COOH ( <nUm> atoms ) , <nUm> for NH3+-C16O2H28-COOH ( <nUm> atoms ) , <nUm> for NH2-C16O2H28-COO- ( <nUm> atoms ) , <nUm> for NH3+-C16O2H28- COO- ( <nUm> atoms ) , <nUm> for a conjugated model ( O = CH - ( CH = CH)15-C = O-(CH = CH)12-CH = CH2 ) , <nUm> atoms ) , <nUm> for aglycoristocetin ( C60N7O19H52+ , <nUm> atoms ) , <nUm> for a polypropylene model complexed with a zirconocene catalyst ( C68H121Zr+ , <nUm> atoms ) and <nUm> for magainin ( C112H177N29O28S , <nUm> atoms ) , respectively . the standard deviations of the FR - MP2 mulliken ( or natural ) partial atomic charges from the conventional ones were <nUm> ( or <nUm> ) for C5H11 , <nUm> ( or <nUm> ) for NH2-C16O2H28-COOH and <nUm> ( or <nUm> ) for NH3+-C16O2H28- COO- , respectively . these errors were attributed to the shape of molecules , the choice of fragments and the degree of ionic characters of molecules as well as the choice of methods . the CPU time of aglycoristocetin , conjugated model , polypropylene model complexed with zirconocene and magainin computed by the FR - ZINDO method was respectively <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> times faster than that by the normal ZINDO method . the CPU time of NH2-C16O2H28-COOH and NH3+-C16O2H28- COO- computed by the FR - MP2 method was , respectively , <nUm> and <nUm> times faster than that by the normal MP2 method . the largest molecule calculated by the FR - ZINDO method was B-DNA ( <nUm> atoms ) . these results will enable us to compute atomic charges of huge molecules near future .

isospecific propylene polymerization behavior of meta-and para-Lewis base ( e ) functionalized unbridged zirconocenes ( [ 1-(En-Ph)-3,4-Me2C 5H2]2ZrCl2 , e = NMe2 , OMe ; n = <nUm> or <nUm> ) was investigated under bulk conditions . catalytic activity of the zirconocenes , and molecular weight and isotacticity of polypropylenes are found to be dependent on the position and number of the lewis base functional groups in the zirconocenes . all the crude polypropylenes possess a broad molecular weight distribution and multi-melting transitions , indicating an involvement of multi-catalytic active species in the polymerization . the highest [mmmm] value of an isotactic portion of the polypropylenes reached <nUm> % , which is higher than that ( <nUm> % ) from the wellknown C2 - symmetric EBIZr ( rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) catalyst . these results support that the in situ generated , rigid rac - like cation - anion pair through the lewis acid - base interactions between the functional groups of zirconocenes and methylaluminoxane anion is effective in the formation of isotactic polypropylene under bulk propylene polymerization conditions . 
alkenylzirconium compounds react with various organic halides in the presence of a palladium or nickel catalyst to give the corresponding cross-coupling products in high yields with high selectivities . carbometallation of alkynes using alkylaluminums such as trimethylaluminum is catalyzed by zirconocene dichloride . the triisobutylaluminum / zirconocene dichloride system induces hydrometallation and subsequent carbometallation of enynes to afford exocyclic olefins . addition of <nUm> equiv. of n-butyllithium to zirconocene dichloride convenient ly produces a zirconocene equivalent . i.e. , “ Cp2Zr ” , which can induce bicyclization of enynes or diynes . reac tions of alkenes and alkynes with the zirconocene give zirconocene - alkene and - alkyne complexes.respectively . whose structures have been determined by x-ray studies . novel <nUm> - migration reactions on zirconium or other metals are also discussed .

recent study in this laboratory is reviewed . combination of group <nUm> metallocene dichloride ( Cp2MCl2 : m = Zr , Hf ) and silver salt ( AgX : x = ClO4 , OTf etc. ) is a particularly effective reagent for activating glycosyl fluoride , which offers a new and efficient method for o-glycoside synthesis , which made us to succeed in the first total synthesis of mycinamicin macrolide antibiotics . mechanistic consideration of this activation led us to find that the reagent combination in <nUm> : 2-ratio , rather than the original <nUm> : 1-ratio , of Cp2MCl2 and AgX engendered further enhanced reactivity . some of the recent application in oligosaccharide synthesis is listed to show the broad scope of this new glycosidation reaction in natural product synthesis . furthermore , this combinational reagent offers a powerful basis for aryl c-glycoside synthesis and the total syntheses of three prototypical compounds of this class , vineomycinone B2 methyl ester and gilvocarcin m and V , were successfully carried out by this glycoside activation method . 
zirconium - mediated carbon-carbon bond forming reactions have been extensively developed for the last decade . an allylic zirconium species and related organozirconium species can be prepared from the reaction of allylic ethers with zirconocene equivalent “ Cp2Zr ” through b-alkoxide elimination under mild conditions . this methodology is applicable to the ring contraction reaction of vinyl sugar and vinyl morpholine derivatives to give enantiomerically pure polyfunctionalized carbocycles and pyrrolidines with high diastereoselectivity , respectively . the origin of high diastereoselectivity in these transformations was deduced by isolating the nine - membered cyclic intermediate possessing (Z)-allylic zirconium species . useful applications of this zirconium - mediated ring contraction reaction to syntheses of bioactive compounds are also described . it is also discussed that the diastereoselectivity of the zirconium - mediated coupling reaction of a chiral imine with unsaturated compounds is highly dependent on the generating temperature of zirconacycles . 
A series of group IV metallocene complexes such as titanocenes , zirconocenes and hafnocenes possessing ansa - chain are discussed as regio- and stereoselective catalysts for polymerization of propylene or styrene . isotactic and syndiotactic polypropylenes are produced via primary cis-addition by the catalytic use of C2- and Cs - symmetric zirconocenes , respectively . significantly , syndiotactic polystyrene is produced , in contrast , via secondary cis-addition even by using C1 - symmetric titanocenes . the reaction mechanism of those polymerizations , the structure of catalytic species and the significant role of methylalumoxane ( MAO ) are also discussed . 
it is generally known that small cyclic alkynes such as cyclopentyne is extremely reactive and unstable . therefore it has been believed impossible to isolate cyclopentyne compounds . we recently reported that low - valent group <nUm> metallocenes reacted with 1,2,3-butatrienes to give 1-metallacyclopent-3-yne complexes and that resulted compounds are surprisingly stable and isolable . we succeeded in determination of their molecular structures by x-ray diffraction analyses , and showed that these are five - membered cyclic alkynes , while p,p-interaction of butatriene was also suggested . In this review , the preparation , structure and reactivity of these 1-metallacyclopent-3-yne compounds are described . the l-zirconacyclopent-3-yne complexes reacted with another ' zirconocene ' to form bimetallic complexes in which the cyclic alkyne coordinated to the other zirconocene moiety , indicating that the zirconacyclopentyne behaved as an alkyne . seven - membered cyclic alkynes were also prepared from 1,2,3-butatriene and a zirconocene - alkyne compound . protonolysis and subsequent nucleophilic attack to aldehyde gave allenyl or dienyl alcohol depending on proton source . 
In this review , the results of studies on new methodology for bond activation by using transition metal complexes are described , in order to realize the expeditious and selective synthesis of organic compounds . carbon-carbon bond formation reactions , accompanying with cleavage of unactivated bonds such as carbon-carbon , carbon-boron , and carbon-silicon bonds , are reported . this review involves , for examples , the new synthetic methodology to introduce both cyano and ester groups ( cyanoesterification ) via the C-C bond activation , regio- and stereoselective synthesis multi-substituted olefins mediated a zirconocene complex via the C-B bond activation , and cross-coupling reaction of alkynylsilanes activated by a copper salt via the C-Si bond cleavage . each reaction can be applicable to synthesis of functional molecules such as opto - electronic materials , an anti-cancer agent , and liquid crystalline compounds . 
In this paper , the efficient methodology for the synthesis of multi-substituted olefins by using zirconocene complexes is described . the key step is regioselective formation of zirconacyclopen-tenes from alkynylboron and alkynylsilane compounds . the subsequent negishi and suzuki - miyaura coupling reactions of C-B and C-Zr bonds give rise to multi-substituted olefins . the developed reaction can be applicable to the synthesis of various functional molecules , for example , an anti-cancer agent . In addition , the mechanism for a regioselective formation of zirconacyclopentenes is analyzed by reactions of alkynylboronates and a zirconocene ( II ) complex . As a result , it is disclosed that an electrostatic interaction effected the regioselective formation of zirconacyclopen-tenes . the synthesis of various unprecedented tri- and tetra-alkylated olefins using b-hydrogencontaining alkyl electrophiles and alkylzinc reagents as coupling partners in regio- and stereocontrolled manners is also described . 
it is well known that the mechanical properties of highly isotactic polypropene depend on the crystalline structure of the material . up to now , the polymer properties were modified by varying either the processing conditions - e.g. , extrusion , annealing etc. - or the composition - e.g. , blending , nucleation . highly active ethylene bridged C1 - symmetric zirconocene catalysts can be used to design the material properties by varying the crystallinity of thermoplastic ( elastic ) polypropenes . with the new unsymmetric catalyst rac-dichloro[1-(9-fluorenyl)-2-(R , s)-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methylinden-1-e5-yl)ethane]zirconium ( IV ) / MAO ( 1 ) polypropenes of variable isotacticities are accessible . the variable and thus defined use of two different sides of the catalytically active species allows the placement of single , cumulated and consecutive [rr] - triads within an isotactic polymer chain . the formation of these stereoerrors is adjusted in an arbitrary manner by the polymerization conditions temperature and monomer concentration . the mechanical properties of polypropenes produced with <nUm> / MAO vary from tough thermoplastic to excellent elastic . stress - strain behavior of these physically crosslinked elastomers can be designed similar to the ones of polyisoprene or partly crosslinked natural rubber . 

In the presence of <nUm> mol % zirconocene bis(perfluorooctanesulfonate)s , indoles reacted with aldehyde / ketone at room temperature in tetrahydrofuran for <nUm> ∼ <nUm> min to give diindolylmethane derivatives in <nUm> % ∼ <nUm> % yields . the catalyst zirconocene bis(perfluorooctanesulfonate)s can be reused <nUm> times , and the conversion rate is still as high as <nUm> % . this reaction does not require strict anhydrous conditions . this procedure provides a new and efficient way for preparing diindolylmethane derivatives . 




the catalytic behavior of the highly isospecific catalyst rac-Me2Si(2-Me,4-PhInd)2ZrCl2 immobilized on the surface of a polymer support , PE with grafted poly(acrylic acid ) that was preliminarily treated by poly(methylaluminoxane) , was studied . the immobilized catalyst was activated by triisobutylaluminum . the molecular masses , melting temperatures , and isotacticity of the produced PP were examined . it was shown that the modification of the catalyst by the boron salt Me2NHPhB(C6F5)4 leads to a change in the kinetics of polymerization and in the isotacticity of the resulting PP . factors affecting the rate and stability of the catalytic behavior of the studied supported catalysts such as the content of immobilized zirconocene , the concentration of triisobutylaluminum , and the reaction temperature were analyzed . it was demonstrated that the catalyst is not washed out from the support surface in the course of polymerization and that PP is produced in the form of granules with a bulk density of <nUm> - <nUm> g / cm3 . 
the influence of the activation procedure applied to a metallocene on its catalytic behavior in ethylene polymerization is discussed and the effect of the zirconocene / activator nature on the properties of PE is demonstrated . MAO and TIBA / CPh <nUm> B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> are intercompared as cocatalysts . the catalytic behavior and the kinetics of ethylene polymerization catalyzed by TIBA / CPh <nUm> B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> - activated metallocene complexes allowed to infer that , in ternary catalytic systems with dichloride precatalysts , TIBA acts not only as an impurity scavenger or simply an alkylating agent , but also as a cocatalyst giving rise to heteronuclear cationic species providing lower chain propagation and chain transfer rates than those generated upon MAO action . when activated with TIBA / CPh <nUm> B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> dichloride zirconocenes were moderately active as compared with MAO and yielded EsP of considerably higher m . A halide or alkyl ligand present in the outer coordination sphere of active sites affects considerably both the catalytic performance of active species and the properties of the resulting PE . the Cl - keeping Al - Zr heteronuclear active sites give rise to high-M linear PE ; alkyl holders are highly capable of chain propagation and chain transfer to monomer . the high reactivity of the Zr - Cl bond in the latter active sites manifests itself also in the high ability to incorporate alfa - olefins to yield PE chains containing branches with <nUm> - <nUm> incorporated ethylene units . 
propylene / ethylene copolymers were prepared over two complex catalyst systems : ( i ) an AlEt3 - activated Cl2Mg - supported titanium catalyst Cl4Ti / Cl2Mg with dibutyl phthalate and propyltrimethoxysilane used as respectively internal and external donors and ( ii ) two methylaluminoxane (MAO)-activated , unsupported zirconocene catalyst systems differing in indenyl ligand structure , viz. , Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 and [Me2Si(4-Ph-2-Et-Ind)2]ZrCl2 ( rac : meso = <nUm> : <nUm> ) . the olefins were copolymerized ( table <nUm> ) in liquid propylene at <nUm> - <nUm> ° C at constant ethylene overpressures ( above C3 pressure ) varying over <nUm> to <nUm> atm corresponding to ethylene concentrations of <nUm> to <nUm> mol / L in the liquid phase . the copolymers contained 1.6-18 % of C2 mers . catalyst activity ( fig. <nUm> ) and kinetics of copolymerization ( fig. <nUm> ) were studied and the microstructure , molecular weight characteristics ( table <nUm> ) and mechanical properties ( tables <nUm> , <nUm> ) of the resulting copolymers were determined . IR spectra ( recorded , not included ) are discussed . the comonomer reactivity coefficients were evaluated for the copolymerizations run over the three catalytic systems . 
treatment of the diazametallacycle Cp2Zr(N(t-Bu)C = N(SiMe3)N(SiMe3) ) ( 4a ) with diphenylacetylene resulted in the formation of the azametallacyclobutene Cp2Zr(N(t-Bu)C(Ph) = C(Ph) ) ( 6a ) and Me3SiN = C = NSiMe3 in high yield . A kinetic study using UV - vis spectroscopy was carried out on the transformation . saturation kinetic behavior was observed for the system , which is supportive of a mechanism that involves a reversible formal [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] retrocycloaddition of 4a to generate the transient imido species Cp2Zr = N-t-Bu ( 7a ) and Me3SiN = C = NSiMe3 . trapping 7a with diphenylacetylene in an overall [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] cycloaddition reaction affords zirconacycle 6a . the study of cycloreversion / cycloaddition reactions between diazametallacycle complexes and diphenylacetylene was extended to other zirconocene systems . detailed kinetic studies were performed for the exchange reactions between the diazametallacycle complexes Cp2Zr(N(2,6-Me2Ph)C = N(SiMe3)N ( SiMe3 ) ) ( 8a ) and Cp2Zr(N(2,6-Me2Ph) C = N(t-Bu)N(t-Bu) ) ( 8b ) with diphenylacetylene ( 5a ) to give the corresponding azametallacyclobutene complex Cp2Zr(N(2,6-Me2Ph)C(Ph) = C(Ph) ) ( 6c ) and extruded carbodiimides ( Me3SiN = C = NSiMe3 for 8a and (t-Bu)N = C = N(t-Bu) for 8b ) . for both systems , the reactions were found to be first order in metallacycle and zero order in alkyne . treatment of the diazametallacycle complexes Cp2Zr(N(2,6-ii-Pr2Ph)C = N(Cyc)N(Cyc) ) ( 9a ) and Cp2Zr(N(2,6-i-Pr2Ph)C = N(i-Pr2) N(i-Pr2) ) ( 9b ) with alkyne 5a resulted in the formation of the six - membered zirconacylces 10a,b , respectively , upon heating at <nUm> ° C . the products 10a,b are generated from the overall insertion of alkyne 5a into the nitrogen-carbon bond of the zirconium - containing diazacyclobutane . complex 10a has been characterized by an x-ray crystallographic study . when the azacyclobutene Cp2Zr(N(2,6-i-Pr2Ph)C(Ph)) ( 6e ) was treated with CycN = C = NCyc or (i-Pr)N = C = N(i-Pr) , the same six - membered zirconacycle complexes 10a,b were obtained . kinetic analysis of the reaction of 6e and (i-Pr)N = C = N(i-Pr) to yield 10b supports an associative process wherein alkyne 5a directly inserts into the zirconium-carbon bond of 6e . the diazametallacycle complex 4a underwent a stoichiometric metathetical exchange with symmetrical carbodiimides RN = C = NR ( r = p = tol , m-Tok , i-Pr , cyc ) to generate new cyclic zirconocene complexes and Me3SiN = C = NSiMe3 . kinetic studies were carried out on the exchange reaction between 4a and (m-Tol)N = C = N(m-Tol) to form 4e and Me3SiN = C = NSiMe3 . the experimental rate data obtained are consistent with a dissociative mechanism . additionally , the saturation rate constant derived for this system from the data is the same ( within experimental error ) as the saturation rate constant obtained from the kinetic study of 4a and diphenylacetylene to form 6a and Me3SiN = C = NSiMe3 . these findings provide additional support for a dissociative mechanistic pathway in the exchange reactions , since the rate constant in the formal [ <nUm> + <nUm> ] retrocycloaddition reaction to generate imidozirconocene species Cp2Zr = N-t-Bu ( 7a ) and Me3SiN = C-NSiMe3 should be the same for both reactions . 
the polymerization of ethylene using supported zirconocene catalysts with varying support compositions SiO2-MAO-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 + TIBA ( catalyst I ) and MgCl2-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 + TIBA ( catalyst II ) ( MAO is methylaluminoxane , ind is indenyl , and TIBA is triisobutylaluminum ) was studied . the examined catalytic systems differ in their activity , ability to control the molecular mass of the resulting polymer , and kinetics of copolymerization with 1-hexene . the molecular structure of PE prepared with supported catalysts I and II and a homogeneous catalyst Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 + MAO was studied by IR and 13C NMR spectroscopy . As evidenced by 13C NMR spectroscopy , PE samples synthesized with the homogeneous catalyst and catalyst I contain ethyl branches along with the end methyl groups in the low-molecular-mass fractions . on the contrary , PE prepared with supported catalyst II is devoid of ethyl branches but contains vinyl groups as the basic type of unsaturation . 
aryl enolsilanes and 2-silyloxy-1,3-dienes react with zirconocene to give alkenylzirconium , and novel 1-methylene-2-propenylzirconium compounds which can be used as 2-dienylation reagents . thus , one - pot coupling of 4-phenyl-1,3-butadienyl-2-zirconocene ( 2d ) with a range of electrophiles including aryl , alkynyl , allyl halides , bromine , iodine and a michael acceptor occurs regioselectively at the C-2 position in the presence of Pd or Cu catalysts . 
the asymmetric ansa - ligand precursors (C5Me4H)SiMe2(C5H4R) ( r = H ( 1 ) , me ( 2 ) , SiMe3 ( 3 ) , < Pr ( 4 ) ) and their lithium derivatives [Me2Si(C5Me4)(C5H3R)]Li2 ( r = H ( 5 ) , me ( 6 ) , SiMe3 . , ( 7 ) , ' Pr ( 8 ) ) have been prepared . the cmsa - niobocene imido complexes [ Me2Si( ? / 5-C5Me4)( ? ; 5.C5H3R)]Nb( = N'Bu)Cl ( r = H ( 9 ) , me ( 10 ) , SiMe3 ( 11 ) , ' Pr ( 12 ) ) were synthesized by the reaction of nb( = N'Bu)Cl3(py)2 with [Me2Si(C5Me4)(C5H3R)]Li2 in THF . the tmsa-zirconocene complexes [ Me2SiO;5-C5Me4)0 / 5-C5H3R)]ZrCl2 ( r = H ( 13 ) , me ( 14 ) , SiMe3 ( 15 ) , ' Pr ( 16 ) ) were prepared by the reaction of ZrCLj and the corresponding lithiated cmsa - derivative . the molecular structures of <nUm> , and <nUm> were determined by single - crystal x-ray diffraction studies . preliminary results for the catalytic activity of 13-16 in the polymerization of ethylene are reported . 
the activity and stability of zirconocene catalysts immobilized on magnesium chloride modified with an organoaluminum compound AlR3 ( r = me or et ) were studied in the polymerization of ethylene ( tables <nUm> , <nUm> ) . an original method was used to introduce a lewis internal base into the magnesium support . trace amounts of water present in magnesium chloride were assumed to react with the organoaluminum compound to produce on the surface of the chloride an alkylaluminoxane [R2AlOAlR2] with the basic centers functioning as a lewis internal base . the resulting support was used to immobilize a zirconocene compound which , when activated with MAO , became a very active complex catalyzing the polymerization of ethylene at a constant rate ( <nUm> kg PE / g Zr · h ) . catalytically active centers were found to occur in the solvent solution only ( and not on the solid support surface ) at a concentration found to be nearly equal to that of water in the magnesium chloride . the ethylene polymerization kinetics studied with two catalysts systems prepared and the physical and mechanical property data measured for the resulting PE ( table <nUm> ) allowed to infer the highly stable zirconocene homogeneous catalyst system to have magnesium atom incorporated into the following structure [ ClMgOAlR2 / Cp2ZrCl2 ] . the modifier AlR3 was found to affect the physical and mechanical properties of the resuiting PE ( table <nUm> ) . 
the syntheses of a series of 1-methyl-3-aryl-substituted titanocene and zirconocene dichrorides are reported . these complexes are synthesized by the reaction of 2- and 3-methyl-6 , 6-dimethylfulvenes ( <nUm> : <nUm> ) with aryllithium , followed by the reaction with TiCl4*2THF , Cl4Zr and (CpTiCl2)2O respectively , to give complexes <nUm> - <nUm> . the complex [ e5-1-methyl-3-(a , a-dimethylbenzyl)cyclopentadienyl]titanium dichloride has been studied by x-ray diffraction . the red crystal of this complex is monoclinic , space group P21 / C with unit cell parameters : a = <nUm> × 10-1 nm , b = <nUm> × 10-1 nm , c = <nUm> × 10-1 nm , α = β = γ = <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> × 10-3 nm3 and z = <nUm> . refinement for <nUm> observed reflections gives the final r of <nUm> . there are four independent molecules per unit cell . 
two supported zirconocene catalysts were prepared : ( I ) O2Si / MAO / Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( <nUm> wt. % Zr , <nUm> wt. % Al ) and ( II ) Cl2Mg / Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( <nUm> wt. % Zr , <nUm> wt. % Al ) . ethylene was homopolymerized and copolymerized with 1-hexene ( <nUm> - <nUm> ° C , <nUm> bar , TIBA as cocatalyst ) over ( I ) and ( II ) . catalyst ( I ) incorporated the comonomer as much as did the homogeneous catalyst of the same composition . Cl2Mg used as support resulted in reduced copolymerization reactivity of the catalyst . copolymer crystallinity and catalyst activity were studied in relation to the concentration of 1-hexene . 
ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization over the O2Si - supported zirconocene / MMAO catalysts was investigated . the silica support was modified by different batches of <nUm> and <nUm> wt % Ga . it was found that Ga was well - dispersed all over the silica granules which can not be detected by XRD . based on the EDX measurement , it was revealed that Ga - modification increased the adsorption ability of MMAO on the silica support after impregnation . thus , Ga - modification showed a promising way to enhance the rate of ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization . based on TGA study , lower interactions between MMAO and support caused by Ga - modification was another reason for increase in catalytic activity . moreover , the Ga - modification increased lewis acid centres or active species on the catalytic system . In addition , a comparative study of polymerization was also conducted with in situ and ex situ impregnation methods . it was found that the in situ impregnation method of the MMAO onto silica exhibited remarkable ( almost <nUm> times ) activity compared to ex situ method which is attributed to lower deactivation effect of the catalyst . 13C NMR analysis , however , indicated that only random copolymers were produced in all systems . these results could be related to the high degree of 1-octene insertion and thus amorphous copolymers were produced in all systems . 
the temperature - programmed desorption ( TPD ) technique was used to study , by mass spectrometry ( MS ) , the desorbates released from O2Si - supported MAO ( I ) and O2Si - supported Cp2ZrCl2 ( II ) surfaces . with II , cp groups were found to be copiously released at temperatures exceeding <nUm> ° C . hence , decomposition of Cp2ZrCl2 while the compound is being heterogenized , can not explain the low activity of the catalyst II in which Cp2ZrCl2 is chemically bonded to the carrier surface through OH groups . the MS ( intensity vs. temperature ) curves recorded for the I desorbates exhibit maxima ( fig. <nUm> ) for m / z = <nUm> - <nUm> at about <nUm> ° C and <nUm> ° C . they represent the methyl groups liberated on thermal destruction of = Al-C- bonds in respectively AlO(Me)2 and AlO2Me . At about <nUm> ° C , the MAO oligomer molecules were fragmented to produce AlOMe ( m / z = <nUm> ) , Al2O ( m / z = <nUm> ) , AlOMe2 ( m / z = <nUm> ) , AlO2Me ( m / z = <nUm> ) , AlO rings ( m / z = <nUm> ) , and (Al3O3)-O- rings ( m / z = <nUm> ) . alternating adsorption ( up to <nUm> times ) of AlMe3 vapor followed by H2O vapor on O2Si surface was tried to synthesize O2Si - supported MAO with no " free " AlMe3 . As a result , surface structures of the type ≡ Si-O-(AlMeO)n , ( n = <nUm> ) were produced . the MAO thus synthesized was showed by TPD studies to have a linear or a planar net structure . 
ethylene was sequentially homopolymerized ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> - <nUm> min ) and copolymerized ( <nUm> ° C , <nUm> - <nUm> min ) with 1-hexene or 1-octene over a Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO or a C2H4(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst in toluene as solvent ; a-olefin conversions were <nUm> - <nUm> mol % . the preliminary homopolymerization of ethylene was found to affect only slightly the composition and the MW and MWD property data of the resulting ethylene-hexene ( CEH ) and ethylene-octene ( CEO ) copolymers . HDPE / CEH and HDPE / CEO reactor mixtures ( RM ) were synthesized , containing various proportions of the copolymers ( table <nUm> ) . the RM components were found to cocrystallize during the polymerization process . mechanical property data were determined for pure and for modified HDPE ( table <nUm> ) . with the copolymer endowed with desired properties and introduced into HDPE in an appropriate amount , high - strength and simultaneously high - MFR materials can be prepared . 
the bonding between electron deficient zirconocene complexes such as [(e5-C5Me5)2ZrR]+ and the counterions [(C6F5)3BR]- ( r = CH3 , <nUm> , r = H , <nUm> ) has been investigated by DFT and extended huckel calculations . the molecular bonding analysis has been carried out in the light of the structural information on the inter-ion interactions available for these and other similar electron deficient coordinatively unsaturated zirconocene complexes . it has been shown that the " anion - cation " interactions in <nUm> and <nUm> are different manifestations of the same need to provide electron density to the metal centre . In <nUm> this is achieved via the -C-H s-bonds and has been described as a pseudo-agostic interaction , whereas in <nUm> electron donation occurs via the phenyl F - atoms . the study of the covalent component of the bonding between the ionic components has shown that the weak electron donation , though not sufficient to saturate the metal centre , stabilises the unsaturated species and allows it to have a longer life time . it has been inferred that in the homogenous ziegler - natta catalytic process the approach of a strongly coordinating molecule , such as an olefin in the polymerisation , destroys the weak interaction and allows the reaction to proceed whilst the ion - pairing maintains the counterion in proximity of the complex . 
propylene polymerizations were carried out by using rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( zirconocene catalyst ) and a commercial third generation ziegler - natta catalyst in a semibatch reactor . from the polymerization reactions , the optimum reaction conditions and the physical properties of polymers produced from each catalyst system were investigated . the optimum reaction temperatures of rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and ziegler - natta catalyst were <nUm> ° C , <nUm> ° C , respectively . on the basis of the results for the produced polymer particle size distributions and the catalytic activities of polymerization reaction , the reaction temperature should be considered as an important factor for the successful polymerization reactions . especially , the polymer was conglomerated in the higher reaction temperature . it was found that there was an upper limitation to co-catalyst concentration . reaction rates and polymer yields rather decreased with increasing the concentration of co-catalyst , i.e. , MAO and TEA1 affected only polymerization activities , but the PEEB in ziegler - natta catalyst system affected isotactic indexes of produced polymer as well as activities . based on these observations , the production yield seems to exhibit a first order linear relationship to the partial pressure of monomer . 
the optical absorption spectra of systems including ansa - zirconocenes ( Me2SiCp2ZrCl2 or Me2CCp2ZrCl2 ) and a modified poly(methylaluminoxane) were studied . the alkylation of zirconocenes involves two stages - fast and slow - resulting in the formation of monoalkyl and dialkyl derivatives , respectively with trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) being the main alkylating agent . A bathochromic shift was observed for <nUm> < Al : Zr < <nUm> in the system containing Me2SiCp2ZrCl2 , and for markedly greater component ratios in the systems with Me2SiCp2ZrCl2 . introduction of TMA in the mixture markedly accelerated the alkylation rate and retarded the formation of complexes responsible for the bathochromic shift . A model of the complex structure is proposed and the laws of complex formation in the system studied are discussed . 
A MgCl2(THF)2 support modified by organoaluminum chloride or MAO enabled us to obtain specially active zirconocene catalyst systems for ethylene polymerization . the zirconocene system on the bimetallic support was found to be the more active than that on the monometallic support . two kinds of catalytic active sites were found to exist in the supported zirconocene catalyst : unstable active sites that become deactivated during the polymerization of ethylene , and very stable catalytic centers created in the olefin environment . the kinetic investigations on the ethylene polymerization allowed to suggest the reason underlying the creation of the stable active sites . 
bulk polymerization of propylene was studied over four ansa - zirconocene catalysts , viz. , Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) , Me2Si(4-Ph-2-Et-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) ( rac : meso = <nUm> : <nUm> ) , Ph2C(CpFlu)ZrCl2 ( 3 ) , and Me2C(3-Me-CpFlu)ZrCl2 ( 4 ) , which were characterized by different symmetries ( C1 , C2 , Cs ) . the structure of the metallocene affected the structure of PP . upon reactions with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) , compounds 1-4 produced very active catalytic systems which catalyzed the polymerization to yield various structures of PP . catalysts <nUm> and <nUm> gave isotactic PP , catalyst <nUm> gave syndiotactic PP and catalyst <nUm> gave hemiisotactic PP . Hemiiso-PP was similar in structure to amorphous PP and had no melting point . the catalytic activity of the system and molecular weight and stereospecificity of PP were studied in relation to the mode of preparation of the catalyst . kinetic parameteres were evaluated , viz. , time of insertion of the propylene molecule ( <nUm> - <nUm> s ) and the time of growth of a single PP macromolecule ( 3-6 s ) , and from these data the minimum degree of polymerization was determined . activation energies were evaluated for the polymerization carried out over each catalyst system . young 's modulus , molecular weight and stereoregularity of the PP prepared were determined . 
methylalumination of 1-organylthio-1-alkynes RSC = CR1 ( <nUm> : r = ph , R1 = C5H11 ; <nUm> : r = me , R1 = C10H21 ) with trimethylalane Me3A1 in the presence of zirconocene dichloride Cp2ZrC12 proceeds regio- and stereoselectively and affords 1-organylthio-2-methyl-1-alkenes RSCH = C(Me)R1 ( <nUm> : r = ph , R1 = C5H11 ; <nUm> : r = me , R1 = C10H21 ) in the yields not exceeding <nUm> % . 
rac-[isopropylidenebis(4,5-benzindenyl)] zirconium dichloride / MAO promotes copolymerization of ethylene and styrene to form a random copolymer with a high activity . the random copolymer has head to tail St-St sequences and isotactic stereo - regularity both of the head to tail St-St and alternating Et-St sequences . this catalytic system also promotes homo-polymerization of styrene to form isotactic polystyrene . the steric interaction of the C <nUm> symmetric ligand framework to polymer chain ends and monomer phenyl groups may control isotactic propagation , similarly to the isotactic polymerization of propene reported , with complexes having C <nUm> symmetry . 
the effect of support type on the activity of zirconocene - triisobutylaluminum ( TIBA ) systems was studied in the polymerization of propylene , and on the properties of the resulting PP . three zirconocenes were used : Me2SiInd2ZrX2 ( x = Cl or me ) and Ph2CCpFluZrCl2 ; and three supports were used : ( i ) O2Si ( spec , area ssp , = <nUm> m2 / g ) ; ( ii ) SiO2-gr-PAAc [ i.e. O2Si modified with poly(acrylic acid ) by radiative grafting ] ; ( iii ) PE-gr-PAAc ( i.e. functionalized by radiative grafting , ssp = <nUm> m2 / g ) . propylene was polymerized in , the liquid monomer . the supports were made to react with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and the product was used to immobilize a zirconocene compound to produce a supported catalyst . with TIBA as cocatalyst , the resulting PP constituted a replica of catalyst particles ; the bulk density of PP was high , up to <nUm> g / cm3 . As the Zr content in the catalyst was increased , the specific productivity ( g PP / g catalyst ) rose to attain a maximum , characteristic for a given support . catalyst activity and m of PP were studied in relation to TIBA concentration . the type of MAO - modified support had little effect on the PP properties . modification of the O2Si / MAO / Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 catalyst with a boron compound , CPh3B(C6F5)4 / did not affect PP properties but reduced the activity of the catalyst system at AlTIBAZr > <nUm> . 
[ ( C13 H8)Si(CH3)2(C 5H3 ) ] was prepared with fluorenyl lithium , dimethyldichlorosilane and cyclopentadienylsodium with <nUm> % total yield . furthermore , a Si - bridged fluorenylidene cyclopen-tadienylidene zirconium complex [ (C13H8)Si(CH3)2(C 5H3)]ZrCl2 was synthesized by reaction of [ (C13H8)Si(CH3)2(C5H <nUm> ) ] and Cl4Zn with THF as a solvent under the schlenk system . the reaction gave the target compound in <nUm> % yield . the zirconium complex was characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR . after activated with methylaluminoxane , the metallocene complex showed a high catalytic activity for the ethylene and propylene polymerization reaction under atmosphere pressure . it was found that the title compound has a catalytic activity in the order of <nUm> g / h , and the molecular weight of ethylene-propylene copolymers is about <nUm> . 
A family of zirconocene , yttrocene , and scandocene complexes have been prepared utilizing an easily modified doubly bridged ligand array , ( 1,2-SiMe <nUm> ) <nUm> { η <nUm> -C <nUm> H <nUm> -4-R}{e <nUm> -C <nUm> H-3,5-(CHMe <nUm> ) <nUm> } , developed in our laboratories . variations in ligand array substitution and metal center provide complexes that exhibit a range of stereoselectivities and activities in a-olefin polymerizations . A series of C s -and C <nUm> -symmetric metallocenes have been utilized for the preparation of polypropylene and polypentene under various polymerization conditions . analysis of the resulting polymer microstructures has provided valuable information about the factors that dictate syndiospecificity , as well as common error forming mechanisms for these systems . 
the reduction in THF and oxidation in CCl2H2 of the bent - sandwich complex (e5-Ind)2ZrMe2 ( 1 ) ( ind = C9H7 , indenyl ) were studied by cyclic voltammetry . complex <nUm> in THF undergoes one - electron reduction to radical anion 1._ , which partially decomposes with the liberation of the ind- anion . even at <nUm> ° C the one - electron oxidation leads to the formation of an unstable 15-electron radical cation undergoing fast heterolytic decomposition to the me . radical and (e5-Ind)2ZrMe+ cation , which is the key reaction center in the catalytic polymerization of olefins . comparative analysis of electron - transfer - induced transformations of bent - sandwich dimethyl and dichloride zirconocenes of the general formula L2ZrX2 ( L = e5-Ind , e5-Cp ; x = Cl , me ) was performed . 
A kinetic , active centre , and morphological analysis has been carried out on the polymerization of ethylene and propylene in hydrocarbon , aromatic and chloroaromatic media using selected homogeneous and silica supported metallocene catalysts activated by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . A number of procedures for supporting selected model zirconocene compounds ( biscyclopentadienylzirconium dichloride and ethylenebisindenylzirconium dichloride ) on different types of silica have been investigated . it is established that the overall activities and kinetic behaviour of these supported catalysts are strongly affected by the procedure used for the catalyst preparation . In general supported metallocene catalysts were shown to have lower activities and also lower numbers of propagating active centers than did the corresponding soluble catalyst systems . MAO pretreated silica catalysts were shown by SEM studies to produce polymer with good morphology and the results obtained indicated that silica fragmentation producing microreactor behaviour could be obtained in these polymerizing catalyst systems . 
the oligomerization of ethylene catalyzed by Cp2ZrL2 ( L = Cl , me , OC6H4-p-Me ) / EAO ( ethylaluminoxane ) afforded not only common chain oligomers but also methylenecyclopentane . it is the first example of oligomerization and simultaneous cyclization of ethylene to a cyclic oligomer . the selectivity of methylenecyclopentane , affected by the structure and the concentration of precatalysts , solvents , aging and reaction temperature and some other factors , came up to <nUm> % when a third - component C5H5N was added to the Cp2ZrCl2 / EAO system under optimal conditions . 
this paper describes how benzene derivatives were formed with high selectivity in one - pot from three different alkynes in excellent yields . firstly , a novel method for pair - selective coupling of an alkyne with ethylene forming zirconacyclopentenes was developed ; then , highly selective cross - coupling of two different alkynes forming zirconacyclopentadienes was achieved ; finally , transmetallation of Zr - C bonds to Cu - C bonds in the presence of a third alkyne led to the formation of benzene derivatives of three different alkynes . new evidences were obtained for understanding the reaction mechanism . 
polymerization of 1-hexene or 1-octene under high pressures ( 100-1000 MPa ) was investigated using permethylated ansa - metallocenes / methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) as catalyst systems . besides the known zirconocene complex ( <nUm> , Me2Si(e5-C5Me4) 2ZrCl2 ) , dialkylsilylene- and dimethylgermylene-bridged hafnocene dichlorides , R2E(e5-C5Me4) 2HfCl2 ( <nUm> , r = me , e = Si ; <nUm> , r = et , e = Si ; <nUm> , r = vinyl , e = Si ; <nUm> , r = me , e = Ge ) , were synthesized and structurally characterized . the catalytic activity of the ansa - metallocenes was remarkably enhanced under high pressures despite their very congested structures . poly( 1-hexene ) with unprecedented high molecular weight such as mw = <nUm> × <nUm> ( mw / Mn = <nUm> , by GPC ) was obtained under <nUm> MPa with <nUm> . studies on termination reactions revealed that the bimolecular chain - transfer process ( b-hydrogen transfer to olefin ) is much accelerated under <nUm> MPa in <nUm> , while b-hydrogen elimination to metal is still major termination process in <nUm> . this indicated that two complexes that have same structure but central metals showed quite different high - pressure effects . 
the copolymerization of ethylene(E) and norbornene ( N ) was examined by using various metallocene catalysts and modified - MAO(MMAO) cocatalyst . for C2 - symmetry catalysts such as rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 , Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 , me2 Si(Cp)2ZrCl2 and Cs - symmetrical iPr(FluCp)ZrCl2 as well as CGC and di-bridged zirconocene , the effects of catalyst structure and [N] / [E] feed ratio on catalyst activity , thermal property and [N] content of copolymer ( COC ) was investigated . for rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst of a constant [N] / [E] feed ratio , the appropriate conditions of [Al] / [Zr] mole ratio , polymerization temperature and cocatalyst structure were found to be <nUm> , <nUm> ° C , MMAO cocatalyst , respectively . As [N] / [E] feed ratio increased , the incorporation of norbornene to copolymer increased while the activity of catalyst decreased except for iPr(FluCp)ZrCl2 . with consideration of catalyst activity as well as N content , it was found that rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MMAO system exhibited relatively high activity and controllable tg . monomer reactivity ratio was determined by kelen - tudos method . 
copolymerizations of ethylene and a-olefin with various zirconocene compounds at a high temperature were carried out to study the relationship between the ligand structure of zirconocene compounds and the copolymerization behavior . all of the indenyl-based zirconocene compounds in combination with dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate / triisobutylaluminum produced only low molecular weight copolymers at a high temperature , regardless of the substituents and bridged structures of the zirconocene compounds . however , zirconocene compounds with a fluorenyl ligand gave rise to a significant increase in the activity and molecular weight of the copolymers by the selection of a diphenylmethylene bridge structure even at a high temperature . ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers obtained with the fluorenyl-based catalysts contained inner double bonds accompanied by the generation of hydrogen , presumably because of a C-H bond activation mechanism . the contents of the inner double bonds were significantly influenced by the polymerization conditions , including the 1-hexene feed content , polymerization temperature , and ethylene pressure . 
the phosphonium - bridged ansa - metallocene complexes { [Me2P(C5Me4)2]ZrCl 2}+ and { [Me2P(C5Me4)2]HfCl 2}+ have been prepared by the reactions of {[Me2P(C5Me4)2]Li2}I with Cl4Zr and Cl4Hf , respectively ; the isolation and structural characterization of { [Me2P-(C5Me4)2]ZrCl 2}+ complete a series of isostructural zirconocene derivatives , namely , [R2P(CpR)2-ZrCl2]+ , [R2E(CpR)2ZrCl2] ( e = C , Si , Ge ) , and [R2B(CpR)2ZrCl2]- , which differ according to the charge on the complex . 
reaction of (ClMe2SiC5H4)2ZrCl2 ( 1 ) with K ( Na ) in liquid ammonia / toluene at - <nUm> ° C gave the ansa - zirconocene dihydride

the four new asymmetric ansa - zirconocene dichlorides rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(2-phenyl- 1-e5-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 4c ) , rac-[(9-e5-fluorenyl)(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl) dimethylsilane]zirconium dichloride ( 4d ) , rac-[(9-e5-fluorenyl)(2-methyl-1-e5indenyl) dimethylsilane]zirconium dichloride ( 4e ) , and rac-[(9-e5-fluorenyl)(2-phenyl-1-e5-indenyl) dimethylsilane]zirconium dichloride ( 4f ) have been prepared , and their polymerization behavior was compared to the recently published rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1-e5- indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 4a ) and rac-[1-(9-e5-fluorenyl)-2-(2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl) ethane]zirconium dichloride ( 4b ) . the Si - bridged ligands are easily accessible by the reaction of fluorenyllithium with dimethyldichlorosilane and the subsequent addition of indenyllithium . A similar route using 1-(9-fluorenyl)-2-bromoethane was applied for the synthesis of the ethylene-bridged ligands . the Zr(IV) complexes of all ligands are highly active catalysts for the propene polymerization reaction after activation with MAO . the influence of the bridge and the particular substitution pattern of the indenyl fragments has been studied with respect to monomer concentration and polymerization temperature . the exchange of the ethylene bridge by a dimethylsilane unit results in a strong increase of the molecular weights but also in a decreased polymerization activity deriving from a fast decomposition of the active catalyst species . interestingly , significantly higher polymer molecular weights could be found for the complexes that contain the 5,6-cyclopentyl substituent on the indenyl moiety . all catalysts showed the effect of a declining stereo - selectivity with increasing monomer concentration , leading to the formation of homopolypropene elastomers . the mechanism of stereoerror formation of these C1 - symmetric species was investigated by deuterium labeling studies on the propene monomers and by comparison with C2 - symmetric complexes . 
the primary silane p-TolSiH3 ( p-Tol = p-CH3C6H5 ) can be polymerized to poly(p-tolylsilane) with <nUm> mol % of both the chiral and achiral zirconocenes Cp2ZrCl2 , Cp(CpSi*)ZrCl2 , and (CpSi*)2ZrCl2 ( cp = CH , CpSi* = C5H4Si(CH3)2-(1R)-endo-(+)-OC10H17 ) in combination with <nUm> mol % of n-BuLi . generally , higher molecular weight linear polymers were obtained when using the substituted zirconocenes in comparison to the parent zirconocene , which in turn produced larger quantities of low-molecular-weight cyclic products . each polysilane sample was analyzed by 29Si{1H} DEPT and 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy . deconvolution of selected regions of the 29Si{1H} DEPT and the 1H NMR spectra for higher molecular weight linear polymers indicated that these catenates were predominantly atactic , on the basis of a triad level bernoullian statistical model . the data suggested that , in this case , chiral substitution of the zirconocene rings had no effect on the stereogrowth of the polysilane chain . 
under the conditions originally developed by taber and nugent , a 1,6- or a 1,7-diene will smoothly condense with zirconocene to give the intermediate metallacycle . while these zirconacycles can be isolated and characterized , they usually are carried on directly , by reaction with a suitable electrophile ( e.g. O , or CO ) , to give the organic product . As zirconium is inexpensive , the procedure is operationally simple , and the byproduct zirconium sulfate is nontoxic , intramolecular diene cyclozirconation has become a useful tool for carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring construction . from the inception of this reaction , it was anticipated that the central Zr could serve as a scaffold to direct the formation of two , three or even four new stereogenic carbon centers . subsequent work has shown that the cyclometallations are reversible , and that the reaction can be carried out under either kinetic or thermodynamic control . it is particularly exciting that the semiempirical computational package ZINDO can serve effectively to predict the relative stability of the intermediate diastereomeric zirconacycles . this has allowed ZINDO to be used in a predictive sense , to guide the design of dienes that cyclize with high diastereoselectivity . the use of this approach in conjunction with total syntheses of the natural products elemol , dendrobine , haliclonadiamine and androstenedione is described in this article . 
the organometallic lewis acid BC18F15 adds to the terminal = CH2 group of the (butadiene)-metallocene complexes 5a and 5b to give the ansa - metallocene betaine systems [Me2Si-(C5H4)2]Zr[C 4H6-B(C6F5)3 ] ( 6a ) and [ Me2Si(3-MeC5H3) 2]Zr[C4H6-B(C6F5) <nUm> ] ( 6b ) , respectively , in high yield . both complexes were characterized by x-ray diffraction . they both contain a substituted n3 - allyl ligand F of e configuration , and they show a characteristic ( ortho aryl)-C-F ⋯ Zr interaction that stabilizes the electron - deficient metal center inside the dipolar structure . BC18F15 also adds to one butadiene terminus of (s-cis-n4-C4H6)[Me2C(C 5H4)-(indenyl)]Zr to give a high yield of a single isomer of the respective ansa - metallocene [C4H6-B(C6F5)3] betaine complex <nUm> . the x-ray crystal structure analysis of <nUm> has revealed that in this case a (Z)-n3-allyl-CH2B(C6F5)3 ligand is formed . this precluded the (aryl)C-F ⋯ Zr coordination . instead , the zirconium center in <nUm> forms a stabilizing internal ion pair interaction between the negatively polarized [B] - C(4)H2 methylene group and the positive zirconium center . the analogously structured ansa - metallocene [(Z)-C4H6-B(C6F5)3] betaine complex <nUm> is obtained in high yield from BC18F15 addition to (s-cis-n4-butadiene)[Me2C-(C5H 4)(fluorenyl)]Zr . In solution the complexes <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> exhibit structures that are analogous to those found in the solid state . however , treatment of ( butadiene ) [Me2Si(C5H4)2]-Zr ( 5a ) with BC18F15 under kinetic control ( <nUm> K in toluene-d8 ) quantitatively yields the [Me2Si(C5H4)2]Zr[(Z)-C 4H6-B(C6F5)3 ] betaine isomer <nUm> , which contains the stabilizing [B] - C(4)H2 ⋯ Zr internal ion pair interaction . subsequent thermally induced rearrangement of the kinetic product <nUm> ( DG ‡ rearr(298 K ) = <nUm> ± <nUm> kcal mol-1 ) then results in the formation of the eventually observed thermodynamic ansa - metallocene betaine product 6a , that contains the (E)-C4H6-B(C6F5)3 ligand and exhibits internal (aryl)C-F ⋯ Zr coordination . A similar reaction sequence was observed during the addition of BC18F15 to the parent (butadiene)zirconocene system <nUm> : at <nUm> K the kinetic Cp2Zr[(Z)-(1-3n),kC4-C4H 6-B(C6F5)3 ] betaine product <nUm> is formed , which rapidly rearranges at temperatures above <nUm> K to yield the previously observed stable Cp2Zr[(E)-C4H6-B(C6F 5)3 ] betaine system <nUm> , which is characterized by an internal C-F ⋯ Zr bond . the ansa - metallocene betaines <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> are all active homogeneous single - component ziegler catalysts for ethene and propene polymerization . they are similarly effective as the usually employed ansa - metallocene dichloride / methylalumoxane catalyst systems . 
UV / visible investigations were carried out on the zirconocene activation mechanism in the case of a series of racEt(Ind)2ZrX2 derivatives where x represents ligands of various extractability . two different elementary steps were identified , depending on the amount of added activator . first , a hypsochromic shift of the ligand to metal charge transfer ( LMCT ) band occurred , corresponding to the zirconocene methylation . second , addition of larger quantities of activator ( MAO , B(C6F5)4(-) ) led to a bathochromic shift of the LMCT band to <nUm> nm that expresses the ionization of the zirconocene . 
copolymers of ethene and 1-hexene were catalyzed with (MenC5H5-n)2ZrCl2 / MAO catalytic systems . the copolymers were found to have properties that depend on the number of methyl substituents n but also their relative positions . the presence of comonomer does not influence the termination reactions following insertion of ethene . 
new examples of chiral C2 - symmetric zirconocenes of low stereoselectivity are presented . zirconenes <nUm> and <nUm> , upon activation with methylalumoxane , produce amorphous polypropylenes with acceptable molecular weights at practical polymerization temperatures and mmmm pentad values between <nUm> and <nUm> % . non-bonded interaction analysis by molecular mechanics accounts for the low enantioselectivity of <nUm> and <nUm> , and predicts the isospecificity of the rac-H2C(2-Me-3-iPr-1-Ind)2ZrR+ catalyst . 
metallocene complexes having multiple Si-Br functionalities attached to the ancillary ligands were synthesized by boron - silicon exchange . the obtained functionalized complexes are readily immobilized on dehydrated ( partially dehydroxylated ) silica . 
an unbridged zirconocene complex bis(1,2-diphenylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride [(1,2-Ph2-C5H3)2ZrCl2] <nUm> has been synthesized and structurally characterized . when activated by MAO , <nUm> produces ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene with high melting transition temperature , as well as atactic oligopropylene with average molecular weight of ∼ <nUm> g mol-1 . 
[ cp ° 2ZrCl(PHCy) ] ( <nUm> ; cp ° = ? / 5-C5EtMe4 ) cy = cyclohexyl ) and tCp'2ZrCl{PH(TRIP)} ] ( <nUm> ; cp ' = ? ; 5-C5MeH4,TRIP = 2,4,6-Pri3C6H2 ) readily insert RNCX ( r = ph , x = S , <nUm> ; r = pr1 , x = O ) to give [ cp ° 2ZrCl{ ? / 2-XC(PHCy)NR } ] ( x = S , r = ph ( 3 ) ; x = O , r = ph ( 4 ) ; x = O , r = pr1 ( 5 ) ) and [ Cp'2ZrCl{ ? ; 2-XC{PH(TRIP)}NR } ] ( x = S , r = ph ( 6 ) ; x = O , r = ph ( 7 ) ; x = O , r = pr1 ( 8 ) ) . 3-8 were characterized spectroscopically ( IR , NMR , MS ) , and crystal structure determinations on 4-6 showed an if bonding mode ( X,N ) of the XC(PHR')NR ( r ' = cy , TRIP ) ligands . of the two possible coordination modes of the ligand , <nUm> and <nUm> are obtained exclusively as the endo isomer , in which the NR group is adjacent to the Zr-Cl bond , while for 6-8 , both isomers ( endo and exo ) are formed ( <nUm> : <nUm> ( 6 ) , <nUm> : <nUm> ( 7 ) and <nUm> : <nUm> ( 8 ) ) , whereby the exo isomer is favored . the exo isomer of <nUm> was structurally characterized .

the optical absorption spectra of systems including ansa - zirconocenes ( Me2SiCp2ZrCl2 or Me2CCp2ZrCl2 ) and a modified poly(methylaluminoxane) were studied . the alkylation of zirconocenes involves two stages - fast and slow - resulting in the formation of monoalkyl and dialkyl derivatives , respectively , with trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) being the main alkylating agent . A bathochromic shift was observed for <nUm> < Al / Zr < <nUm> in the system containing Me2SiCp2ZrCl2 , and for markedly greater component ratios in the systems with Me2CCp2ZrCl2 . introduction of TMA in the mixture markedly accelerated the alkylation rate and retarded the formation of complexes responsible for the bathochromic shift . A model of the complex structure is proposed and the laws of complex formation in the system studied are discussed . 
reaction of (C5H4R)2Zr(C ≡ CPh)2 ( r = me , t-Bu ) with vanadocene Cp2V yields the heterodimetallic complexes Cp2V(m-e2:e4-butadiyne)Zr(C 5H4R)2 ( <nUm> , r = t-Bu ; <nUm> , r = me ) . both compounds have been characterized by elemental analysis , raman spectroscopy , and magnetic susceptibility . according to the x-ray structure of Cp2V(m-e2:e4-butadiyne)Zr(C 5H4t-Bu)2 ( 4 ) , the [Cp2V] and [(C5H4t-Bu)2Zr] metallocene moieties are bonded to a butadiene framework through the two internal carbon atoms for [Cp2V] and through the two internal and the two external carbon atoms for [(C5H4t-Bu)2Zr] . the distances and angles observed around the internal carbon atoms of the butadiene framework indicate that both carbons are planar and tetracoordinate . these structural considerations are supported by a topological analysis of the electron localization function ( ELF ) . the existence of the (C5H4R)2Zr(e 4:1,2,3,4-PhC = C = C = CPh ) ( r = H , SiMe3 , t-Bu , me ) zirconacyclocumulene species as a key intermediate in the formation of the ( Cp2V(m-e2:e4-butadiyne)Zr(C 5H4R)2 heterodimetallic compounds is evidenced by NMR studies of either the formation of such zirconacyclocumulene species by addition to (C5H4R)2Zr(C ≡ CPh)2 of a catalytic amount of Cp2V or of the formation of compounds <nUm> or <nUm> by addition of Cp2V to (C5H4R)2Zr(e 4:1,2,3,4-PhC = C = C = CPh ) ( r = t-Bu , me , respectively ; synthesized from dialkynyl zirconocene complexes (C5H4R)2Zr-(C ≡ CPh)2 via hn daylight ) . the x-ray structure of the (C5H4R)2Zr(C ≡ CPh)2 ( r = H ( 6 ) , t-Bu ( 7 ) , SiMe3 ( 8 ) ) dialkynyl zirconocene complexes is also reported . 
studies related to the behavior of different metallocene catalysts for the homopolymerization of 1-octadecene and its copolymerization with ethylene will be presented . the metallocenes : rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 , rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 and Ph2C(Flu)(Cp)ZrCl2 were chosen for the homopolymerization study . they show important differences in catalytic activity at high temperatures ( ≥ <nUm> ° C ) , with rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 showing the highest activity . At lower temperatures ( ≤ <nUm> ° C ) the differences are negligible . for the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-octadecene only the catalysts rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 were studied . the results show that their catalytic activity is just like that for the homopolymerization of 1-octadecene , with higher activity for the metallocene with the et - bridged catalyst . 13C - NMR analysis shows that the composition of the copolymerization products depends on the catalytic systems . copolymers obtained with rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 have greater comonomer incorporation . thermal analysis shows that poly-1-octadecene synthesized with the catalyst rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 is very dependent on the polymerization temperature . the homopolymer obtained at <nUm> ° C presents two endothermal peaks at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> ° C , as compared with the one obtained at <nUm> ° C which presents one wider peak with a maximum at <nUm> ° C . for the catalyst rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 this trend is not observed . the type of metallocene and the reaction time do not significantly change the intrinsic viscosity , but the polymerization temperature changes it drastically , giving higher values at lower temperature . viscosity measurements on the copolymers show that an increase of comonomer concentration in the feed reduces the molecular weight of the copolymer , and it was also found that for homopolymer , the molecular weight is independent of the catalytic systems . 
we systematically assessed the cytotoxic effects of five metallocene dichlorides containing vanadium ( vanadocene dichloride ) , titanium ( titanocene dichloride ) , zirconium ( zircodocene dichloride ) , molybdenum ( molybdocene dichloride ) , and hafnium ( hafnocene dichloride ) as the central metal atom and <nUm> other vanadocene complexes . these compounds were tested against the human testicular cancer cell lines tera-2 and ntera-2 using both 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays and apoptosis assays . notably , only the vanadium(IV) - containing metallocenes exhibited significant cytotoxicity against tera-2 and ntera-2 cells and induced apoptosis within <nUm> h. vanadocenes with dithiocyanate [ VCp2(SCN)2*0.5 H2O ] and diselenocyanate [VCp2(NCSe)2] as ancillary ligands were identified as the most potent cytotoxic compounds . vanadocenes , especially the lead compound VCp2(NCSe)2 , may be useful in the treatment of testicular cancer . 
enantio- and diastereoselective diels - alder reactions between dienophiles <nUm> and cyclopentadiene are catalyzed by a chiral , dicationic complex formed on reaction of the chiral ansa - zirconocene <nUm> ( x = me ) with <nUm> equiv of the strong acid [(Et2O)2H][B(ArF)4] ( <nUm> ; ArF = 3,5-(CF3)2C6H3 ) , in either dichloromethane or 2-nitropropane solvent . the enantioselectivities are higher at lower catalyst loadings , particularly in dichloromethane solution , and spectroscopic studies suggest that this is related to competitive formation of ether - coordinated complexes at relatively low oxazolidinone : catalyst ratios . 
reactions of the branched tetraalkynylsilanes ( RC ≡ C)4Si ( 1a : r = ph , 1b : tBu , 1c : SiMe3 ) with the metallocene source Cp2Ti(e2-Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe3 ) ( 2 ) led to complexes 4-6 , and those of 1a with Cp2Zr(THF)(e2-Me3SiC ≡ CSiMe <nUm> ) ( 3 ) to complex <nUm> . these , via 2-fold migration and C-C coupling of the alkynyl groups , gave a novel type of dinuclear carbon - rich spiro complexes . the conversions proved to be independent of the metals , the substituents r , and the stoichiometries employed . all new complexes have been characterized spectroscopically . additionally , an x-ray crystal structure analysis was performed for <nUm> . 
A versatile zirconocene - coupling route to a family of conjugated polymers containing thiophene-1-oxide and selenophene units is presented . these polymers have lower band gaps than those associated with related thiophene structures . conjugated polymers have a unique chemical , electronic and optical properties . such properties are determined by the polymer structure and by the composition of the polymer backbone . the properties of interest are varied by changing the polymer structure via appropriate synthetic methods . many of the synthetic methods that are employed are based on transition metal - mediated coupling reactions , primarily with palladium and nickel reagents . 
Rac-H2C(3-t-Bu-1-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 2 ) is a novel , easy to synthesize , high performance catalyst for the polymerization of isotactic propylene ( i-PP ) . methylalumoxane (MAO)-activated <nUm> produces i-PP with good activities at <nUm> ° C in liquid monomer and AlMAO / Zr of <nUm> mol / mol , melting points around <nUm> ° C , and average viscosity molecular weights around <nUm> , at tp = <nUm> ° C . the isotacticity of i-PP from <nUm> / MAO is similar to those of the xylene-insoluble fractions of i-PP from heterogeneous Ti - Cl2Mg catalysts . melting points are lower than those of i-PP from Ti catalysts , but close to or higher than stereospecific zirconocene catalysts . molecular weight distributions are narrow as typical of metallocene catalysts . 
the use of zirconocene coupling reactions for the synthesis of novel conjugated polymers with interesting electronic properties is explored . it is demonstrated that zirconocene - coupling reactions provide a versatile method for tuning the electronic and optical properties via manipulation of the chemical structure and composition of the polymer backbone . this chemistry is used to synthesize highly emissive polymers containing electron - deficient thiophene-1-oxide and dioxide units and a base - dopable cp - containing polymer . 
the morphology of the thermoplastic polypropylene elastomer generated with unbridged bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconocene is studied using differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and nitric acid digestion . thermal fractionation DSC reveals the presence of many melting fractions which is likely caused by a broad distribution in crystallizable block lengths . hard crystalline domains dispersed in a continuous amorphous matrix are clearly visible in the AFM images . images of stretched samples show irreversible morphology changes at high elongations . high temperature nitric acid digestion study provides another estimate of the crystalline domain size in the polymers . 
copolymerizations of ethylene / 1-hexene were conducted using different zirconocene / AIR3 / BC18F15 catalytic systems at <nUm> ° C . when AIEt3 was used as alkylate agent , very low copolymerization activity was observed with both bridged catalyst Et[Ind] 2ZrCl2 and unbridged zirconocene Cp2ZrCl2 in-situ activated with BC18F15 . In appropriate Al / Zr mole ratio using Al(i-Bu)3 , the catalytic activities of both zirconocene catalytic systems were similar to those of sophisticated zirconocene / methylaluminoxane(MAO) catalytic system . the catalytic activities , comonomer incorporation and molecular weight of the copolymer synthesized with Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 / Al(i-Bu)3 / B(C6F 5)3 were higher than those obtained with cp 2ZrCl2 / al( / -Bu)3 / B(C6F 5)3 . the effect of the concentration of 1-hexene on catalytic activity , copolymer molecular weight , and comonomer incorporation was investigated . the complicated " co-monomer effect " , together with an increase in comonomer incorporation , a decrease in the copolymer molecular weight , was found when the comonomer concentration was increased . 
α , b-unsaturated tellurolesters have been prepared in good yield by the reaction of ArTel with acylzirconocene chlorides . 
the complex (C5H5)2Zr(Me)(methallyl) ( 1 ) was prepared and studied as a model for Zr - bound allyl species which are likely to arise in zirconocene - based polymerization systems . <nUm> undergoes allyl-alkyl exchange with trimethyl aluminum ( TMA ) or with methyl alumoxane ( MAO ) at rates that are proportional to the Al concentration , but remain 1-2 orders of magnitude below those of typical olefin insertions . its perfluorotriphenylborane adduct <nUm> , i.e. , the contact ion pair (C5H5)2Zr(methallyl)++H 3CB(C6F5)3- , has been characterized with regard to the rearrangement dynamics of its allyl ligand . propene reacts with <nUm> , at rates which are substantially lower again than those of cationic Zr - alkyl species , under insertion between Zr and one of the allylic termini . scrambling of deuterium from an allylic CD2 terminus over several C atom positions next to the unsaturated chain end indicates rather extensive metal migration within an initial olefin insertion product . density - functional calculations indicate that insertion of propene directly into an e3-coordinated Zr - allyl unit occurs with lower activation energy than insertion into an e1-bound Zr - allyl species and that the lowest - energy pathway for the reactivation of a cationic zirconocene allyl species is its reconversion to the corresponding Zr - alkyl species by molecular hydrogen . 
the synthesis and propene polymerization performance of the novel rac - [ CH <nUm> ( 3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl ) <nUm> ]ZrCl <nUm> ( 2 ) and rac - [ CH <nUm> ( 3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl ) <nUm> ]ZrMe <nUm> ( 2-Me <nUm> ) are described . the ligand precursor , bis(1-tert-butyl-3-indenyl)methane ( L2 ) , is obtained in ca. <nUm> % conversion from the condensation of 3-tert-butylindene and formaldehyde in DMF at room temperature and is isolated as a yellow powder by washing with pentane . red <nUm> is obtained in 50-60 % yield and free from its meso stereoisomer by reacting an et <nUm> O solution of the ligand dianion , (L2)Li <nUm> ( et <nUm> O ) x , with a slurry of ClZr <nUm> in either pentane or toluene . yellow 2-Me <nUm> is prepared in <nUm> % yield by reaction of <nUm> with excess MeMgCl in toluene . alternatively , 2-Me <nUm> ( contaminated with about <nUm> % of its meso isomer ) can be obtained directly from the ligand L2 , by reacting L2 in et <nUm> O with <nUm> equiv of MeLi and then <nUm> equiv of ClZr <nUm> in toluene . both <nUm> and 2-Me <nUm> are remarkably soluble in pentane ( <nUm> , ca. <nUm> g / L ; 2-Me <nUm> , ca. <nUm> g / L ) and toluene ( <nUm> , ca. <nUm> g / L ) . <nUm> / MAO and 2-Me <nUm> / MAO polymerize liquid propene with good activities to highly isotactic ( mmmm = 95-98 % ) , fully regioregular polypropene with medium - high molecular weights ( M w = <nUm> 000-780 <nUm> ) and high melting points ( T m = 154-163 ° C ) in the T p range 30-70 ° C . the behavior of <nUm> is compared to that of the prototypical montell zirconocene rac - [ me <nUm> C(3-t-Bu-Ind) <nUm> ]ZrCl <nUm> ( 1 ) . <nUm> is the first example of a highly efficient and at the same time simple and inexpensive zirconocene catalyst for isotactic polypropene . the molecular structures of <nUm> and its Hf analogue ( hf-2 ) have been determined and compared to that of <nUm> . 
by kinetically stabilizing imidozirconocene complexes through the use of a sterically demanding ligand , or by generating a more thermodynamically stable resting state with addition of diphenylacetylene , we have developed transition metal - catalyzed imine metathesis reactions that are mechanistically analogous to olefin metathesis reactions catalyzed by metal carbene complexes . when <nUm> mol % of Cp*Cp(THF)Zr = NtBu is used as the catalyst precursor in the metathesis reaction between PhCH = NPh and p-TolCH = N-p-Tol , a <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> equilibrium mixture with the two mixed imines p-TolCH = NPh and PhCH = N-p-Tol is generated in C6D6 at <nUm> ° C . the catalyst was still active after <nUm> days with an estimated <nUm> turnovers ( t1 / <nUm> <nUm> m ; TON = <nUm> h-1 ) . when the azametallacyclobutene Cp2Zr(N(Tol)C(Ph) = C(Ph) ) is used as the catalyst precursor under similar reaction conditions , a total of <nUm> turnovers are obtained after <nUm> days ( t1 / <nUm> <nUm> m ; TON = <nUm> h-1 ) . an extensive kinetic and equilibrium analysis of the metallacyclobutene - catalyzed metathesis of PhCH = N-p-Tol and p-F-C6H4CH = N-p-F-C6H4 was carried out by monitoring the concentrations of imines and observable metal - containing intermediates over time . numerical integration methods were used to fit these data to a detailed mechanism involving coordinatively unsaturated ( 16-electron ) imido complexes as critical intermediates . examination of the scope of reaction between different organic imines revealed characteristic selectivity that appears to be unique to the zirconium - mediated system . several zirconocene complexes that could generate the catalytically active " CpCp'Zr = ArN " ( cp ' = cp or cp* ) species in situ were found to be effective agents in the metathetical exchange between different n-aryl imines . N-Alkyl aldimines were found to be completely unreactive toward metathesis with n-aryl aldimines , and metathesis reactions involving the two n-alkyl imines TolCH = NPr and PhCH = NMe gave slow or erratic results , depending on the catalyst used . metathesis was observed between n-aryl ketimines and n-aryl aldimines , but for n-aryl ketimine substrates , the catalyst resting state consists of zirconocene enamido complexes , generated by the formal C-H activation of the a position of the ketimine substrates . 
homopolymerization of 4-methyl-1-pentene and its copolymerization with ethylene in the presence of catalysts based on zirconocenes , [(CH3)5Cp]ZrCl3 , [(CH3)2C(Cp)2]ZrCl2 , [(CH3)2C(Ind)2]ZrCl2 , [(C6H5)(C2H5)C(Ind)2]ZrCl <nUm> , [(CH3)2Si(Ind)2]ZrCl2 , [(CH3)2C(CH3Cp)(Flu)]ZrCl2 , and [(Ph)2C(Cp)(Flu)]]ZrCl2 , were studied . it was shown that the order of loading of the reagents affects the yield of poly ( 4-methyl-1-pentene ) . unsymmetrical , bridged metallocenes exhibit the highest activity in polymerization . for the [(CH3)2C(CH3Cp)(Flu)]ZrCl2-methylalu minoxane system , formation of a syndiotactic poly(4-methyl-1-pentene) was observed . In the copolymerization of 4-methyl-1-pentene with ethylene , conditions providing preparation of a linear LDPE with a variable content of 4-methyl-1-pentene units were determined . the effect of the molar ratio of methylaluminoxane : Zr on the yield and composition of the resulting copolymer was revealed . 
trimethylphosphane adds to the zirconocene-[C4H6B(C6F5)3] betaine complex 2a regioselectively by an overall inversion pathway , with opening of the internal FZr - ArC bond and formation of the Cp2Zr(PMe3)[C4H6B(C6F5)3] adduct <nUm> . complex <nUm> was characterized by X- ray diffraction . the betaine complex <nUm> contains a -CH2B(C6F5)3- substituted p-allyl ligand with characteristic bonding parameters of C1-C2 : <nUm> Å , C2-C3 : <nUm> Å , Zr-C1 : <nUm> Å , Zr-C2 : <nUm> Å , and Zr-C3 : <nUm> Å . 
the pendant (e2-formaldiminium)zirconocene cation complex <nUm> is generated by treatment of the (Cp-CMe2NMe2)CpZrMe2 precursor <nUm> with BC18F15 . the formation of <nUm> proceeds with C-H activation and methane evolution . addition of the phosphanes PPh2R ( r = ph , CH3 and cyclopropyl ) leads to the stable adducts 6a-c , in which the Zr-CH2-N three - membered ring structure of the (e2-for-maldiminium)Zr subunit is retained . the reactive complex <nUm> readily inserts benzophenone into the Zr - CH2N linkage to yield the carbon-carbon coupling product 7. a-Olefins also insert into the reactive Zr-C bond of <nUm> . exposure of <nUm> to ethene at a low temperature ( <nUm> ° C ) results in the formation of the labile metallacyclic mono-alkene- insertion product <nUm> , that is characterized spectroscopically . styrene and 4- tert-bu-tylstyrene undergo a clean [2,1]insertion into the Zr-C bond of <nUm> to selectively yield the isomerically pure mono-insertion products 9a and 9b , respectively , that exhibit their aryl substituents in the a-position adjacent to the zirconium center . In each case a single stereoisomer is formed that contains a s-p-structured e3-benzylic coordination of the chain end , exhibiting the meso-allyl position oriented cis to the substituted cp ring at the resulting metallacyclic framework . complex 9b was characterized by x-ray crystal - structure analysis . 
the catalytic activity of Cp2ZrCl2 supported on three types of molecular sieves ( MCM-41 , VPI-5 and Y zeolites ) was evaluated in the polymerization of ethylene . the supports were dehydrated , pre-treated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , and then reacted with Cp2ZrCl2 . after heterogenization of Cp2ZrCl2 on the molecular sieves , the MAO concentration could be reduced without significant effect on the catalytic activity . the polymers obtained with the heterogeneous catalysts showed higher melting points and molecular weights , as well as narrower polydispersion than those obtained with the homogeneous catalyst precursor . 
the substituted 6-hydroxy-trans-3-hexenoic acids 2-4 have been prepared by a template coupling reaction between ( butadiene ) zirconocene , C6O6W , and cyclobutanone , cyclodecanone , or cyclododecanone , respectively , followed by hydrolytic / oxidative demetallation of the resulting metallacyclic zirconoxycarbene tungsten complexes . the hydroxyalkenoic acids 2-4 have been found to form two novel fundamental types of associated supramolecular structural arrays in the solid state through intermolecular hydrogen bonding , which have been characterized by x-ray diffraction analysis . the cyclobutanone - derived compound <nUm> exhibits an infinitely extending sheet - like structure , which is composed of symmetrically alternating interconnected 12- and 36-membered rings , each being constructed from the functional groups or frameworks of four individual molecules of <nUm> . In contrast , the cyclodecanone- derived compound <nUm> adopts a ribbon - type structure composed of C2- symmetrically arranged symmetry - equivalent 15-membered rings , each containing the functionalities from three individual molecules of <nUm> . on the basis of scanning force microscopy studies , the cyclododecanone - derived compound <nUm> would appear to have a similar structure in the solid state . the structural features of the molecular assemblies that are formed by intermolecular hydrogen bonding of compounds 2-4 in the solid state are selectively controlled by the size and favoured conformations of the spiro - anellated carbocyclic rings at C6 of the 6-hydroxy-trans-3-hexenoic acid carbon chain . 
the title complexes are stable , borate - bridged ansa - zirconocene species which have been prepared by reacting [ { Ph(SMe2)B(e5-C5H4) 2}ZrCl2 ] ( 1 ) with cp*2 - AlMe and [PPN]Cl . their molecular structures were determined by x-ray diffraction . noteworthy are the stabilities of the borate-cyclopentadienyl linkages and the enhanced lewis acidity of the boron within its strained ansa position . 
the chemistry research community is identifying hafnium 's potential capabilities as a catalyst to advance N and C-H activation reactions . the research has found a close relationship between the physical and chemical properties of hafnium and zirconium . it is reported that hafnocene-N2 and zirconocene-N2 complexes react with H to form a hydrazine core between two metallocene units . hafnium is also found to offer broader reactivity of the dihafnocene-N2 complex with carbon dioxide leading to double insertion of carbon dioxide into the Hf-N bonds to form a n2-carbon dioxide core . the group <nUm> metallocene reactions with acetylenes form adducts between bis ( trimethylsilyl ) acetylene , titanocene , and zirconocene . the chemical researchers have applied the enhanced reactivity of hafnium organometallic compounds for synthesis and catalysis . 
several supported zirconocene catalysts were prepared by using Cl2Mg · 6H2O as a precursor for producing an active support . such catalysts combined with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) obtained by reacting Cl2Mg · 6H2O with AlMe3 show good activity for ethylene polymerization similar to that of anhydrous Cl2Mg supported zirconocene catalyst . 
the chemical structures of end groups of medium - low molecular weight atactic and isotactic polypropylenes ( a-PP and i-PP ) , produced with zirconocene / methylalumoxane catalysts , have been analyzed and used to infer the chain - transfer reaction mechanisms , which are then correlated with the zirconocene ligand structure and the polymerization conditions . for the chiral , isospecific ansa - zirconocenes such as rac-[ethylenebis(1-indenyl)]ZrCl2 / methylalumoxane ( <nUm> / MAO ) and rac-[ethylenebis(4,7-dimethyl-1-indenyl)]ZrCl2 / methylalumoxane ( <nUm> / MAO ) catalysts , i-PP molecular weight is dependent on the reg / ospecificity of the catalyst , as shown by the presence of cis-2-butenyl end groups , formed by chain transfer to the monomer after a secondary propylene insertion . At low monomer concentration , chain - transfer with <nUm> / MAO shifts from predominant transfer to the monomer after a secondary propylene insertion to b-methyl ( allyl end groups ) and b-hydrogen transfers after a primary insertion ( 2-propenyl , or vinylidene , end group ) . Ansti-bis(3-R-indenyl)ZrCl2 ( ansa = CH2 , Me2Si , Me2C ; r = me , t-Bu , Me3Si ) catalysts , which are highly regiospecific , produce polypropylenes with chain transfer via both b-hydrogen transfer after a primary insertion and b-methyl transfer . for example , rac-Me2C(3-t-Bu-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( 4 ) exhibits the highest selectivity for b-methyl transfer so far observed in an isospecific zirconocene . As for <nUm> / MAO , the rate of b-methyl transfer in <nUm> / MAO increases by lowering [propylene] . 
the reactions of the bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene permethylmetallocene complexes Cp*2M(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ( m = Ti ( 1 ) , m = Zr ( 2 ) ) with H2O and CO2 were studied and compared to those of the corresponding metallocene complexes Cp2M(L)(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ( m = Ti ( 3 ) , L = - ; m = Zr , L = THF ( 4 ) ) to understand the influence of the ligands Cp(e5-C5H5) and Cp*(e5-C5Me5) as well as the metals titanium and zirconium on the reaction pathways and the obtained products . In the reaction of the permethyltilanocene complex <nUm> with water the dihydroxy complex Cp*2Ti(OH)2 ( 5 ) was formed . this product differs from the well - known titanoxane Cp2TiOTiCp2 which was obtained by the reaction of the corresponding titanocene complex <nUm> with water . the reaction of the permethylzirconocene complex <nUm> with water gives the mononuclear alkenyl zirconocene hydroxide <nUm> . an analogous product was assumed as the first step in the reaction of the corresponding zirconocene complex <nUm> with water which ends up in a dinuclear zirconoxane . In the conversion of the permethylzirconocene complex <nUm> with carbon dioxide the mononuclear insertion product <nUm> was formed by coupling of carbon dioxide and the acetylene . In contrast , the corresponding zirconocene complex <nUm> affords , by an analogous reaction , a dinuclear complex . In additional experiments the known complex Cp*2Zr(e2-PhC2SiMe3) ( 8 ) was prepared , starting from Cp*2ZrCl2 and Mg in the presence of PhC = CSiMe3 . this complex reacts with carbon dioxide resulting in a mixture of the regioisomeric zirconafuranones 9a and 9b . from these in the complex 9a , having the SiMe3 group in b-position to the metal , the Zr-C bond was quickly hydrolyzed by water to give the complex Cp*2Zr(OH)OC( = O ) - C(SiMe3) = CHPh ( 10a ) compared to complex ( 9b ) which gives slowly the complex Cp*2Zr(OH)OC( = O ) - CPh = CH(SiMe3) ( 10b ) . 
the production of polyethylene by zirconocene catalysis is a multistep process that includes initiation , propagation , and termination . each of these steps has a number of associated equilibrium and transition state structures . these structures have been studied in the gas - phase environment using density functional and integrated methods . we have also examined the effects of solvation upon the energetics of the various polymerization steps employing continuum and explicit representations of the solvent ( toluene ) . the reaction steps we have studied are initiation , propagation , propylene and hexene incorporation , termination by hydrogenolysis , termination by b-H transfer to the metal , termination by b-H transfer to the monomer , and reactivation . the solvation effect of toluene takes on special significance for the initiation , termination by hydrogenolysis and by b-H transfer to the metal , and reactivation steps .

interactions between different zirconium compounds as schwartz reagent [Cp2ZrHCl]n , zirconocene [Cp2Zr] or benzyne zirconocene and unsaturated systems incorporating main group elements have been investigated . efficient new methodologies of preparation of several linear mono- , di- , tri-or polyphosphanes as well as mono- , di-or tricyclic compounds incorporating phosphorus , nitrogen , antimony or tin are reported . 
the mono- and bis-ring substituted zirconocenes with pendant phenyl groups [ Zr(e-C5H5)(e-C5H4CMe 2Ph)Me2 ] <nUm> , [ Zr(e-C5H5)(e-C5H4CMe 2C6H4Me-p)Me2 ] <nUm> , [ Zr(e-C5H4CMe2Ph)2Me <nUm> ] <nUm> , and [ Zr(e-C5H4CMe2C6H 4Me-p)2Me2 ] <nUm> have been prepared . the crystal structures of <nUm> and <nUm> have been determined . compounds 2-5 react with methyl abstracting reagents such as BC18F15 or [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4] - to form cationic zirconocene complexes 6-9 as solvent separated ion pairs as shown by low temperature NMR spectroscopy . for the cationic complexes [ Zr(e-C5H5)(e-C5H4CMe 2Ph)Me]+[RB(C6F5)3] - ( r = me 6a or C6F5 6b ) and [ Zr(e-C5H5)(e-C5H4CMe 2C6H4Me-p)Me]+[RB(C 6F5)3]- ( r = me 7a or C6F5 7b ) evidence for the co-ordination of a phenyl group to the zirconium centre via agostic C-H-M interaction was obtained by NMR spectroscopy . these cationic complexes can be considered as models for solvent adducts in kaminsky catalysts . the cationic complexes [Zr(e-C5H4CMe2Ph)2Me] +[RB(C6F5)3]- ( r = me 8a or C6F5 8b ) ( derived from <nUm> ) and [ Zr(e-C5H4CMe2C6H 4Me-p)2Me]+[RB(C6F5) 3]- ( r = me 9a or C6F5 9b ) ( derived from <nUm> ) , respectively , exhibit more complex behaviour . these observations contrast with those from the previously published benzyl congener [Zr(e-C5H4CH2Ph)2Me2] <nUm> which , with methyl abstracting agent , generates both a solvent separated cation / anion pair and a tight ion pair . 
zirconocene supported on alumina or magnesium chloride exhibits modest olefin polymerization activity but not when it is supported directly on silica . the surface silanol as well as siloxane groups must be passivated with appropriate reagents . A very active and stereospecific supported catalyst was obtained by first reacting silica with methylalumoxane and bisphenol A before the impregnation of the ansa - zirconocene precursor . the main difference between a homogeneous and supported catalyst is that at the same gross amount of metallocene , the net concentration of it in the pores of a support material is several orders of magnitude greater than it exists in solution thus the rate of deactivation in the former case is correspondingly faster than in the latter . most other supported metallocene catalysts based on supports such as zeolites , cyclodextrin , polymeric MAO , synthetic polymers , etc. , are poor in olefin polymerization for this and other reasons discussed . 
the tetraphenyl substituted disiloxane bridged ansa - zirconocene has been generated to probe the effect of bridging ligand on metallocene polymerization . the indicated zirconocene has been synthesized by the reaction of Cl4Zr with the distannylated precursor compound . the new disiloxane bridged ansa - metallocene was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR , mass analysis , and elemental analysis . ethylene polymerization was carried out to in- , vestigate the polymerization properties of the prepared complex . polymerization experiments exhibited that the catalytic activity increases with the increase in polymerization temperature as well as the amount of cocatalyst . on the other hand , the molecular weights of the polymers decreased with the increase in polymerization temperature . it turned out that tetraphenyl replacement caused about <nUm> to <nUm> % activity reduction . the most important feature associated in tetramethyl to tetraphenyl substitution was that molecular weights of the polymers from the tetraphenyl substituted complex were enormously improved comparing to those of the polymers from the tetramethyl one . 
three procedures were developed for the preparation of Cp2ZrH{(m-H)2BC4H8} , <nUm> . it can be prepared from the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with K[H2B2(m-H)(m-C4H8) <nUm> ] in a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio ; the reaction of Cp2ZrCl{(m-H)2BC4H8} with K[H2B2(m-H)(m-C4H8) <nUm> ] in a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio ; and the reaction of Cp2ZrCl{(m-H)2BC4H8} with HLi in a <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratio . although the first and second procedures imply the possible synthesis of Cp2Zr{(m-H)2BC4H8}2 , this compound is not formed . 
group IVB metallocene polyethers containing the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol have been synthesized in moderate yield with chain lengths ranging from <nUm> to <nUm> employing the interfacial polycondensation procedure . infrared spectroscopy shows the absence of the O-H group and formation of the M-O linkage consistent with the formation of the polyether . F-MALDI MS results are consistent with the presence of metal - containing fragmentation clusters containing one and two metal atoms and ion fragments up to several hundred units long . the polymers all show moderate to good inhibition of a group of cancer cell lines including colon , breast , lung , and prostrate cell lines . the titanocene - containing polymer has significant CI50 values showing a preference to inhibit the cancer cell lines in preference to the WI-38 normal cell line . 
acetylenic stannanes react with Cp2Zr(H)Cl ( cp = e5-C5H5 ) giving organozirconium(iv) complexes , which are trapped with alkynyliodonium tosylates in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 to afford (Z)-l-en-3-yn-2-ylstannanes . 
(Butadiene)zirconocenes add tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane in a <nUm> : <nUm> stoichiometry to yield metallocene-hydrocarbylborate-betaine systems that serve as active single component metallocene ziegler catalysts . under specific reaction conditions , the first olefin insertion step can be experimentally observed . this is used to characterize the stereochemistry and reaction profile of single alkene insertions at a variety of metallocene ziegler catalysts and related systems . 
we have analyzed the computational results for several elementary reactions of the ethylene polymerization process catalyzed by an alternative ( to the existing metallocene catalysts ) " non-cyclopentadienyl " catalysts such as diimine - M(II) ( where m = Ni and Pd ) and chelating bridged ti- and Zr - complexes . the obtained data have been compared with those for the existing zirconocene - based catalysts . In general , it was shown that : ( i ) the resting stage of the process is a metal-olefin-alkyl complex , the olefin coordination energy of which is a few kcal / mol larger for diimine - M(II) systems than zirconocene or dialkoxide systems ; ( ii ) the rate - determining barrier is a migratory insertion barrier calculated from the metal-olefin-alkyl complex , which is found to be a few kcal / mol larger for the diimine - M(II) system compared to the Cp2ZrCH3+ catalyst . the presence of certain flexible bridging ligands x in the Ti - alkoxide complex , [Y(Ph)X(Ph)Y]TiCH3+ , which are capable of donating electron density to the cationic metal center at various stages during the reaction makes this barrier a few kcal / mol smaller for the dialkoxide than the Cp2ZrCH3+ catalyst . it was shown that an increase in the metal - bridge interaction decreases the migratory insertion barrier and , consequently , increases the catalytic activity of these complexes . although the diimine - M(II) catalysts are less active than zirconocene - based ones , the microstructure of the polymers produced by the former catalyst , which is found to be a function of temperature , ethylene , steric bulkiness of the auxiliary ligands , and transition metal center , makes them attractive for practice . we also have studied the mechanisms of several chain termination / transfer reactions , as well as the role of steric effects in the studied elementary reactions . we have clearly demonstrated tremendous possibilities of the computational chemistry in solving complex problems of the homogenous catalyst , and its high capability of predicting new and more active catalysts for different commercially important processes including olefin polymerization reactions . 
ethylene is polymerized by heterobimetallic combinations of early and late transition metal catalysts . dual combinations of zirconocenes and cationic nickel and iron catalysts with multidentate nitrogen - donor ligands are described . reactor blends of linear and branched ethylene homopolymers are obtained . with zirconocene / nickel complex catalyst combinations , addition of hydrogen selectively reduces the molecular weight of the linear polyethylene formed by the metallocene catalyst . 
tetramethyldisilane - bridged bis(1 - indenyl and tetrahydroindenyl ) metallocene dichlorides(Me2SiSiMe2)Ind2MCl 2[M = ti(1) , zr(2) ] and (Me2SiSiMe2)[IndH4]2MCl 2[M = ti(3) , zr(4) ] were synthesized . complexes 1-4 were characterized by 1H NMR , mass spectra and elemental analyses . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> were used for the polymerization of ethylene after activation with methyl aluminoxane(MAO) at different temperatures and normal pressure . the titanocene <nUm> shows a lower activity but produces polyethylene with a higher molecular weight than zirconocene <nUm> . the catalyst systems show a dependency of the activity and molecular weight on temperature . 
metallocene catalysts in dissolved form are in most cases unsuitable for the production of polyethylene or polypropylene on an industrial scale . In order to use them in existing technical processes , metallocenes have to be supported . Cs - symmetric zirconocenes show a high activity and no leaching additional triisobutyl aluminum is used as scavenger and MAO - covered silica for heterogenization . the aluminum : zirconium ratio can be reduced to values of <nUm> : <nUm> to get optimal activities . the syndiotacticity of the obtained polypropylene is lower compared with polymers of the homogeneous catalyst and decreases strongly with a thinner propene concentration . 
the moderate electrophilicity of palladium (II) - phosphine catalysts compared to those of zirconocene dichlorides makes them more tolerant toward a variety of polar functionalities of olefinic monomers . this allows use of Pd (II) complexes as catalysts for the copolymerization of olefins with readily available polar monomers , like acrylic acid derivatives or carbon monoxide . In particular , developments during the recent years have opened the way to a new and broad family of high molecular weight 1-olefin / CO co- and terpolymers . these 1,4-polyketone materials show interesting and easily variable properties which can be tuned from insoluble , highly crystalline to thermoplastic elastic . the latter polymers resemble in some cases flexible PVC and even vulcanized natural rubbers . 
new data on the structure of polymethylaluminoxane[-Al(CH3)O-]n ( MAO ) , the nature of its lewis acidity , and the mechanism of formation of the active centers of the metallocene catalysts during interaction between MAO and Cp2ZrMe2 obtained by spectroscopy ( 27Al , 17O , 1H , and 13C NMR and spin probe ESR ) and density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations are considered . A three - dimensional structure of MAO ( a cage structure ) with four - coordinated aluminum atoms and three - coordinated oxygen atoms is found to be the most probable . experimental evidence for the presence of relatively weak lewis acid sites in MAO ( about <nUm> site per <nUm> atoms of Al ) is obtained for the first time . the acidity of MAO depends on the size of a MAO molecule n , and it increases with increasing n . A scheme for the formation and structure of lewis acid sites formed upon interaction between MAO and Al2Me6 , which is always present in the MAO samples is proposed . cationic intermediates formed in the MAO / Cp2ZrMe2 system at high molar ratios Al / Zr = 200-4000 corresponding to real conditions of polymerization are characterized for the first time . A scheme of equilibria between them and the most probable precursors of the active centers in this system are proposed . A new mechanism for the formation of the [Cp2ZrMe]+[MAO · me]- ionic pair involving the abstraction and occlusion of a methyl ligand in the bulk of a MAO molecule is proposed on the basis of quantum - chemical calculations . 
the polyethylene obtained in the presence of the catalyst constituted by the meso isomer of the prototypical zirconocene complex (ethylene)bis(l-indenyDzirconium dichloride activated by methylalumoxane is characterized by the presence of ethyl branches . the intensities of the 13C NMR signals associated with these branches indicate that there are about 1-2 ethyl groups per <nUm> monomer units . As a consequence , the melting temperature is 10-15 ° C lower than the linear polyethylene obtained with the rac mixture of the same zirconocene complex . on the basis of kinetic evidence , a branching mechanism that involves a 9-H transfer to the coordinated ethylene is proposed . 
catalytic pauson - khand reaction products with norbornadiene could be effectively transformed to trisubstituted cyclopentadienes , which have been used to synthesize a series of unbridged bis(1-R'-2-R-3-R'-trisubstituted cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichlorides <nUm> ( r = R' = ph ) , <nUm> ( r = ph , R' = me ) , <nUm> ( r = n-Bu , R' = me ) , <nUm> ( r = t-Bu , R' = me ) , <nUm> ( r = (CH2)4OMe ) , R' = me ) , and <nUm> ( r = n-Bu , R' = ph ) . the crystal structure of <nUm> was determined by x-ray crystallography . these zirconium complexes in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) show activities for the polymerization of ethylene . the activities are in the following order : <nUm> > <nUm> > <nUm> ∼ <nUm> ∼ Cp2ZrCl2 > <nUm> ∼ <nUm> . the activity of <nUm> is four times higher than that of Cp2ZrCl2 under similar conditions . 
In this work , the boron ( B ) modification of MCM-41 - supported dMMAO / zirconocene catalysts showed a promising increase ( almost twice ) in catalytic activity in ethylene / 1-octene copolymerization . the enhanced activity can be attributed to the decreased interaction between the support and dMMAO with boron modification as was proved by TGA . it was proposed that boron acted as a spacer anchoring the support and dMMAO . however , at high boron loading ( ca. <nUm> wt % ) , the activity slightly decreased due to the migration of dMMAO into boron layer resulting in less surface concentration of [Al]dMMAO which was measured by XPS . the inhibition of chain transfer reaction during polymerization apparently occurred upon the boron modification providing higher MW polymer . it was also suggested that boron modification has rendered more uniform catalytic sites which was leading to narrower MWD of the polymer observed . based on 13CNMR , boron modification did not affect the microstructure of copolymers obtained . however , the insertion of 1-octene increased with boron modification probably due to decreased steric hindrance of the MCM-41 support . 
trimethylphosphine - stabilized ethylene complexes <nUm> of the ethylenebisindenyl-supported zirconocene fragment are prepared via magnesium reduction of rac - (EBI)ZrCl <nUm> in the presence of ethylene and PMe <nUm> . when the reaction is halted after <nUm> h , good yields of a mixture containing rac-(EBI)Zr(e <nUm> -CH <nUm> = CH <nUm> )PMe <nUm> , rac-1 , and the racemic diastereomer of the zirconacyclopentane derivative (EBI)Zr(e <nUm> -CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> CH <nUm> ) , rac-2 , are obtained . this mixture may be converted to pure rac-1 if treated with excess PMe <nUm> . if the magnesium reduction of rac - (EBI)ZrCl <nUm> is left for <nUm> days in the presence of magnesium chloride , complete epimerization to meso-1 is observed . thus , both diastereomers of <nUm> are available . compounds meso-1 and rac-2 have been characterized crystallographically . the coordinated ethylene ligands in compounds <nUm> are susceptible to electrophilic attack by the pentafluorophenyl-substituted boranes HB(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> and B(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> , forming zwitterionic metallocene products . for reactions involving HB(C <nUm> F <nUm> ) <nUm> , the products meso-3 and rac-3 are characterized by a strong zirconium - hydrido borate interaction , as well as a weak Zr-Cb bonding .

BC18F15 opens the ring of the N-tBu azazirconacyclobutane <nUm> by abstracting the carbon from the zirconium ; the resulting amido cation <nUm> reacts slowly with ethylene to form a chelating g-iminoalkyl zirconocene cation , <nUm> . similarly , BC18F15 removes carbon from the Zr of the N-Ph azazirconacyclopentane 5a and the N-SiMe3 azazirconacyclopentane 5b , forming amido cations that are stabilized in the solid state by coordination of phenyl substituents on N ( <nUm> , from 5a ) or C ( <nUm> , from 5b ) ; <nUm> slowly loses hydrogen , forming an azaallyl cation <nUm> . In contrast AlMe2Cl coordinates the N of the zirconaaziridines <nUm> , resulting in an sp2 N coordinated to Zr through a p orbital . the structures of <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and 11a have been established by x-ray crystallography .

In solution , <nUm> showed time - averaged C2 symmetry ( 1H NMR ) ; however , single - crystal x-ray diffraction analysis showed that <nUm> adopts an asymmetric conformation in which only one of the CH2 annelated rings projects into the Cl2Zr coordination hemisphere . neither <nUm> nor <nUm> served as a precatalyst for alumoxane - cocatalyzed , homogeneous propylene polymerization .

treatment of the alkyl group <nUm> metallocene cation reagent [ZrCp2{CH2Si(CH3)3}(THF)] +[BPh4]- 2b with bis(propynyl)zirconocene 1a yielded the cationic dimetallic complex [ (ZrCp2)2(m-e1 : e2-CH3CCCH3){m-k 2-C ≡ CCH2Si(CH3)3}]+ 3d with BPh4- anion . complex 3d was characterized spectroscopically and by a crystal structure analysis . it contains a planar four-co-ordinate carbon atom , which is stabilized by the interaction with both group <nUm> metal centres . finding the C4H11Si substituent , that originates from the alkylzirconocene reagent , attached at the m-acetylide ligand in the final product is unusual . A reversible alkynyl carbometallation sequence is proposed to account for the observed selective formation of 3d . complex 3d reacted with alkyl isocyanides RN ≡ C ( r = CMe2CH2CMe3 , CMe3 , or cyclohexyl ) by replacement of the m-e1 : e2-CH3CCCH3 ligand to form the m-isocyanide complexes [ (ZrCp2)2(m-e1-C : e2-C,N-RNC){m-k2-C ≡ CCH 2Si(CH3)2}]+ ( with BPh4- anion ) of which one was characterized by a crystal structure analysis .

the polymeric [Ind2Si(C6H4)]n and [Ind2Si(C6H4)]m compounds ( ind = indenyl ) were synthesized via the condensation reaction of bisindenyldichlorosilane and p-dilithiobenzene or p-dilithiobiphenyl , and the supported - type zirconocene catalysts were prepared by reacting them with zirconium tetrachloride . the content of zirconium in the catalysts is much higher than that in the metallocene catalysts supported by inorganic compounds . polymerizations of ethene and propene were conducted with them using methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or ordinary alkylaluminiums as cocatalysts and toluene as the solvent . the catalysts combined with MAO display very high activities especially for the ethene polymerization . from the polymerization at high temperatures , it was found that the active species are markedly stabilized , probably due to the rigid backbones of the carriers . the activity of the catalysts activated with ordinary alkylaluminiums is far less as compared with those activated with MAO .

NMR and FTIR spectroscopies were used to characterize the polymerization products . all three catalyst systems afforded functionalized co- and terpolymers by direct polymerization of ethylene / propylene / hydroxy-a - olefins but only the catalyst system ( 1 ) / MAO displays appreciable activities for direct polymerization of ethylene , propylene and carboxy-a-ole-fins .

liquid co- and terpolymers based on inexpensive and abundant a-olefins and ethylene feed stocks were produced using a single site zirconocene catalyst . the process is based , in part , on the formation of synthetic hydrocarbon base oils ( SHC ) with catalysts having a high viscosity index , low pour point , low volatility , low cold cranking viscosity , high flash point , and excellent oxidation stability . the characteristics of the liquid polymers were modified by cracking and hydrogenation to generate SHC . the oils ' performance properties were comparable to or better than PAO and are an economical alternative to formulating high performance motor oils and lubricants .

A related biszwitterionic zirconocene complex <nUm> is prepared through the reaction of carbon disulfide with the tricyclic a-phospholane zirconaindan <nUm> ; in this case cycloaddition reactions take place on the two carbon sulfur double bonds of CS2 . 
unbridged , sterically substituted zirconocene dichlorides can be prepared in high yields by the interaction of a dialkylzirconium dichloride with <nUm> equiv of the appropriate fulvene in hydrocarbon medium with alkene displacement . the requisite dialkylzirconium dichloride can readily be produced by the alkylation of Cl4Zr in hydrocarbon media with <nUm> equiv of an alkyllithium reagent . generating the R2ZrCl2 reagents in hydrocarbon media permits their use as hydrozirconating agents for a variety of polar unsaturated organic substrates .

A series of substituted indenyl-fluorenyl asymmetric ethylene-bridged ligands have been prepared from the reaction of 1-(9-fluorenyl)-2-bromoethane and the lithium salt of the desired indenyl moiety . the ligands have been converted to the corresponding substituted asymmetric ethylene-bridged metallocenes ( m = Zr , Hf ) . these metallocenes have been evaluated as catalyst precursors for the polymerization of ethylene and propylene . the influence of substitution on the selectivity of the propylene polymerization has been studied . the metallocene [1-(9-fluorenyl)-2-(2,4,7-trimethyl-1-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride was found to produce highly isotactic polypropylene with an [mmmm] value of <nUm> % . 
A general investigation of the elementary reactions involved in the activation processes of zirconocene and Ni - based derivatives by methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) was performed through the association of polymerization kinetics and spectroscopic investigation of the catalytic system . this study demonstrates the close correlation between polymerization activities and the changes in the UV / visible characteristic absorption bands of the transition metal derivative used as catalyst . hex-1-ene was chosen as model monomer . 
homo- and copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene were conducted at different temperature and ethylene pressure with several zirconocenes activated with dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( Me2PhNH*B(C6F5) <nUm> ) / triisobutylaluminium ( i-Bu3Al ) to study the effect of ligand structure and polymerization conditions on catalytic activity , molecular weight and chain transfer reactions . At high temperature and low ethylene pressure , rac-ethylene(bisindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) activated with Me2PhNH*B(C6F5)4 / i-Bu 3Al initially gives a highly active catalyst that is rapidly deactivated . trans-Vinylene double bonds , which were not formed at low temperature , were detected in polyethylene synthesized at high temperature and low ethylene pressure . they reasonably arise from b-H transfer after isomerization reaction . the molecular weight of ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers decreases with increasing 1-hexene feed , followed by the formation of vinylidene end groups . this reveals that b-H transfer from propagating chains containing primary inserted 1-hexene as a terminal unit is predominant . this reaction is influenced by the ligand structure . At high temperature and high ethylene pressure , trans-vinylene and vinylidene contents decrease and the vinyl content increases , indicating that the high ethylene pressure controls b-H transfer after isomerization reaction . 
ethylene polymerization and ethylene / a-olefin copolymerization were conducted using diphenylmethylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride ( Ph2C(Cp)(Flu)ZrCl2 ) as a catalyst activated with dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( Me2PhNH · BC24F20 ) / triisobutylaluminium ( i-Bu3Al ) at high temperature and different ethylene pressure . this catalyst produces high molecular weight polyethylene with high activity . the molecular weight of the copolymers hardly decreases with increasing amount of comonomer in the feed . this is attributed to the control b-H transfer from the propagating chain containing primary inserted comonomer . the occurrence of inner trisubstituted double bonds was confirmed . these bonds are probably formed by dehydrogenation reactions after b-H transfer from the propagating chain followed by ethylene insertion . therefore , this reaction might play an important role in the production of high molecular weight ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers at high temperature . At high ethylene pressure , isomerization reactions from inserted ethylene or primary inserted a-olefin as terminal units , which were observed under low ethylene pressure , can be controlled at low level . 
institut fur anorganische chemie der universitat zu koln , greinstrasse <nUm> , D-50939 koln A series of new ansa - zirconocene dichloride compounds [ PR(C5H4)2ZrCl2 ; r = me(5) , et ( 6 ) , iPr ( 7 ) , tBu ( 8 ) ] with phosphorus as bridging atom between the cyclopentadienyl rings have been prepared , isolated , and characterised by 1H , 13C , 31P NMR spectroscopy , mass spectrometry and elemental analysis . the x-ray structure of <nUm> is reported . 
A novel polymer - supported metallocene catalyst with crosslinked poly(styrene-co-acrylamide) ( AmPS ) as the support has been prepared and characterized . the probability of long sequences of acrylamide ( Am ) in AmPS is still low even at an Am amount of <nUm> mol % , implying the relatively homogeneous distribution of Am . the infrared spectra of AmPS and the supported catalyst substantiate that an amide group in AmPS coordinates with methylaluminoxane through both oxygen and nitrogen atoms . ethylene / a-octene copolymerization showed that the catalytic activity is not markedly affected by adding a-octene . 13C NMR analysis of the ethylene / a-octene copolymer indicated that the composition distribution of the copolymer is uniform . 


novel heterobimetallic complexes that consist of zirconium and rhodium , LRh(e2CH2 = CH)2Si(e5-C 5H2-2,4-Mc2)2ZrCl2 ( 3a L = e5-C9H7 , 3b e2-C5H5 , 3c e-C5Me5 ) , were synthesized , and 3b was structurally characterized . the complexes have a " C2 - symmetric " ansa - zirconocene part and the rhodium metal on the bridge part . the complexes 3a - c in combination with methylaluminoxane catalyzed highly isospecific polymerization of a-olefins . their catalytic activities were higher than that of the parent zirconocene complex , and the obtained polymer had a larger molecular weight . 
for ethylene polymerization , the supported metallocene catalyst was prepared by anchoring CpIndZrCl2 on silica with an appropriate spacer . the three procedures were applied for CpIndZrCl2 anchoring on silica with a hexamethyltrisiloxane or pentamethylene spacer . the anchoring procedures exerted a strong influence on the catalyst activity since the different anchoring methods gave the formation of different structures of active sites . with the new anchoring route , it was possible to prepare the " heterogeneous single - site " catalyst which was found to have only one catalyst structure on silica and exhibited a higher catalyst activity than that of the other supported catalysts . At a polymerization temperature of <nUm> ° C , the activity of the heterogeneous single - site catalyst was comparable to that of the unsupported homogeneous zirconocene . 
propylene polymerization was carried out using an ansa - zirconocene pyrrolidide based catalytic system of racemic ethylene-1,2-bis(1-indenyl)zirconium dipyrrolidide [ rac-(EBI)Zr(NC4H8)2 or ( rac-1 ) ] and methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) or a noncoordinating anion . In situ generation of cationic alkylzirconium species was also investigated by NMR - scale reactions of rac-1 and MAO , and rac-1 , AlMe3 , and [Ph3C] [B(C6Fg)4] . In the NMR - scale reaction using CD2Cl2 as a solvent , a small amount of MAO ( [Al] / [Zr] = <nUm> ) was enough to completely activate rac-1 to give cationic methyl-zirconium cations that can polymerize propylene . the resulting isotactic polypropylene ( iPP ) isolated in this reaction showed a meso pentad value of <nUm> % . In a similar NMR - scale reaction rac-1 was stoichiometrically methylated by AlMe3 to give rac - (EBI)ZrMe2 , and the introduction of [Ph3C] [B(C6F5)4] into the reaction mixture containing rac - (EBI)ZrMe2 led to in situ generation of cationic [rac-(EBI)Zr(m-Me)2AlMe2]+ species that can polymerize propylene to give iPP showing a meso pentad value of <nUm> % . the catalyst system rac - <nUm> / MAO exhibited an increase of activity as the [Al] / [Zr] ratio increased within an experimental range ( [Al] / [Zr] = 930-6511 ) . the meso pentad values of the resulting iPPs were in the range of <nUm> - <nUm> % . the catalytic activity showed a maximum ( rp = <nUm> × <nUm> g PP / mol Zr h atm ) when [Zr] was <nUm> × 10-6 mol / L in the propylene polymerization according to the concentration of catalyst . MAO - free polymerization of propylene was performed by a rac - <nUm> / AlR3 / noncoordinating anion catalytic system . the efficiency of AlR3 was decreased in the order of AlMe3 ( rp = <nUm> × <nUm> g PP / mol Zr h atm ) > Al(i-Bu)3 ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > AlPr3 ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > Al(i-Bu)2H ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > AlEt3 ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) . the performance of the noncoordinating anion as a cocatalyst was on the order of [HNMePh2][B(C6F5)4] ( rp , = <nUm> × <nUm> g PP / mol Zr h atm ) > [HNMe2Ph] [B(C6F5)4] ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > [Ph3C] [B(C6F5)4] ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) > [HNEt2Ph][B(C6F5)4] ( <nUm> × <nUm> ) . the properties of iPP were characterized by 13C - NMR , FTIR , DSC , GPC , and viscometry . 
13C NMR spectroscopic studies of the in situ polymerization of 13C - enriched ethylene ( 13C2H4 ) in the presence of Cp2Zr(13CH3)2 and methylaluminoxane or BC18F15 as cocatalysts were carried out . the first direct observation of Cp2Zr-polymeryl species was made . the in situ polymerization experiments in the presence of different concentrations of dinuclear [(Cp2ZrMe)2(m-Me)]+ and mononuclear cation species [Cp2ZrMe]+ , having [MeB(C6F5)3]- or [MeMAO]- counterions , were performed . these comparisons made it possible to make the assignments of the zirconocene complexes bearing the polymeryl chain as ligands [Cp2Zr13CH2P]+[13CH 3MAO]- , [Cp2Zr13CH2P]+[13CH 3B(C6F5)3]- , and Cp2Zr(13CH2P)(13CH3) . they are in equilibrium with each other . mononuclear Zr - polymeryl ion pairs such as [Cp2Zr13CH2P]+[13CH 3B(C6F5)3]- and [Cp2Zr13CH2P]+[13CH 3MAO]- either are the propagating active species or are intermediates , closely related to the active species , in the polymer propagation . 
metallocene / borate catalysts , generated from zirconocene dimethyl compounds , LnZrMe2 , and anilinium borate , [HNMe2Ph]+[B(C6F5)4] - , were used to copolymerize 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene with 1-hexene and 4-methyl-1-pentene . the selected zirconocenes , bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium(IV) dimethyl ( Cp*2ZrMe2 ) and rac-ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium(IV) dimethyl ( rac - EB(THI)ZrMe2 ) , provided atactic and isotactic materials , respectively . the isotactic polymers produced were amorphous or crystalline depending of the monomer . the calculated reactivity ratios for the copolymerization of 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene with 1-hexene and metallocene rac-EB(T-HI)ZrMe2 indicate that this system approximates an ideal azeotropic copolymerization with r1 = <nUm> and r2 = <nUm> . estimates for the reactivity ratios for the copolymerization of 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene with 4-methyl-1-pentene were r1 = <nUm> and r2 = <nUm> for rac - EB(THI)ZrMe2 and r1 = <nUm> and r2 = <nUm> for Cp*2ZrMe2 . the polymerization of 1-hexene in the presence of the saturated 1-N,N-diisopropylaminopentane with rac - EBCTHDZrMe2 / borate was compared with analogous copolymerizations of 1-hexene / 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene . the aminopentene was more effective than the aminopentane in inhibiting the rate of total monomer conversion , implicating both intra- and intermolecular mechanisms for inhibition by the amine . copolymers of 4-methyl-1-pentene / 5-N,N-diisopropylamino-1-pentene produced with rac-ethylenebisindenyl zirconium(IV) dimethyl ( rac - EBIZrMe2 ) / borate have higher decomposition temperatures with increasing amounts of aminopentene . this copolymer can be protonated with ClH to yield a methanol - soluble material . 
alkyl zirconocenes [Zr(e-C5H4R)2X2] ( where r = CH2Ph , x = Cl 1a or me 1b ; r = CHPh2 , x = Cl 2a or me 2b ; r = Si(SiMe3)3 , x = Cl 4a or me 4b ) and for comparison [ Zr(e-C5H5)(e-C5H4CH 2Ph)Cl2 ] 3a were prepared and characterised . the reactions of these compounds with the methide abstracting reagents BC18F15 , B(o-C6F5C6F4)3 and [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4] - were investigated by low temperature NMR spectroscopy . compound 1b reacts with [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4] - to form the homodinuclear complex [ {Zr(e-C5H4CH2Ph)2Me} 2(m-Me)]+[B(C6F5) 4]- . the related compound [ {Zr(C5H4CH2Ph)2Me} 2(m-Me)]+[MeB(C6F5) 3]- 5a was formed from the reaction of 1b with <nUm> equivalent of BC18F15 . reaction between 1b and <nUm> equivalent BC18F15 gave [ Me(e-C5H4CH2Ph) 2Zr(m-Me)B(C6F5)3 ] 6a and the ion pair [Zr(e-C5H4CH2Ph)2Me][MeB(C 6F5)3 ] 6b which are in equilibrium with each other . A similar observation was made when 2b was used instead of 1b . the sterically more demanding 4b does not show this behaviour . the role of the ligands in ethylene polymerisation was investigated . 
three possible mechanisms of ethylene polymerization in the presence of zirconocene catalysts have been described through density functional calculations . about <nUm> structures ( reactants , intermediates , transition states , and products ) have been located on the potential energy surface . only two mechanisms , called frontside and stepwise backside , appear to be competitive . the frontside mechanism has already been described in the literature , but we present here some important new aspects . In particular , we discuss the important role of the perpendicular form of the olefin p-complex for the frontside process . the stepwise backside mechanism is reported for the first time . the energy barriers in both mechanisms are on the order of <nUm> kcal / mol , which is compatible with the experimental and theoretical values available for similar processes . the energy difference between both mechanisms is certainly below the computational method accuracy , and a definitive conclusion regarding the most favorable mechanism can not be drawn . the influence of other factors such as substituents on the catalysts or the size of the polymer chain could be fundamental . 
(e2-Formaldehyde)zirconocene dimer ( 8 ) cleanly adds one or two molar equivalents of the borane BC12F10H by insertion of the H-[B] unit into the zirconium-carbon bond of the metallaoxirane moleties to form the mono- and bis-insertion products <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . these systems contain five - membered heterocyclic rings that are built up by connecting five different elements , namely H , B , C , O , and Zr . the bis(borane) insertion product <nUm> was characterized by an x-ray crystal structure analysis . (Butadiene)zirconocene reacts with BC12F10H in a similar way by insertion of the H-[B] unit into the (butadiene)C4-Zr linkage to form the metallacycle <nUm> . 
the tricyclic zirconocene - phosphaalkyne dimer complex <nUm> reacts with diethyl mesoxalate ( 5 ) or tetracyanoethene ( 7 ) through Cp2Zr-displacement to furnish the novel oxadiphosphatricyclohexane <nUm> or the diphosphatricyclohexane <nUm> , respectively . In contrast , treatment of <nUm> with indanetrione ( 9 ) results in the formation of the dioxadiphosphatricyclooctene <nUm> , which has been characterized by x-ray structure analysis . 
ethylbisindenyl zirconium dichloride ( Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) and the MAO methylalumoxane ( MAO ) co-catalyst were heterogenized on davision silica <nUm> partially dehydroxylated at <nUm> ° C , following the concept of equilibrium adsorption . the influence of MAO on the electronic environment resulting from the heterogenization was investigated using XPS . heterogenization of Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and MAO on the above silica generated two types of zirconocenium cations ( cation <nUm> and cation <nUm> ) , independent of the heterogenization methods . based on the postulated surface chemistry , cation <nUm> is presumed to be in the form of an ion - pair [SiO]-[Et(Ind)2ZrCl]+ , whereas cation <nUm> is presumed to be a trapped multi-coordinated crown complex of MAO . In the absence of MAO , only cation <nUm> is formed . the present study provides some support for the postulated surface chemistry regarding heterogenization of Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and MAO on silica . 
carbon-carbon bond - forming reactions of allylic organometals have been recognized as one of the most fundamental means in organic synthesis , and a number of applications for the synthesis of biologically active molecules have been reported . we have reported the carbon-carbon bond - forming reactions by the use of the allylic and related zirconium species as reactive intermediates . these zirconium species can be generated by treating allylic ethers with zirconocene - butene complex ( " Cp2Zr " ) through the formation of zirconacyclopropane and the following b-elimination of the alkoxy group . this process was found to be applicable to generate the γ , g-dialkoxyallylic zirconium species <nUm> from orthoacrylate derivative . zirconium species <nUm> possibly has three reactive sites : one is the g-position as a typical allyl metal species , the other is the b-position followed by the a-position initiated by nucleophilic character of ketene dialkylacetal moiety and the third one is regioselective coupling reaction at the a-position . thus , g,g-dialkoxyallylic zirconium species <nUm> can be conveniently prepared by the reaction of triethyl orthoacrylate with " Cp2Zr " . without an additive , <nUm> itself reacts with aldehydes and ketones at the g-position to afford the gem-diethoxy homoallylic alcohol derivatives . under lewis acid promoted conditions , this zirconium species <nUm> reacts with a variety of carbonyl compounds selectively at the b-position in the first step , followed by the cyclopropanation or cyclobutanation reaction to afford the corresponding products mainly depending on electronic nature of substrates or reaction conditions . In the presence of CCuN , reaction of <nUm> with allylic phosphates proceeded at the a-position of <nUm> in a highly SN2'- selective manner to give the 5-alkenoates .

novel fl / iya - metallocene complexes containing bis(indenyl) ligands bridged at <nUm> position were obtained . ethylene or trimethylene bridged type zirconocene was synthesized from bis(p-tolyl)ethane or bis(p-tolyl)propane as starting material , respectively . dimethylsilylene bridged type zirconocene was prepared from the protected 4-bromo-l-indanone derivative . it turned out that meso-C2H4[4,4'(2,7-dimethylindenyl)2]ZrCl2 and 7-flc-Me2Si[4,4'-(2-methylindenyl)2]ZrCl2 were suitable catalysts for producing ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers ith high molecular weight . highly isotactic polypropylene was obtained by using rac-MejSiXS-methyl-l-phenylindenyOJZrClj catalyst and contained only small amounts of 3,1-type regiodefects . the molecular structures of these complexes were confirmed by x-ray analysis . 
the dipeptide derivatives Boc-Gly-Val-OMe ( 2 ) and Boc-Ala-Val-OMe ( 3 ) selectively add the methylzirconocene cation <nUm> to the carbonyl oxygen atom of the N - terminal amino acid residue ( K-C4 = O coordination ) upon treatment with [Cp2ZrCH3(THF)+BPh4-] in dichloromethane at low temperature ( < <nUm> ° C ) to generate the complexes 2-1 and 3-1 , respectively . above <nUm> ° C methane is eliminated to give the stable chelate peptide metallocene cation complexes 2- A and 3-A , respectively , both featuring a combined C1 = O / N / C4 = O coordination to the zirconium center . complex 3-A was characterized by x-ray diffraction . the analogous tripeptide derivatives Boc-Gly-Val-Val-OMe ( 6 ) , Boc-Ala-Ala-Val-OMe ( 7 ) , Boc-Ala-Val-Val-OMe ( 8 ) , and Boc-Val-Val-Gly-OMe ( 9 ) all form analogous K-C4 = O Cp2ZrCH3+ cation adducts (6-9)I under kinetic control and after subsequent loss of CH4 C1 = O / N / C4 = O chelate complexes (8-9)-A under thermodynamic control , both involving selective bonding of the organometallic cation to the terminal amino acid residue of the respective peptide derivatives . thermolysis of the primary adduct 7-I ( > <nUm> ° C ) resulted in methane elimination and formation of a mixture of the isomers 7-B and 7-A ( isolated in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio ) . according to the detailed NMR analysis 7-A shows the favored chelate coordination at the N - terminus involving C1 = O / N / C4 = O bonding , whereas the cation complex 7-B exhibits a similar chelate structure at the internal ala moiety , characterized by C4 = <nUm> / N5 / C7 = O coordination to the zirconium center . similarly , methane liberation from 8-I and 9-I gave mixtures of the respective cationic chelate complex isomers 8-A / 8-C ( <nUm> : <nUm> ) and 9-A / 9-C ( <nUm> : <nUm> ) , respectively . the (8,9)-A isomers have the zirconium ion bonded at the N - terminus , whereas (8,9)-C exhibit the Cp2Zr+ unit at the C- terminus of the peptide chain , involving the ester carbonyl group in forming the chelate framework ( C7 = O / N8 / C10 = O coordination ) . the (6-9)-A isomers are thermodynamically favored . the cation complexes 7-B , 8-C , 9-C rearrange to the a-type isomers upon prolonged standing at temperatures > <nUm> ° C in dichloromethane solution . 
interactions between zirconocene or benzyne zirconocene and unsaturated species incorporating main group elements lead to a variety of new metallaheterocycles . efficient new methodologies of regiospecific syntheses of mono- , bi- , or tricyclic systems incorporating phosphorus , nitrogen , selenium , antimony , germanium or tin are reported . 
copolymerization of ethylene / 1-octene with three ansa - zirconocene / MAO catalyst systems were investigated . the polymerization activity is dependent upon the influence of electronic effects . it decreases in the following order ; C 6H <nUm> ( CH <nUm> ) 2Cp 2ZrCl <nUm> > C 5H 3N(CH <nUm> ) 2Cp 2ZrCl <nUm> > CH 3N(CH <nUm> ) 2ZrCl <nUm> . the composition and sequence distribution of copolymer were calculated from 13C - NMR spectra . it was found that the activityes of three ansacatalysts were lower than Et(Ind) 2ZrCl <nUm> under the same 1-octeone concentration . and their copolymer had lower 1-octene incorporation than that of Et(Ind) 2ZrCl <nUm> . other properties such as molecular wieght , melting point of copolymer were compared . 
analysis of the published data on the interaction between the components of a zirconocene-poly(methylaluminoxane) system used as the catalyst of olefin polymerization indicates that the yield of the reaction product , methane , is virtually independent of the concentration of the components over a wide concentration range . it is assumed that methane is formed in the absence of the monomer on the catalytic site of polymerization formed by the interaction of the major components and the activating admixtures , including uncontrollable admixtures ( H2O , O ) . under specified conditions , it is the admixtures that control the concentration of the catalytic centers and the methane yield . for this reason , the yield of methane is independent of the concentration of zirconocene and poly(methylaminoxane) . 
the solid - state structures of three zirconocene aryl sulfonates were determined . In Cp2Zr(OSO2C6H5)2 ( 1 ) , one of the sulfonate ligands is monodentate , the other bidentate coordinated . Cp2Zr(OSO2-4-C6H4Cl)2 ( 2 ) and Cp2Zr(OSO2-3,4-C6H3Cl 2)2 ( 3 ) are dimers of pentacoordinated zirconocenes with two monodentate sulfonates and a double bridge of m-O,mu;-O'-sulfonates . A possible explanation for the formation of the solid - state structures is offered in terms of differences in electron density of the sulfonate oxygen atoms . <nUm> : C22H20O6S2Zr , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , triclinic , P1 , z = <nUm> . <nUm> : C22Cl2H18O6S2Zr , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , triclinic , P1 , z = <nUm> . <nUm> : C22Cl4H16O6S2Zr , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> ° , β = <nUm> ° , γ = <nUm> ° , triclinic , P1 , z = <nUm> .

unexpected inactive byproducts were observed in the catalytic polymerization of acetylene using metallocene alkyne complexes Cp2M(L)(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) , <nUm> : m = Ti , without L ; <nUm> : m = Zr , L = thf . the reaction of <nUm> was investigated in detail by NMR to give quantitatively at <nUm> ° C the titanacyclopentadiene Cp2Ti-CH = CH - C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3) ( 3 ) . around <nUm> ° C <nUm> starts to rearrange to yield the dihydroindenyl complex <nUm> via coupling of one cp - ligand with the titanacyclopentadiene . In the reaction of <nUm> under analogous conditions a zirconacyclopentadiene Cp2Zr-CH = CH - C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3) ( 5 ) and the dimeric complex [ Cp2Zr(C(SiMe3) = CH(SiMe3) ] 2[m-s(1,2)-C ≡ C ] ( 6 ) were observed . whereas <nUm> decomposes to a mixture of unidentified paramagnetic species , <nUm> was isolated and investigated by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray analysis . In the reaction of rac-(ebthi)Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) ( ebthi = ethylenbis-tetrahydroindenyl ) with 2-ethynyl-pyridine the complex rac - (ebthi)ZrC(SiMe3) = CH(SiMe3)](s-C ≡ CPy ) <nUm> was obtained , which was investigated by an x-ray analysis . 
In reactions of Cp2ZrCl{(m-H)2BC5H10} , <nUm> , with HLi , cl- is replaced to produce Cp2ZrH{(m-H)2BC5H10} , <nUm> . reaction of <nUm> with K[H2BC5H10] yields Cp2Zr{(m-H)2BC5H10}2 , <nUm> . the methyl-substituted compound Cp2Zr-(CH3{(m-H)2BC5H <nUm> } , <nUm> , is prepared from the reaction of Cp2ZrCl(CH3) with K[H2BC5H10] . the synthetic route for the preparation of <nUm> prevents side reactions that occur in the direct alkylation of zirconocene organohydroborate complexes . proton NMR spectra of <nUm> at elevated temperatures indicate that intramolecular hydrogen exchange occurs among Zr-H-B hydrogens , terminal H on Zr , and cp hydrogens . the structures of <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> are reported . crystal data for <nUm> : space group abm2 ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , z = <nUm> . crystal data for <nUm> : space group pbca ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , z = <nUm> . crystal data for <nUm> : space group C2 / c ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> . 
new types of silacyclobutene derivatives were synthesized by zirconocene- and titanocene-ethylene complexes - promoted reactions of some rac - dialkynyldiarylsilanes . 
the norbornene / ethylene copolymerization was investigated by using me 2SiCp 2MtCl <nUm> ( Mt = Zr , TO / MAO catalyst system . the copolymerization kinetics was studied under different conditions . the copolymer was characterized by DSC and 13C - NMR methods . it was found the zirconocene has better catalyst ability for copolymerization of ethylene and norbornene than titanocene . under similar feed ratio , the copolymers with high norbornene content and glass transition temperature were synthesized compared with literature . 
analysis of the published data on the interaction between the components of a zirconocene-poly(methylaluminoxane) system used as the catalyst of olefin polymerization indicates that the yield of the reaction product , methane , is virtually independent of the concentration of the components over a wide concentration range . it is assumed that methane is formed in the absence of the monomer on the catalytic site of the process formed by the interaction of the major components and the activating admixtures , including uncontrollable admixtures ( H2O , O ) . under specified conditions , it is the admixtures that control the concentration of the catalytic centers and the methane yield . for this reason , the yield of methane is independent of the concentration of zirconocene and poly(methylaminoxane) . 
the biphenyl-bridged , chiral zirconocene complex rac-2,2'-biphenyl-bis(3,4-dimethylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride catalyzes the reaction of 1,6-and 1,7-dienes with excess dibutyl magnesium to bis (butyl-magnesio-methyl)-substituted cycloalkane derivatives . analogous reactions occur with butyl magnesium chloride and with heteroatom - containing dienes . the preference of 1,6-dienes for trans-fused cyclization products and that of 1,7-dienes for cis-fusion at ambient and for trans-fusion at elevated temperatures is similar to that observed before for unsubstituted zirconocene complexes . the r-enantiomer of the biphenyl-bridged zirconocene complex gives trans-fused cyclization products with an optical purity of only <nUm> ± <nUm> % ee . the stereochemistry of these cyclomagnesation reactions is explained in terms of the relative rates of mutually competing cyclization and transmetalation steps . 
the syntheses of the doubly - [SiMe2] - bridged zirconocene complexes , (Me2Si)2{e5-C5H 2-4-CHMe2}{e5-C5H-3,5-(CHMe 2)2}ZrR2 ( r = Cl ( 2 ) ; r = CH2Ph ( 3 ) ; r = CH3 ( 4 ) ) are described . the structure of (Me2Si)2{e5-C5H 2-4-CHMe2}{e5-C5H-3,5-(CHMe 2)2}-Zr(CH2Ph)2 ( 3 ) has been examined by single crystal x-ray diffraction methods . it crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-1 , with a = <nUm> , b = <nUm> , c = <nUm> Å , α = <nUm> , β = <nUm> , γ = <nUm> ° and z = <nUm> . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> are active stereospecific pre-catalysts for the [Ph3C] [B(C6F5)4] co-catalyzed polymerization of 1-pentene . polymerization reactions at low temperature in liquid monomer produced poly(1-pentene) with syndiotactic microstructure and narrow molecular weight distribution . by contrast , in 1-pentene / toluene solutions a broad molecular weight distribution is observed . under all conditions examined <nUm> / MAO systems produced high molecular weight , highly syndiotactic poly-1-pentene with narrow molecular weight distributions . 
A reduction of previously reported 2-methoxyethyl and 2-methylthioethyl functionalized zirconocenedichlorides ( e5-C5Me4CH2-CH 2EMe)(e5-C5Me5)ZrCl2 ( e = O , S ) and ( e5-C5Me4CH2CH 2EMe)(e5-C5Me4CH 2CH2E'Me)ZrCl2 ( e = O , S ; E' = O , S ) with Mg / Hg in THF leads unexpectedly to the products of O-Me and S-Me bond cleavage ( e5,s-C5Me4CH2CH 2E)(e5-C5Me5)ZrMe ( e = O , S ) , ( e5,s-C5Me4CH2CH 2E)(e5-C5Me4CH 2CH2E'Me)ZrMe ( e = O , S ; E' = O ) , and ( e5,s-C5Me4CH2CH 2S)2Zr respectively . the crystal structure of ( e5,s-C5Me4CH2CH 2S)2Zr was established by x-ray analysis . At the same time the reduction of ( e5-C5Me4CH2CH 2EMe)(e5-C5Me5)ZrCl2 ( e = O , S ) under <nUm> atm of CO gives either only the usual dicarbonyl derivative ( e5-C5Me4CH2CH 2EMe)(e5-C5Me5)Zr(CO) <nUm> ( e = O ) or a complex mixture of products ( e = S ) . 
bridged ligands 4,4-di(cyclopentadienyl)-N-methylpiperidine ( 4 ) and 4,4-di(indenyl)-N-methylpiperidine ( 5 ) were prepared by condensation of cyclopentadiene or indene with n-methylpiperidone . dilithium salts 4a and 5a were subsequently transformed into the corresponding ansa - zirconocenes <nUm> and <nUm> . No direct contact Zr ⋯ N was found in the crystal structure of <nUm> . the attempt to prepare zirconocene <nUm> from distannyl derivative 5b gave an unexpected monoindenyl complex <nUm> comprising one unreacted stannylated indenyl group and having direct coordination of Zr by nitrogen . 
ethylene-bridged bis(N,N-diisopropyl-1-aminoboratabenzene-4-yl)zirconium dichloride ( 5a ) , dimethylsilyl-bridged bist(N,N-diisopropyl-1-aminoboratabenzene-4-yl)zirconium dichloride ( 7a ) , and dimethylmethylene-bridged (cyclopentadienyl)(N,N-diisopropyl-1-aminoboratabenzene-4-yl)zirconium dichloride ( 6a ) have been prepared . x-ray crystal structures of the dimethyl derivatives of <nUm> and <nUm> show that the complexes closely resemble the corresponding ansa - zirconocenes . when activated by excess methylaluminoxane , 5a , 6a , and 7a are catalysts for the polymerization of olefins . 
the tantalum carborane complex (Et2C2B4H4)CpTaMe2 ( 1 ) is thermally stable but undergoes clean photochemical insertion with alkynes to give vinyltantalum species , in contrast to the thermal reactivity of isoelectronic group <nUm> metallocenes which give methylidene intermediates . certain tantalum vinyltitanium products display NMR resonances indicative of g-agostic Ta-H3C interactions sufficiently strong to stabilize two different regioisomers . decomposition of these species occurs by apparent alkyne deinsertion and ejection of the tantalum fragment to give R2Et2C4B4H4 ( r = me , et , ph ) carborane clusters . the analogous diphenyl complex (Et2C2B4H4)CpTaPh2 ( 8 ) is thermally reactive , eliminating benzene and undergoing trapping reactions of the derived benzyne intermediate with alkynes . the structures of the resulting metallaindene complexes are supported by x-ray crystallography , protonolysis , and spectroscopy . insertions occur with good regioselectivity , controlled by steric and stereoelectronic factors that differ somewhat from those observed for zirconocene and titanocene analogues . reaction of complex <nUm> with excess styrene results in a novel triple - insertion process in which styrene units are added to both ortho positions of an aryl ligand and to the central boron atom of the B3C2 ring . the proposed mechanism ( supported by the use of styrene-d8 and alkylated metallacarborane starting materials ) features two benzyne intermediates , derived from activation of both ortho-CH bonds , and one insertion into a putative Ta-B bond . an important hypothesis is that a Ta-C fragment can undergo intramolecular insertion into a carborane B-H bond , a step unknown for cyclopentadienyl C-H bonds and one that is potentially relevant to the use of metallacarborane complexes as catalysts for olefin polymerization and related processes . 
zirconocene - coupling of ( -C ≡ C10H17O 2CH2C ≡ c-arylene-)n polymers , followed by hydrolysis , provides a convenient , versatile route to soluble , diene-arylene polymers . 
the alternating copolymerization of styrene ( st ) and ethylene ( et ) with high stereo - regularity were monitored by using rac[isopropylidenebis(benzindenyl)] zirconocene catalysts under reduced temperature conditions . the 13C - NMR spectra of the polymers were measured using a spectrometer . the DSC measurement was carried out under flowing N at a temperature rate of <nUm> ° C / min . In general , significant results were obtained . 
we investigated copolymerization of propylene and allylmercaptan as a commercially available sulfur containing monomer . after protection of mercapto group with alkylaluminum , the copolymerization was conducted by isotactic ansa - zirconocene / methylaluminoxane catalysts . polypropylene containing sulfur was obtained with triisobutylaluminum - protected allylmercaptan monomer , while the no polymer was obtained with trimethylaluminum - protected allylmercaptan . structure of the products was investigated by NMR and GPC , and it was revealed that end sulfurizated polymer was mainly produced . 
the polymerization behavior of three linear asymmetrically substituted dienes , i.e. 6-phenyl-1,5-hexadiene ( A ) , 7-methyl-1,6-octadiene ( B ) and r(+)-5,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene ( isocitronellene , C ) is reported in order to study the effect of substitution at one vinylic group . homopolymerization of these monomers with the catalyst system rac-Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 / MAO resulted in no reaction products in the case of monomer A and in polymers with mw , = <nUm> kg / mol and mw = <nUm> kg / mol with the monomers B and C , respectively . according to NMR analysis , the vinylene end group of isocitronellene remained untouched during polymerization , which excludes the possibility of cyclopolymerization or crosslinking . copolymerization of isocitronellene with propene resulted in incorporation of the diene ( <nUm> mol- % ) equal to the stoichiometric ratio in the monomer feed , with a relatively high catalyst activity . the degree of incorporated isocitronellene is inversely related to the polymerization temperature , providing control over crystallinity ( isotacticity ) and molecular weight of the copolymer . the isocitronellene homo- and copolymers could be epoxidized quantitatively and brominated to an extent of <nUm> % . perfluorohexyl iodide was grafted onto the isocitronellene / propene copolymer by radical reaction ( conversion <nUm> % ) , yielding a poly(a-olefin) with fluorinated side chains .

two series of solution polymerizations of propene were conducted : ( i ) using three different methylaluminoxane (MAO)-activated zirconocenes , rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( EI ) , rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( MI ) , and rac-Me2Si(Benz-[e]-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( MBI ) , at the same temperature ( <nUm> ° C ) and varying propene pressure from <nUm> to <nUm> bar and ( ii ) using rac-Me2Si(Benz-[e]-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( MBI ) at the propene partial pressure <nUm> bar and at a range of temperatures from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C ( ind = indenyl ) . 1H and 13C NMR investigation of the unsaturated chain end groups in these samples was performed , with particular attention being paid to ( i ) a detailed re-examination of the NMR assignments reported in the literature , ( ii ) the distinction between unsaturated species formed during the polymerization reactions and those formed afterward due to thermal treatment ( i.e. during the NMR experiments ) , ( iii ) determination of the dependence of the quantities of different types of terminals on the polymerization conditions ( temperature and monomer partial pressure ) . it was shown that four unsaturated chain end groups are formed during polymerization , that is , vinylidene , 2-butenyl , allyl , and the previously unidentified 4-butenyl terminals . In the oligomeric fraction of samples , no further types of unsaturated terminals were observed . two further types of unsaturated groups observed , isobutenyl and the unidentified species x , were not formed during polymerization but , at least prevalently , afterward during the high - temperature NMR experiments . A previously unidentified regiomisinsertion , lateral n-butyl , is also described . 
proton and 11B NMR investigations of two zirconocene boracycloalkane derivatives A and B , as a function of temperature , identified two hydrogens bridged between boron and zirconium and a third attached only to zirconium . observation of the 11B decoupled proton NMR lineshape of A and B ( toluene-d8 solution ) revealed a fast intramolecular mutual exchange of the two bridged hydrogens and a slower process which exchanges each of the latter with the single hydrogen bonded to zirconium alone . comparison of the observed 11B decoupled proton NMR spectra with calculated lineshapes which take account of the exchange processes yielded the corresponding rates and activation parameters . proton NMR data for A and B ( with 11B coupled ) indicate spin coupling between 11B and the bridge hydrogens of ca. <nUm> Hz , subject to averaging by 11B nuclear electric quadrupole induced relaxation ; its rate increases with decreasing temperature . thus , the coupling is averaged at the lower temperatures due to 11B relaxation and on warming becomes obscured as a result of hydrogen exchange . analysis of these latter lineshapes taking account of exchange dynamics , 11B relaxation and the 11B proton coupling constant provided dynamic parameters closely similar to those obtained from the 11B decoupled proton NMR data . At elevated temperature ( <nUm> ° C ) , broadening of the cp proton resonance indicates that these protons undergo slow exchange with the three hydrido hydrogens . 
ansa - ligands , me <nUm> Si(RInd) <nUm> [ r = 2-p ( 1 ) and 3-p-tolyl ( 2 ) ] , have been prepared as a mixture of rac- and meso-isomers in a ratio of <nUm> : <nUm> from the reactions of me <nUm> ClSi <nUm> with cyanocuprates of 1-p-tolylindene and 2-p-tolylindene in diethyl ether , respectively . pure rac - isomers , 1r and 2r , have been isolated by fractional recrystallization of <nUm> and <nUm> . thermal diastereomerization of <nUm> and <nUm> between rac- and meso-isomers has been studied by <nUm> H - NMR spectroscopy . these results imply that <nUm> and <nUm> undergo the diastereomerization process by migration of silicon moiety and hydrogen atom , respectively . ansa - zirconocenes , me <nUm> Si(RInd) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> [ r = 2-p ( 3 ) and 3-p-tolyl ( 4 ) ] , have been prepared from the reactions of the corresponding dilithiated ligands with ClZr <nUm> in diethyl ether and hexane at <nUm> ° C . the molecular structure of rac-3 has been determined by a single crystal x-ray diffraction study . propylene polymerization has been studied using rac-3 and meso-4 in the presence of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . catalyst rac-3 produces a highly isotactic polypropylene ( PP ) at <nUm> ° C by the enantiomorphic site control mechanism and meso-4 affords a syndiotactic dominant PP having a rr triad of <nUm> % at - <nUm> ° C by the chain end control mechanism . 
reactions of Cp2Zr(thf)(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ( 1 ) and rac-(ebthi)Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) ( <nUm> ; ebthi = 1,2-ethylene-1,1'-bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl) ) with 2-vinylpyridine lead , under elimination of the alkyne , to the five - membered azazirconacycles , which are best described as 1-zircona-2-azacyclopent-3-enes ( 1-azadiene complexes ) . one of these complexes couples with ethylene to yield a stable a-2-pyridyl-substituted zirconacyclopentane and reacts in a <nUm> : <nUm> ratio with water to yield a b-2-pyridyl-substituted dimeric s-ethylzirconoxane . In the reaction of the 2-derived complex with BF4H , rac-[1,2-ethylene-1,1'-bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl)]zirconium difluoride was obtained . both 1-zircona-2-azacyclopent-3-enes insert carbon dioxide to give structurally different binuclear carbonate - bridged complexes . 
the organotin compound (e5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)tin tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( 1 ) has been synthesized from a reaction between (pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)tin chloride and lithium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate . this cation proved to be an effective ziegler - natta a-olefin cocatalyst . activities for ethylene polymerizations using dimethylzirconocene and <nUm> were <nUm> × <nUm> g of PE / ( mol of 1*[C2H4]*h ) at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> × <nUm> g of PE / ( mol of 1*[C2H4]*h ) at <nUm> ° C . this system was also effective for the polymerization of propylene . activities using rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)-dimethylzirconium with the tin cation were <nUm> × <nUm> g of PP / ( mol of 1*[C3H6]*h ) . activities increased markedly when using zirconocene dichlorides / tri(i-butyl)aluminum / <nUm> . activities for ethylene polymerization using zirconocene dichloride / tri(i-butyl)aluminum / <nUm> at <nUm> ° C were <nUm> × <nUm> g of PE / ( mol of 1*[C2H4]*h ) . activities for the polymerization of propylene using rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride / tri(i-butyl)aluminum / <nUm> at <nUm> ° C were <nUm> × <nUm> g of PP / ( mol of 1*[C3H6]*h ) . 
A well known catalytic system for the oligomerization of 1-alkenes is zirconocene dichloride ( Cp2ZrCl2 ) , when activated by a large excess of methylalumoxane ( MAO ) . surprisingly , when activated by only <nUm> equiv. of MAO , Cp2ZrCl2 selectively and catalytically dimerizes a-olefins without formation of any higher oligomeric species . this reaction is shown to be general for a number of a-olefins . the conversion of o-diallylbenzene gives a seven - membered cyclic product in an intramolecular dimerization reaction . A possible mechanism for the dimerization process involving a zirconium - hydrido species as the catalyst is formulated , and evidence for it is given by detection of by - products and a deuteration experiment . 
equilibrium constants have been determined for the formation of <nUm> different zirconocene monomethyl monochloro complexes from the respective dichloride complexes and AlC3H9 . the results indicate that the tendency of a particular zirconocene complex to exchange a chloride against a methyl ligand is a measure for the electron deficiency at its Zr center . the results indicate particularly low electron densities for complexes with indenyl instead of cyclopentadienyl ligands , especially for those containing a dimethylsilyl bridge . only one methyl group is transferred to a zirconocene dichloride even by a large excess of AlC3H9 , while the uptake of two alkyl groups , followed by alkane evolution , is observed with triethyl and triisobutyl aluminum . 
fulvenes ( 1a-e ) derived from condensation of cyclopentadiene with acetone or a variety of aldehydes were treated with Ar2LiP ( Ar = phenyl , p-tolyl ) to yield the respective substituted (diarylphosphinomethyl)cyclopentadienides ( <nUm> , <nUm> ) . subsequent reaction with Cl4Zr (THF)2 gave the respective bis [(diarylphosphinomethyl)cyclopentadienyl] zirconium dichlorides ( Ar = phenyl ( 4 ) , p-tolyl ( 5 ) ) . the complex rac-[C5H4-CH(CH3)-PPh2] 2ZrCl2 ( rac-4b ) was characterized by x-ray diffraction . the reaction of complexes 4a and 5a [(Cp-CMe2-PAr2)2ZrCl2] with PdCl2(NCPh)2 or PtCl2(NCPh)2 leads to the formation of the trans-(metallocene-chelate-phosphane)metal complexes 6-9 ( e.g. trans-Cl2Pd(Ph2P-CMe2-Cp)2ZrCl <nUm> ] . chloride abstraction from the reaction product of [Cp-CH(CMe3)PPh2]2ZrCl2 with PdCl2(NCPh)2 eventually gave the cationic complex [ meso,trans-(Cp-CH(CMe3)PPh2) 2(Cl)Zr(m-Cl)Pd(Cl)]+ ( 10 ) that was also characterized by x-ray diffraction . it features a dimetallabicyclic framework with two Cp-CHR-PPh2 ligands and a chloride bridging between the early and the late transition metal center . 
this paper is a review concerning metallic derivatives linked to the surface of phosphorus - containing dendrimers , that are dendrimers possessing one phosphorus at each branching point . the sythetic aspects will be described first , concerning in particular the complexation of transition metals ( Fe , W , Rh , Pt , Pd , Ru ) by monophosphine or diphosphine end groups , the grafting of metallocene derivatives ( zirconocene and ferrocene ) , and the interaction with various clusters ( Au-Fe , Au , Ti ) . some applications of these metallo phosphorus dendrimers will be described in the field of materials science ( modification of the surface of existing materials or creation of new materials ) , and in the field of catalysis ( stille couplings , knoevenagel condensations , michael additions ) . 
rotational barriers about the M-S bonds of 16-electron bent metallocene monothiolates (e5-C5H5)2Zr(Cl) ( SR ) ( r = -CH3 , -CH2CH3 , -CH(CH3)2 , -C(CH3)3 ) ( 1a-d ) have been measured by dynamic 1H NMR methods : <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> kJ mol-1 , respectively . the groundstate orientation about the Zr-S bonds of <nUm> that maximizes spp → mdp bonding ( Cl-Zr-S-R ≈ <nUm> ° ) also maximizes cp ↔ r steric interaction , whereas the rotational transition - state orientation ( Cl-Zr-S-R ≈ <nUm> ° ) is one that minimizes spp → mdp bonding and maximizes Cl ↔ r steric interaction . deviation from a ground - state orientation that is ideal for spp → mdp bonding might be expected as the size of the r group and cp ↔ r steric interaction increases . thus , the aberrant trend for the r = -C(CH3)3 derivative could be attributed to a ground - state steric effect where the sterically demanding -C(CH3)3 group forces an unfavorable ( misdirected ) orientation for Mdp-Spp bonding , but a favorable orientation with respect to cp ↔ r and Cl ↔ r steric interactions . however , the solid - state structures of (e5-C5H5)2Zr(SR)2 ( r = -CH3 , -CH2CH3 , -CH(CH3)2 , -C(CH3)3 ) ( 2a-d ) exhibit regular variation of their metric parameters as evidenced by their Zr-S-C bond angles of <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , and <nUm> ° and S-Zr-S' bond angles of <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> and <nUm> ° , respectively . neither the S'-Zr-S-R torsion angles nor the dihedral angles that describe the relationship between the S / Zr / S' and cp(centroid) / Zr / cp' ( centroid ) planes ( both indicators of the relative orientation of the Zr dp acceptor orbital and the thiolate S pp donor orbital ) reflect the steric demand of the r group . thus , the size of the r group imposes a measured effect on the geometry of <nUm> and the tert-butyl group is not extraordinary . although the enthalpic and entropic effects could not be deconvoluted for rotation about the Zr-S bond of <nUm> in the present study , literature precedents suggest that both enthalpic and entropic effects may play a role in determining the irregular trend that is observed . 
intramolecular cocyclisation of 4-azaocta-1,7-dienes , -1-en-7-ynes , -7- en-1-ynes and -1,7-diynes using ' zirconocene ' equivalents affords 3-aza-8- zirconabicyclo[4.3.0]nonanes , -6-enes , -9-enes or -6,9-dienes . protonolysis , iodinolysis , or carbonylation of these complexes affords 3,4-disubstitued piperidines . exocyclic 1,3-dienes formed from the coupling / protonolysis of 4- azaocta-1,7-diynes react with activated dienophiles to yield reduced isoquinolines .

{ [ 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl ] cyclopentadienyl } titanium trichloride ( CpNTiCl3 , <nUm> ) was activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) to catalyze polymerizations of ethylene ( e ) , propylene ( P ) , ethylidene norbornene ( ENB ) , vinylcyclohexene ( VCH ) , and 1,4-hexadiene ( HD ) . the dependence of homopolymerization activity ( A ) of <nUm> / MAO on olefin concentration ( [M]n ) is n = <nUm> ± <nUm> for e and n = <nUm> ± <nUm> for P . the value of n is <nUm> ± <nUm> for CpTiCl3 / MAO catalysis of ethylene polymerization ; this system does not polymerize propylene . <nUm> / MAO catalyzes HD polymerization at one - tenth of AH for 1-hexene , probably because of chelation effects in the HD case . the copolymerization of e and P has reactivity ratios of rE = <nUm> and rP = <nUm> at <nUm> ° C , and rErP = <nUm> , which suggests <nUm> / MAO may be a multisite catalyst . the copolymerization activity of CpTiCl3 / MAO is <nUm> times smaller than that of CpNTiCl3 / MAO . terpolymerization of e / P / ENB has A of <nUm> g of polymer / ( mol of Ti h ) , incorporates up to <nUm> mol % ( ̃ <nUm> wt % ) of ENB , and high MW 's of <nUm> to <nUm> x <nUm> . all of these parameters are surprisingly insensitive to the ENB concentration . the e / P / VCH terpolymerization has comparable A value of ( <nUm> ± <nUm> ) x <nUm> g / ( mol of Ti h ) . the incorporation of VCH in terpolymer increases with increasing [VCH] . terpolymerization with HD occurs at about one - third of the A of either ENB or VCH ; the product HD - EPDM is low in molecular weight and contains less than <nUm> % of HD . these terpolymerization results are compared with those obtained previously for three zirconocene precursors : rac-ethylenebis(1-e5-inde-nyl) dichlorozirconium ( 6 ) , rac- ( dimethylsilylene ) bis ( 1-e5-indenyl ) dichlorozirconium ( 7 ) , and ethylenebis(9-e5-fluorenyl)dichlorozirconium ( 8 ) . the last compound is a particularly poor terpolymerization catalyst ; it incorporates very little VCH or HD and no ENB at all . <nUm> / MAO is a better catalyst for e / P / VCH terpolymerization , while <nUm> / MAO is superior in e / P / HD terpolymerization .

analysis of the published data on the interaction between the components of a zirconocene-poly(methylaluminoxane) system used as the catalyst of olefin polymerization indicates that the yield of the reaction product , methane , is virtually independent of the concentration of the components over a wide concentration range . it is assumed that methane is formed in the absence of the monomer on the catalytic site of polymerization formed by the interaction of the major components and the activating admixtures , including uncontrollable admixtures ( H2O , O ) . under specified conditions it is the admixtures that control the concentration of the catalytic centers and the methane yield . for this reason , the yield of methane is independent of the concentration of zirconocene and poly(methylaminoxane) . 
several luminescent zirconium thiolate complexes (e5-C5H5)2Zr(SC6H4R-p)2 , where r = Cl ( 1 ) , me ( 2 ) , OMe ( 3 ) , have been synthesized by the reaction of Cp2ZrCl2 with HSC6H4R-p in the presence of Et3N . the crystal structures of (e5-C5H5)2Zr(SC6H4Cl-p)2 and [(e5-C5H5)2Zr(SC6H4OMe-p)]2O ( 4 ) , which has been isolated as a hydrolysis product of (e5-C5H5)2Zr(SC6H4OMe-p)2 , have been determined . complex <nUm> crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21 / a , with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> , and V = <nUm> A3 . the Zr atom is in a distorted tetrahedral coordination environment with the thiolate ligands adopting an " endo(anti) " configuration . the two cp rings have a nearly eclipsed geometry . complex <nUm> crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21 / c , with a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> , and V = <nUm> A3 .

stereoselective propene insertion reactions of chiral zirconocene species of the type rac-(EBI)Zr(e2-pyridyl)+ ( EBI = ethylenebis(indenyl) ) containing substituted e2-pyridyl ligands are described . the reaction of rac - (EBI)ZrMe2 with BC18F15 followed by addition of <nUm> equiv of the appropriate pyridine yields [ rac-(EBI)Zr(e2-3-R3-5-R5-6-R 6-pyrid-2-yl)][MeB(C6F5)3] pyridyl complexes ( 5a-f ; a , R3 = R5 = H , R6 = me ; b , R3 = R5 = H , R6 = ph ; c , R3 = R5 = R6 = H ; d , R3 = me , R5 = H , R6 = me ; e , R3 = H , R5 = R6 = me ; f , R3 = R5 = me , R6 = H ) . At <nUm> ° C , 5a-f react with propene to yield the 1,2-insertion products [rac-(EBI)Zr{e2(C,N)-CH2CHMe(pyrid-2-yl)}][MeB(C 6F5)3 ] , for which two diastereomers ( <nUm> / 6' ) that differ in the configuration of the metallacycle b-carbon are possible . propene insertion of 5a-f is under kinetic control at <nUm> ° C and is highly stereoselective when the pyridyl ring contains a 6-substituent ( R6 ≠ H ; 6a , de = <nUm> % ; 6b , de > <nUm> % ; 6d , de > <nUm> % ; 6e , de = <nUm> % ) . for these cases , the major diastereomer is that in which the metallacycle b-Me group points toward the EBI C6 ring ( configuration S,S,S ( R,R,R ) , where the entries denote the configurations of the EBI bridgehead carbons and the metallacycle b-carbon , respectively ) . the diastereoselectivity is low in cases where R6 = H ( 6c' , de = <nUm> % ; 6f , de = <nUm> % ) . propene insertion of 5a-f is reversible at <nUm> ° C , and the kinetic <nUm> / 6' mixtures evolve to the thermodynamic mixtures at this temperature . 6d isomerizes to a mixture of 6d , gd' , and the 2,1-insertion product [rac-(EBI)Zr{e2(C,N)-CHMeCH2(pyrid-2-yl)}][MeB(C 6F5)3 ] ( 6d' ) at <nUm> ° C . molecular modeling calculations for model rac-(EBI)Zr(e2-pyridyl)(propene)+ species suggest that steric interactions between the pyridyl R6 substituent and the EBI C6 ring cause a tipping of the pyridyl ligand , which influences the pyridyl / propene steric contacts and the facial selectivity of propene binding . the modeling calculations also suggest that the more stable propene adduct diastereomer leads to the kinetic insertion product . 
the mechanisms of chain initiation ( reaction <nUm> ) and chain propagation leading to linear and methyl-branched polymers ( reactions <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively ) as well as chain - transfer ( or chain - termination ) reactions including associative displacement ( reaction <nUm> ) b-H elimination ( reaction <nUm> ) , H exchange ( reaction <nUm> ) , and hydrogenolysis ( reaction <nUm> ) of transition - metal - catalyzed ethylene polymerization have been compared for different metal atoms in the diimine - M(II) complexes ( where m = Ni , Pd , and Pt ) on one hand , and between diimine - M(II) and zirconocene complexes on the other . the rate - determining step of reactions <nUm> and <nUm> is the migratory insertion of the olefin into a metal - alkyl bond for both diimine-M(II)- and zirconocene - based catalysts . under the same conditions , zirconocenes are slightly more active catalysts than the diimine - Ni (II) complex , with the catalytic activity of the diimine - M(II) complex decreasing as Ni > Pd > Pt . the resting stage of the process is a metal-olefin-alkyl complex , and the larger the stability of the complex , the higher the barrier height for migratory insertion . both chain - propagation reactions , <nUm> and <nUm> , start from the b-agostic intermediate . reaction <nUm> for linear chain growth begins with a barrierless bimolecular reaction of coordination of the next olefin , while reaction <nUm> for branched growth begins as a unimolecular b-hydride-elimination reaction with an activation barrier . higher temperatures should increase and higher ethylene pressures should decrease the branching . the barrier heights indicate that ( i ) the zirconocenes will produce a higher ratio of linear to methyl-branched polyethylene than the diimine - M(II) and ( ii ) the linear / branched ratio will be larger for the diimine - Ni (II) than its Pd analog . among the chain - termination mechanisms studied , the associative - displacement mechanism <nUm> where the coordinating olefin exchanges with ethylene from solution is likely to be a preferred one for diimine - M(II) - based processes . the C-H activation and H - exchange chain - termination mechanisms , which are favorable for zirconocenes , are inefficient for diimine - M(II) . hydrogenolysis is another favorable chain - termination process for both the diimine - M(II) and zirconocene in the presence of gaseous hydrogen . 
the isothiocyanato complexes [ Zr(e5-C5H4Me)2(NCS) <nUm> ] and [ Zr(e5-C5H4tBu) 2(NCS)2 ] have been prepared from the corresponding zirconocene dichlorides and KSCN in acetone . analogous reactions with KOCN or CKNSe , led to the formation of the stable dinuclear oxo-bridged complexes [ {Zr(e5-C5H5)2(NCO)} 2O ] and [ {Zr(e5-C5H4Me)2(NCSe)} 2O ] , respectively . the molecular srtucture of [ {Zr(e5-C5H5)2(NCO)} 2O ] has been determined by x-ray diffraction methods and consists of two (e5-C5H5)2Zr(NCO) units linked by an oxo bridge . the Zr-O-Zr bridge [ angle <nUm> ° ] is non linear . the relatively short Zr-O bond lengths of <nUm> and <nUm> Å support the presence of partial double - bond character . the compound contains N - coordinated cyanato ligands which are almost linear .

In these reactions , <nUm> mol of the transannular hydrogen - bridged 10-membered ring compound B2(m-H)2(m-C4H8)2 is also formed . A possible reaction pathway for the formation of these complexes is proposed on the basis of time - lapse 11B NMR spectroscopy . the methyl-substituted complex (e5-C5H5)2Zr(CH 3){(m-H)2BC4H8} , V , is prepared from the reaction of III with CH3Li . the molecular structure of III was reported earlier . the structures of IV and V are reported here . crystal data for IV : space group P21 / n ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , β = <nUm> ° , z = <nUm> . crystal data for V : space group pbca ( no. <nUm> ) , a = <nUm> Å , b = <nUm> Å , c = <nUm> Å , z = ft . 
we report on an efficient synthetic route for the preparation of enantiomerically pure ethylene-bridged ansa - zirconocene and -hafnocene complexes , bearing different cyclopentadienyl fragments . ring opening of (R)-epoxystyrene ( 1 ) with fluorenyllithium proceeds enantiospecifically and leads to optically pure 2-(9-fluorenyl)-1-(S)-phenylethanol ( 2a ) and 2-(9-fluorenyl)-2-(S)-phenylethanol ( 2b ) in nearly quantitative yield . treatment of <nUm> , the trifluoromethanesulfonate derivative of 2b , with fluorenyl- and indenyllithium results in the formation of 1-(9-fluorenyl)-1-(S)-phenyl-2-(1-indenyl)ethane ( 6a ) and 1,2-bis(9-fluorenyl)-1-(S)-phenylethane ( 6b ) , respectively . reaction of the dilithio salts of 6a with Cl4Zr and of 6b with MOU ( m = Zr , Hf ) affords the formation of the enantiomerically pure complexes [ 1-(e5-9-nuorenyl)-1-(fl)-phenyl-2-(e 5-1-(R,S)-indenyl)ethane]ZrCl2 ( 7a = R,R ; 7b = R,S ) and of [1,2-bis(e5-9-fluorenyl)-1-(A)-phenylethane]MCl2 ( 7c , m = Zr ; 7d , m = Hf ) in up to <nUm> % yield . hydrogenation of 7a-d with H / O2Pt gives the complexes 8a-d , bearing octahydrofluorenyl and tetrahydroindenyl ligands . hydrolysis of 8a,b in basic , aqueous media leads to the formation of C2 - symmetric m-oxo dimers ( 12a,b ) . the solid - state structures of enantiomerically pure 7b and 8c and of 12b are reported . 
the kinetics of propylene polymerization using homogeneous Cp2ZrCl2 / methylalumoxane ( MAO ) catalysts have been investigated at <nUm> ° C and <nUm> atm of propylene pressure . the effects of [Al] / [Zr] and [Zr] on the catalyst activity were studied . it was found that MAO plays a critical role in catalyst activation and deactivation . by assuming the coexistence of two dynamic equilibria between active species and inactive ones which are the products of zirconocene dimerization and zirconocene - MAO complexation , a kinetic model was proposed . the model could satisfactorily explain most of the experimental results . 
dimethyltitanocene reacts selectively with a variety of dialkyltartrates with protonolytic cleavage of one of its Ti - CH3 bonds to form the respective dinuclear (|Jtartrato)(Cp,TiCH,) , complexes <nUm> . dimethylhafnocene reacts quite analogously to give the (|itartrato)(Cp2HfCH3)2 systems <nUm> , whereas in the reaction of dimethylzirconocene with the same dialkyltartrates always both zr-methyl linkages are cleaved to yield metallacyclic doubly tartrato-bridged bis(zirconocene) complexes . this synthetic organometallic problem was solved in two ways . treatment of Cp,Zr(CH3)Cl with the dialkyltartrate reagents cleanly gave the respective (\atartrato)(Cp,ZrCl)2 complexes <nUm> . the enolate complex CpTZr(-O-CMe = CH - ,)CH , reacts with dimethyltartrate selectively with liberation of acetone to cleanly yield the ( ji-dimethyltartrato ) ( Cp^ZrCH , ). , complex 8a . six examples of the (|U-tartrato)(Cp.,MX)- , complexes were characterized by x-ray crystal structure analyses , namely the compounds 3a-3d ( Ti ) , 6d ( HO , and 7d ( Zr ) . A comparison of characteristic structural parameters of the Cp-,M(X)-O-C structural units points to an increased metal-oxygen ninteraction in the order Ti < Hf < Zr , which may explain the observed different chemical behavior in this series of compounds .

the recently reported zwitterionic complex Cp*[e5-C5Me4CH2B(C 6F5)3]ZrC6H5 , <nUm> , reacts rapidly with <nUm> equiv of acetone or acetophenone to form the adducts Cp*[e5-C5Me4CH2B(C 6F5)3]Zr(C6H 5)[O = C(CH3)R ] ( r = CH3 , 2a ; C6H5 , 2b ) in ∼ <nUm> % yield . spectroscopic evidence in favor of this assignment is presented ; the adduct nature of the complexes was also confirmed in each case via an x-ray structural analysis . the ketone ligands are bound in an e1 end-on fashion ( the Zr-O = C angles are near linear at <nUm> ° and <nUm> ° for 2a and 2b , respectively ) , allowing for a p-component to the Zr-O bonding . unlike other fleetingly observed ketone adducts of nonzwitterionic cationic metallocenes , the ketone ligands in compounds <nUm> do not undergo insertion into the Zr-C bond neither upon thermolysis nor in the presence of excess ketone . 
the kinetics of propene polymerization in the liquid monomer medium and the properties of the resulting iso-PP were studied in relation to the interannular bridge nature , (CH2)2Ind2ZrCl2 ( I ) , (CH3)2SiInd2ZrCl2 ( II ) , (CH3)2CInd2ZrCl2 ( III ) , and asymmetric (CH3)(cyclo-C3H5)CInd2ZrCl <nUm> ( IV ) , in MAO - activated 1,1'-bridged bisindenyl zirconocene dichlorides . data are also given for the non-bridged (2-Ph-C9H6)2ZrCl2 ( V ) system used under similar conditions . the systems based on zirconocene III are most active and that based on II is most stable . the replacement of one methyl group in the CH2 < bridge by a cyclopropyl group ( compounds III and IV ) results in the depressed initial activity and in the greater deactivation of the system during the process of polymerization . the stereoblock polymer was formed with the catalyst system based on metallocene V , used under similar experimental conditions .

1,6- and 1,7-dienes and -enynes incorporating a silicon-oxygen or silicon-nitrogen link are co-cyclised with zirconocene(1-butene) or diisopropoxytitanium(propene) to give metallabicycles . further elaboration followed by cleavage of the silicon-carbon bond using tamao oxidation affords a wide variety of organic products . 
the synthesis and activity as precatalysts for stereoregular a-olefin polymerization of the chiral C1 - symmetric zirconocene complexes (R)- and (S)-Me2Si(e5-C13H 16)(e-C5H3R*)ZrR2 ) , where C13H16 = octahydrofluorenyl , r = NMe2 , Cl , or me , and R* = (1R,2S,5R)-trans-5-methyl-cis-2-(2-propyl)cyclohexyl ( (-)-menthyl ) , are described . 
A procedure for supporting syndiospecific zirconocene on OSi <nUm> opens up a way of retaining the syndiospecificity of metallocene catalyst . the effects of supporting temperature , time and initial concentration of metallocene on the supported amount of metallocene were investigated . using these supported catalysts for propylene polymerization , it is possible to reduce the consumption of cocatalyst MAO ( methylaluminoxane ) and produce syndiotactic polypropylene in high syndiotacticity . if partial MAO was replaced by triisobutylaluminium , it would be shown that the catalytic activity of these catalysts increases greatly . 
electroconductivities of zirconocene complex - derived catalytic system solutions were measured to identify the ionic particles generated by the catalyst activators and to follow the ionic species formed in the absence and presence of olefins . several organoaluminum compounds ( OAC ) and polymethylalumoxane ( MAO ) were studied as metallocene activators . the specific electroconductivity of the solution of each metallocene complex examined in solvents varying in polarity , activated both with OAC and MAO , was always higher than that of the starting reactants . the electroconductivity value and the olefin polymerization rate were found to vary concurrently . the data obtained show that it is possible to trace the ionic particles generated during the formation of active species and their changes in the course of polymerization reaction . 
metallocene / tetramethylaluminoxane ( MAO ) catalysts control the tacticity and the molecular weight and its distribution in the polymer . zirconocene and hafnocene catalysts copolymerize ethene with cyclic olefins such as norbornene and dimethanooctahydronaphthalene ( DMON ) to yield copolymers with the double bond , rather than the ring , opened to extend the chain . these products are atactic and have interesting properties . syndiotactic polystyrene , mp as high as <nUm> ° C , is another class of tailor - made ( titanocene / MAO ) - catalyzed polymers . with the fluorinated ( CpTiF3 ) substituted for the chlorinated ( CpTiCl3 ) titanocenes , the activity rose by a factor of <nUm> - <nUm> . the two types of polymers were studied with numerous metallocenes used as catalysts . nine metallocenes were used to study their activity in the copolymerization of ethylene with cycloolefins . the reactivities of comonomers were established in the ethylene - DMON systems catalyzed by zircono- and hafnocenes . titanocenes proved to be much more active than the systems involving alkoxy-derivatives Ti(OR)4 [14] . 
catalytic behavior was examined in the series of 2- and 1-substituted bisindenyl zirconium and hafnium complexes , (2-PhInd)2ZrCl2 , (2-PhInd)2HfCl2 , (2-p-TolInd)2ZrCl2 , (2-p-TolInd)2HfCl2 , (1-MeInd)2ZrCl2 , (1-i-PrInd)2HfCl2 , (1-cyclo-C6H11Ind)2ZrCl2 , (2-n-BuInd)2ZrCl2 , and (2-All-Ind)2ZrCl2 . 2-Ph - substituted zirconocene showed higher activity in ethylene polymerization than did the unsubstituted indenyl complex under similar conditions , and provided polyethylene of the higher molecular weight . these catalytic features suggest the increase in activity to be caused probably by an increase in chain propagation rate . the lower productivity of (2-p-Tol-Ind)2ZrCl2 complex compared to (2-PhInd)2ZrCl2 is attributed to the electron donating effect of the methyl substituent at the phenyl ring suppressing the effect of the aryl substituent . the two hafnium analogs showed considerably lower activity as compared with zirconium complexes , the feature commonly observed on replacement of zirconium by hafnium . the most pronounced effect of 1-substituents on the metallocene activity was observed for the 1-Me-and 1-i-Pr - substituted complexes . the activities of the complexes examined in ethylene polymerization were found to be linearly correlated with the electronic and steric substituent characteristics . 
the reaction of the new ligand [ 2,6-(CH2C5H4)2C5H 3N]2-Na2+ ( LNa2 ) with Cl4Zr in THF affords in good yield the trigonal - bipyramidal complex LZrCl2 , where the two chlorine atoms are not equivalent . when LZrCl2 and RMgCl ( r = CH3 , n-butyl , C4H11Si ) are reacted in <nUm> : <nUm> and <nUm> : <nUm> molar ratios , the corresponding complexes LZr(Cl)R and LZrR2 can be isolated in good yields . differently from the Cp2Zr(n-Bu)2 , which has never been isolated due to b-H . elimination , the analogous LZr(n-Bu)2 is thermally stable and its x-ray crystal structure has been solved , confirming its trigonal - bipyramidal geometry with the alkyl groups occupying an equatorial and an axial position . an NMR study ( 1H , 13C , HMQC , NOE ) allowed the complete structural characterization of the complexes in solution . 
polypropenes were prepared , both in and without the presence of molecular hydrogen , using the six ansa - zirconocene catalysts rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ( I ) , rac-Et(IndH4)2ZrCl2 ( II ) , rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2(III) , rac-Me2Si(2-Me-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( IV ) , rac-Me2Si(Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2(V) , and rac-Me2Si(2-Me-Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2 ( VI ) and also Cp2ZrCl2 ( VII ) [ ind = indenyl ] , under standardized conditions ( <nUm> bar partial pressure of propene in toluene solution , at <nUm> ° C , zirconocenes activated by methylaluminoxane ) . the microstructures of the polymers were investigated in detail by using 1H and 13C NMR and GPC , and relationships between catalyst structures and polymer microstructural features are discussed . hydrogen was found to activate all of the catalysts to differing degrees . trends in hydrogen activation were compared with trends in ( a ) the overall numbers of n-butyl terminals ( resulting from chain transfer to hydrogen following secondary insertion ) , ( b ) the ratios , in the presence of hydrogen , of chain transfer to hydrogen to the other mechanisms which lead to renewed chain growth following secondary insertion , and ( c ) the ratios , in the presence of hydrogen , of sites following primary insertion to sites following secondary insertion . the absence of any clear correlations under these three headings leads to the conclusion that the release by chain transfer to hydrogen of resting states following secondary monomer insertion can not be the only mechanism giving rise to hydrogen activation with these catalysts . 
reductive coupling of dimethylfulvene with alkaline earth metals yields inseparable mixtures of the tetramethylethylene-bridged complex Me4C2(C5H4)2M and the unbridged metallocene (i-PrCp)2M ( m = Mg , Ca , Sr , Ba ) . In contrast , the reductive coupling of phenylfulvene with activated calcium in THF gives nearly quantitative yields of a mixture of cis- and trans-diphenylethanediyl-bridged ansa - calcocenes . the more soluble cis isomer can be removed by recrystallization , yielding the C2 - symmetric trans-Ph2C2H2(e5-C 5H4)2Ca-(THF)2 ( trans-2 ) . the molecular structure of this ansa - calcocene shows the cyclopentadienyl rings to be bound in an e5 fashion to the calcium center . this versatile reagent gives high yields of C2 - symmetric transition metal ansa - metallocene complexes via the facile reaction of trans-2 with metal chlorides ( e.g. , Cl2Fe and Cl4Zr ) . the molecular structure of the corresponding anso - zirconocene dichloride complex is described .

organic - inorganic hybrid ( SAV ) supported zirconocene was synthesized and its catalysis on ethylene polymerization was examined . the SAV was synthesized by copolymerization of 4-vinylpyridine with vinyl silica monomer ( SA ) , which was modified by reacting silica with allyltrimethoxysilane ( APS ) . after treated by MAO , the SAV was reacted with Cp2ZrCl2 to form organic - inorganic hybrid supported metallocene . the chemical structure and the composition of SA and SAV have been characterized by solid - state <nUm> C - NMR , XPS , and elemental analysis ( EA ) . the SAV supported zirconocene catalyst was effective in ethylene polymerization at a relatively low MAO level ( Al / Zr = <nUm> ) giving higher activity than that supported by O2Si . 
1-Phenyl-1,4-pentanedione ( 3 ) is selectively converted to the corresponding fulvene - ketone ( 4 ) by treatment with cyclopentadiene in the presence of pyrrolidine . treatment with lithium dimethylcuprate results in selective CH3 - addition at the fulvene carbon and subsequent ring - closure reaction to give <nUm> , which in the presence of lithium diisopropylamide is rapidly dehydrated to yield the bicyclic fulvene <nUm> . its treatment with amalgamated calcium metal leads to reductive fulvene coupling and formation of the calcocene complex ( 10 ) of the substituted 7,7'-bi(tetrahydroindenyl) ligand . only the respective rac - isomer is obtained . hydrolysis of <nUm> followed by double deprotonation with butyllithium yields the corresponding 7,7'-bi(tetrahydroindenyl) dianion equivalent <nUm> . In tetrahydrofuran , <nUm> is cleaved at the 7,7'-linkage with formation of the " monomeric " disproportionation products 11-Li and 12-Li , and treatment of <nUm> with zirconium tetrachloride in THF leads back to the formation of the fulvene <nUm> . transmetalation to zirconium is , however , cleanly achieved when <nUm> is treated with donor - ligand - free Cl4Zr suspended in toluene . the corresponding diastereomerically pure rac-ansa-zirconocene dichloride <nUm> containing the ansa - bridge as part of the a-fused bi(tetrahydroindenyl) ligand system is obtained under these specific conditions . complex <nUm> was characterized by x-ray diffraction , and the outcome of the preliminary propene polymerization experiments is reported . 
the synthesis of Cp2ZrH(OSO2R) and Cp2ZrBH4(OSO2R) ( r = me , tBu , C8F17 , ph , p-tolyl , p-C6H4Cl , m-C6H4CF3 , m-C6H4NO2 ( BH4Zr only ) , 3,5-C6H4(CF3)2 ) is described . the hammett constants of the aryl substituents correlate well with the 11B NMR shift in Cp2ZrBH4(OSO2R) ( r = aryl sulfonate ) . hexene insertion into the Zr-H bond of Cp2ZrH(OSO2CF3) ( 1 ) is fast and reversible : reaction of Cp2Zrhexyl(OSO2CF3) with 2-butyne gives Cp2ZrCMe = CHMe(OSO2CF3) and 1-hexene . treatment of <nUm> with styrene leads to a kinetically controlled mixture of Cp2ZrCH2CH2Ph(OSO2CF3) and Cp2ZrCHCH3Ph(OSO2CF3) that equilibrates with a first - order rate law . the rate is independent of added styrene . olefin insertion into the Zr-C bond was not found .

upon irradiation in toluene solution , meso-racemate mixtures of Me2Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C5H2)2-ZrCl <nUm> or Me2Si(2-Me-4-phenyl-C5H2)2ZrCl <nUm> react with <nUm> equiv of the dilithium salt of racemic binaphthol quantitatively to the racemic binaphtholate complex . analogous reactions with <nUm> equiv of the R(+) enantiomer of dilithium binaphtholate give a near - quantitative yield of the enantiomerically pure ansa - zirconocene binaphtholate complex . the structures of the racemic binaphtholate complex , Me2Si(2-Me-4-tBu-C5H2) 2Zr(binaphtholate) , and of a monodentate binaphtholate complex with a meso configurated zirconocene moiety , Me2Si(3-tBu-C5H3)2Zr(binaphtholate) chloride , were crystallographically determined . 
bis(propynyl)zirconocene ( 1b ) reacts with <nUm> molar equiv of trityl tetraphenylborate by a propynyl group transfer to form Ph3CC ≡ C2H3 and Cp2ZrC ≡ CCH3+ . the in-situ-generated (propynyl)zirconocene cation is not stable under the reaction conditions but instantaneously reacts with the neutral starting material 1b to form the [ ( m-C ≡ CCH3)(m-CH3C ≡ CC ≡ CCH <nUm> ) - (ZrCp2)2+][BPh4 - ] salt , <nUm> . complex <nUm> was characterized by an x-ray crystal structure analysis . it contains an unsymmetrically bridging hexadiyne ligand and exhibits a planar-tetracoordinate carbon center that is stabilized by a three - center two - electron interaction with the two adjacent zirconocene moieties . In solution , complex <nUm> exhibits dynamic NMR spectra that indicate a symmetrizing exchange of the bonding situations between the two ends of the m-hexadiyne ligand . the gibbs activation energy of the automerization reaction of <nUm> is DG ‡ ( <nUm> K ) ≈ <nUm> kcal mol-1 . 
metallocene catalysts leave a well - characterized fingerprint in the polypropene structures . attempts to expand this catalyst - polymer correlation to ethylene-propene copolymers are presented . the 13C nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) are run on <nUm> % solutions of the copolymers in o-dichlorobenzene ( <nUm> % d2 ) at <nUm> ° C , with a <nUm> second pulse delay and <nUm> ° pulses . observations show that single ethylene monomers are added to regioregular propylene homopolymers , and a high level of ethylene insertion adjacent to a 2,1-propylene insertion . this means that high molecular weight C2C3 copolymers can be synthesized with the incorporation of ethylene for each regioregular insertion .

the kinetics of propylene polymerization with Et(H4Ind)2ZrCl2 / methylalumoxane ( MAO ) catalysts have been investigated at 0-50 ° C and <nUm> atm of propylene pressure . the effects of polymerization temperature , catalyst concentration , and catalyst / cocatalyst mole ratio on the catalyst activity and on the properties of the polypropylene products were studied . by assuming the coexistence of two dynamic equilibria between catalytically active species and two inactive species , which are the products of zirconocene dimerization and excessive zirconocene - MAO complexation , a kinetic model has been developed . this model could satisfactorily explain most of experimental results . 
the electronic absorption and luminescence behavior of a number of bis(4-R-1,2-diphenylcyclo-pentadienyl) zirconium dichloride complexes (4-R-1,2-Ph2Cp)2ZrCl2[R = H(2) , me(3) , ph(4) ] in anhydrous n-hexane were studied under an atmosphere of nitrogen . the research results showed that the electronic absorption and luminescence behavior of these compounds can be tuned by the variation of the substituents on the cyclopentadienyl groups . the absorption and emission wavelength of these complexes decreases in an order of r = ph > CH3 > H . As a result , complex <nUm> is a blue color emitter , while complex <nUm> is a green color emitter . 
the isoselective propene polymerization using the supported catalyst O2Si / MAO / Me2Si(2-Me-Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl <nUm> / AlR3 was investigated and compared with propene polymerization using the corresponding homogeneous catalyst system . the influence of propene concentration , polymerization medium , temperature , comonomer , and external aluminium alkyls on polymerization kinetics and polypropene properties such as molecular mass , stereo- and regioselectivity , morphology , and bulk density was studied . 
we observed the thermochromism of the deeply colored zirconocene complex of 1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene ( DPBD ) in the solid state . variable - temperature 13C-CP / MAS NMR spectroscopy revealed that a remarkable change of the electronic structure of the DPBD molecule by constructing the complex propagates all over the carbon sites and that the distortion of the electronic structure of the complex becomes continuously large as temperature is decreased . this phenomenon is closely related to the thermochromism . the mechanism of the temperature variation of the electronic structure of the complex was attributed to the dynamics of phenyl ring and cyclopentadienyl ring of the complex . fast rotation of the cyclopentadienyl ring around its fivefold axis with the extremely small activation energy of <nUm> meV ( = <nUm> kJ / mol ) and <nUm> ° flip rotation of the phenyl ring about the C-C bond with the activation energy of <nUm> meV ( = <nUm> kJ / mol ) were recognized by the measurement of the spin - lattice relaxation rate of proton NMR . semiempirical ZINDO molecular orbital calculation revealed that the deep color of the complex originates in the HOMO-LUMO and HOMO-LUMO+1 transitions . these molecular orbitals are sensitive to the orientation of the p-orbital of cyclopentadienyl rings , suggesting that the dynamic perturbation is operative for the transition energies .

azaphosphazirconaindan systems ( RCp ) <nUm> ZrN(R <nUm> )P(NR <nUm> r <nUm> )(oC <nUm> H <nUm> ) 4a ( r = H ) and 5a,b ( r = < -Bu ) are easily synthesized in a regiospecific way via a zirconocene-benzyne intermediate by means of thermolysis of cp <nUm> ZrMePh <nUm> or ( f-BuCp ) <nUm> ZrPh <nUm> <nUm> in the presence of phosphaimines r <nUm> N = P-NR <nUm> r <nUm> ( 3a : r <nUm> = r <nUm> = r <nUm> = SiMe <nUm> ; 3b : r <nUm> = r <nUm> = t-Eu , r <nUm> = SiMea ) . after selective reaction of elemental sulfur on the phosphorus atom , Zr-N and Zr-C bond cleavage occurs on treatment with methanol , affording phosphine sulfides PhP(S)(NHR <nUm> )(NHR <nUm> ) 8a,b . In these two reactions , complexes ( < -BuCp ) <nUm> ZrN(R <nUm> )P(S)(NIIR <nUm> )(o-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) 7a,b resulting from a selective cleavage of one N-SiMe <nUm> bond linked by the phosphorus atom can be isolated . with selenium powder , similar behavior leads to complexes ( ( -BuCp ) <nUm> ZrN(R <nUm> )P(Se)(NHR <nUm> )(o-C <nUm> H <nUm> ) 10a,b . 
living ring - opening polymerization of the cyclic carbonate 1,3-dioxepan-2-one was achieved by using the cationic zirconocene complex [Cp2ZrMe]+[B(C6F5)4] - as catalyst at room temperature . A linear relation between conversion and molecular weight of the obtained polymer was observed . furthermore , block copolymerization of the cyclic carbonate and e-caprolactone was successfully performed . 
this study develops scoping estimates of the required capital investment and manufacturing costs to make a zirconocene catalyst / cocatalyst system [(F6-acen)Zr(CH2C-Me3)(NMe2Ph)][B(C6F5) <nUm> ] immobilized on a specialized silica support . the costs for this fluorine - based system are compared with corresponding estimates for two other metallocene catalysts using methylaluminoxane (MAO)-based cocatalysts . including the weight of the support and cocatalyst , each of the production facilities for making the three zirconocene catalyst systems is sized in the range of <nUm> to <nUm> tonnes per year . the cost to make the F - based catalyst system is estimated to be $ <nUm> / kg , assuming a <nUm> % return on capital invested . by comparison , the costs for the two MAO - based catalyst systems fall in the range of $ <nUm> / kg to $ <nUm> / kg , assuming the same return . within the +/- <nUm> % accuracy of these estimates , these differences are not significant . given a catalyst productivity of <nUm> kg of resin per gram of zirconocene , the cost contribution in the finished ethylene-propylene copolymer resin is <nUm> cents / kg , excluding costs for selling , administration , and research . 
the ansa - zirconocene derivative tetramethyldisiloxandiyl bis(1-indenyl) zirconium dichloride ( 1 ) has been prepared by the reaction of the dilithium salt of 1,3-bis(1-indenyl) tetramethyldisiloxane with Cl4Zr · 2THF . after catalytic hydrogenation , the corresponding tetrahydroindenyl complex ( 2 ) has been formed . both <nUm> and <nUm> have been shown by 1H NMR spectra to be the mixture of the cis(meso) and trans(rac) isomers . the pure trans isomers 1t , 2c and cis isomer 2c were obtained by recrystallization . the crystal structures of 1t and 2c were determined by x-ray diffraction . both crystals of 1t and 2c are monoclinics , belonging to space groups P21 / n(1t) and P21 / c(2c) . In the unit cell of 2c , one of the six - membered rings of the tetrahydroindenyl ligands has two different conformations which have the same probabilities .

the catalytic dehydrocoupling of bis(1-sila-3-butyl)benzene , <nUm> by Cp2ZrCl2 / Red-Al and Cp2ZrCl2 / n-BuLi combination catalysts yielded a mixture of oily and solid polymers . while the catalytic dehydrocoupling of 2-phenyl-1,3-disilapropane , <nUm> by Cp2ZrCl2 / n-BuLi combination catalyst produced a mixture of oily and solid polymers , the catalytic redistribution / dehydrocoupling of <nUm> by Cp2ZrCl2 / Red-Al combination catalyst gave oily polymer . the dehydrocoupling of <nUm> and <nUm> , unless the prior silane redistribution occurs , seems to initially produce a low-molecular-weight polymer , which then undergoes an extensive cross-linking reaction of backbone Si-H bonds , leading to an insoluble polymer . 
A new dialkylzirconocene type of complex , (1,2-ph2-4-MeCp)2ZrMe2(2) , was synthesized by reaction of (1,2-Ph2-4-MeCp)2ZrCl2(1) and with <nUm> equivalent of methyl lithium at <nUm> ° C . complex <nUm> was characterized by elemental analysis , 1H NMR and 13C NMR . the structure of complex <nUm> was determined by single crystal x-ray structural analysis . upon activation with Al(iBu)3 / Ph3C+ BC24F20 - , complex <nUm> showed a high catalytic activity for the ethylene polymerization reaction at lower n(Al) / n(Zr) ratios and high molecular weight polyethylene samples with high melting transition temperatures were produced . the polyethylene samples were characterized by molecular weight determination , DSC and XRD analysis . 
reaction of zirconocene dichloride Cp2ZrCl2 with aromatic polymers bearing a-diketone and a-hydroxyketone fragments was studied . using reactions of Cp2ZrCl2 with benzil and benzoin , which model a-diketone and a-hydroxyketone fragments , it was shown that zirconocene dichloride reacts only with hydroxyketone groups of the polymer through both reaction with OH group and coordination of Zn to the keto group . the prepared polymers are rather stable and can show promise as catalysts for a number of organic reactions . 
In this article the recent progress of the application of chiral titanium and zirconium complexes in asymmetric synthesis , particularly chiral ansa - titanocene and zirconocene in asymmetric synthesis , has been reviewed . the features and future perspectives of these catalysts have been reviewed . 
an investigation has been undertaken by use of ESCA in the characterization of the central metal(Zr) of dichlorozirconocene / methylaluminoxane homogeneous olefin polymerization catalyst . the change of electron density shown by a shift in ESCA signals ( <nUm> <nUm> eV ) indicates that the catalytic species are " cation - like " . within the range of detecting sensitivity of ESCA spectrometer , only a part of the new catalytic derivative was formed . the influence of complexion time and Al : Zr ratio on the formation of the catalytic zirconocene cation has also been investigated .

the copolymerization of propene and octene-1 using rac - Et(Ind) <nUm> ClZr <nUm> / MAO catalyst has been investigated . results show that with increasing the concentration of octene-1 in the system , the catalytic activity increased first and then decreased , the incorporation rate of octene-1 increased , and in consequence , m η , T m , crystallinity of copolymer decreased . the monomer composition and sequence distribution of the copolymers were determined by IR and <nUm> C - NMR . 
with a new trisiloxane - bridged dinuclear zirconocene , hexamethyltrisiloxanediylbis ( cyclopentadienylindenylzirconium dichloride ) ( TSDZ ) Cl2IndZr-CpSi(CH3)2-O-Si-(CH3) 2-O-Si(CH3)2 cp - ZrIndCl2 , the polymerizations of ethylene were carried out in the presence of modified MAO ( MMAO ) as a cocatalyst . the effects of MMAO amount and polymerization temperature ( tp ) on polymerization behaviours of TSDZ were examined and compared with those of mononuclear zirconocenes such as cyclopentadienylindenylzirconium dichloride , biscyclopentadienylzirconium dichloride and bisindenylzirconium dichloride . the catalytic activity of TSDZ was comparable to that of mononuclear zirconocenes , while the weight - average molecular weight ( mk ) and polydispersity index ( MJMk ) of polyethylene ( PE ) prepared with the former were much higher than those of PE with the latter . with increasing MMAO concentration , the catalytic activity increased but mk decreased for TSDZ , as well as mononuclear zirconocenes . with increasing tr the catalytic activity of TSDZ was a maximum at <nUm> ° C while that of mononuclear zirconocenes increased steadily . for increased tr the decrease of mk and MJMk for TSDZ was extraordinary compared to that for mononuclear zirconocenes . 
copolymers of ethylene and 1-octene , 1-tetradecene and 1-octadecene were synthetized in order to study the effect of the comonomer chain length and amount on density , melting temperature and heat of fusion . they were also compared with the properties of the copolymers obtained with the heterogeneous titanium catalyst . it could be seen that the density / melting -area of the copolymers obtained with the zirconocene catalyst was much broader than with the titanium catalyst . it could also be seen that with the same comonomer content 1-tetradecene gave lower density of the copolymers than 1-octene . however , no difference were seen between the densities of the copolymers obtained with 1-tetradecene and 1-octadecene . the melting temperature of the copolymers was seen to be the lower the longer the comonomer was . In the area of the high branching amount the linear correlation was not in work . it was also shown that the differences in the heat of fusions could only be seen at high amount of branches ( > <nUm> branches / 1000C ) : the longer the comonomer the lower amount of heat was needed to melt the copolymer . 
the substituted silastannatetrahydro-s-indacenes meso-Me2Si(t-BuC5H3)2SnMe <nUm> , meso-Me2-Si(Me2C5H2) 2SnMe2 , and meso-Me2Si(Me-i-PrC5H2)2SnMe <nUm> , prepared from the corresponding silanediyl-bridged dicyclopentadienide dilithium salts by reaction with Me2SnCl2 , were structurally characterized by x-ray diffraction and by 1H - NMR in solution . these cyclic stannanediyl compounds react with Cl4Zr to give selectively the meso diastereomers of the ansa - zirconocene complexes Me2Si(3-t-BuC5H3)2ZrCl2 , Me2Si(2,4-Me2C5H2) 2ZrCl2 , and Me2Si(2-Me-4-i-PrC5H2)2ZrCl <nUm> , respectively . reaction of Me2Si(2-Me-4-t-BuC5H2-Li +)2 with me2 Cl2Sn gives , instead of Me2Si(Me-t-BuC5H2)2SnMe2 , the distannyl derivative Me2Si(2-Me-4-t-BuC5H2-1-SnMe 2Cl)2 . this compound reacts with Cl4Zr to give a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of the rac and meso isomers of Me2Si(2-Me-4-t-BuC5H2)2ZrCl <nUm> . ring - opened , racemic distannyl compounds are formed also from meso-Me2Si(t-BuC5H3)2SnMe <nUm> , meso-Me2Si(Me2C5H2) 2SnMe2 , and meso-Me2Si(Me-i-PrC5H2)2SnMe <nUm> with excess Me2SnCl2 . competition between Me2SnCl2 and Zr centers for reaction with stannylcyclopentadiene units appears to limit the overall stereoselectivity of the ansa - zirconocene complex formation . 
the method developed by erker for the preparation of " dibornacyclopentadiene " <nUm> has been generalized to encompass two related cyclopentadienes flanked by bridged bicyclic subunits derived from (1R)-(+)-verbenone ( 4 ) . whereas lithium dimethylcuprate addition to <nUm> leads to 5a , reaction with diisobutylaluminum hydride and methylcopper affords the less substituted analog 5b . both saturated ketones undergo the shapiro reaction and subsequent in situ condensation with ethyl formate to deliver the dienols 7a,b , respectively . the dehydrative cyclization of these intemediates proved to be more difficult to accomplish than in the earlier work involving <nUm> . exposure of 7a to camphorsulfonic acid in benzene at <nUm> ° C gives rise to <nUm> in <nUm> % yield . these conditions proved much too harsh for 7b , which however undergoes ring closure to give <nUm> ( <nUm> % ) with iodine in ether . following deprotonation , <nUm> can be silylated to give <nUm> , but neither the lithium cyclopentadienide nor the silane can be coaxed into forming a variety of titanocene or zirconocene complexes . these reactants must consequently be more sterically crowded than <nUm> , which does react with MCl4 ( erker ) and CpTiCl3 ( this work ) . remarkably , hydrocarbon <nUm> completely resists deprotonation , a direct reflection of the extreme nonbonded congestion in the vicinity of its sp3 - bound cyclopentadienyl proton . 
when polymerization of propene was conducted using the C2 - symmetrical zirconocenes racEt(2,4,7-Me3Ind)2ZrCl2 ( I ) and rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2ZrCl2 ( II ) combined with Ph3CB(C6F5)4 , the isotacticity ( [mmmm] ) and the melting point ( Tm ) of the produced polymer markedly increased , along with a decrease of the polymerization temperature from <nUm> to <nUm> ° C . thus , isotactic polypropene ( iPP ) with Tm = <nUm> ° C was obtained from the polymerization with catalyst I at <nUm> ° C , whereas the [mmmm] and Tm of iPP were almost unchanged in the same temperature range when the C1 - symmetrical zirconocene iPr(3-tBuCp)(3-tBuInd)ZrCl2 ( III or III' ) was employed . 

additive effects of dialkylaluminum hydrides on propylene-1,3-butadiene copolymerization were investigated with an isospecific zirconocene catalyst , rac-dimethylsilylbis(2-methyl-4-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 4Ph ) , activated by modified methylaluminoxane . dialkylaluminum hydrides improved the apparent selectivity for 1,2-insertion of 1,3-butadiene to give a pendant vinyl group . 13C NMR analysis of the copolymers indicated that the dialkylaluminum hydride converted the 1,4-inserted butadiene unit in the copolymer to tetramethylene unit after methanolysis . 
the novel zirconocene complexes [Cp'2Zr(m-H)(SiHR)]22+[BR' n(C6F5)4-n]22- ( cp' = cp , MeCp , Me5Cp ; r = ph or PhCH2 ; R' = bu or H ) were isolated from silane dehydropolymerization reaction mixtures catalyzed by Cp'2ZrCl2 / 2BuLi / BC6F5 <nUm> or by [Cp'Zr(m-H)H]2 / 2B(C6F5)3 combination catalysts . A total structure analysis of these compounds , performed by multinuclear , multidimensional NMR spectroscopy , shows that each zirconocene fragment bears a positive charge , which is delocalized between the metal center and hydrosilane ligand . 
reaction of zirconocene dichloride Cp2ZrCl2 with aromatic polymers bearing a-diketone and a-hydroxyketone fragments was studied . using reactions of Cp2ZrCl2 with benzil and benzoin , which model a-diketone and a-hydroxyketone fragments , it was shown that zirconocene dichloride reacts only with hydroxyketone groups of the polymer through both reaction with OH group and coordination of Zr to the keto group . the prepared polymers are rather stable and show promise as catalysts for a number of organic reactions . 
the (C5H5-nMen)2Zr[e 2-C2(SiMe3)2 ] ( n = 2-5 ; 1,3-dimethyl , 1,2,3-trimethyl ) ( 2C-F ) complexes were prepared by the reduction of corresponding zirconocene dichlorides with magnesium in THF in the presence of bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene ( BTMSA ) . all of them are stable in the absence of THF . crystal structures of (C5HMe4)2Zr[e2-C 2(SiMe3)2 ] ( 2E ) and (C5Me5)2Zr[e2-C 2(SiMe3)2 ] ( 2F ) and of the analogous titanium complexes are isomorphous . the red shift of the v(C ≡ C ) vibration and the downfield shift of 13C d(C ≡ C ) indicate that BTMSA in 2C-F is more strongly coordinated than in analogous titanocene complexes . the nonisolated complex (C5H4Me)2Zr[e2-C 2(SiMe3)2](THF) ( 2B*THF ) rearranges after the loss of THF to give the dimer [ (e5-C5H4Me)(e1-C(SiMe <nUm> ) = CH(SiMe3)Zr(m-e1:e 5-C5H3Me)]2 ( 3B ) . 
the reduction of rac - (EBTHI)ZrCl2 [ EBTHI = 1,2-ethylene-1,1'-bis(e5-tetrahydroindenyl) ] with equimolar amounts of magnesium in the presence of Me3SiC2SiMe3 in THF at room temperature gave the first zirconocene - alkyne complex containing no additional ligands , rac-(EBTHI)Zr(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) , <nUm> . with pyridine and (S)-(-)-nicotine complex <nUm> gave the ligand - containing complexes rac-(EBTHI)Zr(L)(e2-Me3SiC2SiMe <nUm> ) ( L = pyridine , <nUm> ; L = (S)-(-)-nicotine , <nUm> ) . In the reaction of <nUm> with acetone the insertion product rac-(EBTHI)-(ZrOCMe2C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3) , <nUm> , was formed . complex <nUm> reacted with <nUm> equiv of PhN = CHPh with substitution of the alkyne to form rac - (EBTHI)ZrNPhCHPhCHPhNPh , <nUm> . compounds <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by an x-ray structure analysis . 
complexes were prepared in which one of the 2-phenylindenyl ligand was substituted with cyclopentadienyl type ligands , (cyclopentadienyl)(2-phenyl-indenyl)zirconium dichloride , Cp(2PhInd)ZrCl2 and Cp*(2PhInd)ZrCl2 and studied their behavior in propylene polymerization . the substitution of one of the 2-phenylindenyl ligands with a cp ligand resulted in a fourfold increase in productivity . typical productivities observed for Cp2ZrCl2 type complexes were lower . the molecular weight of polypropylene prepared with complex <nUm> was higher . upon substitution of 2-phenylindene with cp , the ability of the catalyst to generate elastomeric polypropylene is lost . 
catalytic systems based on zirconocenes can produce polymers with an overall amount of regioirregular placements as high as 2-3 % . the higher regiospecifities of titanocene based , with respect to zirconocene based , catalytic systems has been accounted for by the large contributions of the non-bonded interactions , in favor of the monomer coordination suitable for the primary insertion when shorter Mt-C distances are involved . 
azametallacyclobutene Cp2ZrN-t-BuCEt = CEt ( 1 ) underwent an insertion reaction with CO to form the acyl complex <nUm> ( Cp2Zr(N-t-BuCEtCEtCO) , <nUm> % yield ) . the addition of acetone to azametallacyclobutene <nUm> ( Cp2Zr(NArCMeCPh) , Ar = 2,6-dimethylphenyl ) yielded the N - bonded enamine and O - bonded enolate complex of zirconocene <nUm> ( Cp2Zr(NArCMeCPhH)(OCMeCH2) , <nUm> % yield ) . the addition of aldehydes RCOH to metallacycle <nUm> resulted in the insertion of the aldehyde into the Zr-C bond to form complexes Cp2Zr(NArCMeCPhCRHO) ( 8a ) and Cp2Zr(NArCMeCPhC(i-Pr)HO ( 9 ) in <nUm> % ( r = ph ) and <nUm> % yields , respectively . similarly , treatment of metallacycle <nUm> ( Cp2Zr-(NArCEtCEt) ) with benzaldehyde yielded the insertion product <nUm> ( Cp2Zr(NArCEtCEtCPhHO) ) in <nUm> % isolated yield . the structure of complex <nUm> was confirmed by an x-ray crystallographic study . heating the insertion products 8a and <nUm> led to elimination of the a,b-unsaturated imines <nUm> and 14a ( ArN = CMeCPh = CRH ) in <nUm> % and <nUm> % yields , respectively , and the formation of oxozirconocene oligomer (Cp2ZrO)n . the oxozirconocene monomer was trapped by dimethylzirconocene , preventing the formation of oligomer and resulting in the isolation of product <nUm> . A kinetic study of this retrocycloaddition produced the following activation parameters : DH ‡ = <nUm> kcal / mol , DS ‡ = <nUm> eu . A hammett slr study showed that electron - donating groups α to the metallacycle oxygen accelerate the retrocycloaddition ( ρ = <nUm> ) . 
the preparation and crystal structure of the first group <nUm> ansa - metallocene with an oxygen atom directly bonded to the 2-position of an e5-indenyl moiety , rac-[ethylenebis(2-(tert-butyldimethylsiloxy)indenyl)]zirconium dichloride ( 3 ) , is reported . In combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , complex <nUm> polymerizes propylene to highly isotactic crystalline polypropylene ( Tm = <nUm> ° C ; mw = <nUm> <nUm> ; mw / Mn = <nUm> ) . under similar conditions , the propylene polymerization activity of <nUm> / MAO exceeds that of the conventional ansa - metallocene catalyst system (dimethylsilyl)bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride ( 4 ) / MAO by a factor of <nUm> ( <nUm> vs <nUm> kg of PP / mol of Zr / h ; tp = <nUm> ° C ; C3H6P = <nUm> bar ; [Al] : [Zr] = <nUm> <nUm> : <nUm> ) . complex <nUm> crystallizes in the unusual indenyl-backward conformation . the molecular structure is consistent with the expected C2 symmetry . 
In reactions .of the zirconocene derivative Cp2ZrC(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3)(THF) with ketones and aldehydes the influence of the various substituents of the carbonyl compounds upon the formation of different products was investigated . formaldehyde reacts by an insertion of the carbonyl unit into a Zr-C bond to give a metallacycle which is additionally stabilized by the formation of a coordination dimer [ Cp2ZrOCH2C(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3) ] <nUm> ( 1 ) . benzaldehyde yields a monomeric metallacycle Cp2ZrOCHPhC(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3) ( 2 ) . complex <nUm> is less stable than <nUm> , and at higher temperatures it loses half of its moiety Me3SiC2SiMe3 , leaving { [ Cp2ZrOCHPhC(SiMe3) = C(SiMe3)][Cp 2Zr(e2-O = CHPh ) ] } ( 3 ) . benzophenone gives no insertion , and the monomeric e2-ketone complex Cp2Zr(THF)(e2-O = CPh2 ) ( 4 ) was obtained . 
low molecular weight ( ca. <nUm> ) ethylene-1-butene copolymers were synthesized at <nUm> ° C using rac-(dimethylsilyl)bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride ( II ) catalyst and methyl-aluminoxane ( MAO ) cocatalyst . comonomer composition , triad sequence distribution , and end groups were analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR . the average polymer molecule contains about one double bond and one saturated end group . the unsaturated end groups were formed almost exclusively by transfer from propagating chains containing 1-butene as the terminal unit . At least <nUm> % of the unsaturated end groups are vinylidene and trisubstituted double bonds , which are present in the approximate ratio <nUm> : <nUm> . saturated end groups result from the initiation process . both ethylene and 1-butene are involved in initiation , but ethylene more than 1-butene . the product is a random copolymer with very short blocks ( no longer than 2-3 monomer units ) of both ethylene and 1-butene . the comonomer sequence distributions determined by 13C NMR were fitted to first - order markovian statistics , which allowed calculation of the monomer reactivity ratios . the results are discussed in terms of a reaction mechanism consisting of initiation , propagation , and chain transfer reactions . 
In the present study , the linear low - density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) / OZr <nUm> nanocomposites were synthesized via in-situ polymerization with rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst . first , the nano-ZrO <nUm> filler was impregnated with the desired amount of MAO . then , copolymerization of ethylene / 1-octene was performed in the presence of nanoZrO2 / MAO filler to produce the LLDPE / O2Zr nanocomposites . the amounts of nanoZrO2 filler employed were varied at <nUm> and <nUm> g corresponding to [Al]MAO / [Zr] ratios = <nUm> and <nUm> , respectively . it can be observed that the polymer yield increased with increasing the ratios of [Al]MAO / [Zr] . however , the observed polymer yields were much lower ( about 5-30 times ) compared to the yield with no filler addition . the filler contents in polymer were in the range of 23-25 wt % . the characteristics of LLDPE / O2Zr nanocomposites obtained were determined by means of DSC , SEM / EDX , TEM , 13C NMR , and XPS . it was observed that the LLDPE / O2Zr nanocmposites exhibited slightly lower melting temperature ( Tm ) and crystallization temperature ( Tc ) . SEM micrographs demonstrate the homogeneous matrix of the samples . In addition , with EDX mapping technique , it was also revealed that the nano-ZrO2 filler was well distributed over the polymer matrix . based on the TEM result , it was also revealed that the smaller and more uniform particles can be observed after polymerization . these observations suggested that the fragmentation of nano-ZrO2 particles or segregation of the secondary particles could occur resulting in good dispersion of the particles . the distribution of comonomer was studied by 13C NMR . it was shown to be random as seen in the similar catalytic system without filler addition . the binding energy ( BE ) for C 1s obtained from XPS to be <nUm> eV indicating no significant change in the polymer microstructure with the addition of nano-ZrO2 filler .

isotatic polymerizations of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ) , t-buyl acrylate and 2-ethyl hexyl acrylate in both toluene and CH 2Cl <nUm> with an ansa-zirconocenedimethyl were investigated using bis(4-methyl-2,6-dibutyl phenoxyl ) methyl aluminum as the activator . the results indicate that polymers with high molecular weights were produced in high yields .

91Zr NMR chemical shifts and line widths ( du1 / <nUm> ) are reported for a number of ring - bridged and ring - substituted zirconocene dichloride , dibromide , and dimethyl complexes . ab initio computations at the SCF level employing basis sets of moderate size suggest that the magnitude of the electric field gradient ( EFG ) at the Zr atom dominates du1 / <nUm> when the substituents x at Zr are varied ( x = Br , Cl , me ) . substituents at the cyclopentadiene ( cp ) rings affect the computed EFGs much less ; in these cases , the line widths du1 / <nUm> are governed by the molecular correlation times tc , which were obtained for several zirconocene dichlorides from T1(13C) measurements . experimental trends in d(91Zr) of zirconocenes are well reproduced computationally with the IGLO ( individual gauge for localized orbitals ) or GIAO ( gauge including atomic orbitals ) SCF methods employing large basis sets . model calculations suggest that d(91Zr) , as well as the EFG , are quite sensitive to the inclination and twist angles of the cp rings and , to a lesser extent , to the CpZrCp' angle . A substantial deshielding , d(91Zr) ca. <nUm> ppm , is predicted for (C5H5)2ZrMe+ , presumably the active olefin - polymerizing catalyst . 
the first high molecular weight polystannanes , H(SnR2)nH ( r = nBu , nHex , nOct ) , result from dehydropolymerization of secondary stannanes R2SnH2 by zirconocene catalysts . good catalysts include zirconocenes based on both CpCp*Zr ( cp* = e5-C5Me5 ) and Cp2Zr fragments , and the most active catalyst with respect to production of high molecular weight polystannanes was Me2C(e5-C5H4) 2Zr[Si(SiMe3)3]Me . the latter catalyst produced H(SnnBu2)nH chains ( mw / Mn = <nUm> <nUm> / <nUm> <nUm> ) that were contaminated by ca. <nUm> % ( by weight ) low molecular weight cyclic oligomers . lower molecular weights resulted from dehydropolymerizations of Me2SnH2 , PhMeSnH2 , and Ph2SnH2 . At room temperature , H(SnR2)nH ( r = alkyl group ) polystannanes have lmax values at ca. 380-400 nm , attributed to s-s* transitions . thermal gravimetric analyses on the polystannanes reveal that these polymers are as thermally stable as related poly(dialkylsilane)s and have onset temperatures for thermal decomposition in the range 200-270 ° C , under both nitrogen and air . the H(SnnBu2)nH polymer has been shown to be a good precursor to O2Sn , as shown by bulk pyrolysis in air ( ceramic yield : <nUm> % ) . preliminary results also indicate that these polymers may be useful as precursors to elemental tin . the polystannanes are photosensitive , and their photobleaching behavior has been characterized by UV - vis spectrometry and 119Sn NMR spectroscopy , which demonstrated that H(SnnBu2)nH is photochemically depolymerized to a <nUm> : <nUm> mixture of cyclo-(SnnBu2)5 and cyclo-(SnnBu2)6 . the polymers H(SnnHex2)nH and H(SnnOct2)nH exhibit thermochromic behavior which is visibly evident as a discoloration from yellow to colorless upon warming above room temperature . this reversible behavior is associated with an abrupt change in lmax ( e.g. , from <nUm> to <nUm> nm for films of H(SnnOct2)nH ) and a phase change at ca. <nUm> ° C ( by differential scanning calorimetry ) . thin films of H(SnnBu2)nH and H(SnnOct2)nH on glass slides were doped by exposure to F5Sb vapor to conductivities of 10-2 and <nUm> S cm-1 , respectively . preliminary experiments suggest that the dehydropolymerization occurs by a s-bond metathesis mechanism involving four - center transition states . A previous report on production of high molecular weight poly(dibutylstannane) by the reductive coupling of nBu2SnCl2 by Na / 15-crown-5 was reinvestigated and found to produce only low molecular weight material with mw / Mn = <nUm> / <nUm> . 
the rate enhancement effect on comonomer addition and the synergistic effect on 1-butene addition were studied in the co- and terpolymerization of ethylene with long chain 1-olefins using zirconium based metallocenes . with the Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst , the rate enhancement effect was evident only when the polyethylene was insoluble in the reaction medium . when the product was soluble , there was a rate decrease rather than an increase . the microstructure was investigated with first- and second - order markovian statistics . the synergistic effect was not at work in the zirconocenes . when the concentration of 1-butene was increased in the reaction medium the content of the long chain 1-olefin decreased in the terpolymer . this was called an antagonistic effect . 
depending on the reaction conditions , small amounts of the tetraphosphapentacyclic compounds ( tetraphosphacubanes ) 4a , b as well as the isomeric tetraphosphatetracyclic products 5a , b can be isolated from the thermolyses of the phosphaalkynes 3a , b . this cyclotetramerization can be directed towards the formation of tetraphosphacubanes when the whole process is split into two sequential cyclodimerizations . firstly , the zirconocene - phosphaalkyne dimer complexes 8a-d are prepared from <nUm> and 3a-d ; in the second step , the Cp2Zr fragment is extruded from 8a-d by reaction with hexachloroethane . the tetraphosphacubanes 4a-d are obtained in good yields by this process . only in the case of 1-adamantyl-phosphaacetylene and the penta- and tetracyclic products formed concomitantly ( <nUm> + 3e → 8e → <nUm> + <nUm> ) . putative intermediates for the second dimerization step are the diphosphetes 9a-e and their diels - alder dimers 10a-e . 
the preparation of organocopper reagents by transmetalation protocols has emerged as a versatile new tool for selective C,C - bond formation . In this review , the use of organoaluminum , -boron , -lead , -manganese , -mercury , -samarium , -stannane , -telluride , -titanium , -zinc , and -zirconocene derivatives for the preparation of copper complexes is presented and compared to traditional protocols originating from lithium or magnesium organometallics . significantly , a wide range of functionality is generally tolerated in the transmetalation procedures , and the reactivity of the resulting cuprates depends on the presence of the residual metal salts . the use of these heterobimetallic cuprates in natural product synthesis demonstrates some of the key features of this new methodology . 
bimetallic Zr complexes are synthesized by olefin metathesis reaction of vinyl group of monometallic complexes . the Si bridged zirconocene { e5-C5Me4-SiMe2- e5-C5H3CH2CH = CH 2}ZrCl2 is transformed by metathesis reaction to the novel bimetallic complex with ansa - structure . ethylene and propylene polymerization was conducted by bimetallic complexes . the activity of the bimetallic complex depends on the steric hindrance of the ligand . the bimetallic complex with ansa - structure gave isotactic polypropylene with a similar high selectivity to that of the monometallic analog . bimetallic complexes catalyzed cyclopolymerization of 1,5-hexadiene to give poly(methylene-1,3-cyclopentane) . 
ansa - zirconocene complexes , exemplified by Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 , activated by MAO ( zirconocene / MAO ) exhibit high activity ( A ) for polymerization of propylene . polyolefins exhibiting a range of physical and mechanical properties can be synthesized . the molecular structures have been determined by a combination of morphology , molecular and mechanical measurements . the NMR spectra is consistent with a stereochemical control model of consecutive e / e ' ( E,E ' = enantiomorphic sites ) . 
we have reported previously that the rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)methylzirconium ''cation'' ( 1 ) , which was produced from the reaction of rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)dimethylzirconium and triphenylcarbenium ( trityl ) tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate , was exceedingly active and stereoselective in propylene polymerization , and that its catalytic activity and stereospecificity increases with a decrease of tp . however , in the aluminum - free catalyst , a certain amount of <nUm> is consumed in the nonproductive function of scavenging inpurities . we report here an alternate and efficient method to produce alkylzirconocene - type ''cations'' polymerization catalysts . 
several examples are described where in situ generated ( e2-alkyne ) group <nUm> metallocene type substrates add to X-[M2] reagents ( M2 = main group metal ) to form dimetallabicyclic products Cp2M(m-e1:e2-RCCR)(m-X)[M <nUm> ] which contain a planar-tetracoordinate carbon center in the m-e1:e2-hydrocarbyl bridge . thus , (e2-cyclohexyne)(PMe3)ZrCp2 ( 4a ) reacts in this way with excess trimethylgallium to give Cp2Zr(m-e1:e2-C6H 8)(m-CH3)GaMe2 ( 6a ) . complex 6a is one of the rare examples of a gallium compound containing s-hydrocarbyl bridges to this heavy main group metal . complex 6a was characterized by x-ray diffraction . it crystallizes in space group P21 / c with cell parameters a = <nUm> ( 3 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 4 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and RW = <nUm> . complex 6a contains a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom C(2) with pertinent bond distances and angles of <nUm> ( 5 ) Å [Zr-C(2)] , <nUm> ( 5 ) Å [Ga-C(2)] , <nUm> ( 8 ) Å [C(2)-C(3)] , <nUm> ( 7 ) Å [C(1)-C(2)] , <nUm> ( 4 ) ° [C(3)-C(2)-C(1)] , <nUm> ( 3 ) ° [C(3)-C(2)-Ga] , <nUm> ( 1 ) ° [Ga-C(2)-Zr] , and <nUm> ( 3 ) ° [C(1)-C(2)-Zr] . both cp rings are disordered . zirconium and gallium seem to form a three - center two - electron bond with C(2) . the planar-tetracoordinate geometry at carbon atom C(2) is probably electronically stabilized by the s-donor properties of the attached metal centers and by a p-conjugative interaction of the C(2)-C(1)-Zr moiety normal to the s-plane . (e2-1,2-Didehydrobenzene)(PMe3)ZrCp2 ( 4b ) reacts analogously with trimethylgallium to give Cp2Zr(m-e1:e2-C6H 4)(m-CH3)GaMe2 ( 6b ) in almost quantitative yield . complex 6b crystallizes isomorphously to the corresponding Al compound in space group P21 / n with cell parameters a = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , b = <nUm> ( 2 ) Å , c = <nUm> ( 1 ) Å , β = <nUm> ( 1 ) ° , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> , and RW = <nUm> . it also contains a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom [C(2)] . the reaction of ph - CKsC - GaMe2 ( 7 ) with (hydrido)zirconocene chloride produces Cp2Zr(m-PhCCH)(m-Cl)GaMe2 ( 9 ) which is probably also a similarly structured " anti-va n't hoff / LeBel complex " . complexes 6a and 6b react with ethylene or norbornene at room temperature with liberation of Me3Ga and formation of five - membered metallacyclic products ( e.g. , bis(e-cyclopentadienyl)zirconaindane is obtained from 6b and ethylene ) .

dimethyl zirconocene and its derivatives are effective catalysts for the dehydrogenative coupling of primary organosilaes to poly(organosilylenes) . the backbone Si-H functions of these polymers can be functionalised by catalytic hydrosilylation . since the zirconocene polymerization catalyst is also an active hydrosilylation catalyst , it is possible to perform one - pot syntheses of functionalised polysilylenes .

phenylazomethine dendrimer exhibits precisely complexation with metal ions . it was revealed that phenylazomethine dendrimers can assemble organometallic compounds , such as ferrocene and zirconocene , which are known for useful catalysts and easy to be modified by other functional molecules . we found that the big complexation constant enabled ferrocene to make complex with imine at the core selectively , on the other hand , zirconocene can make complex with imine at the outer layer selectively because of the less complexatio constant . it was also revealed that ferrocene - modified dendrimer turned to film on the electrodes by the complexation of ferrocenium to its own imines or next one 's imines . 
bimetallic zirconocene complexes were synthesized by olefin metathesis reaction of alkene - substituted zirconocenes . hydrogenation of a double bond of the bridging chain gives a saturated and flexible bridging chain . the bimetallic catalyst with a short bridging chain shows a higher catalytic activity for ethylene and propylene polymerization than that with a long bridging chain . the bimetallic catalyst with saturated bridging chain has an increased activity , compared to the catalyst with unsaturated bridging chain . steric hindrance at R2 position on the cyclopentadienyl ligand decreases a catalytic activity . the steric hindrance at R1 position weekly affects the catalytic activity .

high performance polymers from simple hydrocarbon monomers such as propylene ( P ) , norbornene ( N ) butadiene ( B ) and styrene ( S ) were obtained by the precise control of primary structures with coordination polymerization catalysis . syndiospecific polymerization of P was performed with C s-symmetric ansa-fluorenylamidodmethyltitanium activated with AlR 3-free MAO ( dMAO ) in heptane . this catalysis system was found to be effective for homo- and copolymerization of norbornene with ethylene or 1-alkene . random copolymer of P and B with 1,4-B units synthesized by an isospecific zirconocene catalyst was converted to a,o-divinyl isotactic PP by metathesis degradation of the copolymer with ethylene . isotactic PP with pendant vinyl group was obtained by copolymerization of P and B in the presence of hydrogen in high activity . crystalline S-B block copolymers which possesses long crystallizable syn-PS segments chemically bonding with a high cis-1,4-PB was synthesized by adding B to a syndiotactic living PS . 
homogeneous single site catalysts have dominated the research interest in olefin polymerization over the past <nUm> years . sinn and kaminski1 started this trend with the discovery that methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) activates group IV transition metal catalysts . the ability to control regio- and stereochemistries , and comonomer content and distribution are some of the important advantages that metallocene catalysts afford in the polymerization process . A current goal is the reduction of the necessary amount of cocatalyst , typically methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , since its high cost and the large amounts needed at industrial scale are a barrier to making metallocene systems cost effective with respect to ziegler - natta catalysts2 . In this paper , we study the effect of MAO on reaction rate , molecular weight and polymer microstructure in the slurry polymerization of isotactic polypropylene . the active catalyst is a cationic species generated in an equilibrium reaction between a zirconocene dichloride catalyst and MAO . increasing concentrations of MAO shift the equilibrium to the formation of the activated complex . thus , catalyst activity increases with increasing MAO / Zr ratio3,4 . In addition , MAO in solution contains residual trimethylaluminum ( TMA ) in a typical concentration of <nUm> % wt . it is known that TMA can act as a chain transfer agent leading to the formation of an isobutyl-terminated chain and liberation of the activated complex5 . In conditions where chain transfer to TMA becomes a competitive process with respect to the other chain transfer reactions , increasing amounts of MAO reduce the molecular weight . slurry polymerizations of propylene were carried out using rac-ethylene-bis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride / MAO as the catalyst system . polymerizations were performed at <nUm> ° C in a <nUm> mL state - of - the - art semi-batch reactor . the effect of MAO / Zr ratio on the rate of reaction , molecular weight and polymer microstructure was explored in order to allow the chain transfer reaction to TMA to be included in our previously developed kinetic model6 . an exhaustive analysis of end - groups of the polymer chains by 1H and 13C NMR was performed to gain understanding of the chain transfer mechanisms . our kinetic model for the homopolymerization of propylene is developed to predict rate of reaction , molecular weight distribution and percentage of unsaturated end - groups of the polymer6 . it is characterized by : ( 1 ) non-instantaneous initiation by insertion of the first monomer molecule ; ( 2 ) propagation by <nUm> insertion producing a regioerror that lowers the molecular weight through competing chain transfer reactions ; ( 3 ) chain transfer to TMA ; and ( 4 ) catalyst deactivation to account for decreasing catalyst activity with time . the estimation of kinetic rate constants was performed using a systematic optimization approach involving on - line measurements of the reaction rate and end - of - batch measurements of molecular weight distribution and polymer end - groups . A least - square objective function was defined to minimize the difference between the experimental measurements and the model predictions . the minimization was performed subject to constraints imposed by the kinetic model equations . these constraints were posed as a set of nonlinear algebraic equations generated by applying temporal discretization techniques to the dynamic model . this presentation will focus on the experimental and modeling results obtained with the rac-ethylene-bis(1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride / MAO catalyst system . the ultimate goal of this research is to develop a chemically based kinetic model that can be extensible to a number of single - site metallocene catalyst systems . to accomplish this goal , research work with the catalysts rac-dimethylsilylbis(2-methyl-4-phenyl-indenyl) Cl2Zr and rac-ethylene-bis ( 4,7-dimethyl-1-indenyl ) Cl2Zr is underway . the former species is highly active and stereoselective , while the later species produces isotactic polypropylene with a high frequency of regioirregular <nUm> insertions . our current work with these catalyst systems will be described in the presentation .

based on dimethyl derivatives of zirconocenes with the C2 symmetry and perfluorenyl borate , catalysts immobilized on inorganic ( silica gel ) and organic ( polysorb ) supports active for the synthesis of isotactic PP were prepared . it was shown that the polymerization of propylene with immobilized catalysts in heptane proceeds at the steady - state rate in the presence of triisobutylaluminum . the polymer arises in the form of granules whose size grows with an increase in the specific yield of the polymer . the nature of the immobilized zirconocene affects the activity of the catalytic system and properties of the resulting PP . the macrotacticity index increases with an increase in the temperature of polymerization . the effective activation energies of polymerization are in the range from <nUm> to <nUm> kJ / mol . 
In this study , behaviours of ethylene / norbornene copolymerization using zirconocene catalysts ; rac-Et[Ind]2ZrCl2 ( cat . A ) and Cp2ZrCl2 ( cat . B ) were investigated . based on activity profiles at various norbornene concentrations , it can be observed that although cat . A is more active than cat . B , it is less stable , indicating more rapid deactivation rates with time . it was found that deactivation rates was more pronounced with high concentrations of norbornene for both catalytic systems . asymmetric activity profiles were observed for both catalytic systems indicating higher deactivation rates compared to the activation rates . the copolymer produced by cat . A exhibited lower melting temperature ( Tm ) , but higher incorporation of norbornene . however , both catalysts produced copolymers with random distribution . 
surface modified silica were reacted with different aluminiumalkyls AlR2R ' ( r = me , et , i-Bu , r ' = H , me , et , i-Bu ) , oligomeric methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) and combinations of both , to yield heterogeneous cocatalysts . these cocatalyts were employed to polymerize ethylene using zirconocene dichloride as the catalyst . the polymerization activity profiles have been recorded and compared with the information gained from the scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) images of the polymers . the fragmentation of the heterogeneous cocatalyts upon polymerization has been demonstrated . the degree of fragmentation and the polymerization activity depend on the preparation of the silica supports and on the preparation of the heterogeneous cocatalysts using these supports . the most reactive , fragmentable heterogeneous cocatalysts show polymerization activities slightly higher than MAO in homogeneous solution and almost <nUm> times higher than commercially available MAO on silica ( = MAO on sylopol ) .

polypropylene was obtained using the metallocene homogeneous catalyst Methyl2Si-(2-Methyl-4-Phenyl)2ZrCl2 / MAO and the corresponding silica / MAO - supported system prepared at different conditions . it was observed that long metallocene immobilization time for the preparation of silica / MAO / zirconocene supported catalyst does not imply in higher catalytic activity . the obtained polymers were characterized according to their melting temperature ( Tm ) and crystallinity degree ( xc ) , through DSC analysis . the results showed that the supported catalyst system produce polypropylene with higher Tm and narrower range of melting in relation to the PP obtained by the homogeneous system . 
polyethylene-clay nanocomposites have been prepared using in situ polymerization . In this study we have evaluated two minerals , silica and bentonite ( smectite ) , as catalyst carriers for the polymerization of ethylene with commercially available zirconocene . the activities of the homogeneous and supported metallocene systems were also compared . we have observed that at high temperatures , ethylene consumption sharply decreases with time by employing homogeneous catalyst . also , the polymerization profiles for both supported systems have rapidly achieved a steady state . moreover , the performance of the smectite - supported system was very similar to that of the silica - supported catalyst . the obtained polymers were characterized according to their melting temperature ( T m ) and crystallinity degree ( x c ) , through DSC analysis . the polyethylene melting temperature has significantly increased with the use of both supported systems in comparison with the homogeneous counterpart . the highest T m of the obtained polyethylenes was <nUm> ° C , which corresponds to that synthesized by the smectite - supported catalyst . 
A series of ancillary directing ligands bearing O , S , N atoms were used to react with ClZr <nUm> to get the intermediate complexes , which showed certain diastereoselectivity when reacting with the dilithium salts of ethene - bridged bis(indene) . to carry out the selective synthesis , the ancillary directing ligand was firstly reacted with equal molar amount of ClZr <nUm> in toluene under argon overnight . the resultant suspension was transferred to the solid salts of C 2H 4-[(e 5-Ind)Li ] <nUm> ( molar ratio <nUm> : <nUm> ) at <nUm> ° C . the reaction mixture was warmed up and stirred for <nUm> h at <nUm> ° C . then the solvent was removed under vacuum and the residue was analyzed directly by 1H - NMR spectroscopy to detect the relative amount of rac-C 2H 4- ( η 5-Ind ) 2ZrCl <nUm> and meso-C 2H 4- ( η 5-Ind ) 2ZrCl <nUm> . most of these ancillary directing ligands assisted the formation of racemic isomers , rac-C 2H 4- ( η 5-Ind ) 2ZrCl <nUm> , with the molar ratio of rac-C 2H 4- ( η 5-Ind ) 2ZrCl <nUm> to meso-C 2H 4- ( η 5-Ind ) 2ZrCl <nUm> as high as <nUm> : <nUm> . further research demonstrated that the diastereoselectivity was significantly influenced by the structure , coordination atoms and substituents thereon of the intermediate complexes . 
two new hetro - dinuclear metallocene catalyst systems of [(C5H5)MCl2] (C5H4)SiMe5 ( C5H4 ) ] [(C5H5)SmCl] [ m = Ti(D , zr(2) ] activated by MAO were used for the polymerization of ethylene . the affections of catalyst concentration , molar ratio of [Al] / [Cat] , temperature and time on polymerization were studied in detail . the results show that the catalytic activity of dinuclear catalysts is lower than the corresponding mononuclear metallocene , and the molecular weight , melt point and crystallinity of polyethylene produced are somewhat decrease . 
the use of organozirconium compounds to prepare oganic fine chemicals began only in the mid-1970s . it showed that alkylzirconium complexes are easy to handle and that their reactivity toward electrophiles makes them excellent intermediates for making alkyl halides . with hydrozirconation as the starting point , organozirconium chemistry has taken varied paths . 
hydrozirconation of 1-alkylnylphosphonates gives the organozirconium(IV) complexes <nUm> in syn-addition way . complexs <nUm> was trapped with NCS , NBS or I <nUm> to afford stereodifined a-halo-1-alkenylphosphonates in moderate to high yields . 
ionic and covalent derivatives of the chlorine analogue of the nonbasic , weakly coordinating triflate ion , CCl3O3S - or " trichlate " ion , have been prepared and compared with the corresponding more strongly coordinated chloroacetates , ClxCH 3-xCO2M ( x = 1-3 ) , using 35Cl NQR ( nuclear quadrupole resonance ) spectroscopy . the 35Cl NQR frequencies of all types of derivatives are sensitive to the nature of the metal ion or lewis acid and are most sensitive in the case of monochloroacetates . In covalent ( including zirconocene ) derivatives , the average NQR frequencies fall as the pauling electronegativity of m falls . the results for ionic derivatives contrast with previous results for ionic hexachlorometalates : the average 35Cl NQR frequencies drop sharply as the ionic radius of the group <nUm> cation increases . ab initio gaussian <nUm> computations at the B3LYP / 6-311++G(3df,3pd) level on isolated XCH2CO2M ( m = Li , Na , K ; x = F , Cl ) molecules duplicate this trend , showing increasing polarization of the C-Cl bond and smaller electric field gradients for larger group <nUm> ions ; the relevance of this to the solid state polymerization of chloroacetates ( herzberg , O. ; epple , M. eur. J. inorg. chem. <nUm> , 1395-1406 ) is discussed . we have prepared the dihydrate and monohydrate of trichlic acid , CCl3HO3S . although trichlates have the highest average NQR frequencies of any of these salts , the NQR frequencies of trichlic acid dihydrate are anomalously lower than those of trichloroacetic acid , which suggests that it is a strong acid , ionized in the solid state to H 5O2 + and CCl3O3S - ions . 
In an effort to activate and functionalize nitrogen to produce H3N , assistant chemistry professor paul J. chirik et al. at cornell university have found that tweaking the ligand in a soluble zirconium complex provides a clue that may help chemists develop a homogeneous route for nitrogen fxiation . H3N forms when tetramethylated cyclopentadienyl ligands are used . upon further addition of H , the end-on complex dissociates to zirconocene dihydride and liberates N , a typical observation for metal-N2 complexes . this finding indicates that the tetramethyl ligands alter the coordination geometry of N in such a way to allow H3N formation . while the reaction sequence is currently not catalytic , it may shed light on how to assemble N-H bonds under mild conditions . 
the reduction of ZrCl4(PR3)2 with Li powder , in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of trans-1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene , affords the Zr (II) diene complexes ( 1 ) in 90-93 % yields . this reaction consists of a rate - limiting step for the formation of the chloride - bridged Zr (III) dimer ( 2 ) and a fast diene - driven disproportionation of <nUm> to <nUm> and ZrCl4(PR3)2 that re-enters the reduction cycle . the reaction of <nUm> with Li2{Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2} in toluene produces quantitatively the desired racemic , divalent ansa - zirconocene ( 3 ) that is a highly active isospecific propylene polymerization catalyst upon activation with common activators . 
molecular weights of polyethylene ( PE ) obtained with using of zirconocene catalyst activated with large excess of methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) were determined by gel permeation chromatography ( GPC ) method . it was found that repeatability of the measurements is strongly influenced by MAO remained in PE samples as well as time of sample keeping in the apparatus ( dissolution + measurement time ) at temp. <nUm> ° C . A method of MAO removing from PE samples , before GPC measurement , based on additional washing of the sample with HF in methanol solution has been proposed . this modification leads to better both authenticity and repeatability of the results . studies on the influence of time of sample keeping in the apparatus at temp. <nUm> ° C showed that dissolution time of a polymer showing molecular weight up to <nUm> ̇ <nUm> g / mol should not exceed <nUm> h . 
the reduction of chloro-2,3,4,5-tetraethylphosphole with sodium , potassium , rubidium , and cesium in THF or 1,2-dimethoxyethane ( DME ) yields nearly quantitatively after recrystallization from a DME solution the corresponding alkali metal 2,3,4,5-tetraethylphospholides (DME)Na(PC4Et <nUm> ) ( 1 ) , K(PC4Et4) ( 2 ) , (DME)Rb(PC 4Et4 ) ( 3 ) , and (DME)Cs(PC4Et4) ( 4 ) . if the chloro-2,3,4,5-tetraethylphosphole still contains zirconocene dichloride from its preparation heteroleptic (THF)CsC5H 5*Cs(PC4Et4) ( 5 ) precipitates . whereas the sodium derivative <nUm> crystallizes as a dimer , the phospholides <nUm> to <nUm> of the heavier alkali metals crystallize as one - dimensional polymers . due to the size of the potassium cation no additional ether ligands are coordinated to this metal atom and a linear column precipitates , whereas for the Rb and Cs compounds the DME complexes are formed thus leading to a zig - zag chain . the substitution of half of the phospholide anions by cyclopentadienide ligands in <nUm> leads to a three - dimensional network in the crystalline state . the metathesis reaction of the potassium derivative <nUm> with Cl3Ga and ClSn <nUm> yields dimeric (DME)K[(m-Cl)4Ga2(PC 4Et4)3 ] ( 6 ) and monomeric Sn(PC 4Et4)2 ( 7 ) , respectively . whereas in the alkali metal phospholides <nUm> to <nUm> a high degree of delocalization of the anionic charge within the five - membered ring and a e5-coordination are realized , the 2,3,4,5-tetraethylphospholide anion is s-bonded to gallium (III) in <nUm> and to tin (II) in <nUm> . 
based on dichloride derivatives of zirconocenes with C2 symmetry and borates , active catalysts of propylene polymerization were formed on a polymer support , PE with a grafted poly(acrylic acid ) treated with poly(methylaluminoxane) . it was shown that the nature of aluminoxane affects the activity of the catalytic system : when aluminoxane is synthesized on the support surface , the activity of the catalyst increases . the influence of the nature of zirconocene and borate on the catalytic behavior of a system containing triisobutylaluminum as a cocatalyst was studied . variation in the polymerization conditions ( liquefied propylene or heptane suspension ) was found not to affect the kinetics of polymerization , characterized by the steady - state rate of monomer consumption . particle - size analysis of the polymers prepared using various systems is presented together with their molecular masses , melting temperatures , and isotacticity indices . 
composition of catalytic system and copolymerization reaction conditions influence on heterogeneity of ethylene / 1-hexene copolymers obtained over MgCl2(THF)2 / MAO / Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst was studied . one of the DSC techniques , i.e. successive self - nucleation / annealing ( SSA ) method allowing separation of the polymer into fractions with differing chemical composition in result of alternating crystallization and melting cycles was applied . it was found that the intermolecular heterogeneity exists inside all studied samples irrespective of the reaction conditions ( temperature and time ) and the catalyst composition ( Al / Zr molar ratio ) . it was also confirmed that catalyst composition has a considerably greater impact on heterogeneity of the copolymers as compared with copolymerization conditions , which apart from the first period of the reaction - do not exert significant influence on this parameter of copolymer structure . 
the synthetic zeolites are characterized by a great variety of structures and compositions , as well as by the different adsorption ability to ions , clusters and the transition metal complexes . therefore they are interesting as supports for heterogenization of the olefin polymerization catalysts . In addition the natural zeolites due to their considerable content in nature and low cost may be used as fillers for the polymer composite materials . the immobilized metalcomplex catalysts of olefin ( ethylene and propylene ) polymerization have been developed on the base of zeolites . In order to prepare these catalysts , the anchored aluminoxanes have been synthesized by reaction of aluminum alkyls ( AlMe3 , AlEt3 and AliBu3 ) with water contained in intracrystalline cavities and pores of zeolites ( NaY , NaZSM-5 , HZSM-5 , NH4ZSM-5 , mordenite and clinoptilolite - bearing tuff ) . these aluminoxanes , with zirconocenes , vanadium chlorides and other transition metals , form the heterogenized complexes that are active in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene without addition of other organoaluminum cocatalysts . the nature of zeolites used as a support , determines the content of zeolite water and affects the formation of anchored aluminoxanes and activity of immobilized catalysts . polyolefins prepared with the immobilized on zeolites zirconocene catalysts demonstrate higher molecular mass and a wider molecular - mass distribution than those of corresponding homogeneous catalysts . the stereoselectivity of supported catalysts depends on the composition , structure of metallocenes and on the zeolite nature . the new composite materials on the base of ultrahigh-molecular-mass polyethylene UHMPE and natural zeolites were developed . the synthesis of composites was carried out by ethylene polymerization on the catalytically activated surface ofzeolite fillers . depending on the amount of zeolite filler in the UHMPE matrix such compositions can be used as wear - resistant , impact - resistant materials for production of units working in conditions of dry friction at high loading or as organomineral ion - exchange sorbents for water purification from radionuclides and heavy metal ions . 
A stereoselective synthesis of conjugated enynes containing allyl selenide unit is reported . selanyl-substituted conjugated enynes were obtained by the coupling reaction of (E)-g-selanyl vinylzirconocene with acetylenic bromide in the presence of ClCu . 
based on dichloride derivatives of zirconocenes with C2 symmetry and borates , active catalysts of propylene polymerization were formed on a PE polymer support with a grafted poly(acrylic acid ) treated with poly(methylaluminoxane) . it was shown that the nature of aluminoxane affects the activity of the catalytic system : when aluminoxane is synthesized on the support surface , the activity of the catalyst increases . the influence of the nature of zirconocene and borate on the catalytic behavior of a system containing triisobutylaluminum as a cocatalyst was studied . variation in the polymerization conditions ( liquid propylene or heptane suspension ) was found not to affect the kinetics of polymerization , characterized by the steady - state rate of monomer consumption . morphological characteristics of the polymers prepared using various catalytic systems are presented together with their molecular masses , melting temperatures , and isotacticity indices . 
the reactions of e2-(1-butene)zirconocene with (4R,5R)-di[(1S)-phenylethyl]amino-1,7-octadienes , carrying two vinyl or two phenyl substituents at C3 and C6 , followed by protonation , gave a mixture of diastereomeric , fully substituted cyclohexanes . In the case of (4R,5R)-di[(1S)-phenylethyl]amino-(3R,6R)-diphenyl-1,7-octadiene , the main diastereomer of the product was isolated with <nUm> % yield , then reductive removal of the n-substituents afforded (1R,2R)-diamino-(4R,SS)-dimethyl-(3R,6R)-diphenylcyclohexane with <nUm> % yield . 
three non-bridged dimethylzirconocene complexes ; i.e. , bis(e5-cyclopentadienyl)dimethylzirconium ( 1 ) , bis(e5-tert-butyl-cyclopentadienyl)dimethylzirconium ( 2 ) , bis(e5-indenyl)dimethylzirconium ( 3 ) , and the chiral zirconocene rac-ethylenebis(e5-indenyl)dimethylzirconium ( 4 ) were synthesized and used as catalysts for the polymerization of methyl methacrylate , MMA , combined with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borate ( A ) or tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate dimethylanilinum salt ( B ) in the presence of ZnEt2 . the evolution of the polymerization characteristics ; i.e. , molecular weight , molecular - weight distribution , and yield were examined for the above systems . the influence of the nature of the solvent was also investigated . the aggregation behavior , the steric hindrance , and the lipophilicity of the active catalytic systems are the most important parameters determining the polymerization characteristics . the tacticity of the products is reported and the influence of the catalyst structure is discussed . finally , the polymerization of other methacrylates ( alkyl = butyl , hexyl , decyl , stearyl , and sec-butyl ) , was conducted and the effect of the nature of the alkyl ester group on the molecular and structural characteristics was established . 
treatment of 1-methylimidazol-2-yl lithium with Cp2Zr(C1)CH3 ( 6 ) gave the corresponding methyl(1-methyl-2-imidazolyl)zirconocene complex <nUm> . treatment of <nUm> with BC18F15 ( 8 ) led to selective methyl abstraction . the resulting (imidazolyl)zirconocene cation <nUm> dimerized under the reaction conditions to yield the dinuclear imidazolyl bridged bis(zirconocene) dication complex <nUm> that was structurally characterized by x-ray diffraction and by DFT calculations . 
four new mixed - ring zirconium complexes , [ CH2 = CH(CH 2)n-C5H4](RC5H4)ZrCl <nUm> [ n = <nUm> , r = CH3OCH2CH2(3) ; n = <nUm> , r = C3H7O ( 4 ) ; n = <nUm> , r = Me3Si ( 5 ) ; n = <nUm> , r = allyl ( 6 ) ] , have been prepared by the reaction of CH2 = CH(CH2)nC5H4ZrCl 3* DME[n = <nUm> ( 1 ) ; n = <nUm> ( 2 ) ] with RC5H 4Li . when activated with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) , the catalytic activities of the above complexes in ethylene polymerization were tested . complexes <nUm> and <nUm> show high activities similar to Cp2ZrCl <nUm> . introduction of methoxyethyl group into cp - ligand dramatically decreases the catalytic activities of complexes <nUm> and <nUm> , which can be overcome by increasing the amount of MAO . for complex <nUm> , the dependence of activity and molecular weight ( Mn ) on the Al / Zr ratio , the polymerization time ( tp ) , polymerization temperature ( TP ) and the polymerization solvent volume ( V ) was investigated . 
A series of phenyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl zirconocenes have been prepared by the reaction of the corresponding ligand with n-BuLi and Cl4Zr in toluene , which were characterized by 1H NMR , MS spectra and elemental analysis . ethylene polymerizations with these complexes in combination with MAO were studied . it is found that the catalytic activity and the molecular weight of polyethylene with one phenyl substituted zirconocene increase with the enhancement of polymerization temperature . 
NMR - spectra of new coordination compounds of zirconocene with 5-norbornene-2-ol and 5-norbornene-2-methanol were studied . besides traditional NMR techniques , a series of bidimensional ones were applied , such as : COSY , HMQC and NOESY . the possibility of obtaining of new metallopolymers via photoinduced polymerization of new Zr - containing monomers is discussed . 
busico and co-workers have provided a clue to rationalize the factors that control the tacticities observed in PP prepared with conformationally dynamic zirconocene - based catalysts under appropriate experimental conditions . In order to find a good agreement between experimental and calculated stereosequence distributions , these authors have proposed an alternative plausible oscillating mechanism for the catalyst . solvent and cocatalyst effects have been also documented and compared to more evident environmental factors ( i.e. , the introduction of bulky rings on the ligands ) as regards the conformational dynamism of the catalyst during chain growth . 
conjugate addition of (E)-3-trimethylsilyl-1-propenylziroconocene to (E,E)-divinylketones in the presence of catalytic amount of CuBr*SMe2 affords (E)-allylsilanes containing (E)-a,b-unsaturated carbonyl moiety under mild conditions with good yield . they undergo highly stereocontrolled silicon - assisted intramolecular cylization when treated with Cl4Ti leading to polysubstituted cyclohexanones . 
the complex polymorphic behaviour of four syndiotactic polypropylene ( sPP ) samples have been analysed by means of DSC and WAXD techniques . two samples ( sPP1 , sPP2 ) were synthesised via metallocene polymerization by using the ansa - zirconocene ph 2C(Cp)(9-Flu)ZrCl <nUm> as catalyst . finally , two additional specimens with different molar masses ( sPP1 - fr1 , sPP1 - fr2 ) were prepared from the most syndiotactic sPP1 sample by temperature gradient extraction . the WAXD analysis shows that together with the orthorhombic form I , form II can coexist in a variable but small proportion depending on both the chain features and the processing conditions . the relative contribution of the disordered and the ordered types of form I is also dictated by molar mass , configurational microstructure as well as processing conditions . the observed changes in the thermal properties as measured by DSC and in the mechanic - dynamical relaxations of the samples , on slowing the crystallisation rate down , can be rationalised in terms of two concurrent processes , namely the perfection undergone by the crystals and the segregation of the amorphous phase . 
4,4'-Dibromobiphenyl reacted with n-BuLi to form 4,4'-dilithiobiphenyl , which further reacted with <nUm> , <nUm> , <nUm> , 5-tetramethylcyclopent-2-enone following the elimination of water to give the ligand 4-(C5Me4H) C3H2 - C3H2 (C5Me4H)-4 ( 1 ) . ligand <nUm> reacted with n-BuLi and Cl4Zr to form the p-biphenylene-bridged dinuclear tetramethylcyclopentadienyl zirconium trichlorides 4-(C5Me4ZrCl3) · C3H2 - C3H2 (C5Me4ZrCl3)-4 , which reacted in situ with cyclopentadienyl lithium(CpLi) or indenyl lithium ( IndLi ) to give the corresponding p-biphenylene-bridged dinuclear zirconocenes 4-(C5Me4ZrCl2Cp') C3H2 - C6H4(C5Me4ZrCl 2Cp')-4 [ cp' = cp(2) , ind(3) ] . the zirconocenes <nUm> and <nUm> were characterized by 1H NMR , MS spectra and elemental analysis , and were studied for ethylene polymerization with methyl a-luminoxane ( MAO ) as cocatalyst . both <nUm> and <nUm> show very high activities and reach the maximum at a higher temperature , indicating that the introduction of the p-biphenylene-bridge increased the catalytic activity and thermal stability of the dinuclear zirconocene catalysts . 
A total synthesis of (+)-epiafricanol ( 6 ) has been readily achieved from d-glucose . the tricyclic alcohol target was arrived at by first forming methyl 6-O-benzyl-2-deoxy-2-C-methyl-a-D-altropyranoside ( 12 ) and converting this intermediate into methyl 2-C-methyl-2,3,4-trideoxy-a-D-threo-hexopyranoside ( 14 ) . there followed a series of steps resulting in extension of the side chain to give the isopropenyl pyranoside <nUm> . this advanced intermediate was subjected to zirconocene - promoted ring contraction , which gave rise to <nUm> and set the stage for conversion to <nUm> . this tertiary carbinol was transformed into <nUm> by sequential ring - closing metathesis and stereodirected simmons - smith cyclopropanation . 
the reaction of trimethylaluminum with the internal water of a zeolite ( the Na form of ZSM-5 , O2Si : Al2O3 = <nUm> ) yielded immobilized methylaluminoxanes which , in the absence of other organoaluminum cocatalysts , reacted with metallocenes ( Cp2ZrCl2 , Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) to form heterogenized complexes active in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene . the kinetics of ethylene and propylene polymerization in the presence of zeolite - supported zirconocene catalysts was studied . the reaction order of ethylene and propylene polymerization with respect to the concentration of the monomer changes from <nUm> to <nUm> as the concentration of the monomer in the reaction zone increases . the apparent activation energies of ethylene and propylene polymerization with the ZSM-5(H2O) / AlMe3 / Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst were found to be <nUm> and <nUm> kJ / mol , respectively . it is inferred that the synthesis of methylaluminoxane directly on the surface of a support and the formation of catalytic complexes in the absence of free methylaluminoxane reduce the probability of leaching active centers from the support surface to a solution . 
A series of new oxygen - substituted , asymmetric zirconocene dichlorides ( rac-{1-[5,6-(ethylenedioxy)-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl]-2- (9-e5-fluorenyl)ethane}zirconium dichloride ( 3a ) , rac{1-[5,6-(ethylenedioxy)-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl]-2- (9-e5-fluorenyl)ethane}dimethylzirconium ( 3b ) and rac-{[5,6-ethylenedioxy)-2-methyl-1-e5-indenyl] ( 9-e5-fluorenyl ) dimethylsilane } zirconium dichloride ( 3c ) } have been prepared and their polymerization behavior was investigated in dependence of monomer concentration , temperature and catalyst activation . the presence of oxygen substituents on the indenyl ring results in a strong increase of polymerization activities and also of polymer molecular weights with decreasing Al / Zr ratio . significantly higher molecular masses and activities were found for the dimethyl complex 3b after activation with [(C6H5)3C+] [(C6F5)4B-] deriving from the absence of chain transfer to aluminum and higher concentration of active cata lyst species . the mechanism of stereoerror formation of the oxygen - containing C1 - symmetric catalyst was investigated by deuterium labeling studies on propene monomers . the results are discussed on the basis of a reversible chain transfer to aluminum . 
the polymerized metallocene catalyst <nUm> was prepared by the co-polymerization of ansa - zirconocene complex [ ( CH2 = CH)CH3Si(C 5H4)2]ZrCl2 ( 3 ) containing vinyl substituted silane bridge with styrene in the presence of radical initiator . catalyst <nUm> was found to display high ethylene polymerization activity of <nUm> × <nUm> gPE / ( mol*h ) with a viscosity average molecular weight ( me ) value of <nUm> × <nUm> using methylalumoxane ( MAO ) as a co-catalyst . the ethylene polymerization has been investigated under different conditions . 
A group <nUm> metallocene complex that serves as olefin polymerization catalyst was tethered on a solid support such as silica gel by covalent bonds . A zirconocene complex that has a vinyl group on its cyclopentadienyl ligand was hydrosilated or hydroborated to introduce a functional anchor for immobilization reactions . the complex with a Si-Cl group was tethered on a silica surface by the reaction with a surface Si-OH group . the zirconocene with a BH group was immobilized on a silica gel modified with chlorodimethylvinylsilane . ethylene polymerization using the tethered catalysts showed that the hydroboration-method seems more effective than the hydrosilation-method . it exhibited comparable catalytic activity to the corresponding homogeneous catalyst and produced polyethylene of a higher molecular weight . 
In order to compare with silylene-bridged group <nUm> metallocenes . C2 symmetric dimethylgermylene-bridged zirconocene and hafnocene dichlorides were prepared and employed as the catalyst for polymerization of propylene in combination with methylaluminoxane ( MAO ) . germylene-bridged metallocenes always produced isotactic polypropylene of higher molecular weight than that produced by silylene-bridged analogues . the molecular structures of four metallocenes prepared from dimethylsilylene and germylenebis(2,3,5-trimethylcyclopentadienyl) were determined by x-ray diffraction and showed no substantial differences of geometry between silylene- and germylene-bridged ones . 
unexpectedly the zirconocene metalloligand [ cp ° 2Zr- (OOCCH2SH-k1O)(OOCCH2SH-k 2O,O' ) ] ( <nUm> ; cp ° = C5 - EtMe4 ) reacts with[NiCl2(PMe2Ph)2] or [PdCl2(PnBu3)2] in the presence of NEt3 ( ratio <nUm> : <nUm> : <nUm> ) to give the tetranuclear IVZr - NiII complex <nUm> and the octanuclear IVZr - PdII complex <nUm> , respectively . 
As a discovery of C - C coupling and amine elimination reaction by treatment of 6-dimethylamino-6-methylfulvene with zirconium tetrachloride , experiments using amino-substituted benzofulvene 1a or aminopentafulvene 2a , instead of 6-dimethylamino-6-methylfulvene , gave bis [1-(dimethylamino)ethenyl-indenyl]zirconium dichloride 1c which was characterized by x-ray diffraction as monoclinic , space group C2 / c , a = <nUm> . <nUm> <nUm> nm , b = <nUm> . <nUm> <nUm> nm , c = <nUm> <nUm> nm , β = <nUm> . <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> . <nUm> <nUm> nm <nUm> , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> . <nUm> <nUm> , and bis[(1-methyl-4,5-dihydro-2-pyrrolnyl)cyclopentadienyl ] zirconium dichloride 2c as triclinic , space group P1 , a = <nUm> . <nUm> <nUm> ( 16 ) nm , b = <nUm> . <nUm> <nUm> nm , c = <nUm> <nUm> nm , α = <nUm> . <nUm> , β = <nUm> ( 3 ) , γ = <nUm> . <nUm> ° , V = <nUm> . <nUm> <nUm> nm <nUm> , z = <nUm> , r = <nUm> . <nUm> <nUm> . 
A zirconocene - olefin complex induced reductive radical cyclization of b-haloalkyl allyl acetals in THF . this complex served as a single electron transfer reagent to promote the cyclization . furthermore , the reaction in DME afforded tetrahydrofuranylmethylzirconium species effectively . 
A single - stage , i.e. , degree of polymerization of one , and enantioselective version of the ziegler - natta alkene polymerization was envisioned as a potentially significant and useful method for catalytic asymmetric C-C bond formation , shortly after the corresponding alkyne version involving Zr - catalyzed alkylalumination of alkynes was discovered in <nUm> . however , the discovery of such an asymmetric reaction proved to be a major challenge . At least three widely observable unwanted side reactions , i.e. , ( 1 ) cyclic carbometalation , ( 2 ) b-H transfer hydrometalation , and ( 3 ) alkene polymerization , represented by the ziegler - natta polymerization , were noted and were to be avoided . with Zr as the metal at the catalytic center , we eventually came up with a notion that di- or multiple alkylation of Zr was to be avoided for achieving superior acyclic asymmetric carbometalation . this , in turn , led us to avoid the use of highly nucleophilic alkylmetals containing alkali metals and Mg . aluminum used in ziegler - natta polymerization that can selectively monoalkylate Zr proved to be one of a very limited number of favorable metals . even so , undesirable cyclic carbozirconation can occur in nonpolar solvents via intricate bimetallic routes to cyclic organozirconium species . the vastly different reactant - catalyst stoichiometry and the absence of polymerization promotors , such as methylaluminoxane , in our investigations permit us to ignore the ziegler - natta polymerization as a serious and unwanted side reaction , although use of limited amounts of promotors can in some cases accelerate otherwise sluggish ZACA reactions . selection of the currently used Zr catalysts including (R)- and (S)-(NMI)2)ZrCl)2 ) , dichlorobis(neomenthylindenyl) zirconium was made by screening <nUm> or so known chiral zirconocene derivatives . systematic scientific design and screening of chiral ligands are clearly highly desirable , and efforts along this line are ongoing . even at the current level of development , however , the ZACA reaction shows considerable promise as an efficient and selective method for catalytic asymmetric C-C bond formation , which has already been used to significantly modernize and improve syntheses of natural products including deoxypolypropionates and isoprenoids of biological and medicinal interest . 
the sequential homo- and copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene and 1-octene initiated by Cp2ZrCl2-methylaluminoxane and C2H4[Ind]2ZrCl2-methylaluminoxane homogeneous catalysts yielded reactor mixtures based on HDPE and different amounts of ethylene copolymers with these olefins . the composition and properties of polymeric products formed at the stage of copolymerization are independent of the preliminary homopolymerization of ethylene . the components of the reactor mixtures are capable of cocrystallization directly in the course of synthesis . the synthesized reactor mixtures based on HDPE and ethylene-1-hexene copolymers which surpass linear LDPE in tensile strength possess good plastic properties and a high melt flow index . 
A new cyclopentadiene derivative 1,2-diphenyl-4-propyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene(1) was synthesized by reaction of 3,4-diphenyl-2-cyclopentenone with n-propyl lithium . <nUm> was treated with n-butyl lithium and then reacted with Cl4Zr in toluene to give sterically bulky unbridged zirconocene dichloride (1,2-Ph2-4-PrCp)2ZrCl2(2) . 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopic analyses reveal its c2u- symmetric conformation in solution . upon activation with methylaluminoxane(MAO) , <nUm> effectively polymerizes ethylene and produces high molecular weight polyethylenes with high melting transition temperatures at low Al / Zr ratios . At ambient conditions , <nUm> / MAO system shows high catalytic activity in propylene polymerization and produces oily oligomers . 
the activity of a MgCl2(THF)2 / MAO / Cp2ZrCl2 / MAO catalyst was studied in copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene in relation to Al : Zr mole ratio ( 1500-7000 at <nUm> ° C ) , experimental temperature ( 20-70 ° C ) , and time ( 20-90 min at <nUm> ° C ; 10-55 min at <nUm> ° C ) . As the temperature and the Al : Zr ratio were increased , the activity of the catalyst rose . At the same time , the degree of incorporation of 1-hexene into the polymer chain increased and the m , melting point and crystallinity of the copolymer decreased . the catalyst was stable throughout the copolymerization . the process rate and copolymer properties were not affected by copolymerization time .

the sequential homo- and copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene and 1-octene initiated by Cp2ZrCl2-methylaluminoxane and CH2 [Ind]2ZrCl2-methylaluminoxane homogeneous catalysts yielded the reactor mixtures based on HDPE and different amounts of ethylene copolymers with these olefins . the composition and properties of polymeric products formed at the stage of copolymerization are independent of the preliminary homopolymerization of ethylene . the components of the reactor mixtures are capable of cocrystallization directly in the course of synthesis . the synthesized reactor mixtures based on HDPE and ethylene-1-hexene copolymers which surpass linear LDPE in tensile strength possess good plastic properties and melt flow index . 
the reaction of trimethylaluminum with the inner water of a zeolite ( the Na form of ZSM-5 , O2Si : Al2O3 = <nUm> ) yielded immobilized methylaluminoxanes which in the absence of other organoaluminum cocatalysts reacted with metallocenes ( Cp2ZrCl2 , Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 ) to form heterogenized complexes active in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene . the kinetics of ethylene and propylene polymerization in the presence of zeolite - supported zirconocene catalysts was studied . the reaction order of ethylene and propylene polymerization with respect to the concentration of the monomer changes from <nUm> to <nUm> as the concentration of the monomer in the reaction zone increases . the apparent activation energies of ethylene and propylene polymerization with the ZSM-5(H2O) / AlMe3 / Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst were found to be <nUm> and <nUm> kJ / mol , respectively . it is inferred that the synthesis of methylaluminoxane directly on the surface of a support and the formation of catalytic complexes in the absence of free methylaluminoxane reduce the probability of leaching active centers from the support surface to a solution . 
the polymerization of ethylene using supported zirconocene catalysts with varying support compositions SiO2-MAO-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2+TIBA ( catalyst I ) and MgCl2-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2+TIBA ( catalyst II ) ( MAO is methylaluminoxane , ind is indenyl , and TIBA is triisobutylaluminum ) was studied . the examined catalytic systems differ in their activity , ability to control the molecular mass of the resulting polymer , and kinetics of copolymerization with 1-hexene . the molecular structure of PE prepared with supported catalysts I and II and a homogeneous catalyst Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2+MAO was studied by IR and 13C NMR spectroscopy . As evidenced by 13C NMR spectroscopy , PE samples synthesized with the homogeneous catalyst and catalyst I contain ethyl branches along with the end methyl groups in the low-molecular-mass fractions . on the contrary , PE prepared with supported catalyst II is devoid of ethyl branches but contains vinyl groups as the basic type of unsaturation . 
polymeriztion of linear low density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) using a dual functional catalytic system containing different kinds of metallocene / AlEt <nUm> / B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> as copolymerization catalysts and Ti(On-Bu) <nUm> / AlEt <nUm> as the ethylene dimerization catalyst was studied . using the single cocatalyst AlEt <nUm> in the catalytic system , it is easy to overcome the shortcoming of interference between two catalytic metals in a single reactor . among the four zirconocene systems used , the most active dual functional catalytic system is [ Ti(On-Bu) <nUm> / AlEt <nUm> / Et(Ind) 2ZrCl <nUm> / B(C 6F <nUm> ) <nUm> ] , its activity reaches <nUm> × <nUm> <nUm> gPE / molZr*h . the density of obtained LLDPE is <nUm> g / cm <nUm> and 1-butene insertion rate <nUm> mol % . 
the catalytic behavior of the highly isospecific catalyst rac-Me2Si(2-Me,4-PhInd)2ZrCl2 immobilized on the surface of a polymer support , PE with grafted poly(acrylic acid ) that was preliminarily treated by poly(methylaluminoxane) , was studied . the immobilized catalyst was activated by triisobutylaluminum . the molecular masses , melting temperatures , and isotacticity of the produced PP were examined . it was shown that the modification of the catalyst by the boron salt Me2NHPhB(C6F5)4 leads to a change in the kinetics of polymerization and in the isotacticity of the resulting PP . factors affecting the rate and stability of the catalytic behavior of the studied supported catalysts such as the content of immobilized zirconocene , the concentration of triisobutylaluminum , and the reaction temperature were analyzed . it was demonstrated that the catalyst is not washed from the support surface in the course of polymerization and that PP is produced in the form of granules with a bulk density of <nUm> - <nUm> g / cm3 . 
this paper describes ethylene polymerization using four kinds of zirconocene with different substituents in the cp ring as catalysts and aluminoxane as cocatalyst . polymerization activities , polymerization kinetics and me of resultant polyethylene were compared . it was found basically that polymerization activities were in the following order : A2 ≅ B2 > A1 > B1 [ A1 : ( CH2 = CH - CH2 - CH2 - cp)2 Cl2Zr ; B1 : ( CH2 = CH - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CP)2 Cl2Zr ; A2 : ( CH2 = C2H3 - CH2 - cp)2 Cl2Zr ; B2 : ( CH3 ( CH3 ) C = CH - CH2CP)2 CI2Zr ] . A novel kinetic model was developed based on the consideration of reactivation reaction . A possible mechanism of influence of different substituents in the cp ring on polymerization activities was discussed .
