Ethylene polymerization by zirconocene-B(C6F5)3 catalysts with various aluminum compounds has been investigated. It is found that the catalytic activity depended on zirconocenes used, and especially on the type of aluminum compounds. For Et(H4Ind)2ZrCl2 (H4Ind : tetrahydroindenyl), the activity decreases in the following order: Me3Al > i-Bu3Al > Et3Al ≫ Et2AlCl. While for Cp2ZrCl2(Cp : cyclopentadienyl), it varies as follows: i-Bu3Al > Me3Al ≫ Et3Al. Furthermore, the activity is significantly affected by the addition mode of the catalytic components, which may imply that the formation of active centers is associated with an existing concentration of catalytic components. Results of thermal behavior of polyethylene (PE) studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) show that crystallinity of the polymer prepared with Et3Al is higher than that with Me3Al or i-Bu3Al. It is also found that the number-average molecular weight (M) of the polymers prepared with Me3Al or i-Bu3Al is much higher than that with Et3Al. 1H-NMR studies substantiate that i-Bu3Al is a more efficient alkylation agent of Cp2ZrCl2 in comparison with Me3Al. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
