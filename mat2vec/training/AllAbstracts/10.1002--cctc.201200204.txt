Several biomimetic metalloporphyrin complexes (M(TPP)XY; in which TPP=meso-porphyrin; M=Mg II, Al III, Sn II, or Sn IV; X=OAc, F, Cl, Br, I, OTf, or none; and Y=Cl, Br, I, OTf, or none) were prepared, characterized, and used effectively in the "green" synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO 2. The catalytic systems of Mg(TPP)/tetrabutylammonium iodide and Al(TPP)Cl/phenyltrimethyl ammonium tribromide can initiate the cycloaddition of epoxides and CO 2 at room temperature to generating cyclic carbonates in excellent yield. ChlorophyllA is shown to induce enantioselectivity of racemic propylene oxide. All reactions displayed excellent selectivity to cyclic carbonate without polycarbonate and other by-products. Chloropropylene carbonate is shown to be obtained under CO 2 bubbling conditions catalyzed by Al(TPP)Cl/phenyltrimethylammonium tribromide. The catalytic order of activity for biomimetic metalloporphyrins is Al III>Mg II>Sn IV>Sn II. These phenomena are explained with respect to the Lewis acidity of metal center in metalloporphyrins.
