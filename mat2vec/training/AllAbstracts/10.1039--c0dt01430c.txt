Starting from 1,1′-diacetylferrocene the ortho-amino,α- dimethylamino[3]ferrocenophane system 3 was prepared. This was converted to the o-imino,α-Cp-derivative 6. Subsequent treatment with e.g. an excess of methyllithium followed by ZrCl 2 (NMe 2 ) 2 (thf) 2 and Me 2 SiCl 2 eventually gave the [3]ferrocenophane based Cp-amido zirconium complex 11b. In a similar way the [3]ferrocenophane derived fluorenyl-Cp ansa-zirconocene dichloride complex 20 was obtained. The 20-methylalumoxane (MAO) system is an active homogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalyst for ethylene polymerization. The 11b-MAO system reacts efficiently with an ethene-1-octene mixture to yield a mixture of linear polyethylene plus the ethene-1-octene copolymer. The compounds 5, 8, 10b, 11b, 13, 14, and 20 were characterized by X-ray diffraction. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.
