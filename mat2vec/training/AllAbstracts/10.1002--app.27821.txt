The dye initiators consisting of N-[3-(p-alkylpyridine)propyl]-2-[N-(3- bromopropyl)quinoline]-2-methylenebenzotiazolium diiodides as chromophores and n-buryltriphenylborate anion as electron donor were prepared to achieve an efficient photoinitiator of free radical polymerization in a visible-light region. The relative photoinitiating efficiencies of novel photoinitiators of vinyl monomers polymerization were evaluated. The results obtained clearly documented that the bicationic photoinitiators exhibit a marked increase in the photoinitiation ability compared to the initiators consisting of a single charged hemicyanine dye.
