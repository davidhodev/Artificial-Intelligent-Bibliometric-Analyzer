Some zirconium compounds containing chelating diamido dipyrrole or tetra-amido tetra-pyrrole ligands were synthesized and used as polymerization catalyst with high polymerization activity of ethylene at 40 °C and 1 bar, in presence of MAO or B(C6F5)3 as co-catalyst. The maximum catalytic activity reached 1100 Kg/mol bar h for ethylene polymerization by Zr2(octa-phenyl calix[4]pyrrolidine)Cl4. These results reveal that half-zirconocene like complexes including four terminal chlorine and one calix[4]pyrrolidine in middle with both π and σ-interaction have the highest ethylene polymerization turnover (compounds 13, 14). © 2007 Springer.
