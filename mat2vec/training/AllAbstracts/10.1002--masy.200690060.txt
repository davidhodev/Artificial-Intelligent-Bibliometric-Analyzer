In the presence of an trialkyl aluminum cocatalyst the activation of scandium, yttrium and lutetium mono(cyclopentadienyl) complexes with various substituted cyclopentadienyl ligands by [Ph3C][B(C6F 5)4 results in highly efficient catalysts for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene. As active species half-sandwich alkyl cations is assumed that is isostructural with the mono(cyclopentadienyl) titanium alkyl cation originally proposed by Zambelli.
