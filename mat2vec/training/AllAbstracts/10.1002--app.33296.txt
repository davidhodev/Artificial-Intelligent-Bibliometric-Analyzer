The star-shaped polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was synthesized via radical polymerization promoted by metallocene complexes in the presence of initiator of tetra(2,3-epoxy propoxy)silane (Is) and reducing agent Zn. The effect of temperature, time, molar ratio of monomer to initiator, and the structure of metallocene complexes on the polymerization performance was investigated. The structure and properties of the obtained polymer were characterized by gel permeation chromatography, multiangle laser light scattering, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and WAXD. The results indicated that the obtained polymer was atacticspecific and featured narrow molecular weight distribution (1.30-1.57). Star-shaped organosiloxane- functionalized PMMA was produced.
