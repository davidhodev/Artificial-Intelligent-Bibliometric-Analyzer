The system EtInd2ZrCH+/3 is parallel with SiO(*)/2 MAO- was studied theoretically by means of an extended Huckel method (EHMO) for the propylene adsorption. The adsorption of the different forms of olefins was evaluated on the active site formed by metallocene and silica, in presence or not of methylaluminoxane (MAO). In this way, it is possible to appreciate the important function of MAO when the active site is modeled considering all components. According to these results the presence of MAO avoids the adsorption of some forms of propylene.
