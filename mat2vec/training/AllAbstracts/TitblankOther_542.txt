The tetraphenyl substituted disiloxane bridged ansa-zirconocene has been generated to probe the effect of bridging ligand on metallocene polymerization. The indicated zirconocene has been synthesized by the reaction of ZrCl4 with the distannylated precursor compound. The new disiloxane bridged ansa-metallocene was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, mass analysis, and elemental analysis. Ethylene polymerization was carried out to in-, vestigate the polymerization properties of the prepared complex. Polymerization experiments exhibited that the catalytic activity increases with the increase in polymerization temperature as well as the amount of cocatalyst. On the other hand, the molecular weights of the polymers decreased with the increase in polymerization temperature. It turned out that tetraphenyl replacement caused about 50 to 70% activity reduction. The most important feature associated in tetramethyl to tetraphenyl substitution was that molecular weights of the polymers from the tetraphenyl substituted complex were enormously improved comparing to those of the polymers from the tetramethyl one.
