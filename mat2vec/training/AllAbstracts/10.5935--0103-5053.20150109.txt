©2015 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.Homogeneous polymerization catalysts require large amounts of solvent and cannot control the polymer morphology. In order to solve this issue, a narrow-shaped spherical ZSM-5 zeolite was used in ethylene polymerization as a support for zirconocene (Cp<inf>2</inf>ZrCl<inf>2</inf>). Several heterogeneous catalytic precursors were prepared and used in ethylene polymerization reactions, which showed yields (between 980-8019 kg PE mol<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) and were efficient at promoting morphological replication of the support. So, a well-established protocol for slurry polymerization reaction was found, yielding well-defined polymer particles in an advantageous polymerization process.
