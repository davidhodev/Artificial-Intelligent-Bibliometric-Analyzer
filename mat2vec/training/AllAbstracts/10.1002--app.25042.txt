The influence of montmorillonite (MMT) on the syndiotactic polymerization behavior of styrene was studied. To avoid the hydrophilic surface of the MMT coming into contact with the catalyst, which could poison it, SAN was introduced between the MMT and CpTi (OCH3)3. MMT was introduced into the catalytic system as a supporter for the Ti catalyst (supported catalytic system) or just dispersed in the polymerization solvent directly (in situ polymerization system). The polymerization results showed that surface modification of MMT dramatically affected the catalytic activity as well as the syndiotacticity of the polymers. This is mainly explained by the insulator SAN preventing the formation of the inactive/little active species Si - O - Ti and other atactic active species resulting from the reaction of the -OH on the MMT layer surface with CpTi(OCH3)3.
