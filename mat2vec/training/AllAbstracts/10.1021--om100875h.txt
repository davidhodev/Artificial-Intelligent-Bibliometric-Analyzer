Reaction of (silyl)(silylene)tungsten complex Cp*(OC) 2W(SiMe3)(=SiMes2) (1) with sulfur reagents, S8 and ethylene sulfide 4, afforded cyclic carbene tungsten complex Cp*(S)W{=C(SiMe3)C(=O)OSi(Mes)2S} (3) via C=O bond fission of a carbonyl ligand and 1,2-migration of the SiMe3 group from W to the resulting carbene carbon. In contrast to the tungsten complex, reaction of (silyl)(silylene)molybdenum complex Cp*(OC) 2Mo(SiMe3)(=SiMes2) (2) with 4 gave η2-thiocarbonyl complex Cp*(S)Mo[{η2-S= C(SiMe3)}C(=O)OSi(Mes)2S] (5), which would be formed by addition of a sulfur atom to the Mo=C bond of a molybdenum analogue of 3. © 2010 American Chemical Society.
