Enolizable ketones and thiols have been investigated as potential transfer agents for methyl methacrylate (MMA) polymerization mediated by the Cp 2 ZrMe 2 /B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 system. Addition of 1-10 equiv of acetophenone, acetone, or thiophenols inhibits polymerization, while the system tolerates the presence of tert-butylthiol (tBuSH). In this case, a moderate decrease in the molecular weight of the PMMAs is observed. The stoichiometric reactivity of these organic acids toward the cationic ester enolate complex [Cp 2 Zr(THF)(O(tBuO)C=CMe 2 )] + [MeB-(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ] - (1), which models the active species for MMA polymerization, has been investigated. Ketones undergo aldolization reactions with 1 to generate species that are inactive in MMA polymerization. Thiols readily cleave the Zr-O bond of 1 to give [Cp 2 Zr(SR)(THF)] + cations (R = tBu, 4; SC 6 H 4 -p-Cl, 6; SC 6 H 4 -o-OMe, 7). The crystal structure of 7 has been determined. In the presence of a tert-butyl ester R′CO 2 tBu, thiolato complexes 4, 6, and 7 smoothly decompose into the corresponding cationic carboxylato complex [Cp 2 Zr(THF)(O 2 CR′)] + (R′ = iPr, 5; CH 3 , 9) and thiol RSH, with release of isobutene. tert-Butylthiolato complex 4 and the in situ combination Cp 2 Zr(StBu)Me/B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 polymerized quantitatively MMA in toluene to yield PMMAs with narrow dispersity (M n /M w = 1.26-1.48), but with molecular weight much higher than the expected M n values, consistent with poor initiation efficiency and/or instability. © 2005 American Chemical Society.
