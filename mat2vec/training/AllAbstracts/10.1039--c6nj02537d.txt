© The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.The dimer lithium complex 3 and zirconium complexes 4-6 were synthesized and characterized. Monomer/dimer zirconium complexes 4-6 were synthesized by changing the molar ratio of ZrCl4:ligand. Their structures were confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis, which showed a distorted octahedral geometry. Complexes 5 and 6 were zirconium trichloride compounds, while complex 4 was not a zirconium chloride species. The catalytic behaviors of complexes 4-6 were investigated in the presence of MAO as a cocatalyst. It was found that the catalytic activities of these zirconium complexes toward ethylene polymerization were closely related to the bonding patterns (η3:η1, η3 or η1), the number of chlorine atoms in the procatalysts and the availability of the coordination site in the molecule. Zirconium trichloride complex 5 showed the highest catalytic activity mainly because of its η1 bonding pattern.
