Silyliminophenolate precursors (1-4) were prepared by reactions between 3-aminopropyldiethoxymethysilane (3-APS) and salicylaldehyde, 3-methoxysalicylaldehyde, 4-hydroxysalicylaldehyde, and 5-bromosalicylaldehyde in 1:1 mole ratio in ethanol at room temperature, respectively. Then these precursors were used in the preparation of the following compounds. The Zr-compounds (SPIMP)2Zr2(OnPr)2O, (MeO-SPIMP)2Zr2(OnPr)2O, (HO-SPIMP)2Zr2(OnPr)2O, and (Br-SPIMP)2Zr2(OnPr)2O were prepared by reaction of zirconium (IV) propoxide with silyliminophenolate (SPIMPH), silyliminomethoxyphenolate (MeO-SPIMPH), silyliminohydroxyphenolate (HO-SPIMPH), and silyliminobromophenolate (Br-SPIMPH) in n-propanol, respectively. All these compounds (1-8) were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, FTIR, mass spectroscopies, elemental, and thermogravimetric analyses. In order to see their (5-8) catalytic activity over lactides and epoxides these compounds were tested in polymerization of l-lactide (LLA) and 3- glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTS) and were effective. Poly-LLA, poly-GPTS, and copolymer of LLA/GPTS were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, DSC, TGA, MS and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
