We investigated the catalytic performance of both bridged unsubstituted [rac-Etlnd 2 ZrMe 2 , rac-Me 2 Silnd 2 ZrMe 2 ] and 2-substltuted [rac-Et(2-Melnd) 2 ZrMe 2 ), rac-Me 2 Si(2Melnd) 2 ZrMe 2 ] dimethylbisindenylzirconocenes activated with triisobutyl aluminum (TIBA) as a single activator in (a) homopolymerizations of ethylene and propylene, (b) copolymerization of ethylene with propylene and hexene-1, and (c) copolymerization of propylene with hexene-1 (at AlTIBA/Zr = 100-300 mol/mol). Unsubstituted catalysts were inactive in homopolymerizations of ethylene and propylene and copolymerization of propylene with hexene-1 but exhibited high activity in copolymerlzations of ethylene with propylene and hexene-1. 2-Substituted zirconocenes activated with TIBA were active In homopolymerizations of ethylene and propyl-ene and exhibited high activity in copolymerization of ethylene with propylene and hexene-1, and in copolymerization of propylene with hexene-1. Comparative microstructural analysis of ethylene-propylene copolymers prepared over rac-Me 2 Silnd 2 ZrMe 2 activated with TIBA or Me 2 NHPhB(C 6 F 5 ) 4 has shown that the copolymers formed upon activation with TIBA are statistical in nature with some tendency to alternation, whereas those with borate activated system show a tendency to formation of comonomer blocks.
