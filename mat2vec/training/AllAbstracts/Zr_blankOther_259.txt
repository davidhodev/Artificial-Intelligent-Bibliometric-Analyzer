The effect of support type on the activity of zirconocene-triisobutylaluminum (TIBA) systems was studied in the polymerization of propylene, and on the properties of the resulting PP. Three zirconocenes were used: Me2SiInd2ZrX2 (X = Cl or Me) and Ph2CCpFluZrCl2; and three supports were used: (i) SiO2 (spec, area Ssp, = 300 m2/g); (ii) SiO2-gr-PAAc [i.e. SiO2 modified with poly(acrylic acid) by radiative grafting]; (iii) PE-gr-PAAc (i.e. functionalized by radiative grafting, Ssp = 4 m2/g). Propylene was polymerized in, the liquid monomer. The supports were made to react with methylaluminoxane (MAO) and the product was used to immobilize a zirconocene compound to produce a supported catalyst. With TIBA as cocatalyst, the resulting PP constituted a replica of catalyst particles; the bulk density of PP was high, up to 0.5 g/cm3. As the Zr content in the catalyst was increased, the specific productivity (g PP/g catalyst) rose to attain a maximum, characteristic for a given support. Catalyst activity and M of PP were studied in relation to TIBA concentration. The type of MAO-modified support had little effect on the PP properties. Modification of the SiO2/MAO/Me2SiInd2ZrCl2 catalyst with a boron compound, CPh3B(C6F5)4/ did not affect PP properties but reduced the activity of the catalyst system at AlTIBAZr > 500.
