KGaA, Weinheim.Cp'TiCl2(N-(6-(2-(diethylboryl)phenyl)pyrid-2-yl)SiMe3), [Cp' = C5H5 (3), C5(CH3)5 (4)], and the aminoborane-free half-titanocene analogs with the general formula: Cp'TiCl2(N-(biphenyl-3-yl)SiMe3); [Cp' = C5H5 (7), C5(CH3)5 (8)] are synthesized and used in the polymerization of styrene. All the pre-catalysts are active in styrene polymerization, >90% syndiotactic poly(styrene) (st-PS) is produced, exceeding that of their ansa-homologues (C5(CH3)5)TiCl2(6-(2-(diethylboryl)phenyl)pyrid-2-ylamido)(dimethylsilyl) (9) and (C5(CH3)5)TiCl2(3-biphen-3-ylamido)(dimethylsilyl) (10) both in activity and molecular weight. Pre-catalyst 8 allows for the synthesis of high-molecular-weight st-PS with activities up to 5000 kgst-PS molcat-1 h-1. Implications of the 2-(diethylboryl)phenyl)pyrid-2-yl group on polymerization activity and molecular weight are discussed. A series of half-titanocene analogs is synthesized and used for the synthesis of syndiotactic poly(styrene) (st-PS). High-molecular-weight st-PS with M¯n values up to 1 400 000 g mol-1 (polydispersity index (PDI) = 1.38) is prepared with activities up to 5000 kgst-PS molcat-1 h-1.
