KGaA.UV-vis spectroscopic data indicate that zirconocene cations with Zr-bound allylic chain ends are generally formed during olefi n polymerization with zirconocene catalysts. The rates and extent of their formation and of their re-conversion to the initial pre-catalyst cations depend on the types of zirconocene complexes and activators used. (Figure Presented).
