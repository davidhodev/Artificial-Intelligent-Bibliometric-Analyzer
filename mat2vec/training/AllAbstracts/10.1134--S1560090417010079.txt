© 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.The structure of zirconocene is determined experimentally. Zirconocene is found to catalyze effectively the copolymerization of α-olefins with nonconjugated dienes in the presence of minimal amounts of methylalumoxane as an organoaluminum activator. On the basis of a highly ferromagnetic carrier (a product of the reaction between Fe3O4 microparticles and Si(OEt)4), a deposited zirconocene catalyst is obtained. Using the latter, copolymers of α-olefins (1-hexene, 1-octene, and 1-decene) with 1,7-octadiene and 1,4- di(3-butenyl)benzene are synthesized. The obtained ferromagnetic copolymers demonstrate properties of effective absorbents of hydrocarbons, namely, oil sponges. A copolymer of 1-octene and 1,4-di(3-butenyl) benzene is found to possess the maximum adsorption capacity (up to 8) in the studied series.
