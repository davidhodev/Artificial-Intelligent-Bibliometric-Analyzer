The synthesis, structural features of octahedral titanium complexes with different ancillaryligations and their catalytic properties in the polymerization and isomerization of α-olefins arepresented. As a ligands, benzamidinate, phosphinoamido, allylic, acetylacetonate and β-diketiminate moieties have been described. The peculiarities and mechanisms of the olefinspolymerization catalyzed by these complexes activated with methylalumoxane, the influenceof the reaction conditions on the formation of highly stereoregular, elastomeric or atacticpolypropylenes, are discussed. Various complexes were also active in the isomerization of α-olefins sheding light on the plausible polymerization mechanism. © 2006 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.
