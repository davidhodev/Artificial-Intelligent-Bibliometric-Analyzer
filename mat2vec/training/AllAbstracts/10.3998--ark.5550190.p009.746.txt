©ARKAT USA, Inc.A green method for the synthesis of new glycerol-derived selenol esters was developed by reactions between several anhydrides and bis-(2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolanylmethyl)diselenide using Rongalite®, K2CO3 and polyethylene glycol-400 (PEG-400) as the solvent. These reactions were efficiently conducted under mild conditions, employing stable and non-hazardous starting materials and in short reaction times (20-180 min), affording the corresponding selenol esters in moderate to good yields (55-85%) at room temperature. Further, it was demonstrated that deprotection of the ketal protecting group of the selenol ester 3, with acidic cationexchange resin Dowex®50WX8, produces the water-soluble selenol ester.
