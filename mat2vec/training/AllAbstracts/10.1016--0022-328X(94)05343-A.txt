The synthesis of Me3Si or Me2HSi substituted doubly bridged cyclopentadiene systems [(Me2Si)2(C5H3R′) (C5H3R)] (1a: R = R′ = H; 1b: R = R′ = SiMe3; 1c: R = H, R′ = SiMe3; 1d: R = SiMe3, R′ = SiMe2H) derived from 2,2,8,8-tetramethyl-2,8-disilatricyclo [7.3.0.03, 7]dodeca-3,5,9,11-tetraene is discussed. The reaction of 1 with nBuLi yields the mono lithiated compounds Li[(Me2Si)2(C5H3R′)(C5H2R)] (2). 2 forms with 0.5 equivalents fo TiCl4 (3) the appropriate titanocene-dichlorides [(Me2Si)2(C5H3R′) (η5-C5H2R)]2TiCl2(4). The analogous reaction of 2 with equimolar amounts of (η5-C5H4SiMe3)TiCl3 (5) affords the titanocene-dichlorides [(Me2Si)2(C5H3R′)(η5-C5H4Me3)TiCl2 (6) in excellent yields. Dilithiat 1a reacts with two equivalents of (η5-C5H4SiMe3)TiCl3 (5) to form the compound {μ-[(η5-C5H3)SiMe2]2[(η5-C5H4SiMe3)TiCl2]2 (8) in which 1a itself is part of two titanocene-dichloride moieties. Furthermore, the catalytical activity of compounds 4, 6 and 8 is performed. It was found, that these metallocene complexes polymerize ethene, but do not react with propene; the copolymerization of ethene and propene with 4 as catalyst was successful.
