The synthesis of a novel polymer support and its use for the attachment of a metallocene catalyst is described in detail. The support was prepared by solid-phase synthesis from functionalized beads by the introduction of a spacer chain followed by the attachment of an alkylated cyclopentadienyl ligand. The characterization of the resulting resin-bound ligand and catalyst was achieved by using a wide range of analytical techniques for on-bead analysis. The supported titanocene complex exhibited moderate catalytic activity in the polymerization of ethylene. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
