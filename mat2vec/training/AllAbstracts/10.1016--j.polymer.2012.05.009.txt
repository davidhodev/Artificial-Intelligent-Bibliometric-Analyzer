Household LED bulbs and halogen lamps are used to promote the ring-opening photopolymerization of epoxides in the presence of a new series of iridium(III) complexes (IrCs) exhibiting enhanced visible light absorption properties through the introduction of a coumarin moiety. These latter complexes are used as catalyst photoinitiators in an oxidative cycle in combination with a silane and an iodonium salt. Remarkably, even under the selected very soft irradiations (e.g. light intensity lower than 2 mW/cm2), excellent polymerization profiles are obtained (conversions > 80%). The mechanisms are investigated by ESR and luminescence experiments. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
