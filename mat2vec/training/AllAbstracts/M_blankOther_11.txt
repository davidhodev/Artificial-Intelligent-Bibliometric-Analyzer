[(C13 H8)Si(CH3)2(C 5H3)] was prepared with fluorenyl lithium, dimethyldichlorosilane and cyclopentadienylsodium with 51 % total yield. Furthermore, a Si-bridged fluorenylidene cyclopen-tadienylidene zirconium complex [(C13H8)Si(CH3)2(C 5H3)]ZrCl2 was synthesized by reaction of [(C13H8)Si(CH3)2(C5H 3)] and ZnCl4 with THF as a solvent under the Schlenk system. The reaction gave the target compound in 86% yield. The zirconium complex was characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR. After activated with methylaluminoxane, the metallocene complex showed a high catalytic activity for the ethylene and propylene polymerization reaction under atmosphere pressure. It was found that the title compound has a catalytic activity in the order of 103 g/h, and the molecular weight of ethylene-propylene copolymers is about 104.
