Poly(propylene-ran-1,3-butadiene) that contained selectively inserted 1,4-butadiene units was successfully synthesized by Ind-1 activated with MAOs. The average amounts of 1,4-BD per polymer chain and thus the average length of propylene units between 1,4-BDs of the copolymer could be controlled by the butadiene concentration in the feed. The copolymers with high molecular weight were converted to α,ω-divinyl isotactic PP by ethenolysis.
