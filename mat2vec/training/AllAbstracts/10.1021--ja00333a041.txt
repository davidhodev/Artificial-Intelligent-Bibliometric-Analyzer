The soluble bis(cyclopentadienyl)bis(phenyl)titanium/methylalumoxane catalyst system produces isotactic polypropylene with a novel stereoblock microstructure consistent with a chain-end stereochemical control mechanism. Chiral catalysts derived from the racemic enantiomers of ethylene-bridged indenyl derivatives are the first metallocene catalysts to form isotactic polypropylene with the conventional structure predicted by an enantiomorphic-site stereochemical control model. The meso achiral form of the ethylene-bridged titanium indenyl diastereomers and zirconocene derivatives produce polypropylene with an ideally atactic structure. Differing regiospecificities during cis addition with soluble Ti and V chain-end controlled stereospecific systems result in Ti being isotactic specific and V being syndiotactic specific.
