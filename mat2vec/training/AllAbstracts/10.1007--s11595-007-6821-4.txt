The condensation of acetylacetone (CH3COCH2COCH 3) with benzdine (H2N-C6H4-C 6H4-NH2) yielded diimine ligand 1 [HOC(Me)C(H)(Me)C=N(p-C6H4)(C6H 4-p)N=C(Me)C(H)C(Me)OH)], which was converted into sodium salts. And then the sodium salts reacted with monosalicylaldiminato titanium complex 2{[3,5-di-Bu t -2-(O)C6H2CHN(PH)]TiCl 3(THF)} in dried dichloromethane to give a new benzdine-bridged binuclear complex 3{[3,5-di-Bu t -2-(O)C6H 2CHN(PH)]2[OC(Me)C(H)(Me)C=N(p-C6H 4)-(C6H4-p)N=C(Me)C(H) C(Me)]Ti 2Cl4. The complex 3 was characterize by 1HNMR and elemental analysis. In the presence of MAO(methylaluminoxane), the complex 3 in toluene was effective to catalyze polymerization, affording moderately high catalytic activity 1.93×105 g PE /(mol•Ti•h)]and high molecular weight polyethylene [5.63×105 g/mol]. The high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) curve of polyethylene obtained revealed a single peak, but the molecular weight distribution (MWD=3.21) is obviously broader than that of the similar mononuclear titanium complex. The melting points of the obtained polyethylene reaches 138 °C, indicating that the polyethylene is of high crystallinity. © 2008 Wuhan University of Technology and Springer-Verlag GmbH.
