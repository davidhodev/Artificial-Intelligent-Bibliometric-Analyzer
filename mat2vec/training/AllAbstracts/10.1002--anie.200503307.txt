Direct evidence: An ESI mass spectrometer coupled online to a microreactor was used to intercept the catalytically active cationic intermediates of the Ziegler-Natta polymerization of ethene with the homogeneous catalyst system [Cp2ZrCl2]/MAO (see picture; MAO = methylaluminoxane, Cp = cyclopentadienyl, X = CH3, Cl). For the first time these intermediates were studied directly from the solution and their catalytic activity proved. (Figure Presented). Â© 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.
