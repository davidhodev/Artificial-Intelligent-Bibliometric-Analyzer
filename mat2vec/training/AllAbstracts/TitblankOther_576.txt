The discovery of metallocene methylaluminoxane (MAO) catalysts has opened a frontier in the area of organometallic chemistry, polymer synthesis and processing. A great number of different titanocenes and zirconocenes have been synthesized that give tailored polymers of totally different structures, let control polymer tacticity, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution more efficiently. New kinds of copolymers and elastomers can be synthesized. To use the catalysts in industrial processes supporting of the metallocenes is important. Copyright Â©7999 by Kodansha Ltd.
