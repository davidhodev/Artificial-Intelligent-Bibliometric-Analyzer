Syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS) was synthesized in the presence of a mono-titanocene complex of Î·5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyltri-4-methoxyph titanium [Cp* Ti (OC6H4OCH3)3] activated by methylaluminoxane (MAO). Influences of different polymerization mediums including heptane, toluene, chlorobenze and neat styrene on the activity, syndiotacticity and molecular weight of polystyrene were investigated. The bulk polymerization was the best choice in all cases for producing sPS with the highest activity and molecular weight. In contrast, much better activity and syndiotacticity of yields arose from polymerization in heptane than in the other solvents. Using a solvent with higher dipole moment, such as chlorobenze, lower activity and syndiotacticity were given resulting from the stronger coordination of solvent with Ti (III) active species which controlled syndiospecific polymerization of styrene. Aggregated structures of sPS obtained respectively from bulk polymerization and polymerization in heptane used as solvent were different.
