The C(s)- and C(2v)-symmetric doubly dimethylsilylene-bridged zirconocene complexes (Me2Si)2{η5-C5H2-4-CHMe2{η5C5H-3,5-(SiMe3)2}ZrCl2, 6a, and (Me2Si)2{η5C5H-3,5-(CHMe2)2)2ZrCl2, 6b, have been synthesized by reaction of corresponding dilithio ligand salts with ZrCl4 in CH2Cl2. When activated with methyl aluminoxane, C(s)-symmetric zirconocene 6a catalyzes the polymerization of propylene (liquid propylene, 0°C) to yield a syndiotactic polymer of Mw = 1,000,000 and rrrr% = 75.4. By contrast, C(2v)-symmetric zirconocene 6b displays a low activity and affords an atactic polymer.
