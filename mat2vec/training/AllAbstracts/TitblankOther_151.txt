The reduction of amide promoted by "in situ" formed ruthenium phosphine complex was carried out using polymethylhydrosiloxane as reductive reagent. The effects of structure of the amide, solvent and ligand on the catalytic efficiency and the products have been evaluated. The amide with secondary or primary amine group produces to the corresponding tertiary amine and secondary amine. The reaction of acrylamide with polymethylhydrosiloxane is complicated to produce acrylonitrile, propionitrile and polymer with the siloxane-based linked Polyacrylamide and polyacrylonitrile.
