A new β-ketoimine ligand was prepared through traditional condensation of 2-acetylcyclohexanone with 1-naphthylamine. Consequently, the new moisture- and air-stable bis(β-ketoamino)nickel(II) complex Ni[2-CH3C(O)C6H8(=NAr)]2 (Ar = naphthyl) was synthesized and characterized. The solidstate structures of the ligand and complex have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Additionally, the new complex is a highly active catalyst precursor for polymerization of norbornene in combination with methylaluminoxane. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
