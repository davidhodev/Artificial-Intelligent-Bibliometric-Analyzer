KGaA.A series of vanadyl di(5-t-butyl-2-(aryliminomethyl)quinolin-8-olate) complexes is prepared by the reaction of 5-t-butyl-2-(aryliminomethyl)quinolin-8-ol derivatives with a slight excess of VO(OPr)3 in toluene. All the vanadyl complexes are fully characterized by elemental analysis and FTIR spectroscopy; moreover, the molecular structures of representative complexes C2 and C3 are further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. On activation with diethylaluminum chloride (Et2AlCl) in either the presence or absence of ethyl trichloroacetate (ETA), all the vanadyl complexes exhibit high activities toward ethylene polymerization (up to 1.81 × 107 g mol-1 V h-1), producing polyethylenes with ultrahigh molecular weights (up to 1.51 × 106 g mol-1) and narrow polydispersities. The copolymerizations of ethylene with either norbornene or 1-hexene are also successfully carried out with high activities. (Chemical Equation Presented).
