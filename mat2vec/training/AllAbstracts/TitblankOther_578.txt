The PE-b-sPS block copolymers were synthesized with η5-cyclopentadiencyltrifurfuryloxyltitanium/MAO and η5-cyclopentadiencyltribenzyloxyltitanium/MAO catalyst systems respectively. The effect of [TMA] and ethene prepolymerization time on catalytic efficiency were investigated. The results showed that total catalytic efficiency came down with the increasing of ethene prepolymerization time and the [TMA] had a optimum value for different catalyst system. The PE-b-sPS block copolymers were obtained by butanone extraction fractionation. The PE-b-sPS block copolymers accounted for 40wt%-60wt% of the total copolymerization products and the weight content of styrene segment in the block copolymer is up to 80%- 85%. The block copolymers were characterized by DSC, WAXD, FTIR and 13C-NMR methods.
