Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society. Resting/dormant benzyl- and allyl-type Ti(IV) complexes formed under α-olefin polymerization conditions have been detected and characterized by NMR. Experimental and computational evidence supports a formation mechanism via reversible Ti-C bond homolysis rather than "classical" σ-bond metathesis.
