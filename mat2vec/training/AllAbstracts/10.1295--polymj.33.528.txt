The reactions of methyl methacrylate (MMA) or I2 with the living zirconium-polyolefin bond (Zr-PO) using zirconocene catalyst system were examined. Although the reaction of MMA with the living Zr-PP does not proceed, I2 readily reacts with the living Zr-PO, such as atactic polypropylene (ataPP), iso poly(1-hexene) and syndiotactic poly(propylene) (synPP), quantitatively to give the terminal iodized polyolefins (PO-I). Moreover, PO-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) block copolymers could be obtained by the reaction of MMA with living Sm-PO, which was formerly prepared by the transformation of PO-I by Cp2*Sm.
