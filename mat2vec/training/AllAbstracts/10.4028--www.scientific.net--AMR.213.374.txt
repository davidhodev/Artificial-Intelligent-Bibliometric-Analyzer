The thioether bridged Zirconocene complex [(C5H 5)Cl2ZrC5H4CH2CH 2]2S has been synthesized by treating the dilithium salts of the thioether bridged cyclopentadienyl ligand with two equivalents of C 5H5ZrCl3(DME) and characterized by 1HMNR and elemental analysis. Homogenous ethylene polymerization by this complex has been conducted systematically in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO). The influence of the molar ratio [MAO]/[Cat], the catalyst concentration, time and temperature have been studied in detail. The catalytic activity of 1 is 6.46×105 g PE/mol·Cat·h. Higher temperature is favorable for increasing the catalytic activity for 1. A high concentration of the catalysts drops the catalytic activity as well as the molecular weight of polyethylene for the complex. High temperature gel permeation chromatography (HT-GPC) proves the production of polyethylene with a broad molecular weight distribution (MWD). © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.
