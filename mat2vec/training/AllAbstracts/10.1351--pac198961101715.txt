Cp-bonded alkyl substituents may change the structural and chemical features of group 4 bent metallocene complexes considerably. Increased solubility appears to make in situ generated (MeCp)<inf>2</inf>Zr(H)Cl an improved hydrozirconation reagent. The use of methylcyclopentadienyl ring systems allows the detection of the dynamic behaviour of the doubly acetylide bridged [(MeCp)<inf>2</inf>Zr-C-C-Ph]-dimer. Steric interaction between bulky Cp-bonded tert-alkyl groups and the substituents at the internal carbon atoms of a conjugated diene ligand causes hindered (RCp)-metal rotation in many (diene)zirconocene and -hafnocene complexes (ΔG+ r o t≈ 10 kcal/mol). Due to the preferred chiral Cp-rotameric conformation of the (Me<inf>3</inf>C-Cp)<inf>2</inf>M bent metallocene systems this dynamic feature can readily be detected in solution by NMR spectroscopy. The (Cp-CHMePh)<inf>2</inf>ZrCl<inf>2</inf>/alumoxane-system catalyzes the stereospecific polymerization of propene. Catalysts derived from rac-[(1-phenylethyl)cyclopentadienyl]-zirconocene dichloride produce isotactic polypropylene via enantiomorphic-site and chain end control. © 1989 IUPAC
