Reaction between 2-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)benzenamine and 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde or 3,5-di-ferf-butyl-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde afforded 2-(4,5-dihydropyrrolo[1,2-a] quinoxalin-4-yl)phenol (HOL1NH, 1a) or 2,4-di-teft-butyl-6-(4,5- dihydropyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxalin-4-yl)phenol (HOL2NH, 1b). Both 1a and 1 b can be converted to 2-(H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxalin-4-yl)phenol (HOL 3N, 2a) and 2,4-di-tert-butyl-6-(H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxalin-4-yl) phenol (HOL4N, 2b), respectively, by heating 1a and 1b in toluene. Treatment of 1b with an equivalent of AlEt3 afforded [Al(Et 2)(OL2NH)] (3). Reaction of 1 b with two equivalents of AlR3 (R = Me, Et) gave dinuclear aluminum complexes [(AlR 2J2(OL2N)] (R = Me, 4a; R = Et, 4b). Refluxing the toluene solution of 4a and 4b, respectively, generated [Al(R 2)(OL4N)] (R = Me, 5a; R = Et, 5b). Complexes 5a and 5b were also obtained either by refluxing a mixture of 1b and two equivalents of AlR3 (R = Me, Et) in toluene or by treatment of 2b with an equivalent of AlR3 (R = Me, Et). Reaction of 2a with an equivalent of AlMe 3 afforded [Al(Me3)(OL3N)] (5c). Treatment of 1b with an equivalent of ZnEt2 at room temperature gave [Zn(Et)(OL2NH)] (6), while reaction of 1 b with 0.5 equivalent of ZnEt2 at 40 °C afforded [Zn(OL2NH)2] (7). Reaction of 1 b with two equivalents of ZnEt2 from room temperature to 60 °C yielded [Zn(Et)(OL4N)] (8). Compound S was also obtained either by reaction between 6 and an equivalent of ZnEt2 from room temperature to 60 °C or by treatment of 2b with an equivalent of ZnEt 2 at room temperature. Reaction of 2b with 0.5 equivalent of ZnEt2 at room temperature gave [Zn(OL4N)2] (9), which was also formed by heating the toluene solution of 6. All novel compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and elemental analyses. The structures of complexes 3,5c and 6 were additionally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. The catalysis of complexes 3, 4a, 5a-c, 6 and 8 toward the ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone was evaluated. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
