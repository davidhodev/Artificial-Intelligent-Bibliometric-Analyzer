A DFT study of ethylene polymerization by zirconocene catalysts was carried out. Stationary points corresponding to intermediates and transition states were located on the potential energy surface of the [Cp 2 ZrC 2 H 5 ] + + C 2 H 4 model system. Three possible reaction mechanisms involving the formation of Î²-agostic complexes were considered. The energy and thermodynamic characteristics for different reaction pathways were calculated. Corresponding activation energies lie in the range 3.9-6.8 kcal mol -1 .
