Organotin polymers generally offer moderate to good inhibition of a variety of cancer cell lines. Here we focus on efforts associated with breast and pancreatic cancers. With respect to breast cancer, for organotin polyethers there is a marked differentiation in the ability to inhibit the MCF-7 estrogen-sensitive cell line in comparison to the MDA non-estrogen cell line where those polyethers that contain the Sn-O-phenyl linkage preferentially inhibit the MDA cell lines in comparison to the MCF-7 cells while those polyethers that do not contain this linkage show little differentiation between the two cell lines. With respect to pancreatic cancer, there are a number of organotin polymers that exhibit good inhibition of the pancreatic cancer cell lines. Some structure/property relationships are emerging.
