Two binuclear oxo-bridged half-titanocene complexes, -oxo-bis[(1-aryl-2,3, 4,5-tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)dichlorotitanium] [(ArMe4CpTiCl 2)2O, Ar = 4-iPrC6H4 (3), 4-tBuC6H4 (4)], have been prepared by the treatment of 1-aryl-2,3,4,5-tetramethylcyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride [ArMe4CpTiCl3, Ar = 4-iPrC6H 4 (1), 4-tBuC6H4 (2)] with 0.5 equiv of H 2O. Complexes 3 and 4 have been characterized by elemental analysis and 1H- and 13C-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance; NMR) spectroscopies, and their molecular structures have been determined by X-ray crystallography. When activated with iBu3Al and Ph 3CB(C6F5)4, complexes 3 and 4 both exhibit reasonable catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization (90×103 to 280×103 kg PE (mol Ti)-1 bar-1 h-1), producing polyethylenes with moderate molecular weight. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.
