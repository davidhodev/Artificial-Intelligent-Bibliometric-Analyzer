A DFT study of the bi- and trinuclear heterocomplexes of Ti, Al and Mg revealed a higher reactivity of Mg-containing compounds toward ethylene, as compared to Mg-free systems; this explains a significant activation effect of Mg-containing compounds on thecatalytic activity of the Ti complexes in ethylene polymerization.
