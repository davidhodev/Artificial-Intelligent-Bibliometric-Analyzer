A novel method for the preparation of heterogeneous metallocene catalysts is described that can be applied for the polymerization of olefins starting with homogeneous metallocene complexes. For this purpose zirconocene dichloride complexes have been prepared containing alkenyl or alkynyl substituents. These complexes can be activated with methyl alumoxane (MAO) and then are incorporated as comonomers into the formed polyolefin chain. The homogeneous metallocene catalysts become self-immobilizing under the reaction conditions and the further formation of the polyolefin is then catalyzed heterogeneously.
