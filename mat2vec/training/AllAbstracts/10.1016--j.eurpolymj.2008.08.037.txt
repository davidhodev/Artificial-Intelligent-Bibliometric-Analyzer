A systematic analysis was performed on a series of 1-n-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroaluminates (where alkyl = ethyl, butyl, hexyl, and octyl), applied as a medium of the Cp2TiCl2 titanocene catalyst, to evaluate the influence of the physical properties of the ionic liquids on the polymerisation reaction carried out in the biphasic ionic liquid/hexane mode. Two alkylaluminium compounds, AlEtCl2 and AlEt2Cl, were used as activators. The influence of the activator/catalyst molar ratio on the performance of the ethylene polymerisation was determined for each ionic liquid studied. The best results were obtained using 1-n-octyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroaluminate. For the titanocene catalyst immobilised in the ionic liquid, AlEtCl2 turned out to be a better activator than AlEt2Cl in our studies. The properties of the polyethylene product have also been presented. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
