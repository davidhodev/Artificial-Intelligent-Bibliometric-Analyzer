The scandium half-sandwich (bis)alkyl complex [Sc(η5-C 5Me4{SiMe2(C6F5)}) (CH2SiMe3)2(THF)] has been prepared by σ-bond metathesis between [Sc(CH2SiMe3) 3(THF)2] and C5Me4H{SiMe 2(C6F5)}. Structural characterization by single crystal X-ray diffraction revealed the typical piano-stool geometry for this type of complex. The addition of [Ph3C][B(C6F 5)] resulted in the formation of a half-sandwich alkyl cation which is an efficient catalyst for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene in the presence of aluminium alkyls. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
