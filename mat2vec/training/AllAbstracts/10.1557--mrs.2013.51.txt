Recent advances in polymerization of allyl and diallyl monomers catalyzed by homogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts are reviewed. Zirconocene catalysts are effective for copolymerization of ethylene or propylene with Al-masked allyl monomers, as well as homopolymerization of allylsilanes. Phosphine-sulfonate Pd complexes promote the copolymerization of ethylene with various polar allyl monomers, in the absence of a masking agent. Late transition metal catalysts promote stereoselective cyclopolymerization of diallyl monomers having various polar functional groups. The cyclopolymerization of alkyl-substituted diallyl monomers by Pd diimine complexes affords the polymer having alternating oligomethylene and trans-1,2-cyclopentene groups.
