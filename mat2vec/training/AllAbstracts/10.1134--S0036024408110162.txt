Density functional theory was used to study model ethylene reactions with CpTiIIIEt+A- (A- = CH 3B(C6F5)3- , or B(C 6F5)4- ; A- can be absent) compounds. The polymerization of ethylene on an isolated CpTiEt + cation is hindered because of equilibrium between the CpTi(C 2H4)Et+ primary complex and the primary product of CpTiBu+ insertion. At the same time, the polymerization of ethylene on CpTiEt+A- ion pairs (A- = CH 3B(C6F5)3- or B(C 6F5)4- ) is thermodynamically allowed (ΔE from -26.2 to -25.6 kcal/mol and ΔG298 from -10.9 to -10.4 kcal/mol) and is not related to overcoming substantial energy barriers (ΔE# = 8.2-12.3 kcal/mol and ΔG 298≠ ) = 7.8-13.3 kcal/mol). The degree of polymerization can be low because of the effective occurrence of polymer chain termination by hydrogen transfer from the polymer chain to the monomer. © 2008 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.
