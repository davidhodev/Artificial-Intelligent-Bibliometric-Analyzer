A variety of new silylene-bridged fluorenyl-containing ligands has been synthesized with good yields via a convenient synthetic route. Two dimethylsilylene-bridged (η5-indenyl)(η5-fluorenyl)(1) and (η5-cyclopentadienyl)(η5-fluorenyl) (2) zirconocene dichlorides with C1 and Cs molecular symmetry have also been prepared. Upon activation with methyl aluminoxane, the former produced a polypropylene of high molecular weight, but with low activity and isotacticity. The latter catalyzed non-stereospecific propylene polymerization without any syndiotactic tendency, but with 40 and 20 times greater ethylene and propylene activity respectively than the former catalytic system. © 1995.
