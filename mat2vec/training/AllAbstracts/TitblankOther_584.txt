Atactic polypropene was synthsised with homogeneous catalytic systems of varios titanium compounds activated by methylaluminoxane(MAO). The titanium ligands affect both catalytic activity and stereoregularity of polypropene obtained. For novel η5cyclopentadienyltri-n-propyloxy titanium [CpTi (O-n-Pr)3 ]/MAO catalytic system, the influencing factors of polymerization temperature, Al/Ti molar ratio and propene pressure on propene polymerization have been studied. The catalytic activity at polymerization temperature 40°C and Al/Ti molar ratio 200 was 220kgPP/molTi·h. The kinetics of early state propene polymerization with CpTi(O-n-Pr)3/MAO has been investigated. The polymer yield increases almost linearly with increasing the titanium or monomer concentration. The apparent rate of polymerization (Rp) versus titanium and monomer concentration appears the first order reaction rule, and the apparent rate constant (Kp) is 2.92 × 105mol · L-1 · h-1 at 40°C . The calculated polymerization activation energy (ΔE) is 7.88 × 10 3 · mol-1, while the impact fractor(A) is 1.41 × 104mol·L-1·h-1. After boiling heptane extraction of the polypropene for 8h. The soluble fraction with more than 95% by weight was isolated and characterized as atactic polypropene by 13 C-NMR, WAXD and FTIR. The molecular weight (Mw) and its distribution ( Mw/Mn) determined by GPC were 8.0∼ 10.0 × 104 and 2.0 respectively.
