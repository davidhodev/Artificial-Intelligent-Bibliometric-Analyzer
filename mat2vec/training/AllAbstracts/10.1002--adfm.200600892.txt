Recent increases in the demand for mobile devices have stimulated the development of nonvolatile memory devices with high performance. In this Communication, we describe the fabrication of low-cost, high-performance, digital nonvolatile memory devices based on semiconducting polymers, poly(o-anthranilic acid) and poly(o-anthranilic acid-co-aniline). These memory devices have ground-breaking and novel current-voltage switching characteristics. The devices are switchable in a very low voltage range (which is much less than those of all other devices reported so far) with a very high ON/OFF current ratio (which is on the order of 105). The low critical voltages have the advantage for nonvolatile memory device applications of low operation voltages and hence low power consumption. With this very low power consumption, the devices demonstrate in air ambient to have very stable ON- and OFF-states without any degradation for a very long time (which has been confirmed up to one year so far) and to be repeatedly written, read and erased. Our study proposes that the ON/OFF switching of the devices is mainly governed by a filament mechanism. The high ON/OFF switching ratio and stability of these devices, as well as their repeatable writing, reading and erasing capability with low power consumption, opens up the possibility of the mass production of high performance digital nonvolatile polymer memory devices with low cost. Further, these devices promise to revolutionize microelectronics by providing extremely inexpensive, lightweight, and versatile components that can be printed onto plastics, glasses or metal foils.
