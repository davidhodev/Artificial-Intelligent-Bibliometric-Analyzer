Block copolymers containing polysilane blocks are unique in that the polysilane components possess electro-active properties and are readily photodegradable. This review will discuss and assess the two major approaches to the synthesis of polysilane block copolymers via pre-formed polymer chain coupling and living polymerisation techniques. The self-organisation of polysilane block copolymers and the morphologies adopted in thin fi lms are reviewed. Amphiphilic polysilane-containing block copolymers self-assemble in solvents selective for one block and a number of examples are highlighted. The versatility of these materials is highlighted by recent signifi cant applications including the preparation of hollow crosslinked micellar aggregates in aqueous solutions and in patterned thin fi lm generation subsequently employed as templates for the growth of cell cultures and CaCO3.
