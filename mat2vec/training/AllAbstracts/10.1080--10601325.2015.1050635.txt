Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC 2015.Statistical copolymers of 2-methyl-2-oxazoline, MeOx, and 2-phenyl-2-oxazoline, PhOx, were prepared by cationic ring opening polymerization using bis(η5-cyclopentadienyl)dimethyl zirconium, Cp2ZrMe2, in combination with tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate dimethylanilinum salt, [B(C6F5)4]-[Me2NHPh]+, as the initiation system. The reactivity ratios were estimated using the Finemann-Ross and the Kelen-Tüdos graphical methods. Structural parameters of the copolymers were obtained by calculating the dyad sequence fractions, which were derived using the monomer reactivity ratios. The kinetics of the thermal decomposition of the copolymers was studied by thermogravimetric analysis, TGA, in the frame of the Ozawa-Flynn-Wall and Kissinger methods. The self-assembly behavior was also studied in aqueous solutions by dynamic light scattering measurements.
