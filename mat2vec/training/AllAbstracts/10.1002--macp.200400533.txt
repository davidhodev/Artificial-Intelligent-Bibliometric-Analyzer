Sixteen C1-symmetric zirconocene and one hafnocene complexes bearing the 2,5-R2-7H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:4,3-b′]dithiophene ligand (R = H, Me, Et, Ph) linked to a substituted indenyl ligand have been synthesized and tested in propylene polymerization. Most of the C 1-symmetric zirconocenes of this type are highly active in propylene polymerization at low MAO/Zr ratios and produce poly(propylene)s (PP) in a broad range of isotacticity and melting points. The molecular weight and crystallinity of the PPs are strongly dependent upon the type of substituents on the indenyl moiety: PPs with Tm between 75 and 156°C and viscosity average molecular weights between 100 000 and 400 000 have been obtained at 50-70°C in liquid propylene. © 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
