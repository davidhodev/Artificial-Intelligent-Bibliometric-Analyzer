This paper reports the convenient "one-pot" synthesis of a bifunctional - Me 4 Cp ̂ phenolate - ligand and the efficient "one-step" synthesis of the corresponding Ti IV and Zr IV complexes. The reaction of 2-bromo-4-methylphenol with 2 equiv of n BuLi followed by addition of 2,3,4,5-tetramethyl-2-cyclopentenone produces the bifunctional mono-Cp phenol ligand precursor 2-(tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)-4-methylphenol ((TCP)H 2 , 1). Reaction of 1 with Ti(CH 2 -Ph) 4 at 60°C in toluene cleanly generates (TCP)Ti(CH 2 Ph) 2 (2), while the corresponding reaction with Zr(CH 2 Ph) 4 at higher temperatures affords the chelated C 2 -symmetric zirconocene (TCP) 2 Zr (3). In solution at room temperature, the two benzyl groups of 2 are magnetically equivalent, however, in the solid state, X-ray diffraction reveals that one benzyl group is coordinated in a normal η 1 -fashion and the other in an η 2 -mode. The small Cp-(centroid)-Ti-O angle of 107.7(2)° in 2 indicates sterically open features in common with amido-based "constrained geometry" polymerization catalysts. Low-temperature NMR-scale reactions of 2 with B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 and Ph 3 C + B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 - indicate the formation of the corresponding cationic complexes (TCP)TiCH 2 Ph + PhCH 2 B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 - (4) and (TCP)TiCH 2 Ph + B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 - (5). Upon activation with Ph 3 C + B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 - , complex 2 is highly active for ethylene, propylene, and styrene polymerization.
