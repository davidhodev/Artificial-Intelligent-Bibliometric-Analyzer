(Figure Presented) Unbridged yet isospecific metallocene polypropylene catalytic systems can be generated in situ during the MAO-assisted activation step (see picture; MAO = methyl aluminum oxane), as demonstrated with a dimethylaminophenyl-substituted zirconocene that has a racemic, C 2-symmetric structure in the solid state and produces highly isotactic polypropylene.
