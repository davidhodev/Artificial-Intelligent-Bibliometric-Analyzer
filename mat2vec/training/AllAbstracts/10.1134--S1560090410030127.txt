The photoinduced postpolymerization of styrene and methyl methacrylate in the presence of metallocenes is studied. It is shown that, after short-term UV irradiation, the polymerization of vinyl mono- mers mediated by metallocenes continues in the dark regime until the formation of polymer glasses. The pro- cess proceeds as a terminationless complex-radical polymerization. Â© Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2010.
