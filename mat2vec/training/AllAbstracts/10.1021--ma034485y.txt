Highly syndiotactic propene polymerization in the presence of Cs-symmetric metallocene cations is much less obvious that it may appear based on asymmetry considerations alone. Effectively preventing the generation of m stereodefects requires the assistance of a counterion able to slow site epimerization more than monomer insertion, but also seconding chain-migratory insertion.
