KGaA, Weinheim.The reactivity towards AlMe3 of discrete cationic ansa-zirconocenes 2a,b that are ubiquitously used in isoselective propylene polymerization and based on [{Ph(H)C(3,6-tBu2-Flu)(3-tBu-5-Et-Cp)}ZrMe2)] {Cp-Flu} and rac-[{Me2Si-(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2}ZrMe2] {SBI} was scrutinized. The first example of a structurally characterized Group4 metallocene AlMe3 adduct (3b) is reported. In the presence of excess AlMe3, the {SBI}-based AlMe3 adduct 3b undergoes a slow decomposition via C-H activation in a bridging methyl unit to yield a new species (4b) with a trimetallic {Zr(μ-CH2)(μ-Me)AlMe(μ-Me)AlMe2} core. EXSY NMR data for the process 2b3b→4b suggest very rapid and reversible binding of an additional AlMe3 molecule onto AlMe3 adduct 3b. The resulting heterotrimetallic species intermediates exchange of methyl groups between different metal centers and slowly undergoes the C-H activation reaction towards 4b. Zirconocene-based AlMe3 adducts bind an additional AlMe3 molecule reversibly, affording heterotrimetallic intermediates. One of the AlMe3 adducts undergoes slow decomposition via C-H activation in a bridging methyl unit to yield a new species with a trimetallic {Zr(μ-CH2)(μ-Me)AlMe(μ-Me)AlMe2} core.
