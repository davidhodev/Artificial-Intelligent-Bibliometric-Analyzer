The polymer synthesized from reaction of titanocene dichloride and 2-nitro-p- phenylenediamine was doped by exposure to iodine vapor. Electrical conductivity increased from about 101 to 105 fold depending on the doping time resulting in the materials conductivity increasing from being a semiconductor to becoming a near conductor. The process is cyclic. This is the initial report of such doping increasing the conductivity of a condensation polymer. Â© MD Publications Pvt. Ltd.
