Radical ring-opening polymerization (rROP) combines the advantages of both ring-opening polymerization and radical polymerization, that is the preparation of polymers bearing heteroatoms in the backbone but with the ease and robustness of a radical process. This current review presents a comprehensive description of rROP by detailing: (i) the various monomers that polymerize through rROP; (ii) the main parameters that govern the rROP mechanism; (iii) the copolymerization by conventional or controlled/living radical polymerization between rROP monomers and traditional vinyl monomers to obtain copolymers with advanced properties; (iv) the different applications (low shrinkage materials and preparation of (bio)degradable materials) of rROP monomer-containing materials, and (v) the main alternatives to rROP to induce degradability to materials obtained by a radical polymerization.
