Â© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.In this research work, a zirconocene/MAO complex was used as a catalyst for the copolymerization of 1-hexene and ethylene in the presence of nano titania doped with 1 % of manganese (TiO2/Mn), which was used as a drop in filler. It was investigated from the 13C NMR analysis that 1-hexene incorporation increases with the addition of nano filler. The degree of crystallinity (DOC), catalytic activity and molecular weight of the nanocomposites were studied by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), yield analysis and gel permeation chromatography (GPC), respectively. It was found that DOC, catalytic activity, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution were strongly influenced by the addition of nano filler due to the increase of 1-hexene incorporation. As a result, an increase in catalytic activity and a decrease in DOC were observed due to the addition of nano filler. The non-isothermal crystallization kinetics of the produced copolymer was studied using a model proposed by Ozawa and Mo et al. It was observed that the crystal growth rate is slowed by the nano filler. The activation energy (EA) was determined by the Kissinger method, and it was found that EA is increased incrementally with the loadings of the nano filler, confirming a slower crystallization process.
