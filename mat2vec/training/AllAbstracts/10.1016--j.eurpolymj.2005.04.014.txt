The electrochemical synthesis and characterisation of poly(methyl vinylsilane) and a series of poly(methyl vinylsilane-co-metallocenes) network polymers are described in detail. This class of polymers are not accessible through Wurtz coupling reaction and are however prepared by electro-reduction of dichloro methyl vinylsilane in a non-aqueous system using aluminum electrodes in a single compartment cell. These polymers have been characterised using UV, FTIR, XRD, SEM and NMR spectral techniques. Cyclic voltammetric studies of the above polymers reveal their conducting behavior. These polymers show optical properties as explained from the results. Polymers of this type are proposed as potential soluble precursors for SiC and metal doped SiC materials. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
