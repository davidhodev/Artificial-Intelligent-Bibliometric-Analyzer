Organic-inorganic hybrid (SAV) supported zirconocene was synthesized and its catalysis on ethylene polymerization was examined. The SAV was synthesized by copolymerization of 4-vinylpyridine with vinyl silica monomer (SA), which was modified by reacting silica with allyltrimethoxysilane (APS). After treated by MAO, the SAV was reacted with Cp2ZrCl2 to form organic-inorganic hybrid supported metallocene. The chemical structure and the composition of SA and SAV have been characterized by solid-state 13 C-NMR, XPS, and elemental analysis (EA). The SAV supported zirconocene catalyst was effective in ethylene polymerization at a relatively low MAO level (Al/Zr = 600) giving higher activity than that supported by SiO2.
