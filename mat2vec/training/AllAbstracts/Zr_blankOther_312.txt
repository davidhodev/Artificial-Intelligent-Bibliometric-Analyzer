Several supported zirconocene catalysts were prepared by using MgCl2 · 6H2O as a precursor for producing an active support. Such catalysts combined with methylaluminoxane (MAO) obtained by reacting MgCl2 · 6H2O with AlMe3 show good activity for ethylene polymerization similar to that of anhydrous MgCl2 supported zirconocene catalyst. ©1999 Springer-Verlag.
