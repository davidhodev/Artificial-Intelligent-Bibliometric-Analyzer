The metallocene alkyne complexes [Cp2M(L)(η2-Me3SiC2R)] react with diisobutylaluminium hydride at room temp. by addition of HAl(iBu)2 to yield the heterobimetallic complexes [{Cp2M}(μ-η1:η2-RC C SiMe3)(μ-H){Al(iBu)2}] [{Cp2M}: (η5C5H5)2Ti, R = Ph 1, R = SiMe3 2; {Cp2M}: (η5-C5H5)2Zr, R = SiMe3 3; {Cp2M}: (ebthi)Zr, R = SiMe3 4] {ebthi: rac-[1,2ethylene-1,1′-bis(η5-tetrahydroindenyl)]}. Complexes 1-4 were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and 1, 2 and 4 investigated by X-ray crystal structure analysis. Compounds 1-4 were tested as initiators in the ring-opening polymerization of lactones. The results are discussed in comparison to the corresponding monometallic titanocene and zirconocene alkyne complexes.
