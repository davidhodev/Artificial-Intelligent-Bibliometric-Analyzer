The intermediates of olefin polymerization over homogeneous catalysts based on bis[N-(3-tert-butylsalicylidene)anilinato]zirconium(IV) dichloride {(L tBu)2ZrCl2} (1-tBu), bis[N-(3-methylsalicylidene)-anilinato]zirconium(IV) dichloride {(L Me)2ZrCl2} (1-Me), and bis[N-(salicylidene) anilinato]zirconium(IV) dichloride {(LH)2ZrCl2} (1-H) with different activators {methylaluminoxane (MAO) and AlMe 3/[CPh3]+-[B(C6F5) 4]-) have been studied by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Heterobinuclear ion pairs [(LtBu) 2Zr-(μ-Me)2AlMe2]+[Me-MAO] - (2-tBu) and [(LtBu)2Zr(μ-Me) 2AlMe2]+[B(C6F5) 4]- (2′-tBu) are formed upon activation of l-tBu with MAO and AlMe3/[CPh3] +[B(C6F5)4]-, respectively. These species are the precursors of the highly active intermediates of polymerization. In contrast, the activation of 1-Me with MAO results mainly in the formation of the tight ion pair [(LMe) 2ZrMe+⋯-Me-MAO-]. This ion pair is the precursor to a poorly active intermediate of polymerization. In the catalytic systems 1-HZMAO and 1-H/AlMe3/[CPh3]+[B(C 6F5)4]-, the aluminum ion pairs [LHAl(μ-Me)(μ-Cl)AlMe2]+[Me-MAO] - and [LHAl(μ-Me)(μ-Cl)AlMe2] +[B(C6F5)4]-, which were inactive in ethylene polymerization, are predominantly formed. The isomeric composition of 2′-tBu is close to that of the initial complex 1-tBu. The main route of the 1-tBu/MAO catalyst deactivation is the ligand transfer to aluminum with the formation of the complex LtBuAlMe2. © 2007 American Chemical Society.
