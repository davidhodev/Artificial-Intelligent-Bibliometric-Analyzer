© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.A new Titanium (IV) complex, dichlorobis(salicylato)titanium(IV) [TiL2Cl2] (1) {LH = Salicylic acid} has been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR and UV-visible spectroscopy. As a post-metallocene complex it’s olefin polymerization activity has been investigated at room temperature in aqueous emulsion. In presence of tetraphenylborate as cocatalyst, it has been found to exhibit moderate to high activity in the range of 103 in homopolymerization and copolymerization of styrene and methyl methacrylate to produce syndiotactic rich, ultrahigh molecular weight polymers with low molecular weight distribution. The polymer latex produced has been analyzed by DLS, HRTEM and FESEM which revealed that the latex is highly stable and contains polymer particles having size around 50 nm. The microstructures, molecular weights and thermal properties of the polymers have also been determined by 1H-NMR, 13CNMR, GPC and DSC analysis. The polymers have also been characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, GPC and DSC analysis.
