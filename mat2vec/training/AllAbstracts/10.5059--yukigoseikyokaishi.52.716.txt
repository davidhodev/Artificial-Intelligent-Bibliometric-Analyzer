A series of group IV metallocene complexes such as titanocenes, zirconocenes and hafnocenes possessing ansa-chain are discussed as regio- and stereoselective catalysts for polymerization of propylene or styrene. Isotactic and syndiotactic polypropylenes are produced via primary cis-addition by the catalytic use of C2- and Cs-symmetric zirconocenes, respectively. Significantly, syndiotactic polystyrene is produced, in contrast, via secondary cis-addition even by using C1-symmetric titanocenes. The reaction mechanism of those polymerizations, the structure of catalytic species and the significant role of methylalumoxane (MAO) are also discussed.
