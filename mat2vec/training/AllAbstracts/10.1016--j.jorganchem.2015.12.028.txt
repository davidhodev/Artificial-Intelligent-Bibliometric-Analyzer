The structures of the complexes were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, and X-ray crystal analyses were performed for complexes 2a, 2b and 2d. The coordination mode of the fluorenyl group to the metal center was changed from η3 to η1 when a bulky group was introduced on the nitrogen or 2,3-position of the fluorenyl ring. Syndiotactic-specificity of the catalyst for the propylene polymerization was reduced when bulky group was introduced on the nitrogen. Least-square fitting analysis of the steric pentad distributions revealed that the stereodefect was mainly formed by the chain migration without monomer insertion, which is accelerated by the η1-coordination of the fluorenyl group.
