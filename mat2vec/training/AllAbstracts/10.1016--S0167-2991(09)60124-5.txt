The catalytic properties of (C5H5)2 TiCl and TiCl3 reacted short fibre asbestos chrysotile are presented. The chrysofile-titanocene fibre is highly selective for the hydrogenation of linear olefins and shows good hydrogenation rates for monoolefins over diolefins. Also, both the titanocene fibre and the chrysotile-TiClx fibre are moderately active for Ziegler-Natta type polymerization of ethylene, propylene and 1-butene. Â© 1984.
