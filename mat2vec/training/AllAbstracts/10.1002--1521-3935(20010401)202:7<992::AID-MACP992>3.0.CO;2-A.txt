Phenol-functionalized polyethylenes were prepared by copolymerization of ethylene with 4-allylanisole in the presence of metallocene/MAO catalysis, followed by demethylation. Anisole groups incorporated in polyethylene main chains were quantitatively converted to phenol functional groups by treating the copolymers with AlCl3. The copolymerization of ethylene with 4-allylanisole revealed that the bridged metallocene catalyst seemed to favor the incorporation of the polar comonomer compared to the hindered metallocene catalyst. Increase of the MAO concentration markedly enhanced the activity of the catalysts, but it diminished the incorporation of the polar comonomer. The end group analysis of the copolymers showed that chain transfer to aluminium occured more frequently than other chain transfer reactions.
