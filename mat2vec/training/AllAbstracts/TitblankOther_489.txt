Branched polyethylene with ethylene as single monomer was synthesized with homogeneous catalyst systems consisting of η5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyltrialkyloxy titanium[Cp*Ti(OR)3] and various modified methylaluminoxanes(mMAO).The effects of the ligands OR and TMA content in mMAO of Cp*Ti(OR)3/ mMAO catalyst system on ethylene polymerization have been studied in details. Polymerization conditions such as temperature, [Ti] concentration and molar ratio also have been discussed. Characterization by 13C NMR, FTIR and DSC indicates that the polymer is long chain (carbon atoms≥6) branched polyethylene. A possible mechanism of branched polyethylene with Cp*Ti(OBz)3/mMAO catalyst system is proposed.
