Benz[f]indenyl zirconium complexes have been successfully synthesized and characterized. Their catalytic activities were evaluated for the polymerization of ethylene. The complexes combined with MAO can be highly active single site catalysts, which display activities comparable with that of the Cp 2ZrCl2/MAO system and provide very high molecular weight polyethylenes. The melting point of the polymers indicates the formation of linear polyethylene. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
