The reaction of (η5-C5H5)2Zr{P(SiMe3)2}2 with Ni(CO)4 yields the heterodinuclear phosphido-bridged complex (η5-C5H5)2Zr{μ-P(SiMe3)2}2Ni(CO)2 (1). 1 was characterised spectroscopically and by X-ray structure determination. The central four-membered ZrP2Ni ring is slightly puckered (dihedral angle between planes ZrP2/NiP2 = 1.8°). The Zr-P bond lengths are equivalent (Zr-P1 2.655(1), Zr-P2 2.652(1) Å), as are the Ni-P bond lengths (Ni-P1 2.264(1), Ni-P2 2.266(1) Å). The long Zr ⋯ Ni distance of 3.038(1) Å indicates the absence of a metal-metal bond. The heterodinuclear phosphido- and arsenido-bridged complexes (η5-C5H5)2Zr{μ-E(SiMe3)2}2M(CO)n [E = P; M(CO)n = Ni(CO)2 (1) or Mo(CO)4 (2); and E = As, M(CO)n = Cr(CO)4 (3)] react rapidly with methylaluminoxane, yielding catalytically active complexes which rival the known cationic systems for the polymerization of ethylene.
