Reaction of (o, m, p) disodium(phenylenedimethylene)dicyclopentadienide C6H4(CH2C5H4Na) 2 with 2 equiv of (MeCp)TiCl3 yields the phenylenedimethylene bridged binuclear titanocenes complexes [(MeC 5H4)TiCl2](C5H4CH 2C6H4CH2C5H 4)[(MeC5H4)TiCl2] (3, 4, 5) in high yield, which were characterized by 1H NMR and elemental analysis. They were used successfully as efficient catalysts for ethylene polymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO). The catalytic activities of 4 and 5 are somewhat higher than that of 3 and the molecular weight distributions (MWD = 4.8-6.2) of the polymers generated from the bimetallic catalytic systems are obviously higher than that obtained by conventional Cp2TiCl 2.
