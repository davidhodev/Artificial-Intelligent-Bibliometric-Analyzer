An unbridged zirconocene complex bis(1,2-diphenylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride [(1,2-Ph2-C5H3)2ZrCl2] 1 has been synthesized and structurally characterized. When activated by MAO, 1 produces ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene with high melting transition temperature, as well as atactic oligopropylene with average molecular weight of âˆ¼1150 g mol-1.
