Reaction of indenyllithium with 1,1-dichlorosilacyclobutane gave a mixture of diastereomeric isomers of 1,1-bis(10ineenyl)-1-silacyclobutane (1), and the product was in turn converted into diastereomeric (1,3-propanediyl)silylene-bis(1-indenyl)dichlorozirconium complexes (2) in a 5:2 racemic:meso ratio. Complex 2 was activated with either methyl aluminoxane (MAO) or Ph3CB(C6F5)4 to perform ethylene and propylene polymerization over a very board range of temperature of polymerization (-55°C ≤ Tp ≤ 85°C). Variations of the polymerization activity (A) and molecular weight (MW) with Tp were investigated as well as the isotactic yield (IY) in the case of propylene polymerizations. Comparisons of those results with other closely related ansa-zirconocene precursors were also made. © 1995.
