A hybrid was synthesized by grafting polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) to multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The MWCNT/polymer composites produced using silsesquioxane grafted MWCNTs as a filler had a high electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness. Homogeneous dispersion of silsesquioxane grafted MWCNTs occurred throughout the polymer without any aggregation, while a pristine MWCNT aggregate that integrated several nanotube domains existed in the polymer matrix. A comparative study of the optical transmittance, electrical, and electromagnetic interference shielding properties of poly(l-lactide) (PLLA)/MWCNT composites based on pristine MWCNTs and silsesquioxane grafted MWCNTs was carried out. A high electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (15-16 dB) was obtained in the 36-50 GHz range at a relatively low filler loading (4 wt%) in the PLLA/silsesquioxane grafted MWCNT composite.
