Their performance in ethylene polymerization was extensively investigated to uncover the mechanism of cooperative catalysis among multiple Ti centers that are confined in a nanosized random coil of PNB chains. It was found that, under full activation, the activity of the PNB-supported catalysts was consistently higher than that of the unsupported molecular catalyst. At a lower polymerization temperature, the cooperation effect prevailed and the activity tended to improve as the number of Ti centers per chain was increased. At a higher temperature, a smaller number of Ti centers per chain led to better activity due to the active-site isolation effect. On the basis of a kinetic examination, the cooperation at a lower temperature was attributed to the enhancement of the propagation rate constant, where confined active centers as monomer trapping sites plausibly suppressed the entropic loss in the π complexation.
