(Figure Presented) Why don't you melt? The zirconocene-catalyzed polymerization of norbornene proceeds by σ-bond metathesis to give 2-exo,7′-syn linkages in the main chain and 2-exo,2′-exo-linked mononorbornyl branches. The resulting helical structure is very compact (see picture, view along helical axis), which hinders conformational changes and explains the insolubility of the polynorbornene and why it cannot be melted. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
