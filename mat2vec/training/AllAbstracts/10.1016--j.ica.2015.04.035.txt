Â© 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.Nine bis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride complexes of the type [C<inf>9</inf>H<inf>6</inf>-(CH<inf>2</inf>)<inf>n</inf>-O-Ar]<inf>2</inf>ZrCl<inf>2</inf> (n = 3-5; Ar = Ph, t-Bu-Ph) were synthesized, characterized, activated with methylalumoxane (MAO) and tested for ethylene polymerization. Structure-property-relationship studies showed that the activities of the catalysts depend on the length of the bridging chain between the indenyl and the phenoxy group as well as on the bulk at the phenoxy substituent. A t-Bu substituent at the ortho position of the phenoxy group (5a/MAO) gives a much higher catalyst activity (27,500 kg PE/mol cat h) than the isomer 8a/MAO with a t-Bu substituent at the para position of the phenoxy group (16,700 kg PE/mol cat h). Obviously substituents in the ortho position of the phenyl ring generate a bulkier catalyst cation and this can keep the MAO anion at a further distance to allow easier ethylene coordination and chain growth in the polymerization steps. The mono substituted bis(indenyl) complex (C<inf>9</inf>H<inf>7</inf>)[C<inf>9</inf>H<inf>6</inf>-(CH<inf>2</inf>)<inf>4</inf>-O-4-t-Bu]ZrCl<inf>2</inf> shows lower activity (11,700 kg PE/mol cat h) than 8a indicating that the electronic effect is dominating in this type of catalysts.
