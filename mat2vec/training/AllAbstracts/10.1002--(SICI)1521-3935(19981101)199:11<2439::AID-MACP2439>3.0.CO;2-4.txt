Propene polymerization was conducted with titanocene (Cp2TiMe2, Cp2TiMe2; Cp = η5-C5H5, Cp* = η5-C5Me5)/organoborane (B(C6F5)3, Ph3CB(C6F5)4) catalysts at -5O°C using toluene as a solvent. The polymer obtained with Cp2TiMe2/Ph3CB(C6F5) 4 is less isotactic than that obtained with Cp2TiMe2/B(C6F5)3. However, the isospecificity of the former catalyst is improved with respect to that of the latter one when a toluene/CH2Cl2 mixture is used as a solvent instead of toluene. As similar enhancement in isospecificity was observed when alkylaluminium is added to the polymerization system. On the other hand, only Ph3CB(C6F5)4 is an efficient cocatalyst for the propene polymerization with Cp2*TiMe2. The polymer obtained with Cp*2TiMe2/Ph3CB(C6F 5)4 as catalyst is atactic, even in the presence Of CH2Cl2 or alkylaluminium. Based on these results, the stereospecificity of achiral titanocenes is discussed.
