Conducting polymers are unique reactive materials whose composition (polymer-counterion-solvent) shifts (non-stoichiometry) under electrochemical control in liquid electrolytes. The involved events (electric pulses, conformational movements, ions and solvent composition change, or shift of the intra- and intermolecular forces) mimic similar events occurring during living functions in cells. A new unexplored world for basic academic research and for the development of new biomimicking devices is emerging. Combination of chemical reactions and conformational energy of the chains open a new paradigm: there are great expectations for the development of electrochemical actuators (artificial muscles, smart windows, smart membranes, smart drug delivery) intelligent devices able to sense their surroundings during work. Scientists and engineers able to develop new theoretical models to quantify conformational movements stimulated by the chemical reactions in dense and wet polymeric materials (artificial or biological) are required.
