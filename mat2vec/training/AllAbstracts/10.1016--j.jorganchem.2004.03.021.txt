Ansa-zirconocene dichloride complexes containing a 9-fluorenyl group at the 1-position of naphthalene and a 2-indenyl 12, 1-indenyl 13, or cyclopentadienyl 14 group at the 2-position of the naphthalene were synthesised and characterised. The molecular structures of the complexes have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. After activation with excess methylalumoxane (MAO), the complexes were used as homogeneous catalysts for the homopolymerisation of ethylene and propylene. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
