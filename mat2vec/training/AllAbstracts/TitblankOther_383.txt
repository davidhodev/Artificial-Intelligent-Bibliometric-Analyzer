Transformations that take place in the rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl 2-based catalytic system of olefin polymerization were studied by electronic absorption spectroscopy. Polymethylaluminoxane (MAO) and its modified analog containing 10% of isobutyl groups (MMAO) were used as aluminum-containing components. The evolution of absorption spectra in toluene both with time and upon the fractional addition of new portions of MMAO or MAO to rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 was examined. It was presumed that the bathochromic shifts of the longwave absorption band in the electronic spectra are related to the formation of zirconocene adducts with three-coordinated AI atoms and/or two-coordinated O atoms of polymethylaluminoxane. Calculations performed within the framework of the density-functional theory revealed the specifics of formation of rac-Et(Ind)2ZrMe2 adducts in comparison with the adducts derived from Cp2ZrMe2.
