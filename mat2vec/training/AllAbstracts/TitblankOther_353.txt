In the last half decade, living coordination-insertion polymerization of olefins over Ziegler-Natta catalyst has emerged as a powerful tool for synthesis of advanced polymers with new structures. Materials prepared by this method ranged from simple homopolymers, such as linear, branched, isotactic or syndiotactic polypropylenes, to various kinds of block copolymers and end-functionalized polymers. A review covers the recent developments in this rapidly growing research area, covering the fields of organometallic chemistry, polymer chemistry and material science; and ligand and catalyst design, as well as the polymer properties prepared by such living polymerization.
