This review summarizes the present state of investigations concerning the synthesis of graft or comb-shaped macromolecules. The three main approaches "grafting onto", "grafting from" and "grafting through" are discussed extensively. Emphasis is given to controlled polymerization processes which enable preparation of well-defined species, i.e. to samples with a low dispersity in molecular weight, of satisfactory homogeneity in composition, and in which the molecular structure is defined unambiguously by the conditions of preparation. Ionic polymerization techniques revealed efficient for a number of systems. An increasing number of graft copolymers of well-defined structural characteristic are designed by controlled free radical polymerization techniques or by combination of two polymerization methods.
