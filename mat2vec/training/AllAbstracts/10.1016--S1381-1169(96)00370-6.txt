The isoselective propene polymerization using the homogeneous Me2Si(Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2/MAO catalyst system was investigated. The influence of the concentrations of metallocene and MAO activator on polymerization kinetics and microstructure of the resulting polymer was studied. Catalyst activity was found to be independent of zirconocene concentration and only a function of total MAO concentration. Polypropene microstructure was not affected by either MAO or zirconocene concentration. The polymerization behavior is compared to that of Me2Si(2-Me Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2/MAO. A model is presented to account for the equilibria present in the polymerization medium. This model takes into account the interactions between metallocene cation and excess MAO, thus explaining the influence of MAO concentration on catalyst activity in propene polymerization.
