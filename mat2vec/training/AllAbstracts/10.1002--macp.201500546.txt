Â© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.The observed development of one-component photoinitiators of cationic polymerization reactions in the last forty years is briefly described. Cationic photoinitiators can usually be activated by short wavelengths (<300 nm) and relatively hard conditions (high intensity). The search for cheaper and safer light sources has led to the use of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). In this review, a special emphasis is provided on the most recent and promising cationic initiators operating under near UV and visible LEDs. Ferrocenium salts exhibit the broadest visible light absorption and are probably, from this point of view, the most versatile near UV and visible light cationic initiators. Excellent photoinitiation performance has been found with the ferrocenium salts as one-component initiators, and the effect of ferrocenium salts based multi-component photoinitiating systems on the relevant photoinitiation performance has also been investigated. The progress made along the last forty years in the design of one-component photoinitiators of cationic polymerization reactions is briefly described. A special emphasis is provided on the most recent development of ferrocenium salts based photoinitiating systems operating under near UV and visible LEDs.
