Group 4 metal complexes [M(η5-C5Me4SiMe2-η1-N-2R)(NMe2)2] (R = pyridine, pyrazine, pyrimidine, thiazole, M = Ti; R = pyridine, thiazole; M = Zr) containing the tetramethylcyclopentadienyl-dialkylsilyl bridged amidinato as pendant ligand, were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, solution1H,13C and15N NMR spectroscopy and experimental13C and15N CPMAS in the solid state. The crystal structures of [Ti(η5-C5Me4SiMe2-η1-N-2R)(NMe2)2] (R = pyridine 2a, pyrazine 2b, pyrimidine 2c, thiazole 2d) were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. All compounds exhibit a distorted tetrahedral geometry, with the ansa-monocyclopentadienyl-amido ligands acting in a bidentate mode. The [M(η5-C5Me4SiMe2-η1-N-2R)(NMe2)2] (R = pyridine, thiazole; M = Zr, Ti) complexes are ethylene polymerization catalysts in the presence of MAO and they are active precursors in regioselective catalytic hydroamination operating with an anti-Markovnikov mechanism. © 2007 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
