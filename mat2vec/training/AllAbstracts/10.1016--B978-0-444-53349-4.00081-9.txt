This is a comprehensive overview of metallocene-mediated alkene (olefin) polymerization. The covered topics include the polymerization mechanism, catalyst activation, catalyst propagation, catalyst termination events, ethylene polymerization, α-olefin polymerization, metallocene-mediated stereoselectivity, the polymerization of conjugated and nonconjugated dienes, and copolymerizations of ethylene with α-olefins. An overview of historically significant metallocenes is presented as well as key polyolefin architectures made possible with metallocene-based catalysts. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
