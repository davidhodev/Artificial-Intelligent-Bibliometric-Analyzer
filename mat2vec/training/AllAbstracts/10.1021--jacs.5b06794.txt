Â© 2015 American Chemical Society.The articulation of the notion of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), which emerged from the discovery that H<inf>2</inf> can be reversibly activated by combinations of sterically encumbered Lewis acids and bases, has prompted a great deal of recent activity. Perhaps the most remarkable consequence has been the development of FLP catalysts for the hydrogenation of a range of organic substrates. In the past 9 years, the substrate scope has evolved from bulky polar species to include a wide range of unsaturated organic molecules. In addition, effective stereoselective metal-free hydrogenation catalysts have begun to emerge. The mechanism of this activation of H<inf>2</inf> has been explored, and the nature and range of Lewis acid/base combinations capable of effecting such activation have also expanded to include a variety of non-metal species. The reactivity of FLPs with a variety of other small molecules, including olefins, alkynes, and a range of element oxides, has also been developed. Although much of this latter chemistry has uncovered unique stoichiometric transformations, metal-free catalytic hydroamination, CO<inf>2</inf> reduction chemistry, and applications in polymerization have also been achieved. The concept is also beginning to find applications in bioinorganic and materials chemistry as well as heterogeneous catalysis. This Perspective highlights many of these developments and discusses the relationship between FLPs and established chemistry. Some of the directions and developments that are likely to emerge from FLP chemistry in the future are also presented.
