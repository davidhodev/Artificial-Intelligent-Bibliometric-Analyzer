© 2016 American Chemical Society.The highly Lewis acidic, cationic aluminum species [DIPP-nacnacAlMe]+[B(C6F5)4]¯ (1, DIPP-nacnac = [HC{C(Me)N(2,6-iPr2C6H3)}2]¯) has been shown to undergo reactions with a wide variety of small molecules, in both the presence and absence of an external weak phosphine base, PPh3. Cycloaddition reactions of unsaturated C-C bonds across the aluminum diketiminate framework are reported, and the first structural confirmation of this type of cycloaddition product is presented. Addition of PPh3 to 1 produces the cationic aluminum phosphine complex [DIPP-nacnacAl(Me)PPh3]+[B(C6F5)4]¯, which undergoes fluxional dissociation/coordination of the phosphine in solution. This weak Al-P interaction can be utilized in frustrated Lewis pair type reactions to activate alkenes, alkynes, CO2, propylene oxide, and the C-Cl bonds of CH2Cl2. The CO2 adduct [DIPP-nacnacAl(Me)OC(PPh3)O]+[B(C6F5)4]¯ undergoes further stoichiometric reduction with Et3SiH to produce an aluminum formate species.
