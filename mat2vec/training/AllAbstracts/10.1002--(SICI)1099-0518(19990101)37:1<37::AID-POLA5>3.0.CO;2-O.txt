The use of crosslinked poly(styrene-co-4-vinylpyridine) having functional groups as the support for zirconocene catalysts in ethylene polymerization was studied. Several factors affecting the activity of the catalysts were examined. Conditions like time, temperature, Al/N (molar ratio), Al/Zr (molar ratio), and the mode of feeding were found having no significant influence on the activity of the catalysts, while the state of the supports had a great effect on the catalytic behavior. The activity of the catalysts sharply increased with either the degree of crosslinking or the content of 4-vinylpyridine in the support. Via aluminum compounds, AlR3 or methylaluminoxane (MAO), zirconocene was attached on the surface of the support. IR spectra showed an intensified and shifted absorption bands of C-N in the pyridine ring, and a new absorption band appeared at about 730 cm-1 indicating a stable bond Al-N formed in the polymer-supported catalysts. The formation of cationic active centers was hypothesized and the performance of the polymer-supported zirconocene was discussed as well. Â© 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
