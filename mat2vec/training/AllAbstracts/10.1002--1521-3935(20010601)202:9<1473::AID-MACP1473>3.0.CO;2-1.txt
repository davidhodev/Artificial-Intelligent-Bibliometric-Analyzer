Propylene polymerization was conducted with the Cp2ZrHCl/B(C6F5)3/ [tBuNSiMe2Flu]TiMe2 catalyst system with AlOct3 as a scavenger at -50°C. The polymer obtained displayed a bimodal molar mass distribution. It could be confirmed that the polymer with higher M̄n was produced from Zr active sites and the polymer with lower M̄n resulted from Ti active sites. In both fractions, M̄n was increased linearly with increasing polymerization time. The MWD (M̄w/M̄n) values of each fraction were around 1.1. Thus, it could be said that propylene polymerization proceeded in a living manner even with zirconocene active species by using the mixed metallocene system. The living like polymerization of propylene with Cp2ZrMe2/B(C6F5)3/ Cp*TiCl3 was also demonstrated at -50°C. Under the reaction between carbon monoxide (CO) and this living polypropylene (PP) at -78°C, it could be found that CO was quantitatively incorporated into living PP.
