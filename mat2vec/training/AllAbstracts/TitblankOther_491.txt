Syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS) and polyethylene were comparatively synthesized with homogeneous catalytic systems composing η 5-pentamethycyclopentadienyltribenzyloxy titanium [Cp* Ti (OBz) 3] and various modified methylaluminoxanes (mMAO). The content of TMA in mMAO can be controlled by regulating H 2O/TMA molar ratio during the preparation of mMAO by partial hydrolysis of TMA with Al 2(SO 4) 3·18H 2O. The effect of Al/Ti molar ratio on polymerization of styrene as well as ethylene have been studied in detail. The oxidation states of titanium in Cp* Ti(OBz) 3/MAO catalytic systems were determined by redox titration method. It seems that active centre of Ti(III) is favorable for styrene syndiospecific polymerization with higher catalytic activity, while Ti(IV) center is favorable for ethylene polymerization. The styrene syndiospecific polymerization may also be influenced by the external addition of tri-isobutyl-aluminum(TIBA) into the same catalytic sistem giving higher yield but slightly lower molecular weight of sPS.
