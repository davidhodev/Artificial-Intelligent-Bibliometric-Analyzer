A novel polymer-supported metallocene catalyst with crosslinked poly(styrene-co-acrylamide) (PSAm) as the support has been prepared and characterized. The probability of long sequences of acrylamide (Am) in PSAm is still low even at an Am amount of 32.8 mol %, implying the relatively homogeneous distribution of Am. The infrared spectra of PSAm and the supported catalyst substantiate that an amide group in PSAm coordinates with methylaluminoxane through both oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Ethylene/α-octene copolymerization showed that the catalytic activity is not markedly affected by adding α-octene. 13C NMR analysis of the ethylene/α-octene copolymer indicated that the composition distribution of the copolymer is uniform. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
