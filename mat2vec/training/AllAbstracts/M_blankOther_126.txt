Recently, the preparation of the first siloxy substituted bis(indenyl) ansa-zirconocene, [ethylenebis(2-(tert-butyldimethylsiloxy)indenyl)]zirconium dichloride and its preliminary application in polymerization of propylene and ethylene has been reported. Currently, the structure/property relationships of siloxy substituted metallocenes are being investigated. The polymerization behavior of several complexes is being addressed. This article shows some selected results and summarizes the present status of research.
