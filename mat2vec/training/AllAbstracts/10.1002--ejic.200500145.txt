The zirconocene complexes Cp2Zr(L) (η2-Me 3SiC2SiMe3) (1a: L = THF; 1b: L = pyridine) and the ethylene bis(tetrahydroindenyl) complex rac-(ebthi)Zr(η2- Me3SiC2SiMe3) (2) react with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoropyridine with C-H bond activation to produce the 4-substituted pyridyl complexes with agostic alkenyl groups Cp′ 2Zr(4-C5NF4)[-C(SiMe3)=CH(SiMe 3)] (Cp′2 = Cp2) (3) and (Cp′2 = ebthi) (4). With 2,3,4,6-tetrafluoropyridine, after C-H bond activation, complex 2 yields two isomers of the 5-substituted pyridyl complex rac-(ebthi)Zr(3-C5NF4)[-C(SiMe3)= CH(SiMe3)] with agostic alkenyl groups, 5a and 5b. With pentafluoropyridine complex 1b gives, after dissociation of the bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene (btmsa), C-F bond activation at the 4-position and formation of Cp2Zr(4-C5NF4)F (6). Complex 1b reacts with 3-chloro-2,4,5,6-tetrafluoropyridine by means of a preferred C-Cl activation to give Cp2Zr(3-C5NF4)Cl (7). These results are in contrast to the reactions of the titanium complex Cp 2Ti(η2-Me3-SiC2SiMe 3) which, with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoropyridine, gave C-F activation in preference to C-H activation. With pentafluoropyridine, C-F bond activation at the 2-position was found rather than at the 4-position. © Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 69451 Weinheim, 2005.
