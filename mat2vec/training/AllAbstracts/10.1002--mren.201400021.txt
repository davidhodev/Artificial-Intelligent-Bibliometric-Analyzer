KGaA, Weinheim.The synthesis in a liquid propene phase of ethylene-propylene copolymers of low molecular weights (3000-20000gmol-1) is accomplished using three different metallocenes containing bridged bis(indenyl) moieties: (A) rac-dimethylsilylbis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride, (B) rac-ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride, and (C) rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride. Hydrogen pressures higher than 1 bar were required to drop the molecular weight below 25000gmol-1. Metallocene B gives rise to the copolymers with lower molecular weights (<5000gmol-1), irrespective of the ethylene content, due to the presence of a hydrogenated six membered ring in the indenyl moiety as well as a -CH2- bridge. DSC experiments indicate that for low ethylene contents (below 4wt%), metallocene A gives rise to copolymers with the highest melting temperatures and the lowest melting enthalpies, suggesting the existence of longer isotactic propylene sequences into the copolymer backbone.
