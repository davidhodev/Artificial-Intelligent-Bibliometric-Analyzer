Linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) with different branching contents were prepared from ethylene, without the addition of α-olefin comonomer, using a combination of catalyst precursors {TpMs}NiCl (1) (Tp Ms = hydridotris(3-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)) and Cp2ZrCl 2 (2) activated with MAO/TMA (1:1) in toluene at 0°C and by varying the nickel loading mole fraction (xNi). The polymerization results showed that the turnover frequencies are strongly dependent on the xNi varying from 6.6×103 to 32.1×10 3 mol[C2H4]/mol[Zr] h. The 13C NMR spectra of the copolymers showed that the branch contents of the polymers increase as the xNi increase in the medium promoting the production of polymers with a wide range of melting point (Tm). © 2004 Elsevier B.V.
