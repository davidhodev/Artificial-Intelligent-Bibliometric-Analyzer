The current development of the metallocene-based Ziegler-Natta catalysts has been reviewed. The discovery of these catalysts has offered the opportunity to obtain a deeper insight into the mechanism of Ziegler-Natta polymerizations. In this review, some mechanistic models for polymerization and stereoregulation, as well as the factors which affect the activity and stereospecificity of the catalysts, have been discussed. The technology of olefin polymerization with the metallocene-based catalysts is in the early stage of commercialization. Using these catalysts, a large number of novel polymers with special properties have been obtained. Â© 1995.
