Activities of ethylene/α-olefin copolymerization were found to increase with silane-modified silica-supported MAO using ansazirconocene catalyst. The increase in activities was less pronounced when higher α-olefins were used. However, silane modification resulted in the narrower molecular weight distribution of polymers. 13C NMR revealed that ethylene incorporation in all systems gave polymers with the similar triad distribution.
