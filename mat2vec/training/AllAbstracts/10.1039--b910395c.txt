Tris(pyrazolyl)borate titanium(IV) complexes containing aryloxo ligand of type, TpTiCl2(OAr) [Tp = HB(pyrazolyl)3; Ar = 2- iPrC6H4, C6F5, 2,6-Ph2C6H3], have been prepared, identified, and the structures of TpTiCl2(OC6F5), TpTiCl2(O-2,6-Ph2C6H3) have been determined by X-ray crystallography. The 2-iPrC6H 4 analogue exhibits especially high catalytic activities for ethylene polymerisation in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO), and the activity by TpTiCl2(OAr) increased in the order: Ar = 2-iPrC 6H4 > Ph > C6F5 >> 2,6-Ph2C6H3 > 2,6-Me2C 6H3, 2,6-iPr2C6H 3.
