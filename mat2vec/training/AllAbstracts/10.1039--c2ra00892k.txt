Three-component photoinitiating systems of radical and cationic polymerization are reviewed. The involved mechanisms are described. The design of new promising systems for the photopolymerization of low viscosity monomers under air and low intensity light sources (household lamps, LED bulbs, the sun, LEDs, diode lasers) in the 350-700 nm wavelength range suggest novel applications for Radiation Curing, Laser Imaging, optics, holography or medicine areas.
