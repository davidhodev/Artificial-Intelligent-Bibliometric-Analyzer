© 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.We report here the use of methylaluminoxane (MAO) modified aqueous miscible organic solvent treated (AMOST) layered double hydroxide, Mg6Al2(OH)16CO3·4H2O (AMO-Mg3Al-CO3) as a catalyst support system for the slurry phase polymerisation of ethylene using immobilised metallocene and non-metallocene metal complexes. The polymerisation data demonstrates that the catalyst productivity is dependent on the thermal treatment of the LDH and the temperature, pressure and time of the polymerisation. The solid catalyst system, AMO-Mg3Al-CO3/MAO/(MesPDI)FeCl2 has been shown to have the highest overall activity for a non-metallocene system (14166 kgPE mol-1complex h-1 bar-1), and AMO-Mg3Al-CO3/MAO/(2-Me,4-PhSBI)ZrCl2 was the most productive for a metallocene-based system (∼3300 kgPE mol-1complex h-1 bar-1). The molecular weights and polydispersities vary with the complex on the AMO-LDH surface. Scanning electron microscopy images show that the morphology of the as produced polyethylene mimics that of the LDH support. This journal is
