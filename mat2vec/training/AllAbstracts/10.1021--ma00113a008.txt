Polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) was conducted with the catalyst systems of rac-Et(Ind)2Zr(CH3)2/Ph3CB(C6F5)4, rac-Et(IndH4)2Zr(CH3)2/ph3CB(C6F5)6, and rac-Me2Si(Ind)2Zr(CH5)2/Ph3CB(C6F5)4. These catalysts only weee found to be inactive. However, the addition of suitable Lewis acids like alkylzinc and alkylaluminum compounds gave highly isotactic PMMA. The isotactic pentad [mmmm] in PMMA as well as the propagation rate constant (kp) depended significantly upon the zirconocene compounds. Both the microstructure ([mmmm]) and propagation rate constant (kp) increased in the following order: Me2Si(Ind)2 < Et(IndH4)2 < Et(Ind)2. The microstructure of PMMA was also affected slightly by alkylzinc compounds: (CH2)2CH=CH2 < CH2CH3 > (CH2)3CH3. When the polymerization was initiated by the rac-Et(Ind)2Zr(CH3)2/Ph3CB(C6F5)4/Zn(C2H4CH=CH2)2 catalyst system at 0 °C in toluene, the molecular weight of PMMA increased in proportion to the conversion of MMA. The increase of temperature from 0 to 80 °C caused a decrease in isotactic pentad content by approximately 10%. The isotactic polymerization of MMA was revealed to proceed by an enantiomorphic site-controlled mechanism. © 1995, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
