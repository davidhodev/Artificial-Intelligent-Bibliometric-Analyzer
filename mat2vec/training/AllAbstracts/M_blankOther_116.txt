Electroconductivities of zirconocene complex-derived catalytic system solutions were measured to identify the ionic particles generated by the catalyst activators and to follow the ionic species formed in the absence and presence of olefins. Several organoaluminum compounds (OAC) and polymethylalumoxane (MAO) were studied as metallocene activators. The specific electroconductivity of the solution of each metallocene complex examined in solvents varying in polarity, activated both with OAC and MAO, was always higher than that of the starting reactants. The electroconductivity value and the olefin polymerization rate were found to vary concurrently. The data obtained show that it is possible to trace the ionic particles generated during the formation of active species and their changes in the course of polymerization reaction.
