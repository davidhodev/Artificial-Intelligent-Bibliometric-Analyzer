Cp2TiR (OMe) prepared by treating bis (Î·5-cyclopentadienyl ) titanacyclobutane compound with one equivalent of methanol was used as a catalyst precursor in the copolymerization of ethylene and propylene in the presence of AlEtCl2. The effects of the type of alkylaluminum, molar ratio of alkylaluminum to the titanocene and monomer composition on the catalytic activity for the copolymerization were studied. It was found that chlorine-containing alkylaluminums are the efficient co-catalysts. The monomer reactivity ratios of the copolymerization catalyzed with Cp2TiR(OMe)-AlEtCl2 catalyst system were estimated to be rE = 5.3, rP = 0.03 and rErP = 0.16, indicating a random copolymerization. The 13C NMR analysis of the sequence distribution of copolymer indicated that the propylene units in copolymer are mostly isolated by ethylene units or ethylene homopolymeric sequences.
