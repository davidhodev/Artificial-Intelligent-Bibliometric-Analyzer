Both the rac- and meso-dinuclear ansa-zirconocene catalysts (μ-C12H8{[SiPh(Ind)2]ZrCl2} 2) were prepared by a coupling reaction between 2 equiv of diindenylphenylchlorosilane (rac- and meso-isomers) and 1 equiv of p-dilithiobiphenyl in diethyl ether at -80°C, followed by a successive reaction with ZrCl4 · 2THF in THF at -78°C. Polymerizations of ethene and propene were conducted in a 1 dm high-pressure glass reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer at 60, 80, 100, 120, and 150°C using methylalumoxane (MAO) as cocatalyst and toluene or decahydronaphthalene as the solvent. Copolymerization of ethene and 1-octene was also checked in brief. For ethene polymerization, the meso-catalyst was found to be more active, which displayed an extremely high activity to give linear polyethene with a high molecular weight and a narrow molar mass distribution (MMD). The apparent activity increased monotonously with rising polymerization temperature from 60°C up to 150°C, indicating that the active species are stable even at a high temperature. On the other hand, both the rac- and meso-catalysts showed very poor activities for propene polymerization. However, copolymerization of ethene and 1-octene proceeded at a high speed. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
