A novel catalyst precursor, (η5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)titanium triallyloxide (Cp*Ti(OCH2-CH=CH2)3), was prepared and employed in a study of propylene polymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO). This work has revealed that the half-titanocene catalyst is desirable for the production of elastomeric poly(propylene) with high molecular weight (M̄w = 8-69 × 104) as well as in good yields under typical polymerization conditions. © Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1999.
