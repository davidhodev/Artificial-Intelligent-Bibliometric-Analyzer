The cationic alkyl zirconocene complex Cp2Zr+Me[CH3B-(C6F 5)3] is found to initiate the ring-opening polymerization of 1,5,7,11-tetraoxaspiro[5,5]undecane under mild condition to give poly(oxypropylenepropylenecarbonate) with low polydispersity. The rate of the polymerization is first-order with respect to monomer and catalyst concentration. At high monomer concentration, the initial rate of polymerization becomes zero-order with respect to monomer concentration.
