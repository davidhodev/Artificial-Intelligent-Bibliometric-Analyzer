Bis(imino)diphenylamido rare-earth metal dialkyl complexes [o-(2,6- iPr2-C6H3-NC-C6H 4)2-N]Ln(CH2SiMe3)2 (1: Ln = Sc; 2: Ln = Lu; 3: Ln = Y) have been synthesized in good yields and structurally characterized by elemental analysis, NMR spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. They serve as highly efficient single-component catalysts both for the living ring-opening ε-caprolactone polymerization and random copolymerization with γ-butyrolactone, with the activity being dependent on the steric hindrance around the metal center, yielding high molecular weight PCLs or P(CL-co-BL)s with narrow molecular weight distributions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.
