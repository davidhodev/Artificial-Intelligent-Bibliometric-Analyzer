This article deals with four families of heteroatomic polymers that contain p-block elements in their main chain. The polymers discussed herein contain P-N, B-N, B-P, and Si-O motifs. Among the P-N polymers, the other subclasses included are those that contain P-N-E motifs (E = C, S, S(O)) as well as polymers that contain inorganic P-N and P-N-C rings as pendant groups. Various synthetic methods for the assembly of these polymer systems and their structure and properties are discussed. In each case, the chemistry of the relevant small molecules is also presented.
