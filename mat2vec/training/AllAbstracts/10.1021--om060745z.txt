Using the Sm/SmI2 mixed system, organochlorosilanes (R 3SiCl) undergo reductive dimerization reactions to give the corresponding disilanes in moderate to good yields. The Sm/SmI2 mixed system also can be applied successfully to the polymerization of l,4-bis(dimethylchlorosilyl)benzene and dichloromethylphenylsilane, which affords the σ-π conjugate poly(disilanylenephenylene) (M w/Mn = 1.2, Mn = 2480) and poly(methylphenyl) silane (Mw/Mn = 1.5, Mn = 4650) with a sharp molecular distribution. © 2007 American Chemical Society.
