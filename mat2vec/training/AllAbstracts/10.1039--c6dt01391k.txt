© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.Novel Zr(iv) and Hf(iv) complexes bearing two constrained bulky β-enaminoketonato ligands {[ArNCH-C8H3(CH2)n(R)O]2MBn2, M = Zr or Hf; n = 1, 2 or 3; R = H or C6H5; Ar = C6H5 or C6F5} were synthesized and clearly characterized. X-ray crystal structure analysis reveals that these complexes adopt a distorted octahedral geometry. Compared with non-constrained analogues, the Zr(iv) complexes with a cyclic skeleton exhibited high catalytic activities (up to 16.4 kgPE mmolZr-1 h-1) toward ethylene polymerization at ambient pressure and elevated temperatures. Moreover, the catalytic properties of these complexes could be governed exquisitely by appropriate variation of the N-aryl substituents and the size of the benzocyclane. The Zr(iv) complexes bearing a non-fluorinated N-aryl group yielded oligomers, while the fluorinated analogues bearing a five-membered or six-membered cyclane group produced high molecular weight polyethylenes (33.4-306 kg mol-1) under similar conditions on account of the suppression effects on β-H elimination. The Zr(iv) complexes are more active toward ethylene polymerization than the Hf(iv) analogues, and the resulting polymers exhibited higher molecular weight and narrower molecular weight distribution.
