For improving the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of metallocene polyethylene (PE), two new asymmetric ethyl_ether bridged dinuclear titanium metallocene complexes: (CpTiCl2)2 [η5-η5-C9H6 (CH2)2O(CH2)2 C5H4](Cl) and (CPTiCl2)2 [η5-η5-C9H6 (CH2)2O(CH2)2 C5H3 CH3] (C2), have been synthesized by using Schlenk technology, and they were characterized with GC-MS, 1H-13C-NMR and IR. After activation with methy aluminoxane (MAO), C1 and C2 are efficient catalytic systems for ethylene polymerization. At the atmosphere pressure, their catalytic activities reached to 4.43 × 105 g/(mol·h) and 4.82 × 105 g/(mol·h), the Mη of PE reached to 7.52 × 105 and 7.15 × 105, and the MWD of PE were 12.4 and 11.00, respectively.
