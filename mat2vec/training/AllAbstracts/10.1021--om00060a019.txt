Alternative reaction modes for α-olefin insertion in a zirconocene alkyl cation are investigated by the extended Hückel MO method. Agostic interaction of one of the α-H atoms of the migrating alkyl group with the Zr center is found to stabilize the transition state of the preferred reaction mode. Essential contributions to this preference are identified by fragment-MO analysis. Implications of these findings for stereoselective olefin polymerization by chiral ansa-metallocene derivatives are discussed. © 1992, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
