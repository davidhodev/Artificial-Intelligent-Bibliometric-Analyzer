The free-radical polymerization of styrene and methyl methylacrylate in the presence of dicyclopentadienyltitanium dichloride was studied. It was shown that the process proceeds without any noticeable gelation up to high conversions and is characterized by a linear increase in molecular mass with conversion. On the basis of quantum-chemical calculations and ESR studies, a scheme describing polymer chain growth involving an organometallic compound was proposed.
