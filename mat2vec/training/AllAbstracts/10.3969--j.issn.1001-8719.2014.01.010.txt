The oil-solvent drag reducing agent (DRA) was synthesized with slurry polymerization catalyzed by Ziegler-Natta catalyst under atmosphere pressure and 1-octene as raw material. The effects of co-catalyst type and its dosage, dosage of external electron donor on polymerization were discussed. A new process synthesizing oil-soluble drag reducing agent was suggested. The drag reducing efficiency of DRA was determined in simulative loop evaluation apparatus. The results showed that the slurry polymerization process was simple, by which drag reducing efficiency of the product DRA could reach 58.7% with the intrinsic viscosity [Î·] of 17.3 dL/g.
