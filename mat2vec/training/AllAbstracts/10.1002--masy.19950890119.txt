Me2C[1‐Cp‐9‐Flu]ZrCl2 derivatives with H‐, CH3‐and (CH3)3C‐ substituents β to the Cp bridgehead carbon atom as well as complexes having mono‐ or di‐substituted fluorenyl ligands (R = CH3‐, (CH3)3C‐, CH3O‐, CH3OCH2‐, (CH3)3CC≡C‐, (CH3)2N‐, F‐, and Cl‐) have been investigated as propylene polymerization pro‐catalysts. Steric effects from the β‐Cp substituents determine the iso‐, hemi‐iso‐, and syndio‐specificities of the catalysts. The relative stereospecificities of Me2Si[1‐Cp‐3t‐Bu‐9‐Flu]ZrCl2 and rac‐Me2Si[1‐Ind‐3‐t‐Bu]2ZrCl2 are in accord with molecular models. The more un‐symmetrical the catalysts are the more m and mm stereosequences there are in s‐PP. The m dyads also increase with the concentration of Me2C[1‐Cp‐9‐Flu‐2‐OMe]ZrCl2.
