The polymerization of norbornene has been investigated in the presence of different bis(salicylaldiminate)nickel(II) precursors activated by methylaluminoxane. These systems are highly active in affording nonstereoregular vinyl-type polynorbornenes (PNBs) with high molecular weights. The productivity of the catalytic systems is strongly enhanced (up to 35,000 kg of PNB/mol of Ni × h) when electron-withdrawing nitro groups are introduced on the phenol moiety. On the contrary, the presence of bulky alkyl groups on the N-aryl moiety of the ligand does not substantially affect the activity or characteristics of the resulting PNBs. The catalytic performances are also markedly influenced by the reaction parameters, such as the nature of the solvent, the reaction time, and the monomer/Ni and Al/Ni molar ratios. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
