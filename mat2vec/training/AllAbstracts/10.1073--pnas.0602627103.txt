Bis(1-methylethenyl-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride (7a) was prepared by a fulvene route. Photolysis at 0°C with Pyrex-filtered UV light resulted in a rapid and complete intramolecular [2+2]cycloaddition reaction to yield the corresponding cyclobutylene-bridged ansa-zirconocene dichloride isomer (8a). This is one of the rare examples of an organic functional group chemistry that leads to carbon-carbon coupling at the framework of an intact sensitive group 4 bent metallocene complex. More sterically hindered open metallocenes that bear bulky isopropyl or tert-butyl substituents at their Cp rings in addition to the active 1-methylethenyl functional group undergo the photochemical ansa-metallocene ring closure reaction equally facile. The metallocene systems used and obtained in this study have served as transition metal components for the generation of active metallocene propene polymerization catalysts. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.
