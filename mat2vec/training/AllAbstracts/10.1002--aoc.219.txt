A series of new bis(indenyl) zirconium diaryloxides of general formula Ind2Zr(OL)2 (L = C6H5, 2; C6F5, 3; 2,6-Me2C6H3, 4; 2,4,6-Me3C6H2, 5; 4-tBuC6H4, 6) were synthesized by a metathesis reaction of Ind2ZrCl2 (1) with the appropriate thallium aryloxide salt, TIOL. The complexes 1-6 were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR techniques. They were also examined as catalysts for ethene and 1-hexene polymerization with methylalumoxane as co-catalyst, and a trend of the polymerization activity as a function of aryloxide ligands was observed. An interpretation of this trend, considering both the electronic and steric effects of the substituents on the aryloxide rings, was proposed. Â© 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
