The Cp<inf>2</inf>ZrCl<inf>2</inf>/C<inf>2</inf>H<inf>5</inf>AlCl<inf>2</inf> system (Cp=π-cyclopentadienyl) was found to be an active catalyst for polymerization of alkynes. Both internal and terminal alkynes were polymerized by this homogeneous catalytic system. Spectroscopic observation of a zirconacyclopentadiene compound in the above reaction led to the investigation of zirconacyclopentadienes as possible reaction intermediates. The zirconacyclopentadiene on reaction with phenylacetylene produced larger zirconacycles and poly-(phenylacetylene). Apparently, the mechanism of polymerization of alkynes is by successive insertion of the alkyne into the zirconium-carbon bond, producing expanded zirconacycles, elimination of which results in the formation of a polyalkyne. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.
