Using the low-valent titanium reagent (Zn/TiCl4), dichlorophenylsilane underwent a reductive polymerization reaction to give Si-H functional poly(phenylsilane) (Mw/Mn=2.5, M n=2400) in a moderate yield. Applying this method, the corresponding organosilane copolymers (2b-2f) were also obtained. The absorption maxima of these organosilane copolymers are remarkably hypsochromically shifted in comparison with those of poly(diarylsilane)s. Â© 2008 SIOC, CAS, & Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.
