Boratabenzenes (4) are six π-electron aromatic anions which can serve as versatile ligands towards Zr(IV) and Zr(II). The reaction of 4 with ZrCl4 affords bis(boratabenzene)zirconium(IV) dichlorides (11), which on treatment with BuLi and excess PMe3 give bis(boratabenzene)bis(trimethylphosphine)zirconium(II) (27). On activation by excess methylaluminoxane 11 are the catalysts for the polymerization or oligomerization of ethylene. Bridged boratabenzene zirconium dichlorides 19, 20, and 21, which closely resemble the corresponding ansa-zirconocenes, can be similarly activated for polymerization of ethylene. Compound 27 reacts with 1,3-diynes to afford zirconacycles 31 and with acetylene by ring annulation to afford 32. © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.
