Heterogeneous cocatalysts, catalysts, and catalyst mixtures for the polymerization of ethylene were prepared applying "fumed silica" and mesoporous MCM-41 support materials and zirconocene dichloride, titanocene dichloride, and a bis(arylimino)pyridine iron complex as catalyst precursors. The catalyst mixtures produced polyethylenes which exhibit the properties of two single polymers. Polyethylenes with the desired bimodal molecular weight distributions could be obtained with a series of ternary Zr/Ti/Fe catalysts. The ability of the zirconium and titanium species to copolymerize short-chain 1-olefins produced by the iron centers ("in situ" copolymerization) is useful for the production of copolymers from only one monomer (ethylene).
