A series of ZrIV and TiIV complexes containing the 6-(2-(diethylboryl)phenyl)pyridyl-2-yl motif are used in the methylalumoxane-triggered copolymerization of ethylene (E) with norborn-2-ene (NBE). 13C NMR analyses reveal that vinyl insertion polymerization (VIP)-derived poly(E)-co-poly(NBE) is obtained with pre-catalysts 1-4 and 6, while pre-catalyst 5 allows for the synthesis of a copolymer that contains both VIP- and ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP)-derived structures. All the VIP-derived poly(E)-co-poly(NBE) sequences show predominantly isolated NBE/alternating-syndiotactic E-NBE, as well as alternating-isotactic E-NBE sequences. The microstructure of the copolymers is correlated with the propensity of the pre-catalysts to allow tandem ROMP-VIP. Â© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
