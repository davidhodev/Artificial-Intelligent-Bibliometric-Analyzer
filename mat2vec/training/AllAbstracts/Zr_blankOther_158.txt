High performance polymers from simple hydrocarbon monomers such as propylene (P), norbornene (N) butadiene (B) and styrene (S) were obtained by the precise control of primary structures with coordination polymerization catalysis. Syndiospecific polymerization of P was performed with C S-symmetric ansa-fluorenylamidodmethyltitanium activated with AlR 3-free MAO (dMAO) in heptane. This catalysis system was found to be effective for homo- and copolymerization of norbornene with ethylene or 1-alkene. Random copolymer of P and B with 1,4-B units synthesized by an isospecific zirconocene catalyst was converted to α,ω-divinyl isotactic PP by metathesis degradation of the copolymer with ethylene. Isotactic PP with pendant vinyl group was obtained by copolymerization of P and B in the presence of hydrogen in high activity. Crystalline S-B block copolymers which possesses long crystallizable syn-PS segments chemically bonding with a high cis-1,4-PB was synthesized by adding B to a syndiotactic living PS.
