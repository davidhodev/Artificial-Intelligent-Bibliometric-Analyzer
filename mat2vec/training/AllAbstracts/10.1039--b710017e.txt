Bimetallic dichlorotitanium complexes, {2,6-[η5-2,5-Me 2C5H2]2-4-R-C6H 2N-N}{Ti(iv)Cl2}2 (7, R = Me; 8, R = F) and 4,4′-A[{2-(η5-2,3,5-Me3C5H)C 6H3NC6H11-κN}Ti(iv)Cl 2]2 (18, A = CH2; 19, A = O; 20, A = ortho-C6H4) are prepared via a key step of the Suzuki-coupling reaction of 2-dihydroxyboryl-3-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one (1) with dibromo-compounds. The solid state structure of 7 was determined by X-ray crystallography. Complexes 7 and 8 are not active for ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization. Meanwhile, the complexes 18-20 are highly active and their activities are higher than that of the mononuclear analogue, {2-(η5-2,3,5-Me3C5H)C6H 3NC6H11-κN}Ti(iv)Cl2 (21). The molecular weights of the polymers obtained with the bimetallic complexes 18-20 are higher than that of the polymer obtained using 21. Slightly higher contents of long-chain-branching are observed for the copolymers obtained using the bimetallic system. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.
