Titanocene and its derivatives are part of a larger division within organometallic chemistry called metallocenes. The diverse uses for these complexes are illustrated by covering three different fields of experimentation: polymerization, cancer research, and organic synthesis. Metallocene catalysts are emerging as the leaders of a new era in polymer synthesis. These catalysts produce polyethylene called linear low-density polyetheylene (LLDPE). Other processes, like free radical polymerization, produce branched chains and give a lower quality product. New functionalized Cp2TiCl2 compounds synthesized in 2003 exhibit significant toxicity against a number of different human tumor cell lines. Several reaction schemes illustrate the wide range of applications for titanocene complexes as catalysts or reactants in organic synthesis. Titanocene dichloride catalyst can be used to promote a double alkylation of styrenes by two alkyl halides under mild conditions. Furthermore, titanocene dichloride is also effective in promoting alkylations of alkylol with organoaluminum reagents. All of these applications show that titanocene derivatives have a promising future in many fields of research and development.
