A nonconjugated methacrylate copolymer (PCzOxEu) containing carbazole moieties (electron donors), 1,3,4-oxadiazole moieties (electron acceptors), and europium complexes in the pendant groups was synthesized via free radical copolymerization of methacrylate monomers containing the respective functional groups. The molecular structure and composition of PCzOxEu was characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and cyclic voltammetry (CyV). The resulting copolymer exhibited a relatively high glass transition temperature (Tg ≈125°C) and good solubility in common organic solvents. It could be cast into transparent films from solutions. For a thin film of PCzOxEu sandwiched between an indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrode and an Al electrode (ITO/PCzOxEu/Al), the structure behaved as a nonvolatile flash (rewritable) memory with accessible electronic states that could be written, read, and erased. The polymer memory exhibited an ON/OFF current ratio up to 10 5, switching response time of ∼1.5 μs, more than 10 6 read cycles, retention time of more than 8 h, and write/erase voltages of about 4.4 V/-2.8 V under ambient conditions. The roles of oxadiazole moieties in improving the response time and retention time of the memory device were elucidated from the molecular simulation results. © 2006 American Chemical Society.
