Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Ethylene slurry polymerization using Cp*TiCl2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) in the presence of supported solid MAO cocatalysts proceeded without decreasing in the activity compared to the homogeneous system, affording polymers with controlled shape replicated from the original support. Unique characteristics by 1 in the ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization observed in the homogeneous system (high catalytic activity, efficient 1-hexene incorporation, temperature dependence) have also been preserved in this catalysis, affording high molecular weight poly(ethylene-co-1-hexene)s with unimodal molecular weight distributions as well as with high 1-hexene contents.
