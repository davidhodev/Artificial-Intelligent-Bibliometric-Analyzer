© 2015 Elsevier B.V.A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was designed and synthesized to serve as a functional material for selective recognition of 6-thioguanine (6TG), an antitumor drug. For that, the newly synthesized functional monomer, cytosine-bis(2,2'-bithienyl)-(4-carboxyphenyl)methane ester (Cyt-S4), revealed Watson-Crick type nucleobase pairing of 6TG. Formation of the Cyt-S4 and 6TG complex of the 2:1 stoichiometry was postulated based on the DFT calculations at the B3LYP/3-21G(*) level and experimentally confirmed by fluorescence titration. The molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) film was deposited by potentiodynamic electropolymerization on a Pt disk electrode as well as on an Au-coated glass slide and on an Au-quartz crystal resonator. The statistical model of formation of this film was successfully simulated by molecular dynamics. Completeness of the subsequent 6TG template extraction from MIP was confirmed by the UV-visible spectroscopy. An imprinting factor of 2.9 for the MIP film was determined by piezoelectric microgravimetry using ECQM. The double-layer capacity and alternating current measurements under flow-injection analysis (FIA) conditions were selected to transduce the 6TG recognition signal into the change of the double-layer capacity dependence on the 6TG concentration in solution for different supporting electrolyte concentrations. Detectability of the resulting chemosensor was 10μM 6TG for the 0.5M KF carrier solution in FIA. Selectivity of the chemosensor with respect to common interferences was high, e.g., it exceeded 130 to 2-amino-6-methylmercaptopurine, a 6TG metabolite.
