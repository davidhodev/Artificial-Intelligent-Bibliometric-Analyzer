Four dinuclear alkylidene-bridged zirconocene complexes were synthesized applying hydrozirconation reaction of α,ω-dienes with the "Schwartz' reagent" and tested for the polymerization of ethylene. The polyethylenes obtained with alkylidene-bridged dinuclear complexes showed higher molecular weights Mw and polydispersities revealing that more catalytically active species exist in the polymerization system. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.
