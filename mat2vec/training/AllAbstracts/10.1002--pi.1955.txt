Two new half-sandwich titanocene catalysts for the stereospecific polymerization of styrene, RCpTi(o-MeOPhCPh2O)Cl2 (R = H (1); R = Me (2)), were prepared by reaction of the corresponding RCpTiCl3 complexes with o-methoxyphenyldiphenylmethanol (o-MeOPhCPh2OH) in the presence of triethylamine. Upon activation with excess methylaluminoxane (MAO), they showed high activities and high thermal stabilities for the stereospecific polymerization of styrene. The influences of polymerization temperature, Al/Ti molar ratio, solvent (aliphatic or aromatic) and time on the activity and syndiotacticity of the styrene polymerization were investigated.
