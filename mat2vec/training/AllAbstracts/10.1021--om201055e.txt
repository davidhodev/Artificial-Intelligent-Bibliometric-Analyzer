Trifluoromethyltrimethylsilane, (CH 3) 3SiCF 3, in the presence of CsF serves as an excellent CF 3 group-transfer reagent, and reaction with Cp 2TiF 2 in THF gives the titanocene trifluoromethyl fluoride complex Cp 2Ti(CF 3)(F) (1; Cp = C 5H 5) in 60% isolated yield. Reaction of complex 1 with the trimethylsilyl reagents, (CH 3) 3SiX (X = OTf = OSO 2CF 3, Cl, Br, I, N 3, and OSO 2Ph), in a tetrahydrofuran or toluene solution affords the corresponding Ti-CF 3 derivatives Cp 2Ti(CF 3)(X) (X = OTf (2), Cl (12), Br (13), I (14), N 3 (15), and OSO 2Ph (16)) in good isolated yields of 67-84%. These compounds have been characterized by a combination of reactivity studies, IR and 1H/ 13C{ 1H}/ 19F NMR spectroscopies, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The Ti-CF 3 linkage in these complexes is remarkably robust, and although the α-C-F bonds are elongated, there is no evidence of an α-fluoride (Ti•••F- CF 2) between the electrophilic Ti(IV) metal center and any of the C-F bonds in the trifluoromethyl group in the solid-state or in solution. In the solid-state, these complexes are shock-sensitive; energetic decomposition of Cp 2Ti(CF 3)(F) (1) produces uniform spherical nanoparticles ranging from ∼70 to 120 nm in size and porous fluorinated oligomers and polymers containing both -(CF 2-CF 2)- and -(CF 2-CFH)- units, as determined by a combination of SEM, XRD, XRF, XPS, and 19F MAS NMR. Density functional theory results show good agreement with experimental structural data obtained for Cp 2Ti(CF 3)(X) (X = F (1), OTf (2), Cl (12), N 3 (15)) and accurately predicts longer Ti-CF 3 distances than for each specific CH 3 analogue, and the trend extends to structurally related Zr and Hf analogues. Simpler model compounds from groups 4 and 8 (M(CH 3) 4, M(CH 3) 3(CF 3), M(CH 3) 3(CCl 3), and M(CH 3) 3(CF 2CF 2CF 2CF 3); M = Ti, Zr, Hf, Fe, Ru, Os)) were also examined and show that, for group 4 complexes, π-bonding is a significant factor in shortening the strongly ionic M-CH 3 relative to M-CF 3, whereas for the predominantly covalent group 8 analogues, π-back-bonding helps to shorten the predominantly covalent M-CF 3 relative to M-CH 3. The bonding analysis suggests that the significant elongation of C-F bonds α to metals is mainly a consequence of the electropositivity of the group 4 metal centers, with minor, if any, contributions from π-effects; the bond-lengthening effect is most pronounced at the α-position and decays rapidly on moving away from the metal. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
