Photo associated reactions and light responsive materials have great potential to improve existing industrial processes, including liquid crystal alignment and capturing solar energy. This book presents a range of reactions and materials with some of the most exciting current and future applications. It includes a brief introduction to photochemistry; in-depth discussion of photosensitizers, photoinititiators, and the processes of light curing and crosslinking; listing of light responsive polymers and their uses; and a discussion of polymeric materials for use in non-linear optics. The book will interest polymer chemists and engineers developing light reactive varnishes, paints, and adhesives for paper, plastic, wood, and metal surfaces, as well as for optical fibers, compact discs, xerography, and holography.
