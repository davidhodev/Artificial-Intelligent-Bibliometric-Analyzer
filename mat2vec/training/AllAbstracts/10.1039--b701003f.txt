Exclusive formation of poly(ethylene-co-styrene)s were observed by introduction of ethylene into the solution of syndiospecific styrene polymerisation using Cp′TiCl<inf>2</inf>(O-2,6-<sup>i</sup>Pr <inf>2</inf>C<inf>6</inf>H<inf>3</inf>) (Cp′ = 1,2,4-Me<inf>3</inf>C <inf>5</inf>H<inf>2</inf>, tert-BuC<inf>5</inf>H<inf>4</inf>)-MAO catalysts without by-production of syndiotactic polystyrene, whereas the styrene polymerisation did not proceed when ethylene was removed from the reaction mixture of ethylene/styrene copolymerisation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.
