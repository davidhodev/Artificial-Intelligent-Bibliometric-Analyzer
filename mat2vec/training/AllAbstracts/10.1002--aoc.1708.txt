trans-Dichlorotetrapyridineruthenium(II) [trans-RuCl2(py) 4] was synthesized and the structure was determined by single crystal X-ray crystallography. Highly efficient formation of propylene carbonate (PC) from carbon dioxide and propylene oxide was achieved by using a catalyst system composed of trans-RuCl2(py)4 and hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide under mild conditions (4h, 80 °C, 3.0 MPa). PC was obtained in nearly 100% selectivity without the formation of a polymer. The catalyst could be recycled constantly many times without any significant loss of its catalytic activity. On the basis of the results, a mechanism for the reaction was proposed. Copyright © 2010 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
