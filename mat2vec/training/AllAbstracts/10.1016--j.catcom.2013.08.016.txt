The novel half-metallocene zirconium (IV) bearing quinoline-amino-phenolate tridentate ligand (Zr1) was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, NMR spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography. The complex Zr1, upon activation with MAO, proved active in the polymerization of ethylene (26-2015 kg of PE/mol[Zr]·h- 1), yielding high-density polyethylenes with molecular weight varying from 129 to 364 × 103 g·mol- 1. Complex Zr1 was also tested in the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene affording high molecular weight poly(ethylene-co-1- hexene) with low comonomer incorporation (1.0-1.9%). © 2013 Elsevier B.V. rights reserved.
