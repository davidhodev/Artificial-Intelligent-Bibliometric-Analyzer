The novel neutral κ2-N,O-salicylaldiminato Ni(II) complex, [κ2-N,O-{2,6-(3′,5′-R2C 6H3)2C6H3-N=C(H)-(3,5- I2-2-O-C6H2)}NiCH3(pyridine)] (1a-pyr, R = NO2), with four nitro substituents on the N-terphenyl motif is a catalyst precursor for ethylene polymerization to yield linear higher molecular weight polyethylene (e.g., Mn 2.1 × 105 g mol-1 and only 2 methyl branches per 1000 carbon atoms). A comparison with other known catalyst precursors at various polymerization conditions shows that the catalytic properties in terms of linearity and molecular weight are similar to the fluorinated catalyst precursor with R = CF3, showing that the latter is not singular, but rather suppression of chain transfer and branch formation by β-hydride elimination can also be brought about by nonfluorinated electron-withdrawing remote substituents. © 2013 American Chemical Society.
