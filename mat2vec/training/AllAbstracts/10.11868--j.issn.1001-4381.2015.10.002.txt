Â©, 2015, Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials (BIAM). All right reserved.Several heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts were prepared by loading TiCl4 using mixture of modified montmorillonite (MMT) and functionalized muti-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as effective composite nanofillers. The polyethylene nanocomposites were produced by in-situ polymerization with these catalysts. The effect of composition of MMT and MWCNTs on the mechanical properties of polyethylene nanocomposite was investigated. The results show that highly active polymerization catalyst with the nanofillers containing MMT and modified MWCNTs can be obtained. The composition of nanofiller has a remarkable influence on mechanical properties of polyethylene nanocomposite. The maximum tensile strength of polyethylene nanocomposite is 38.7 MPa using the mass ratio of MMT to MWCNTs of 1:1.
