Complexes were prepared in which one of the 2-phenylindenyl ligand was substituted with cyclopentadienyl type ligands, (cyclopentadienyl)(2-phenyl-indenyl)zirconium dichloride, Cp(2PhInd)ZrCl2 and Cp*(2PhInd)ZrCl2 and studied their behavior in propylene polymerization. The substitution of one of the 2-phenylindenyl ligands with a Cp ligand resulted in a fourfold increase in productivity. Typical productivities observed for Cp2ZrCl2 type complexes were lower. The molecular weight of polypropylene prepared with complex 2 was higher. Upon substitution of 2-phenylindene with Cp, the ability of the catalyst to generate elastomeric polypropylene is lost.
