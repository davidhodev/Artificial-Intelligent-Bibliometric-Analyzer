Syndiotactic polystyrene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) copolymer is synthesized via the Huisgen 1,3 dipolar click cycloaddition reaction of properly end functionalized syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer segments. The end functionalized sPS is obtained by quenching the styrene polymerization catalyzed by a half-titanocene catalyst with N-bromosuccinimide to yield sPS-Br, then converted into the corresponding azide (sPS-N3) by reaction with sodium azide. The PgBiB-PMMA segment is synthesized by ATRP of MMA using the PgBiB initiator carrying the alkyne functionality. The formation of core-shell micelles with size depending on the copolymer composition is highlighted by AFM. Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
