The reaction of pentamethylcyclopentadienyltris((trimethylsilyl)methyl)titanium (Cp*Ti-(CH2SiMe3)3) with 1 equiv of B(C6F5)3 was almost quantitative to give the "cationic" compound [Cp*Ti(CH2SiMe3)2]+[B(CH 2SiMe3)(C6F5)3] - (1), which was readily identified spectroscopically. The complex 1, prepared in situ by reacting the precursor with B(C6F5)3, has also been found to be active for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene, producing over 95% syndiotactic PS at an activity of 0.86 × 107 g of PS/(mol of Ti·mol of styrene·h). Both activity and syndiospecificity significantly increased when triisobutylaluminum (TIBA) was used to scavenge the polymerization system. The maximum polymerization activities for the cationic complex were found at Tp = 70°C. The electron-withdrawing substituents on the aromatic solvent ring could increase the activity and s-PS yields, although toluene is the polymerization medium of best choice in the styrene polymerization. Through the comparison of various Lewis acids as cocatalysts by virtue of their difference in both Lewis acidity and ion-pair interactions, the role of the key titanocene-cocatalyst interaction was unambiguously demonstrated, suggesting that the nature of Lewis acids and the structure of their corresponding counteranions were important.
