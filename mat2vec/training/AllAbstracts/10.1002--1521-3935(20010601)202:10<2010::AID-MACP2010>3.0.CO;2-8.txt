Details of the preparation and polymerization behavior of two chiral zirconocene catalysts are presented. The results of experimental and molecular-mechanics evaluation of their stereoselectivity with respect to liquid-propene polymerization are compared with those of a related catalyst system. The elastic properties of the obtained amorphous poly(propylene), due to the presence of small Î³-form crystallites, are compared with those of a highmolecular weight atactic poly(propylene) obtained in the presence of a C2v catalyst.
