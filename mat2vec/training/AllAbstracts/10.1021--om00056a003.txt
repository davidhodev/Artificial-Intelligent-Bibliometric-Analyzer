Monitoring the interaction of ((trimethylsilyl)methykl) titanocene chloride with aluminum chloride in polar halocarbons by 1H, 13C, and 27AI NMR spectroscopy has yielded direct spectral evidence for the generation of equilibrating solvent-separated and contact ion pairs, Cp2TKCH2SIMe3)+ and AlCl4 −. Such ion pairs are effective catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene, and as re quired by this action, Me3Si fragments from the titanoc-ene component are incorporated into the linear, high-density polyethylene formed. X-ray diffraction data on ((trimethylsllyl)methyl)tltanocene chloride (space group P21/n; R = 0.042; Rw = 0.050; p(max) = 0.43 e/Å3) reveal an unusually short Ti-CH2 bond (2.162 Å) and an anti conformational arrangement of the Me3SiCH2 group with the Ti-CI bond. © 1991, American Chemical Society.
