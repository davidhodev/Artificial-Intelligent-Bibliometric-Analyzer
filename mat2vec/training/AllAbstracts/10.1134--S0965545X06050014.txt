The specific features of free-radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate in the presence of a new initiating system, benzoyl peroxide-N-N-dimethyl-N- (memylferrocenyl)amine, are studied. Mutual influence of the ferrocene and amino groups on the kinetic parameters of polymerization and on the microstructure of the resulting polymers is revealed. The polymer formed in the presence of this initiating system is shown to have a predominantly syndiotactic structure. Â© Pleiades Publishing, Inc., 2006.
