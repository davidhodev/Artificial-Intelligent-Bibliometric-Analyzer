The functionalized (fluoroaryl)borate salts Ph3C+B(C6F4TBS)4 - and Ph3C+B(C6F4TIPS)4 - (TBS = tBuMe2Si; TIPS = iPr3Si) are prepared in three steps from 1,4-HC6F4Br, Reaction with zirconocene dimethyls yields crystalline, thermally stable, soluble L2ZrCH3 +B-(C6F4SiR3)4 - and L'2ZrH+B(C6SiR3)4 - salts (L = η5-C5H5; η5-1,2-Me2C5H3; L' = η-Me5C5) which function as highly active ethylene polymerization catalysts. © 1995, American Chemical Society.
