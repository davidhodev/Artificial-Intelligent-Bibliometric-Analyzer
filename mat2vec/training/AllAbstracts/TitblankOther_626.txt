This paper presents data on difencholate of titanocene, new organotitanium coordination compound and its application to a polymerisation of styrene. The new complex was characterised by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and mass-spectrometry. The polymerisation of styrene was realised in tightly closed Schlenk tubes under dry N2 atmosphere in the presence of methylaluminoxane as co-catalyst, providing the necessary [Al]/[Ti] ration of 4000. The samples of the polystyrene obtained having syndiotactic configuration structure were analysed by a set of different modern physico-chemical methods: gel-permeation chromatography, Fourier transform IR-spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. It was shown that new catalyst exceeds CpTiCl3 in several principal characteristics of the final polymer (e.g. Mw), whilst the latter compounds is one of the best known Kaminsky-type species for styrene polymerisation. Synthesis of new titanocene derivatives containing bicyclic voluminous frameworks of lateral ligands which impart to the coordination compound more stability in air and more solubility in non-polar organic media could be a possible alternative to rather popular but quite expensive idea to enhance the catalytic activity via synthesis of bridged metallocenes.
