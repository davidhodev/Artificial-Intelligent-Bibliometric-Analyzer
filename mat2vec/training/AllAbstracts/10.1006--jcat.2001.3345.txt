We studied a ZSM-5 zeolite as metallocene support for ethylene polymerization. We transformed the Na-ZSM-5 into H-ZSM-5. After the cation exchange, the zeolite was calcined at three different temperatures. Characterization of the material indicated that by means of the calcination procedure it is possible to produce dealuminization with an increase in extraframework aluminum (EFAL). We prepared zirconocene-supported catalysts on zeolitic supports using two preparation methods. The higher activity was observed with the zirconocene supported on ZSM-5 pre-treated at 900°C. We think that the dealuminization process generates an increase in EFAL. This EFAL is responsible for the higher activity. © 2001 Academic Press.
