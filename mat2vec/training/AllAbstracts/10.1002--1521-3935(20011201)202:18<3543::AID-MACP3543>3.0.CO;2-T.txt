The polymerization of 1-hexene with the catalyst systems Cp2ZrCl2/MAO and Me2SiInd2ZrCl2/MAO is investigated in order to elucidate the nature of the active species in zirconocene/MAO catalyzed polymerizations. Varying monomer concentration and monomer conversion does not result in any unexpected behavior. However, changing catalyst and cocatalyst concentration leads to broadened, or even bimodal, molecular weight distributions under certain reaction conditions. These results may be interpreted in terms of a coexistence of two active species with different rates of propagation and of termination.
