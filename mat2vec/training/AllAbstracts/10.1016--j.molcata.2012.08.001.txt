Ethylene copolymerization with 1-hexene, styrene using half-titanocenes containing 1,3-dialkyl- and 1,3-diarylimidazolin-2-iminato ligands, Cp′TiCl 2[1,3-R 2(CHN) 2CN] [Cp′ = Cp (1), tBuC 5H 4 (2); R = tBu (a), 2,6- iPr 2C 6H 3 (b)], have been explored in the presence of MAO cocatalyst. Complex 1a exhibited remarkable catalytic activity for ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization, affording ultrahigh molecular weight copolymers with uniform molecular weight distributions (M n = 1.07-1.31 × 10 6, M w/M n = 1.43-1.82). An opposite trend for effect of N-substituents in 1a,b toward the activity in ethylene and styrene homopolymerization was observed. The ethylene/styrene copolymerizations afforded poly(ethylene-co-styrene)s with uniform compositions and the polymerization by the tBu analogues (1a,2a) proceeded in a living manner with moderate activities, whereas the imidazolidin-2-iminato analogues, CpTiCl 2[1,3-R 2(CH 2N) 2CN] (R = tBu, Ph, 2,6-Me 2C 6H 3), afforded a mixture of copolymer and homopolymers or exhibited negligible activity under the same conditions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
