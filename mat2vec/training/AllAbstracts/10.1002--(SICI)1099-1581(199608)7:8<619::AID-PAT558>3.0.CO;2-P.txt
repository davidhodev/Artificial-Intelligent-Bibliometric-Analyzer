A series of polymer-supported RCpCpTiCl2 (Cp=η5 - C5H5; RCp=η5 - RC5H4) has been prepared and reduced by i-C3H7MgBr in situ, then used as catalysts in hydrogenation of styrene, isomerization of 1,5-cyclooctadiene and 1,5-hexadiene, and reduction of carbonyl compounds. In some cases, the introduction of a polymer ligand on the Cp ring restricts the aggregation of active sites and the formation of the inactive dimer of the titanocene species, and results in an increase of activity. Regeneration of polymer-supported titanocene catalysts was performed and the results are presented and briefly discussed.
