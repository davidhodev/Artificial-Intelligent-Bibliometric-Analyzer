A new mono-substituted titanocene, (η5-cyclopentadienyl) [η5-(1-(4-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexyl) cyclopentadienyl]dichlorotitanium (I), has been prepared via a novel modified synthesis, and its X-ray crystal structure has been determined. It crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with cell constants a = 0.968 0(5) nm, b = 1.284 6(5) nm, c = 1.694 4(6) nm, Z = 4, R = 0.066. The I/methylaluminoxane (MAO) catalyst system produces at different polymerization temperatures either an isotactic or a syndiotactic polypropylene, both of which have the combined influence of enantiomorphic-site control and chain-end control, or an atactic polypropylene controlled by Bernoullian propagation mechanism. © 1995.
