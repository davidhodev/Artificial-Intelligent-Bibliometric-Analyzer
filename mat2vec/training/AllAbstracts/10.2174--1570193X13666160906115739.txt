The cyclopolymerization of α, ω-dienes performs as an efficient method to obtain the cyclopolyolefins, which usually exhibit remarkable properties, such as high transparency, good mechanical properties, high glass transition temperature, etc.. Moreover, incomplete cyclopolymerization of α, ω-dienes affords the polymers bearing pendant vinyl groups, which can be modified by post-polymerization modification strategy to generate the functional polymers. Therefore, polymerization of α, ω-dienes has attracted extensive attention in both industrial and academic researches during recent decades. Through years of development, numerous single-site metal catalysts for coordination polymerization of α, ω-dienes have been reported, concerning group 3 metals, group 4 metals and some late transition metals. So, the aim of this review is to highlight these single-site metal catalysts which are used for coordination polymerization of α, ω-dienes.
