A new bis(indenyl)zirconocene bearing a pendant Si-Cl anchor has been grafted onto MCM-41, SBA-15, MCM-48 and a disordered mesoporous silica for the polymerisation of ethylene and propylene, producing polymers with very high molecular weights, low polydispersities and, in the case of polypropylene, higher levels of isotacticity than obtainable with analogous homogeneous systems.
