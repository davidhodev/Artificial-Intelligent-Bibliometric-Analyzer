CH2=CHCH2CpTiCl3 (1), CH2=CHCH2CH2CpTiCl3 (2) and CH3CH2CH3CpTiCl3 (3) have been synthesized and characterized. The influence of the alkenyl substituent groups on the catalyst activities in the syndiotactic polymerization of styrene was investigated. The catalyst activities decreased in the order CH2=CHCH2CH2CpTiCl3 > CH3CH2CH2CH2CpTiCl3 > CH3CH2CH2CpTiCl3 > CH2=CHCH2CpTiCl3 (Cp=C5H4). By using complex 1, the dependence of the activity on the concentration of methylaluminoxane, triisobutylaluminum and diisobutylaluminum hydride was investigated.
