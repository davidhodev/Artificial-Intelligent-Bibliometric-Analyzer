New examples of chiral C2-symmetric zirconocenes of low stereoselectivity are presented. Zirconenes 1 and 2, upon activation with methylalumoxane, produce amorphous polypropylenes with acceptable molecular weights at practical polymerization temperatures and mmmm pentad values between 15 and 30%. Non-bonded interaction analysis by Molecular Mechanics accounts for the low enantioselectivity of 1 and 2, and predicts the isospecificity of the rac-H2C(2-Me-3-iPr-1-Ind)2ZrR+ catalyst.
