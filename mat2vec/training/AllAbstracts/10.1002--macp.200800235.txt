Polycarbosilanes exhibit desirable physiochemical properties such as high thermal stability, elastomeric behavior, diverse functional group tolerance, electronic delocalization, and ease of synthesis. New ceramic precursors, fire-retardant materials, and flexible conducting polymers have been created using polycarbosilanes. Catalytic hydrosilylation provides a convenient synthetic route to these materials. With its tolerance of many functional groups, catalytic hydrosilylation offers one-step syntheses of both aliphatic and olefinic polymers and dendrimers whose electronic properties can be tuned selectively. Copolymerization of conjugated diynes with compounds that contain the silole chromophore offers a route to new luminescent materials that have been applied to the detection of explosives and may be promising organic light-emitting diode materials. An important feature of the silole materials is the Lewis acidity at silicon, which offers a function not often present in organic polymers. Â© 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.
