The origin of the syndiotactic selectivity in propene polymerization of a typical bridged fluorenyl-amido catalyst, namely [Me2Si(3,6-di-tert-butyl-9-fluorenyl)(Ntert-buty])] TiCl2 (1), activated with methylaluminoxane or [HMe2N(C6H5)][B(C6 F5)4]/Al(i-butyl)3, was investigated by means of 150 MHz 13C NMR spectroscopic microstructural polymer analysis. The asymmetric induction was traced unambiguously to enantiotopic-sites control. Compared with the better-known cyclopentadienyl-fluorenyl ansa-zirconocenes, 1 turned out to be almost identically enantioselective (in agreement with computer modeling), but less stereoselective because of a higher propensity to undergo site epimerization. This results in a chain microstructure with large predominance of m over mm stereodefects, deceptively similar to that of syndiotactic poly(propylene) produced under chain-end control.
