Mechanism of copolymerization of ethylene and norbornene (NBE) catalyzed by half-titanocene complexes bearing o-di(phenyl)phosphanylphenolate ligands have been studied via density functional theory (DFT). Geometry optimization for catalysts and active species indicated that although this series of half-titanocene complexes have two kinds of structures which are four-coordinated and five-coordinated, they all have similar cationic active species structures in the present of cocatalyst. In polymerization, the olefin coordination insertion reaction will initiate from the trans position to the O atom of active species. Energy profiles and reaction-rate calculations results indicated that the insertion of ethylene into the Ti-Me bond process is obviously difficult than the insertion of ethylene into the Ti-Et bond process, lead to the conclusion that the chain initialization process is the rate-determining step of the ethylene homopolymerization. On the contrary, the chain initialization process of norbornene homopolymerization is much more easy, but the insertion of norbornene into the Ti-NBE bond process is very difficult due to the larger steric bulk of norbornene. For the Et/NBE copolymerization, the chain initialization process is relatively easy by the presence of NBE monomer, then the ethylene and fewer norbornene can insert into the polymer chain conti- nuously. That is the main reason for why these half-titanocene complexes displayed excellent ability to ethylene/NBE copolymerization in experimental investigations, while they only exhibited low activities for ethylene homopolymerization.
