A magnesium chloride supported zirconocene catalyst was synthesized using a soluble tetrahy-drofuran complex of magnesium chloride. The supported catalyst polymerizes ethylene with high activities in the presence of methylaluminoxane. The siginificant feature of the supported catalyst is that it polymerizes ethylene even at temperature as high as 100°C at low Al/Zr ratios. The polymer molecular weights obtained using supported catalyst are found to be higher compared to the unsupported catalyst. The molecular weight distribution index is in the range of 2.0-2.5. The active site concentration of the supported catalyst was found to be five times lower than that of the unsupported catalyst. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, D-69451 Weinheim 1999.
