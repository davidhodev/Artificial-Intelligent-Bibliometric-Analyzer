Organotin polyethers containing the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol have been made in moderate yield with chain lengths ranging from 20 to 200 repeat units employing the interfacial polycondensation procedure. Infrared spectroscopy shows the absence of the O-H group and formation of the Sn-O linkage consistent with the formation of the polyether. F-MALDI MS results are consistent with the presence of organotin-containing fragmentation clusters containing one and two tin atoms and ion fragments up to about 30 units long. The polymers all show moderate to good inhibition of a group of cancer cell lines including colon, breast and prostrate cell lines. Many of them show significant CI 50 values showing a preference to inhibit the cancer cell lines in preference to the normal cell lines. Â© 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
