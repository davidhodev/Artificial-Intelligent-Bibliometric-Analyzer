A new polymer-supported metallocene catalyst has been prepared. The polymer-supported metallocene displayed considerably high activity in ethylene polymerization, the highest being 3.62x10 7 gPE/molZrÂ·h, the molecular weight of the polyethylene produced was Mn = 1.29x10 5 , about 3-4 times those of corresponding homogeneous zirconocenes. The polymer-supported metallocene keeps the characteristics of homogeneous metallocene catalysts, and offers some features,such as adaptable to gas phase and slurry processes; easy to prepare in low cost; relatively high activity and lower MAO/Zr ratio; lower inorganic residues in the polyolefins as compared to cases of SiO 2 Al 2 O 3 or MgCl 2 ; unitary active structure, no complex surface as with SiO 2 ; good control of morphology of the resulting polymer.
