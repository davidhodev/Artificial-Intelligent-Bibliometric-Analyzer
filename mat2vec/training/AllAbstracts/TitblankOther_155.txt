Polysilanes are polymers of Si-catenated backbone and each silicon atombares two organic side groups. The sigma-electrons of the Si-Si bondsdelocalize over the long range of the backbone (sigma-conjugation) resultingin unusual physical properties such as strong absorption at 300-400 nm andefficient fluorescence in the ultraviolet region, high conductivity upondoping with oxidants, high photoconductivity and high NOL. Polysilaneshave, therefore, been studied as a photoconductor, emitting material and/orcarrier transporting materials of LEDs, photoresists, and photo-inducedradical initiators. Organic side groups control the conformation of the mainchain which controls the conjugation efficiency. The conformation ofpolysilanes is sensitive to the circumstances of the polymer and, thus, bringsabout various chromotropisms such as thermo-, piezo, electro-, iono- andsolvato-chromisms.
