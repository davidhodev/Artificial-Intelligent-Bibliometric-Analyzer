The meso ansa zirconocene with dimethylsilyl bridge, activated by methylalumoxane, catalyses the ethylene polymerization, producing ethyl-branched polyethylene. With respect to the polymers obtained with the previously investigated meso zirconocenes, we have found higher branching amount and lower molecular weight. The rapid β-H transfer from the growing chain to the coordinated monomer could account for both these features of the polymer. The investigation on the structural parameters of the complex, through X-ray diffraction analysis, and on the electrophilicity of the cationic center, through NMR experiments, suggests, as a possible rationalization of this behavior, the obstruction in the inward site. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.
