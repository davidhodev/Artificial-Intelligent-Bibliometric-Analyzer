A new dinuclear titanocene complex [(CH3C5H4) TiCl2]2 [C5H4CH2CH2 OCH2CH2C5H4] (A) was synthesized and characterized by elementary analysis and l H-NMR spectrometry. In combination with the cocatalyst of Al(Et)3, methylaluminoxane (MAO) and Al(i-Bu)3, A was active to initiate methyl methacrylate (MMA) bulk and solution polymerization. The influences of cocatalyst, reaction time and temperature on polymerization were studied in detail. The result showed that Al(i-Bu)3 was the best cocatalyst. In combination with cocatalyst of Al(i-Bu)3, under the polymerization conditions of molar ratio of MMA to A 1500, molar ratio of Al(i-Bu)3 to A 20, 60°C, reaction time 20 h, the conversion of MMA and the viscosity average molecular weight of PMMA of bulk polymerization were 98.6% and 7.87 × 105 repectively; under the polymerization conditions of molar ratio of MMA to A 1500, molar ratio of Al(i-Bu)3 to A 20, 80°C, reaction time 15 h, the conversion of MMA and the viscosity average molecular weight of PMMA of solution polymerization were 77.3% and 3.24 × 105 respectively. The molecular weight distribution (MWD) of PMMA was 5.0-7.0.
