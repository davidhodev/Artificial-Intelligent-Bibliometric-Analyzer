© 2019 Elsevier B.V.A series of novel bis(imino)pyridine cobalt(II) chlorides, LCoCl2, with the bis(imino)pyridine ligands bearing one or several electron-withdrawing substituents (F, Cl, Br, CF3) at the aniline moieties, have been prepared and characterized. In the presence of methylalumoxane (MAO), these complexes have demonstrated high ethylene oligo- and polymerization activity (up to 1.8·107 g products∙(mol Co)−1 h−1 bar−1), affording products ranging from 1-butene and Z,E-2-butenes to strictly linear low-molecular-weight (Mn ∼ 300…700) polyethylene. The dependence of the reaction outcome on the ligand structure is discussed.
