(Chemical Equation Presented) Not a catalyst killer: In the reaction of 2 with B(C6F5)3, a nucleophilic aromatic substitution with C-F bond cleavage leads to the unexpected difluoride 1. Although the formation of Zr-F species during olefin polymerization by [Cp′2ZrR]+[RB(C6F5) 3]- (Cp′ = substituted or unsubstituted η5-cyclopentadienyl; R = Me, H) catalysts is often described as a deactivation, the catalyst precursor 2 can be regenerated from 1 through treatment with iBu2AlH. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
