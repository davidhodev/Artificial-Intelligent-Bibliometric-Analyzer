1-n-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroaluminate ([BMIM]+[AlCl4]-) was applied to biphasic ionic liquid/hexane ethylene polymerisation as a medium of the Cp2TiCl2 titanocene catalyst activated by alkylaluminium compounds (MAO, AlEt2Cl, AlEt3). The best results were obtained using AlEt2Cl. The results show that catalyst recycling, higher ethylene pressure, and greater Al/Ti molar ratio along with a greater volume of the ionic liquid phase enhance catalyst activity. The polyethylene gathered from the hexane phase is characterised primarily by its high purity. Its physical properties remain polyethylene obtained over a heterogeneous metallocene catalyst. Thus, biphasic ionic liquid polymerisation using a metallocene catalyst is possible and offers interesting technological implications. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
