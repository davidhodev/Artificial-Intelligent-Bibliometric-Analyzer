Cyclopentadienyl magnesium chloride (MgClCp) and its functionalized derivatives represent original and interesting supporting materials to heterogenize metallocene catalysts for olefin polymerizations. The synthesis of MgClCp, its functionalization, and the preparation of a catalytic system in which the ZrCl2(Flu)+ moiety is joined on the support through a cyclopentadienyl ligand are reported. This catalyst was tested in ethene polymerization, and both the catalytic activity and properties of the produced polymer were measured. Its performance was compared with that shown by the catalyst ZrCl2CpFlu employed under the same conditions for both unsupported and conventional supports, such as MgCl2. The results showed a remarkable improvement in terms of the activity and polymer properties with these heterogenized catalysts. Moreover, this system showed stability toward leaching processes and was characterized by good morphological control of the growing polymer. Finally, catalysts in which [HB(3,5-Me2pyrazolyl)3]ZrCl2+ and [HB(3,5-Me2pyrazolyl)3]ZrClOtBu+ moieties were bonded to a functionalized MgClCp- support were also synthesized and tested. The results showed that the proposed supports could be usefully used to heterogenize tailored metallocene homogeneous catalysts. In fact, new catalysts were prepared that combined the peculiar advantages of both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts and overcame the disadvantages of the latter, such as a lack of morphology and reactor fouling.
