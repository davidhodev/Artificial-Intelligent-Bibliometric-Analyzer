The future of polyolefin-based materials and the opportunities for further research and development in Ziegler-Natta catalysis are discussed. Thorough control of polymer microstructure and architecture ensured by modern olefin polymerization catalysts and processes warrants further progress in fundamental and applied research for many years to come.
