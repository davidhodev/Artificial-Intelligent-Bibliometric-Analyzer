The reactivity of group 4 zirconocene dichlorides incorporating (1-trimethylsilyl)-η5-indenyl (Me3SiInd) and η5-1-(trimethylsilyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydromdenyl (Me3SiTHI) ligands toward boron tribromide was investigated. Whereas the reaction of (Me3SiInd)CpZrCl2 (1) with BBr3 in CH2Cl2 immediately cleaved the indenyl ligand from the metal, (Me3SiTHI)CpZrCl2 (3) reacted with BBr3 in CH2Cl2 at 70°C for 2 days to obtain [1-(BrSiMe2)THI]CpZrBr2 (6) in 49% yield. The reaction of (Me3SiInd)Li (2 equiv) with ZrCl4(THF)2 afforded pure rac-(Me3-SiInd)2ZrCl2 (2) in 60% yield. Hydrogenation of (2) (50 bar, PtO2 catalyst) afforded rac-(Me3-SiTHI)2ZrCl2 (4) in 81% yield. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of 4 showed that the Zr atom lies on a crystallographic C2 axis with the C4H8 annelated rings projecting into the ZrCl2 hemisphere of the pseudotetrahedral coordination environment. The reaction of 4 with MeLi in toluene afforded rac-(Me3SiTHI)2ZrMe2 (5) in 62% yield. 1H NMR and 13C NMR analysis confirmed the rac assignment for 5. Treatment of 4 with BBr3 in CH2Cl2 at 70°C for 2 days afforded rac-[1-(BrMe2Si)THI]2ZrBr2 (7) in 78% yield. The reaction of 7 with moisture in ambient air gave the ansa-metallocene rac-[μ-O-(1-Me2SiTHI)2]ZrBr2 (8) in 97% yield. In solution, 8 showed time-averaged C2 symmetry (1H NMR); however, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis showed that 8 adopts an asymmetric conformation in which only one of the C4H8 annelated rings projects into the ZrCl2 coordination hemisphere. Neither 4 nor 8 served as a precatalyst for alumoxane-cocatalyzed, homogeneous propylene polymerization. © 1999 American Chemical Society.
