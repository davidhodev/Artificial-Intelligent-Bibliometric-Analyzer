Isotactic poly-1,2-(4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene) (poly(1,2-4-MPD)) was synthesized by a homogeneous titanium catalyst. The polymer was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), x-ray diffraction, and thermal analysis. The polymerization of 4-MPD was performed by C2-symmetric ansa-zirconocenes activated by methylaluminoxane (MAO). The results show that homogeneous titanium catalyst promotes the isospecific polymerization of 4-MPD with a high degree of stereocontrol.
