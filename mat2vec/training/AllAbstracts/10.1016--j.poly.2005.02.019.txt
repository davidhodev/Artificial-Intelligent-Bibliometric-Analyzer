Copolymers of norbornene with 1-hexene or 1-octene were prepared using the ansa-metallocene [methylene(bis(2,5-dimethylcyclopentadienyl))]zirconium dichloride (1) in the presence of MAO. The α-olefin content in the copolymer was determined by 13C NMR spectroscopy and resulted in a dramatic decrease in polymer Tg and Mw. The catalyst activity was determined to be 1.0 ± 0.1 kg (polymer)/mmol(Zr) h at 70°C. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
