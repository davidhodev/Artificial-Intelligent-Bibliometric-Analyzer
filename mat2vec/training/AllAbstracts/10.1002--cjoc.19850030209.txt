The mechanism of catalytic polymerization of acrylonitrile in the presence of titanocene dichloride under light have been investigated by UV, NMR and ESR spectroscopy. Results of photochemical reaction monitored by UV and NMR showed that titanocene dichloride (Cp2TiCl2) in dimethyl sulfoxide system can be decomposed by light irradiation to give cyclopentadiene. ESR studies show that cyclopentadienyl free radical in photopolymerization system of Cp2TiCl2‐acrylonitrile can be trapped by two kinds of spin trapping agents, phenyl‐N‐tert‐butylnitrone and 2‐methyl‐2‐nitrosopropane, respectively. Therefore, the radical mechanism of catalytic polymerization of acrylonitrile in the presence of Cp2TiCl2 under light is further confirmed.
