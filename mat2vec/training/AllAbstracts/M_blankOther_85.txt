Two new unbridged zirconocenes, bis(2,4,7-trimethyl indenyl)zirconium dichloride (Met-I) and bis(2-methyl-4,7-diethyl indenyl)zirconium dichloride (Met-II) were prepared in order to investigate the steric effects of substituents on the nature of the catalysts for the polymerization of propylene. A mixture of methyl aluminoxane (MAO) and triisobutylaluminum [Al(iBu)3)] was used as cocatalyst to activate these catalysts. The decrease in steric bulkiness of substituents at 4 and 7 positions of the indenyl ring resulted in an increase of both activity and molecular weight as well as the isotacticity.
