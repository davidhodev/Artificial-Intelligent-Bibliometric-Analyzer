We report the first successful block copolymerization of ethylene and methyl methacrylate using a zirconocene-based catalyst system. The catalyst is generated in situ from Me2C(Cp)(Ind)ZrMe2 and B(C6F5)3 in toluene. Block copolymerization is achieved via the sequential addition of the monomers, starting with ethylene. The composition of the block copolymer is shown to be dependent on the time allowed for ethylene polymerization. The solubility of the resulting polymers, NMR data and GPC measurements are discussed, and a polymerization mechanism is proposed.
