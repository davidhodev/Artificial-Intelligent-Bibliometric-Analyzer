The copolymerization mainly of ethylene and propylene with various polar functional comonomers, using various metallocenes and the methylaluminoxane (MAO) cocatalyst, has been primarily reviewed from the perspective of the following two subjects. One is the influence of the various functional groups on the copolymerization reactions, and the properties of the resulting products; the other is the areas of future research. The functional groups have been classified into oxygen-, nitrogen-, and halogen-containing moieties; borane-containing -olefins; silanes; dienes; cyclic olefins; as well as styrene and its various derivatives. The following areassynthesis of easily soluble functional cooligomer/copolymer; products with uniform distribution of the comonomer; establishment of relation among the catalyst structure and the various steps of copolymerization (initiation, propagation, and chain termination); the degradation and stabilization study of the functional copolymers and the correlation of the same with the catalyst structure; the application of supported metallocenes to synthesize the resulting polymer; the minimization of multi-step synthesis; and the development MAO cocatalyst formulation (to improve the activity and comonomer incorporation)have been identified to be the subjects of future research, which will be of special importance to the researchers working in functional polyolefins.
