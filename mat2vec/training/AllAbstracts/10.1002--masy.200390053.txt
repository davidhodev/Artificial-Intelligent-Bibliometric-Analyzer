Metallocenes are highly active catalysts for the production of precisely designed polyolefins and engineering plastics. Especially zirconocene/methylalumoxane (MAO) catalysts and half-sandwich titanium complexes have opened a frontier in the area of new polymer synthesis and processing. The materials obtained show different microstructures, tacticities and properties compared with conventional polymers. Alternating ethene/propene polymers show lower glass transition temperatures than random copolymers. Constrained geometry catalysts are useful for the synthesis of norbornene/ethene copolymers.
