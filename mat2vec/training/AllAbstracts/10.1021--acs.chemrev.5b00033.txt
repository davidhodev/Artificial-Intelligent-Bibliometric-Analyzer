A study was conducted to demonstrate the use of discrete cationic complexes for ring-opening polymerization (ROP) catalysis of cyclic esters and epoxides. It was demonstrated that in the majority of cases a single reactive nucleophilic group was initially attached to the metal center, and only one polymer chain was generated per metal center. It was seen that discrete cationic metal complexes acted as Lewis acids that triggered the cationic ROP of epoxides.
