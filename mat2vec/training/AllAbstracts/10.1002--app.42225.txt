© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.A series of novel nonmetallocene catalysts [N, O, P] with diphenyl phosphoroso ligands were synthesized by the treatment of phthaldialdehyde, substituted phenols, chlorodiphenyl phosphine with metal halides of TiCl<inf>4</inf> and ZrCl<inf>4</inf>. The catalyst microstructure was characterized by <sup>1</sup>H NMR and EA. After activated by methylaluminoxane (MAO), these [N, O, P] catalysts were utilized to catalyze the polymerization of ethylene and the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-octene. The results indicated that the obtained catalysts were highly efficient for ethylene polymerization and ethylene/1-octene copolymerization. Structures and properties of the obtained polymers were measured by WAXD, DSC, GPC, and <sup>13</sup>C NMR. The results indicated that polyethylene catalyzed by Cat.3 possessed the highest weight-average molecular weight of 1.025 × 10<sup>6</sup> g/mol and the highest melting point of 136.3°C. The copolymer of ethylene/1-octene catalyzed by Cat.1 exhibited the highest 1-octene incorporation content of 0.63 mol %.
