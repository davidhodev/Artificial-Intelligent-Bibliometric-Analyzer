Long-chain branch polyethylene was prepared by homopolymerization of ethylene over two novel mono-titanocene catalyst systems, namely Cp*TiOC6H 4Cl3MAO (CatI), where Cp* was 5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl and MAO was methylaluminoxane, and [Cp* Ti OC6H4Cl3MAO (Cat II). 13C NMR indicated that branched chain polyethylene with long chain branches (carbon number more than 6) was only synthesized on Cat I, while polyethylene with methyl pendants and long chain branch was prepared over Cat II. Raising polymerization temperature and n(Al) : n(Ti) resulted in high branching degree of polymer. For Cat II, 2,1-insertions increased with increasing of polymerization temperature, and then polymer of high methyl pendant content were obtained. DSC analysis showed that polyethylene with higher branching degree had lower melting point when relative molecular masses of the polymers were approximate.
