Two series of new dinuclear organo-rare-earth-metal alkyl complexes supported by 2-amidate-functionalized indolyl ligands with different haptic modes were synthesized and characterized. The treatment of [RE(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 3 (THF) 2 ] with 1 equiv. of 2-(2,6- i Pr 2 C 6 H 3 NHC═O)C 8 H 5 NH (H 2 L 1 ) and 2-(2- t BuC 6 H 4 NHC═O)C 8 H 5 NH (H 2 L 2 ) in toluene yielded the dinuclear organo-rare-earth-metal alkyl complexes {[η 1 :(μ 2 -η 1 :η 1 )-L 1 ]RE(CH 2 SiMe 3 )(THF) 2 } 2 [RE = Gd (1a), Dy (1b), Y (1c), Er (1d), and Yb (1e)] and {[η 1 :(μ 2 -η 1 :η 1 ):η 1 -L 2 ]RE(CH 2 SiMe 3 )(THF) 2 } 2 [RE = Gd (2a), Dy (2b), Y (2c), Er (2d), and Yb (2e)] in good yields. When [RE(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 3 (THF) 2 ] were treated with 2 equiv. of H 2 L 1 or H 2 L 2 in THF, the dinuclear organo-rare-earth-metal complexes {(η 1 :η 1 -HL)[η 1 :(μ 2 -η 1 :η 1 ):η 1 -L]RE(THF)} 2 (1ca: RE = Y, L = L 1 ; 2ea: RE = Yb, L = L 2 ) were obtained. The complexes could react with small organic molecules such as N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), phenyl isocyanate, N-methylallylamine, phenylacetylene, pyridine, N-phenylimidazole, or 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) to yield a series of new complexes with different reactivity patterns along with the reported rare-earth-metal alkyl complexes. In the presence of cocatalysts, these dinuclear organo-rare-earth-metal alkyl complexes could initiate isoprene polymerization with high activity (100% conversion of 2000 equiv. of isoprene in 12 h), yielding polymers with high regioselectivity (1,4 polymers up to 96.1%).
