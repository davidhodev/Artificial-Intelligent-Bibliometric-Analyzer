The effect of the structure and surface properties of support material on metallocene (zirconocene chloride) adsorption and catalyst activity in ethene polymerization was studied. Commercial Grace silica, mesoporous silicate, MCM-41, and aluminium-modified MCM-41 were used as supports. The highest amount of zirconocene dichloride was adsorbed on Al-modified MCM-41 (Si/Al = 32), providing the most reactive sites for attachment of the active component on the support surface. The 13C-CPMAS NMR studies proved that Cp2ZrCl2 is bound to the support surface. Also the highest activity in ethene polymerization was obtained using this support. Â© 1999 Academic Press.
