Polyethersulfone has been used as the support to anchor TiCl4 or Cp2TiCl2 through dative 'O-Ti' bond. The supported complexes in combination with methylaluminoxane are effective ethylene polymerization catalysts. The polyethylene made by the supported catalysts, especially the titanocene-derived catalyst, has low polydispersity indicating single site character.
