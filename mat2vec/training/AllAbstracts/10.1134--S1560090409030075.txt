The free-radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate in the presence of chlorine-containing complexes of Fe(III) with 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3′, 5′-di-tert-butylphenyl)porphyrin and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3′- butoxyphenyl)porphyrin, as well as in the presence of the acetate complex of Co(III) 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3′,5′-di-tert-butylphenyl)porphyrin, has been investigated. The kinetic features of the process and the molecular mass characteristics of polymers are studied, and a feasible polymerization mechanism is proposed. © 2009 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.
