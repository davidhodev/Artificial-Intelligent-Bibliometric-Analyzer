The constrained geometry complexes {3,6-tBu2C13H6 SiMe2NtBu}TiCl2 (X = Cl, 1; Me, 2), in combination with MAO or borane activators, have been investigated in the copolymerization of propylene with styrene at 25-60 °C, 1-5 atm. Both systems were found to give styrene-propylene (PP-PS) copolymers with up to 24 mol% of styrene incorporated and moderate molecular weights (Mw = 14,000-88,000; Mw/Mn = 1.58-2.32). Addition of some ethylene to the styrene-propylene feed improves the catalytic polymerization activity. The PP-PS copolymers feature a syndiotactic-enriched polypropylene microstructure (r > 92%), with randomly distributed single styrene and/or short polystyrene units. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.
