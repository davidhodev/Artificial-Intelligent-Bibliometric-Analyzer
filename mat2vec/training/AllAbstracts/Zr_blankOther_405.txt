Reactions of Cp2Zr(thf)(η2-Me3SiC2SiMe 3) (1) and rac-(ebthi)Zr(η2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) (2; ebthi = 1,2-ethylene-1,1′-bis(η5-tetrahydroindenyl)) with 2-vinylpyridine lead, under elimination of the alkyne, to the five-membered azazirconacycles, which are best described as 1-zircona-2-azacyclopent-3-enes (1-azadiene complexes). One of these complexes couples with ethylene to yield a stable α-2-pyridyl-substituted zirconacyclopentane and reacts in a 2:1 ratio with water to yield a β-2-pyridyl-substituted dimeric σ-ethylzirconoxane. In the reaction of the 2-derived complex with HBF4, rac-[1,2-ethylene-1,1′-bis(η5-tetrahydroindenyl)]zirconium difluoride was obtained. Both 1-zircona-2-azacyclopent-3-enes insert carbon dioxide to give structurally different binuclear carbonate-bridged complexes.
