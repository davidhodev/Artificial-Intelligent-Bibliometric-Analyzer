Ansa-Cyclohexyl-bis(4,5,6,7-tertrahydro-1-indenyl) zirconium dichloride (5) was used as catalyst for propylene and ethylene polymerization together with methyl aluminoxane (MAO) as the cocatalyst. Isotactic polypropylene (PP) was obtained with the highest activity of 6.37×107g PP (molZr) -1h-1. The meso-meso (mmmmm) pentads sequence content of PP was determined by 13C NMR spectroscopy. The dependence of the microstructure on the reaction temperature and the Al/Zr molar ratio was examined and the catalytic activity of complex 5 was compared with that of the similar ansa-zirconocene 3. The high activity of the new zirconocene 5 for propylene isospectic polymerization at high temperature (60 °C) is the result of its unique bridged-group structure. Complex 5/MAO displays also high catalytic activity of 0.46×106 to 9.87×106g PE(molZr)-1h-1 in the homo-polymerization of ethylene. The visometric molecular weight of PE ranges from 0.97×104 to 11.16×104 g•mol-1 under the given conditions.13C NMR spectroscopy analysis proves the PE to be linear polyethylene (LPE). © 2007 Wuhan University of Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
