The preparation of polyethylene with a broad distribution of molecular weight was studied using Cp2TiCl2 or Cp2ZrCl2 incorporated with (Me or t-BuCp)2SmCl and methylaluminoxane (MAO) employed as co-catalyst. The influence of parameters on the polymerization, such as molar ratio of MAO/catalyst, catalyst concentration, temperature and time have been studied in detail. It was found that the polyethylene had higher molecular weight by using Cp2TiCl2 or Cp2ZrCl2 catalytic system combined with (t-BuCp)2SmClas compared with the system combined with (MeCp)2SmCl. Meanwhile, the polyethylene obtained from (t-BuCp)2SmCl-contained catalytic system had high polydispersity (PDI>3.5).
