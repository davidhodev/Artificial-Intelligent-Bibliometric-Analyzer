We synthesized new electropolymerizable [Ru(bpy)nL m](PF6)2 (L = 4,4 bis(3-pyrrol-1-ylpropyloxy) bipyridyl) derivatives. The introduction of electron donating ether groups in the bipyridine ligand induced a negative shift of the Ru(III)/(II) redox couple. The electrochemical behavior of complex Ru1 (n = 2, m = 1) and complex Ru2 (n = 0, m = 3) were compared using platinum and Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT) electrode. Higher polymerization yields and surface concentrations were obtained at MWCNT electrodes. Furthermore, MWCNT electrodes increase polymer permeability and decrease the charge trapping phenomenon involved in the oxidation and reduction of the polypyrrolic skeleton of the Ru(II) functionalized polymers.
