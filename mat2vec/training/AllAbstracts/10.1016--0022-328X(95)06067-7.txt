The first tin-bridged zirconocenes [(CH3)2Sn(C5H4) 2]Zr[N(CH3)2]2 (3) and Sn{(C5H4)2Zr{N(CH3) 2]2}2 (4) have been obtained from tetrakis(dimethylamido)zirconium (1) and the CH-acidic ligands (CH3)2Sn(C5H5)2 (2a) and Sn(C5H5)4 (2b), respectivily. The ansa-zirconocene 3 is formed in quantitative yield, 4 in 81% yield. The bi- and trimetallic complexes 3 (ZrSn) and 4 (Zr2Sn) polymerize ethylene more efficiently than the well-known silicon-bridged analogue of 3 (Si instead of Sn).
