A homogeneous dispersion of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS) is obtained by a simple solution dispersion procedure. MWCNTs were dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), and sPS/MWCNT composites are prepared by mixing sPS/NMP solution with MWCNT/NMP dispersion. The composite structure is characterized by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The effect of MWCNTs on sPS crystallization and the composite properties are studied. The presence of MWCNTs increases the sPS crystallization temperature, broadens the crystallite size distribution and favors the formation of the thermodynamically stable β phase, whereas it has little effect on the sPS γ to α phase transition during heating. By adding only 1.0 wt.% pristine MWCNTs, the increase in the onset degradation temperature of the composite can reach 20 °C. The electrical conductivity is increased from 10-10∼-16 (neat sPS) to 0.135 S m-1 (sPS/MWCNT composite with 3.0 wt.% MWCNT content). Our findings provide a simple and effective method for carbon nanotube dispersion in polymer matrix with dramatically increased electrical conductivity and thermal stability. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
