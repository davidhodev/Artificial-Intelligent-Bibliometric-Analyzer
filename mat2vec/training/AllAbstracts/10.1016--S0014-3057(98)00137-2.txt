The syndiotactic polymerization of styrene with methoxyethylcyclopentadienyl titanium trichloride (1), 2-tetrahydrofurfurylcyclopentadienyl titanium trichloride (2), cyclopentadienyl dichloroisopropoxy titanium (3) and methylaluminoxane was studied. Substituted half-sandwich titanocene (1, 2) exhibited low activity and syndiotacticity, while the alkoxy derivative of cyclopentadienyl titanium trichloride exhibited high activity and syndiotacticity. Possible reasons for the differences are discussed. Â© 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
