A novel carrier of ultradispersed diamond black powder (UDDBP) was used to support metallocene catalyst. Al2O3 was also used as carrier in order to compare with UDDBP. Supported catalysts for ethylene polymerization were synthesized by two different reaction methods. One way was direct immobilization of the metallocene on the support, the other was adsorption of MAO onto the support followed by addition of the metallocene. Four supported catalysts Cp2ZrCl2/UDDBP, Cp2ZrCl2/Al2O3, Cp2ZrCl2/MAO/UDDBP and Cp2ZrCl2/Al2O3/MAO were obtained. The content of the zirconium in the supported catalyst was determined by UV spectroscopy. The activity of the ethylene polymerization catalyzed by supported catalyst was investigated. The influence of Al/Zr molar ratio and polymerization temperature on the activity was discussed. The polymerization rate was also observed. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
