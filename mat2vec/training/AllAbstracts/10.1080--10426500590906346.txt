Substituted metallocene ligands containing cyclopentadiene ring fused to either selenophene or benzo[b]tellurophene were prepared following methods previously developed for analogs containing sulfur. 5-Methyl-4,5-dihydro- cyclopenta[b]-selenophen-6-one (2) and 3-Methyl-3,4-dihydro-benzo[b] cyclopenta[d]telluraphen-2-one (7) (major isomers) were prepared by polyphosphoric acid catalyzed Friedel-Crafts acylation / Nazarov cyclization of methacrylic acid onto selenophene and respectively benzo[b]tellurophene. Following reduction of the ketone to alcohol, then dehydration, the chalcogen-containing cyclopentadiene olefins were prepared. The olefins were deprotonated with n-butyllithium followed by either bridging with dichlorodimethylsilane, deprotonation and metallation, or deprotonation and direct metallation. In this manner, isomeric mixtures of -rac/-meso dimethylsilanediylbis(η5-5-Methyl-cyclopenta[b]selenophenyl) zirconium dichloride (5) Bis(η5-2-methyl-cyclopenta[b][1] benzotelluraphenyl)zirconium dichloride (9) were prepared and characterized. Complexes formed active olefin polymerization catalyst when activated with methylalumoxane. Polymerization results with ethylene and propylene are included. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Inc.
