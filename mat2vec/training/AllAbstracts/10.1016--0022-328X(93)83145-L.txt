The mono- and bis-cyclopentadienyl compounds 1-(Cp″)-4-(CH3)C6H4 (1) and 1, 4-(Cp″)2C6H4 (2) (Cp″ = 3,4-dimethylcyclopenta-1,3-diene-1-yl) have been synthesized. The reactions of the lithium salts of 1 and 2 with CpZrCl3 · dme (dme = dimethoxyethane) and Cp*ZrCl3(CP* C5(CH3)5) yielded the mono- and bi-nuclear bridged zirconocenes 1-(Cp″ZrCpCl2)-4-(CH3)C6H4 (3), 1,4-(Cp″ZrCpCl2)2C6H4 (4) and 1,4-(Cp″ZrCp*Cl2)2C6H4 (5). When activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO), the mono- and bi-nuclear zirconocenes 3 and 4 catalyse the polymerization of propene. The influence of the catalyst composition on the polymerization kinetics and molecular weight is discussed. © 1993.
