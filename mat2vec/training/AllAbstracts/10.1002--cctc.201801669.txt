Double deprotonation of the respective NHC precursor ligand and further reaction with one equivalent of TiCl4⋅THF2 leads to the formation of complexes Ti-1–Ti-3 of the general formula TiCl3(NHC-R-O)(THF), (NHC-R-O=1-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-3-(2-O-phenyl)-4,5-dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene, 1-(mesityl)-3-(2-O-phenyl)-4,5-dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene, 1-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-3-(2-O-phenyl)-4,5-dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene). Furthermore, these Ti-(NHC-R-O) trichloride complexes can be reacted with the bulky aryloxo ligands 2,6-ditBu-4-methylphenolate and 2,2’,4,4’,6,6’-hexa-iPr-terphenoxide, respectively, to form the mixed titanium (aryloxo)(NHC-R-O) dichloride pre-catalysts Ti-4–Ti-6. Single-crystal X-ray structures of complexes Ti-1, Ti-5 and Ti-6 are presented. Depending on the aryloxo ligand used, the complexes possess either a trigonal bipyramidal or square pyramidal ligand sphere. The propensity of Ti-1, Ti-4–Ti-6 to homopolymerize ethylene and to copolymerize ethylene with norborn-2-ene (NBE) and cyclopentene (CPE), respectively, was investigated and access to high-molecular weight (co-)polymers with such complexes is disclosed.
