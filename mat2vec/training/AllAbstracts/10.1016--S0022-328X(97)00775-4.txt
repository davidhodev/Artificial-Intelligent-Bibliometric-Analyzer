A series of zirconocene complexes of formula Cp 2 ZrMe 2-n L n where Cp = C 5 H - 5 , Me = methyl, L = pyrazolyl, bis(N,N′-phenylformamidinato), or substituted aryloxide and n = 1,2, were synthesized by reaction of Cp 2 ZrCl 2 and Cp 2 ZrMe 2 with LiL or HL, respectively. The structures of Cp 2 Zr(2,6-OC 6 H 3 Me 2 ) 2 , Cp 2 Zr(2,4,6-OC 6 H 2 Me 3 ) 2 and Cp 2 ZrMe{CH(NC 6 H 5 ) 2 } were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The complexes demonstrate appreciable activity for ethylene polymerization when used as cocatalysts with methylaluminoxane and dimethylanilinium tetrafluorophenylborate. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.
