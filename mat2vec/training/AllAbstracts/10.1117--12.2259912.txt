Â© 2017 SPIE.In the dense gel that is the intracellular matrix forming part of living cells electrochemical reactions take place provoking the interchange of ions and water with the surroundings. Systems containing conducting polymers mimic this feature of biological organs. In particular, conducting polymers are being studied as dual sensing-actuating reactive materials giving new multifunctional sensing-actuators, which allow the construction and theoretical description of artificial proprioceptive devices. Here films of polypyrrole/dodecyl benzene sulfonate (PPy-DBS) coating a platinum electrode were submitted to potential sweeps at different sweep rates in order to explore if the polymer reaction senses the working electrochemical conditions. The effective consumed electrical energy per cycle follows a fast decrease when the scan rate increases described by the addition of two exponential sensing functions. Moreover, the variation of the hysteresis from the parallel charge/potential loop with the scan rate is also described by the addition of two exponential functions. In both cases the exponential functions fitting results at low scan rates are related to reaction-driven conformational movements of the polymer chains, being closer to biochemical conformational and allosteric sensors. The second exponential functions fitting results at high scan rates are related to diffusion kinetic control, being closer to present electrochemical sensors.
