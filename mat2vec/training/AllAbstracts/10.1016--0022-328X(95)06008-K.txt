Four possible structures of C2-symmetric bis(fluorenyl)zirconium complexes are presented. Three bis(fluorenyl)zirconocene complexes have been prepared and tested for the polymerization of propylene and ethylene. rac/meso-Dichloro[Î·10-(1,2-ethanediyl)bis (7H-benzo[c]fluoren-7-ylidene)zirconium (10/10 *) seems to be the most active polymerization catalyst for ethylene.
