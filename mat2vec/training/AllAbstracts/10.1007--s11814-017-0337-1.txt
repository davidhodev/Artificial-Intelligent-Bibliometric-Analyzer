Â© 2018, Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers, Seoul, Korea. Three types of nanoporous silica support were modified by methylaluminoxane MAO and characterized by using BET, SEM, XRD and TGA. Dimethylsilyl (N-tert-butylamido)(tetramethylcyclopentadienyl) titanium dichlride was synthesized and immobilized on modified support. The prepared complex was then used as a reactive catalyst for ethylene polymerization. The effect of immobilization conditions on catalyst performance was studied. The results revealed elevated temperature grafting, decrease in precatalyst loading. Also, increasing of immobilization reaction time showed an increase in activity to 130 Kg poly/mol Ti.h.bar. The effects of polymerization temperature and [Al]/[Ti] ratio on the catalyst behavior, namely activity and bulk density, were investigated. According to the results, the activity of single-site catalyst depends on condition of immobilization and structure of nanoporous silica support.
