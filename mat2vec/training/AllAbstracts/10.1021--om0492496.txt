The racemic isomers of C 2H 4(1-Ind) 2TiCl 2 and Me 2Si(2-Me-Benzind) 2TiMe 2 were synthesized and structurally characterized. Reactions of these and related ansa-titanocene complexes with methylaluminoxane or with the cationizing reagent [CPh 3] +[B(C 6F 5) 4] -Ak-Me 6 were monitored by UV/vis, 1H NMR, and EPR methods. Under conditions approaching those typically used in olefin polymerizations, heterobinuclear cations of the type [Dian Ti IV(μ-Me) 2AlMe 2] + (with Dian = bridged ligand dianion) dominate in each of these reaction systems, which catalyze the polymerization of propene at temperatures below ambient. Above 0°C, these cations are reduced, mainly to neutral heterobinuclear species DianTi III(μ-Me) 2AlMe 2, which appear to be inactive with regard to polymerization catalysis. In the absence of monomer, the main reducing agent appears to be ethyl aluminum admixtures in Al 2Me 6. Addition of monomer increases the rate of reduction rather drastically, probably via formation of titanium hydrides. © 2005 American Chemical Society.
