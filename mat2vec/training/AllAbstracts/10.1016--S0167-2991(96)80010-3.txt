Work in the application of metallocene-based catalysis to olefin polymers has become a research topic of growing interest in recent years. A great number of symmetric and chiral zirconocenes have been synthesized to give totally different structures of isotactic, syndiotactic, atactic or block polymers. The isotactic sequence length of polypropylene is influenced by the nature of the ligands of the metallocene. New ring or bridge substituted metallocene/methylalumoxane catalysts for the olefin polymerization are described. Â© 1996 Elsevier B.V.
