A zirconocene-ethylene complex C p2Zr(CH2 = CH2)-(PMe3) reacted with R3EX (E= Si, Ge, Sn; R = Ph or Bu; X = Cl, OE1, or OER3) to give R3EEt in high yields after hydrolysis. The reaction mixture of the ethylene complex with Bu3SnCl further reacted with phenylacetylene to give homoallyltin compounds. When the reaction mixture was treated with Ph3SnCl or Ph3GeCl instead of phenylacetylene, Ph3SnEt or Ph3GcEt was obtained in high yields after hydrolysis via the replacement of the Î²-SnBu3 moiety.
