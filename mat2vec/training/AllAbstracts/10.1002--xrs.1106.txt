A series of metallocenes, namely, [Cp2ZrCl2], [(MeCp)2ZrCl2], KnBuCp)2ZrCl2], [((BuCp)2ZrCl2], KiBuCp)2ZrCl2], [Et(Ind)2ZrCl2], [Et(IndH4) 2ZrCl2], and [MeSi2(Ind)2ZrCl 2)] were analyzed by extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XFS). Complementary techniques, UV-vis spectroscopy and cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry, were employed to characterize the organometallic complexes. The catalysts were evaluated in ethylene polymerization, having methylaluminoxane (MAO) as the cocatalyst, and the resulting polymers were characterized by gel permeation chromatography. The structural and electronic effects caused by the coordination sphere around the metal center and their effects on the catalytic activity and polymer characteristics are discussed.
