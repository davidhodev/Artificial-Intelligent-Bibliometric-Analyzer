Ethylene polymerization was carried out using highly active metallocene catalysts (Cp 2ZrCl 2 and Cp 2TiCl 2) in combination with methylalumoxane. Titanium(IV) oxide containing 1% Mn as dopant was used as nanofillers. The influence of filler concentration, reaction temperature and pressure on the catalytic activity and polymer properties was investigated. There was a fourfold increase in the activity of zirconocene catalyst by addition of doped-titania. The morphology indicates that the doped-titania nanoparticles have a nucleus effect on the polymerization and caused a homogeneous PE shell around them. The optimum condition for polymerization was found to be 30°C. © 2012 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.
