Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.Abstract A family of group 4 metallocene complexes based on the hexamethylindenyl ligand (C9Me6H; Ind#) have been prepared and fully characterised. The complexes rac-Ind#2ZrCl2 (rac-1), meso-Ind#2ZrCl2 (meso-1), rac-Ind#2HfCl2 (rac-2), meso-Ind#2HfCl2 (meso-2) were prepared by the reaction of Ind#Li with the corresponding MCl4 (where M = Zr, Hf); and rac-Ind#2Zr(CH2Ph)2 (rac-3) was derived from rac-1 using two equivalents of potassium benzyl (KCH2Ph). All five species were characterised by NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X-ray diffraction and studied using density functional theory. The zirconocenes were tested for their activity as solution-phase ethylene polymerisation catalysts and rac-1 was found to outperform the meso-1 at most temperatures. The benzyl analogue, rac-3, peaked at more than double the activity reported for the dihalide species.
