Based on dichloride derivatives of zirconocenes with C2 symmetry and borates, active catalysts of propylene polymerization were formed on a PE polymer support with a grafted poly(acrylic acid) treated with poly(methylaluminoxane). It was shown that the nature of aluminoxane affects the activity of the catalytic system: when aluminoxane is synthesized on the support surface, the activity of the catalyst increases. The influence of the nature of zirconocene and borate on the catalytic behavior of a system containing triisobutylaluminum as a cocatalyst was studied. Variation in the polymerization conditions (liquid propylene or heptane suspension) was found not to affect the kinetics of polymerization, characterized by the steady-state rate of monomer consumption. Morphological characteristics of the polymers prepared using various catalytic systems are presented together with their molecular masses, melting temperatures, and isotacticity indices.
