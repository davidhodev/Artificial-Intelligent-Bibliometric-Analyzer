Metallocene catalysts leave a well-characterized fingerprint in the polypropene structures. Attempts to expand this catalyst-polymer correlation to ethylene-propene copolymers are presented. The 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are run on 10% solutions of the copolymers in o-dichlorobenzene (50%d2) at 130 °C, with a 12 second pulse delay and 90° pulses. Observations show that single ethylene monomers are added to regioregular propylene homopolymers, and a high level of ethylene insertion adjacent to a 2,1-propylene insertion. This means that high molecular weight C2C3 copolymers can be synthesized with the incorporation of ethylene for each regioregular insertion.
