Syndiospecific styrene (St) polymerization, catalyzed by the CpTiCl 3/methylaluminoxane (MAO) system, was investigated using two different activation procedures. The polymerization parameters included polymerization time, temperature (∼25-100°C), ratio of [Al]/[Ti] (∼100-1000), and catalyst precursor concentration (∼0.5-10.0 × 10-4 mol Ti/L). It was found that adding reactants in the order of (CpTiCl3, + MAO) + St (Injection of Styrene mode) gave much higher monomer conversion rates, higher weight-average molecular weights, and narrower molecular weight distributions than for the (St + MAO) + CpTiCl3 (Injection of Catalyst mode). The former also yielded significantly higher syndiotacticity fractions. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements showed multiple peaks exhibiting polymorphism in crystalline syndiotactic polystyrene samples. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
