Hydrooligomerizations of norbornene were carried out using C2, Cs and C2v symmetric zirconocenes with methylaluminoxane as catalysts. The structures of the hydrodimers and -trimers were investigated and correlated to the symmetry of the metallocene. The polymerization of norbornene is shown to proceed by cis-exo insertion. The mechanisms of polymerization and stereocontrol are closely related to the ones observed in the polymerization of α-olefins. Thus the C2 symmetric metallocene features erythrodiisotactic structures, while erythrodisyndiotactic products are observed in case of the Cs symmetric one. This is caused by enantiomorphic site control, while stereospecificity in the hydrooligomerization using Cp2ZrCl2 MAO is determined by chain end control mechanism. © 1995.
