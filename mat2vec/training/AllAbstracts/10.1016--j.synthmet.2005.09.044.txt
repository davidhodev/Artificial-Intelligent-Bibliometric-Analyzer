Mono-substituted acetylene monomers with a liquid crystalline (LC) group are polymerized using rhodium, iron or molybdenum complex catalysts. LC polyacetylene derivatives with number-averaged molecular weights of 4000-330000 were obtained in 5-92% yield. The LC behavior is examined by X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and polarizing optical microscopy. The polymers prepared using rhodium or iron catalyst are confirmed to assume a cis form and to undergo an irreversible isomerization to the trans form upon heating. Photo-responsive polyacetylene derivatives are successfully synthesized through the introduction of an azobenzene moiety as a mesogenic core into the side-chain, and these forms exhibit a reversible photochemical cis-to-trans isomerization of the azobenzene moiety.
