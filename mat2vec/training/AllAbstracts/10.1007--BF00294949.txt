Polymerization of ethylene and copolymerization of ethylene-propylene proceeded smoothly by using homometallic binuclear zirconium complex 1 or heterometallic binuclear zirconium-titanium complex 2/methylaluminoxane catalyst system. The molecular weight distributions of polymers obtained by the binuclear zirconium complexes were broader than that produced by mononuclear zirconium complex. Â© 1995 Springer-Verlag.
