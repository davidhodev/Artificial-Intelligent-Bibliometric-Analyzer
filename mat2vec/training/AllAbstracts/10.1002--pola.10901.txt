The polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) was investigated with tris(pentafluorophenyl)alane [Al(C 6 F 5 ) 3 ] and four metallocene imido complexes that varied in the complex symmetry/chirality, metal, and R group in the =NR moiety, as well as a zirconocene enolate preformed from the imido zirconocene and MMA. This study examined four aspects of MMA polymerization: the effects of the metallocene imido complex structure on the polymerization activity and polymer tacticity, the degree of polymerization control, the elementary reactions of the imido complex with Al(C 6 F 5 ) 3 and MMA, and the polymerization kinetics and mechanism. There was no effect of the imido complex symmetry/chirality on the polymerization stereochemistry; the polymerization followed Bernoullian statistics, producing syndiotactic poly(methyl methacrylate)s with moderate (∼70% [rr]) to high (∼91% [rr]) syndiotacticity, depending on the polymerization temperature. Polymerization control was demonstrated by the number-average molecular weight, which increased linearly with an increase in the monomer conversion to 100%, and the relatively small and insensitive polydispersity indices (from 1.21 to 1.17) to conversion. The reactions of the zirconocene imido complex with Al(C 6 F 5 ) 3 and MMA produced the parent base-free imido complex and the [2 + 4] cycloaddition product (i.e., zirconocene enolate), respectively; the latter product reacted with Al(C 6 F 5 ) 3 to generate the active zirconocenium enolaluminate. The MMA polymerization with the metallocene imido complex and the alane proceeded via intermolecular Michael addition of the enolaluminate to the alane-activated MMA involved in the propagation step.
