Ethylene is polymerized by heterobimetallic combinations of early and late transition metal catalysts. Dual combinations of zirconocenes and cationic nickel and iron catalysts with multidentate nitrogen-donor ligands are described. Reactor blends of linear and branched ethylene homopolymers are obtained. With zirconocene / nickel complex catalyst combinations, addition of hydrogen selectively reduces the molecular weight of the linear polyethylene formed by the metallocene catalyst.
