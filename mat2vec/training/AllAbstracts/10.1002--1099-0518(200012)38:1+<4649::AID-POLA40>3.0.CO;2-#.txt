A series of Me4Cp-amido complexes [η5:η1-(Me4C5)SiMe 2NR]TiCl2; R = t-Bu, 1; C6H5, 2; C6F5, 3; SO2Ph, 4; or SO2Me, 5 were prepared and investigated for olefin polymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO). X-ray crystallography of complexes 3 and 4 revealed very long Ti - N bonds relative to the bonds of 1. These complexes were employed for ethylene-styrene copolymerizations, styrene homopolymerizations, and propylene homopolymerizations in the presence of MAO. The productivities of the catalysts derived from 3-5 were much lower than the productivity of the catalyst derived from 1 for the propylene polymerizations and ethylene-styrene copolymerizations, whereas the styrene polymerization activities were much higher for the catalysts derived from 3-5 than for the catalyst derived from 1. The polymerization behavior of the catalysts derived from the metallocenes 3-5 were more reminiscent of monocyclopentadienyl titanocene CpTiX3/MAO catalysts than of CpATiX2/MAO catalysts such as 1 containing alkylamido ligands. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
