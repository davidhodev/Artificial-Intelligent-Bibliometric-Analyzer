A number of Al complexes bearing bidentate N,N-dialkylaniline-arylamido ligands, OrMo-(ArNCH2)C6H4NR 2AlMe2 (R = Me, Ar = 2,6-iPr2C 6H3, 3a; 2,6-Et2C6H3, 3b; 2,6Me2C6H3, 3c; 4-MeC6H 4, 3d; Ph, 3e; and. R = Et, Ar = 2,6iPr2C 6H3, 3f; 2,6-Me2C6H3, 3g; Ph, 3h), have been synthesized from the reaction of the corresponding free ligands, orMo-(ArNHCH2)C6H4NR2 (R = Me, Ar = 2,6-iPr2C6H3, 2a; 2,6Et 2C6H3, 2b; 2,6-Me2C 6H3, 2c; 4-MeC6H4, 2d; Ph, 2e; and R = Et, Ar = 2,6-iPr2C6H3, 2f; 2,6-Me 2C6H3, 2g, Ph, 2h), with AlMe3 (1 equiv.). All complexes were characterized by 1Hand 13C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Singlecrystal X-ray diffraction analysis of complexes 3 c and 3e revealed that these Al complexes have a distorted tetrahedral geometry around, the metal center. All complexes were found to be efficient catalysts for the ring-opening polymerization of e-caprolactone (CL) in the presence of benzyl alcohol, and complexes 3a-h catalyze the polymerization of CL in a living fashion.
