Based on the reaction between Cp2TiCl2 and substituted salicylic acids in the presence of β-cyclodextrin polymer (β-CDP), three four-coordinated titanocene complexes [(η5- C5H5)2Ti(S,O′)(OCC6H 4)•(C6H6)0.5] (1), [(η5-C5H5)2Ti{(O,O′)(3,5- Cl2-OCC6H2)}] (2) and [(η5- C5H5)2Ti{(O,O′)(3,5-(NO2) 2-OCC6H2)}] (3) were synthesized in high yields and their crystal structures have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The structure of 1 has a Monoclinic space group P21/c with a = 8.313(3) Å, b = 9.960(4) Å, c = 22.330(8) Å, β = 111.856(11)° and Z = 4. The structure of 2 has a Monoclinic space group P21/c with a = 8.0577(13) Å, b = 8.9022(14) Å, c = 21.977(4) Å, β = 96.298(3)° and Z = 4. The structure of 3 has a Triclinic space group P-1 with a = 8.1687(11) Å, b = 8.3027(11) Å, c = 12.7164(17) Å, α = 102.930(2)°, β = 100.479(2)°, γ = 95.458(2)° and Z = 2. Each of the complexes exhibits a three-dimensional framework constructed through weak interactions, which are hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking and C-H⋯π interactions. It was found that the variation of the substituted salicylate ligands affect the weak interactions as well as the specific framework structure that forms. Graphical Abstract: Three four-coordinated titanocene complexes [(η5-C 5H5)2Ti(S,O′)(OCC6H 4)•(C6H6)0.5] (1), [(η5-C5H5)2Ti{(O,O′)(3,5- Cl2-OCC6H2)}] (2) and [(η5- C5H5)2Ti{(O,O′)(3,5-(NO2) 2-OCC6H2)}] (3) were synthesized in high yields, each of the complexes exhibits a three-dimensional framework constructed through weak interactions. It was found that simple variation of the substituted salicylate ligands affect the weak interactions as well as the specific framework structure that forms. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
