The calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the experimental differences observed in the molecular weights of the polymers obtained using different zirconocene catalysts have been performed. Geometric structures and Gibbs free energy profiles were obtained using the B3LYP hybrid DFT functional and LANL2DZ basis set for all atoms. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian03 package, while thermodynamic data were calculated for 1 bar ethylene pressure and 298 K using standard statistical thermodynamic methods implemented in the Gaussian package. It was observed that the silyl-bridged bis-indenyl catalysts containing linear alkyl substituents in the 3-position of the indenyl ligand yield polyethylenes with different molecular weights depending on the alkyl chain length. The corresponding product presents a metallacycle structure and the polymer chain ejected from the catalyst.
