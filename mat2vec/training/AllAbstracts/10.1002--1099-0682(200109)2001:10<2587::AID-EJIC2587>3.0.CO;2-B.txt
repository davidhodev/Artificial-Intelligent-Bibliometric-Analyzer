The P-H-functionalized 2-(phosphanyl)ethanethiols RHPCH2-CH2SH [R = Ph (1), 2,4,6-Me3C6H2 (Mes) (2), 2,4,6-iPr3C6H2 (Tipp) (3)] were prepared by ring cleavage of ethylene sulfide with LiPHR, followed by hydrolytic workup and distillation. 1-3 react with [Cp2TiCl2] in the presence of excess NEt3 to yield a diastereomeric mixture (ratio ca. 1:1) of rac- and meso-[Cp2Ti(SCH2CH2PHR)2] [R = Ph (4), Mes (5), Tipp (6)]. 6 is not obtained in pure form. Compound 4 reacts with [Cu(CH3CN)4]BF4 to yield [Cu{P,P′-PHPhCH2CH2-SB(FH)SCH2CH 2PPh(B-P)}2]BF4 (7). 1-7 were characterized spectroscopically. 7 exhibits dynamic behavior in solution, as shown by 31P NMR spectroscopy. Crystal structure determinations were carried out on 5 and 7. In 5, both diastereomers cocrystallize in the asymmetric unit. Although the cation of 7 has six chiral centers, only the (RP,RP,RP,RP,RB,R B)/ (SP,SP,SP,SP,SB,S B) diastereomer is present in the solid state. © Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, 2001.
