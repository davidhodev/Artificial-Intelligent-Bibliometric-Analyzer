Effective catalytic systems on the basis of alkylzirconocene dichlorides and methyl - alunoxane for polymerization of ethylene and its copolymerization with other α - olefines have been studied. Some physico - chemical characteristics of synthesized polymers (ρ, Tm, MM, MMD) were studied. IR - spectroscopy, 13C NMR and X - ray analysis methods were applied.
