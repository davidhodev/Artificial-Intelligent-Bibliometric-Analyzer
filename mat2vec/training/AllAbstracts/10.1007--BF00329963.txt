The norbornene/ethene copolymerization was investigated by using two CS-symmetric ([Me2C(Fluo)(Cp)]ZrCl2III, [Ph2C(Fluo)(Cp)]ZrCl2IB) and two C2-symmetric ([Me2Si(Ind)2]ZrCl2I, [Ph2Si(Ind)2]ZrCl2II) catalysts with methylaluminoxane (MAO) as cocatalyst. This investigation focussed not only on the different polymerization behavior, like catalyst activity, but also considers the material properties of the synthesized copolymers. It was found, that the CS-symimetric catalysts are very well suitable to yield amorphous copolymers with glass transition temperatures above 180°C and molecular weights >100.000 g/mol. These copolymers could be used as potential starting materials for optical discs and fibers. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.
