[Me2C(Cp) (Ind)]ZrCl2 metallocene catalyst has been prepared and employed in a study of ethene polymerization in the presence of the cocatalyst methylaluminoxane. C1 and C2 signals are detected in the 13C NMR spectra of the resultant polymers; this reveals that the resultant polymer is a branched polyethene (polyethylene). The influence of polymerization temperature, catalyst concentration and [Al]/[Zr] ratio on catalytic activities and polymerization kinetics is investigated. A plausible mechanism for forming branched polyethene is suggested.
