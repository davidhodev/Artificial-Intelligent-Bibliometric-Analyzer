The bimodal MCM-41-supported zirconocene/dMMAO catalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity for ethylene/1-octene copolymerization compared to the unimodal one. The higher activity can be attributed to lesser support interaction. The copolymer having broader MWD was obtained with the bimodal support without any significant changes in MW and polymer microstructure as seen by 13C NMR. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
