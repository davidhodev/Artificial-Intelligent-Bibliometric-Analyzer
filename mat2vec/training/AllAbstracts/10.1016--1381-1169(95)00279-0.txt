Efficient polymerization of acetylene is achieved by using titanocene alkyne complexes as precatalysts. The in situ generated titanocene 'Cp2Ti' is the catalytically active species which induces acetylene polymerization. A mechanism including an exo-allylidene metallacyclobutene complex for the catalytic formation of polyacetylene is proposed.
