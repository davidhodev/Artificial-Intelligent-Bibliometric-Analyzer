With a new trisiloxane-bridged dinuclear zirconocene, hexamethyltrisiloxanediylbis (cyclopentadienylindenylzirconium dichloride) (TSDZ) Cl2IndZr-CpSi(CH3)2-O-Si-(CH3) 2-O-Si(CH3)2 Cp-ZrIndCl2, the polymerizations of ethylene were carried out in the presence of modified MAO (MMAO) as a cocatalyst. The effects of MMAO amount and polymerization temperature (Tp) on polymerization behaviours of TSDZ were examined and compared with those of mononuclear zirconocenes such as cyclopentadienylindenylzirconium dichloride, biscyclopentadienylzirconium dichloride and bisindenylzirconium dichloride. The catalytic activity of TSDZ was comparable to that of mononuclear zirconocenes, while the weight-average molecular weight (Mk) and polydispersity index (MJMk) of polyethylene (PE) prepared with the former were much higher than those of PE with the latter. With increasing MMAO concentration, the catalytic activity increased but Mk decreased for TSDZ, as well as mononuclear zirconocenes. With increasing Tr the catalytic activity of TSDZ was a maximum at 40 Â°C while that of mononuclear zirconocenes increased steadily. For increased Tr the decrease of Mk and MJMk for TSDZ was extraordinary compared to that for mononuclear zirconocenes.
