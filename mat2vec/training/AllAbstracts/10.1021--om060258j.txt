This work reexamines the reaction of the tantalocene trialkyl complex Cp 2TaMe 3 with the strong organo Lewis acids (LAs) E(C 6F 5) 3 (E = B, Al) under various reaction conditions, investigates the activation of Schrock's alkylidene complex Cp 2Ta(=CH 2)Me with Al(C 6F 5)3, and employs the alkylidene complex for the polymerization of functionalized alkenes such as methyl methacrylate (MMA) and N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAA). Three cationic and zwitterionic tantalocene complexes have been isolated and structurally characterized, the cation [Cp 2TaMe 2] +[MeB(C 6F 5) 3] - (1), the zwitterion Cp 2Ta +[CH 2Al(C 6-F 5) 3 -]Me (2), and the cation [Cp 2Ta(CH 2)MeAl(C 6F 5) 2] +[Al(C 6F 5) 4] - (3). Complex 3, which is formed by the unusual nucleophilic attack of a C 6F 5 group within the aluminate moiety in 2 on Al(C 6F 5) 3 present in excess, consists of a cationic portion that can be viewed as a hybrid of two extreme structures: Cp 2-Ta +[CH 2Al(C 6F 5) 2]Me and the cationic tantalocene alkylidene-LA adduct [Cp 2Ta(=CH 2)MeAl(C 6F 5) 2] +. The investigation into the scope of such a unique reaction type shows it to be specific to the aluminate/alane (A1 -/A1) pair. All three isolated complexes are inactive for polymerization of MMA and DMAA; however, the combination of Cp 2Ta(=CH 2)Me with 2 equiv of Al(C 6F 5) 3 is highly active, producing high-molecular-weight polymers presumably via an A1 -/A1 bimolecular propagation process.
