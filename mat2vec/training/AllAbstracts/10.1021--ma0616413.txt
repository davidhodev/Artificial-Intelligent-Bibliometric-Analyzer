The realization of insertion polymerization of cyclobutene derivatives by using the circumventing pericyclic reactions are discussed. The unwanted pericyclic ring-opening of cyclobutene to the more stable butadiene is considered to provide limited advancement and the approach is to eliminate the pericyclic ring opening reaction. Titanium complexes, based on bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium catalyze the ring opening metathesis polymerization of norbornene. Gel permeation chromatography showed a trimodal polymer distribution of relatively low molecular weight. The source of the olefin peak in the NMR samples was investigated, which shows that the olefin formation occurs through β-hydride elimination. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that both poly-1 and poly-2 have thermal stability close to 400°C even with a low molecular weight. Glass transition temperature were found to be lower than that of addition polymer of norbornene.
