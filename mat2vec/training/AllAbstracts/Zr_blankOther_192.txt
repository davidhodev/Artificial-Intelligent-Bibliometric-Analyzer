Polypropylene was obtained using the metallocene homogeneous catalyst Methyl2Si-(2-Methyl-4-Phenyl)2ZrCl2/MAO and the corresponding silica/MAO-supported system prepared at different conditions. It was observed that long metallocene immobilization time for the preparation of silica/MAO/Zirconocene supported catalyst does not imply in higher catalytic activity. The obtained polymers were characterized according to their melting temperature (Tm) and crystallinity degree (Xc), through DSC analysis. The results showed that the supported catalyst system produce polypropylene with higher Tm and narrower range of melting in relation to the PP obtained by the homogeneous system.
