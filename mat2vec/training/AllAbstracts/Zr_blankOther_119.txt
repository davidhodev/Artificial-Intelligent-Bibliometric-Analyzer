The present work is aimed at increasing the seed germination of damaged and older seeds in an effort to allow such seeds to act as reliable seed sources. The synthesis and structural characterization of kinetin-containing Group IVB metallocene-containing polymers is described. A number of seeds were treated with ppm amounts of kinetin and kinetin-containing polymers. The rate of seed germination was generally increased for the seeds that were treated in comparison to those seeds that were not treated. These increases in seed germination ranged to over seven fold.
