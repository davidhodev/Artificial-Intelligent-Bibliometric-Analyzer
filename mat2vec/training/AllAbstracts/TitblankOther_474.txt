A series of titanocenes[(C5H4R)2TiCl2, R=H(1), Me(2), C6H11(3) and (C5H4R)2TiAr2, R = H, Ar=C6H5(4), p-MeC6H4(5), m-MeC6H4(6); R=Me, Ar=C6H5(7), p-MeC6H4(8); R=C6H11, Ar=C6H5(9), p-MeC6H4(10)] were synthesized. The catalytic hydrogenation of SBS copolymer using these catalysts was studied. The effects of the types of catalyst, the amount of catalyst and the component ratio of catalyst were investigated and found that the SBS was hydrogenated more than 98% when the amount of catalyst was 0. 001-0. 003 mmol/g polymer. Among the catalysts, the p-tolyltitanocene 8 gives the best result and is a promising catalyst system for catalytic hydrogenation of SBS copolymer.
