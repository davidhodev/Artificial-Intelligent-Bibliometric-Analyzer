Metallocene-catalyzed polymerization of olefins and diolefins, including styrene and selected polar vinyl monomers, is an important new technology that in recent years has started to make significant inroads into the polyolefin marketplace. Metallocenes have broadened our knowledge of the mechanistic understanding of ZieglerNatta catalysis, stereospecific polymerization, and termination reactions. In contrast to classic ZieglerNatta catalysis, the polymerization takes place at a defined transition metal center, which allows precise control of the monomer insertion and other reaction steps. Many titanocenes, zirconocenes, and hafnocenes with various symmetries have been synthesized and found to give tailored polymers of totally different structures. Methylalumoxane or other bulky cocatalysts are the main causes for the high activities of the metallocene catalysts. Single-site catalysts have the capability of permitting the user to control polymer tacticity, molecular weight, and molecular weight distribution more efficiently than in the. Â© 2001.
