Effects of structural features of 4 dinuclear constrained geometry catalysts having paraxylene derivative bridge (DCGC) on copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene were investigated. The bridges of three catalysts have para-xylene backbone with a different substituent at benzene ring. The substituents were hydrogen (Catalyst 1), isopropyl (Catalyst 2), n-hexyl (Catalyst 3) and 1-octyl (Catalyst 4). It was found that Catalyst 1 having hydrogen as a substituent exhibited the greatest activity among the four dinuclear CGCs. On the other hand, Catalyst 2 containing isopropyl as a substituent showed the smallest activity. Very interestingly, Catalyst 2 was able to produce about 6 times higher molecular weight polymer than Catalyst 3 and 4. Catalyst 3 and 4 having a long alkyl chain substituent revealed the biggest comonomer response to generate polyethylene copolymer containing more than 40% 1-hexene contents. These results suggest that the control of the substituent of para-xylene bridge of dinuclear CGC can provide a proper method to adjust the microstructure of polyethylene copolymers.
