A novel methylene bridged binuclear bis (imino) pyridyl iron (II) complex 3 ([2, 6-R2-C6H3N = C (CH3) C5H3N (CH3) C = N (3, 5-R2) C6H2-CH2-(3, 5-R2) C6H2N = C (CH3) C5H3N (CH3) C = N (2, 6-R2) C6H3] [FeCl2]2 (R = i-C3H7)) was synthesized. Activated by MAO or AlEt3, complex 3 exhibites very high activity and produces high molecular weight polyethylene with broad/bimodal molecular weight distribution and high melting temperatures. In addition, the 13C NMR spectrum of PE obtained indicates that the PE is high linear.
