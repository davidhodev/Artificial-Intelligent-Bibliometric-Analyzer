© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.A new imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine-containing pyrrolyl ligand HL (HL = 3-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine) was synthesized and employed in the organometallic chemistry of titanium. The syntheses, structures, catalytic properties and antitumor activity of three titanium complexes supported by HL are reported. Reactions of Ti(NMe2)4 and Ti(NEt2)4 with 2 equivalents of HL, led to the production of titanium bisamido complexes TiL2(NMe2)2 (1) and TiL2(NEt2)2 (2), respectively. Treatment of Ti(OiPr)4 with 2 equivalents of HL resulted in the formation of TiL2(OiPr)2 (3). All complexes were characterized by elemental analyses and NMR studies. The solid-state structures of 2 and 3 were further established by single X-ray crystallography. The titanium bisamido complexes 1 and 2 are shown to be good pre-catalysts for the hydroamination of alkynes. Complex 1 was found to be an active catalyst for the ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone. The cytotoxicity activities of 3 towards the tumor cells HCT-116, PC3 and MCF-7 were measured. Complex 3 exhibited good antitumor properties.
