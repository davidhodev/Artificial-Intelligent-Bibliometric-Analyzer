A series of alkyl- and aryl-imido titanium dialkyl compounds Ti(N'Bu)(Me 3 [9]aneN 3 )R 2 (R = Me (1), CH 2 SiMe 3 (3), CH 2 t Bu (4), CH 2 Ph (5)), Ti(NR)(Me 3 [9]aneN 3 )Me 2 (R = i Pr (6), Ph. (7), 3,5-C 6 H 3 (CF 3 ) 2 (8), 2,6-C 6 H 3 i Pr 2 (9), 2-C 6 H 4 CF 3 (10), 2-C 6 H 4 t Bu (11)), and Ti(NR)(Me 3 [9] aneN 3 )(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 2 (R = i Pr (12), Ar F (13)) were prepared and crystallographically characterized in the case of 1, 6-9, and 11 (Me 3 -[9]aneN 3 = 1,4,7-trimethyl triazacyclononane; Ar F = C 6 F 5 ). These compounds, isolobal with the titanocenes Cp 2 TiR 2 , were thermally stable at elevated temperatures except for 4. Reaction of 7 with [Ph 3 C][BAr F 4 ] (TB) and diisopropylcarbodiimide in CH 2 Cl 2 gave the Ti-Me insertion product [Ti(NPh)(Me 3 [9]-aneN 3 ){MeC(N i Pr) 2 }][BAr F 4 ] (15-BAr F 4 ). The corresponding reaction of 7 in the absence of organic substrate gave [Ti 2 (μ-NPh) 2 (Me 3 [9]aneN 3 ) 2 Cl 2 ][BAr F 4 ] 2 via a solvent activation reaction. The roomtemperature ethylene polymerization capabilities of the dialkyl compounds were evaluated using TB cocatalyst in the presence of Al i Bu 3 (TIBA). Among the dimethyl precatalysts, only the systems 1 and 11, with the bulkiest imido groups, showed high productivities (6230 and 1210 kg mol -1 h -1 bar -1 , respectively). The productivites of the other ferf-butyl imido precatalysts 3 and 4 (130 and 120 kg mol -1 h -1 bar -1 , respectively) were substantially lower than that of 1. The catalyst system 1/TIBA (2500 equiv, no added TB) was also active for ethylene polymerization (225 kg mol -1 h -1 bar -1 ). The less productive imido dialkyl precatalysts all formed complex mixtures on exposure to TIBA. The polyethylenes produced with 1, 3, and 5-11 generally had M w /M n values in the range 2.6-3.0. The PE formed with 1/TB/TIBA was terminated only by methyl end groups, consistent with chain transfer to TIBA followed by subsequent β-H transfer by the resultant titanium isobutyl cation. The alkyl cations [Ti(N t Bu) (Me 3 [9]aneN 3 )R] + (R = Me or CH 2 SiMe 3 ) reacted rapidly with TIBA in C 6 D 5 Br at -30°C, forming isobutene. DFT calculations found that TIBA adducts of the model methyl cation [Ti(NMe)(H 3 [9]aneN 3 )Me] + were energetically favorable by ca. -80 to -110 kJ mol -1 . Whereas 1 alone or with AlMe3 present has been shown to form only Ph 3 CMe on reaction with [Ph 3 C] + , 1:1 mixtures of 1 and TIBA gave Ph 3 CH as the only tritylcontaining product, suggesting a key role for transient [Al i Bu 2 ] + in the activation process for these catalysts. Overall, the imido group in the Ti(NR)(Me 3 [9]aneN 3 )Me 2 /TB/TIBA catalysts systems appears to have two roles: to stabilize the dialkyl precatalyst toward degradation by the TIBA itself prior to activation, and to inhibit the formation of catalytically inactive hetero- or homo-bimetallic complexes. © 2006 American Chemical Society.
