As a prelude to metal mediated systems, a series of typical free radical initiators were first evaluated in the thermal or UV-mediated VDF polymerization in glass tubes, at room temperature (rt) in a variety of solvents. Better polymerization results were obtained with initiators which generate the most reactive radicals (TBPO), in solvents that minimize chain transfer (ACN). The effect of UV irradiation was subsequently investigated to reveal a photocontrolled free radical polymerization. Finally, a series of epoxides, aldehydes, halides and peroxides, known to initiate both styrene and diene polymerizations in the presence of Cp2TiCl•, were tested as potential rt VDF initiators. However, regardless of reaction conditions, no polymer was obtained. This is most likely due to the incompatibility of solvents appropriate for Cp2TiCl2 reductions with those conducive of VDF polymerizations. Thus, polar solvents favored by Cp2TiCl 2 are strong chain transfer agents towards VDF (dioxane, THF, diglyme, acetone), while solvents that limit chain transfer to PVDF• (ACN), react with Cp2TiCl•. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
