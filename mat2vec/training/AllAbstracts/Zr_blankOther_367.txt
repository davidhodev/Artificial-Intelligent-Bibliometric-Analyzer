Novel fl/iya-metallocene complexes containing bis(indenyl) ligands bridged at 4 position were obtained. Ethylene or trimethylene bridged type zirconocene was synthesized from bis(p-tolyl)ethane or bis(p-tolyl)propane as starting material, respectively. Dimethylsilylene bridged type zirconocene was prepared from the protected 4-bromo-l-indanone derivative. It turned out that meso-C2H4[4,4'(2,7-dimethylindenyl)2]ZrCl2 and 7-flc-Me2Si[4,4'-(2-methylindenyl)2]ZrCl2 were suitable catalysts for producing ethylene/1-hexene copolymers ith high molecular weight. Highly isotactic polypropylene was obtained by using rac-MejSiXS-methyl-l-phenylindenyOJZrClj catalyst and contained only small amounts of 3,1-type regiodefects. The molecular structures of these complexes were confirmed by X-ray analysis. Copyright Â©7999 by Kodansha Ltd.
