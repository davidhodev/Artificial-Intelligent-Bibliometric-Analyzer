The development of ansa-metallocene catalysts is considered along several lines of interest-ansa-metallocene complexes with different ligand frameworks, insights gained with regard to relevant reaction intermediates and contributions of ansa-metallocene catalysts to industrial polymer production-with a view toward the present state of the art in these fields of catalysis research.
