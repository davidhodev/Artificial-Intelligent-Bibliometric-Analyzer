The reductive dimerization or polymerization of organochlorosilanes has been achieved by using the low-valent titanium reducing agent other than the alkali metals that are invariable used in the Wurtz-type coupling reaction. Applying this method, the corresponding disilanes or poly(methylvinylsilane) was obtained in good yields. The poly(methylvinylsilane) synthesized by this method is highly pure with a high molecular weight and a narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn = 1.6, Mn = 16,860). Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V.
