(tBuC5H4)TiCl2(N=CtBu2) (1) exhibited remarkable catalytic activities (12,000–43,700 kg-polymer/mol-Ti·h) and efficient comonomer incorporation in ethylene copolymerization with tetracyclododecene (TCD) in the presence of methylaluminoxane, and the catalytic activity by 1 increased even at 60 °C. The resultant polymers are high molecular weight amorphous poly(ethylene-co-TCD)s (Mn = 5.88–7.03 × 105) with uniform compositions (with high Tg values, 108–203 °C); a linear relationship between Tg values and the TCD contents was observed. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
