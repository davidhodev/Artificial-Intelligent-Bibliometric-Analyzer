The spherical zirconia modified with BCl3, SiCl4, and glycerol was used as the support for rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst to catalyze the copolymerization of ethylene/1-hexene. It is aimed to investigate the modification effects from different modifiers on copolymerization behaviors and compare the results with the unmodified system. The modified supports show higher activity than the unmodified one. Especially, the SiCl4 modification exhibited the highest activity and produced copolymer with the largest 1-hexene insertion. This can be attributed to stronger interaction between the support and MAO along with the presence of SiCl4 as a spacer group resulting in the absence of induction period. The modification did not affect the copolymers microstructure and the random copolymers were obtained from all supported systems. The narrower molecular weight distribution can be obtained from the modified supports. Besides, BCl3 modification presents the highest molecular weight of polymer probably due to BCl3 suppressing chain transfer reactions. Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.
