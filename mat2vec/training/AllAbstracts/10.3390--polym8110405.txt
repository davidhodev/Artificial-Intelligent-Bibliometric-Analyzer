Â© 2016 by the authors.In this review are reported some of the most relevant achievements in the chemistry of the ethylene-styrene copolymerization and in the characterization of the copolymer materials. Focus is put on the relationship between the structure of the catalyst and that of the obtained copolymer. On the other hand, the wide variety of copolymer architecture is related to the properties of the material and to the potential utility.
