KGaA, Weinheim.Copolymerization mechanisms of norbornadiene (NBD) and propylene, catalyzed by three zirconocene catalysts (namely, rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2ZrCl2/MAO (catA), rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2/MAO (catB), and rac-CH2CH2(Ind)2ZrCl2/MAO(catC)), have been studied, using density functional theory computations. It has been found that the barrier (28.5 kcal mol−1) for the insertion of propylene to the [Zr]A-NBD-PP1 (the NBD insertion product) is significantly higher than those to [Zr]B-NBD-PP1 (22.9 kcal mol−1) and [Zr]C-NBD-PP1 (20.5 kcal mol−1), rationalizing the experimental observation that addition of NBD deactivated catA system but only lowered the catalytic activity of catB and catC systems. However, [Zr]A-NBD-PP1 can react with H2 easily, which displaces NBD−PP1 chain and gives active [Zr]A−H species to continue copolymerization, which is why the introduction of H2 could recover the catalytic activity of catA system.
