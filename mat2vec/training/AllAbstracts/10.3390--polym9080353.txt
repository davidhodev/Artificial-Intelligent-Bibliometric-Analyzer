Â© 2017 by the authors. Non-metallocene oxovanadium(V) complexes bearing either [ONNO]-type amine pyridine bis(phenolate) ligands or [ONN]-type amine pyridine phenolate ligands were employed as efficient catalysts to copolymerize ethylene with several unsymmetrical norbornene-containing dienes, such as 5-vinyl-2-norbornene (VNB), 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB) or dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), producing copolymers with high comonomer incorporations (VNB: 33.0 mol %; ENB: 30.4 mol %; DCPD: 31.6 mol %, respectively) and high molecular weight (VNB: 86.4 kDa; ENB: 256 kDa; DCPD: 86.4 kDa, respectively). The enchainment of the dienes was proven to be exclusive of vinyl-addition via the C=C double bond of the norbornene ring while the other double bond was retained near the backbone without crosslinking. During the copolymerization of ethylene with ENB, a positive 'comonomer effect' was observed. The catalytic activities of the catalysts as well as the molecular weights and comonomer incorporations of the resultant copolymers could be tuned within a wide range by varying the structures of the catalysts and copolymerization conditions. The [ONN]-type oxovanadium(V) complexes showed higher catalytic activities than those of [ONNO]-type oxovanadium(V) complexes, irrespective of the structure of the dienes. In addition, the dominant chain transfer pathway of the non-metallocene oxovanadium(V) catalytic system promoted copolymerization was proven to be transfer to aluminum compounds.
