The copolymerization of vinylcyclohexane (VCH) with ethylene using an original complex analyst of nonbridged half-titanocenes containing an aryloxo ligand was described. The observed catalytic activities based on the polymer yields decreased at higher VCH/ethylene molar ratios under lower ethylene pressure, whereas the VCH contents in the resultant copolymer increased under VCH/ethylene molar ratios. The glass transition temperature values increased upon increasing the VCH contents, suggesting that the resultant copolymers are amorphous. It was shown that both the cyclopentadienyl fragment and the anionic donor ligand directly affect the VCH incorporation.
