In order to gain further insight into dicarbollide-catalyzed ethylene-norbornene polymerization, the behavior of the (η5-C2B9H11)- Zr(NRt2)2(NHEt2)-TIBA catalyst was studied and preliminary compared with that of Me2Si(3-tBuCp)(adamantylamido)- ZrCl2/MAO (2) and (η5-C5Me5)- ZrCl3-MAO (3). Several ethylene-norbornene copolymerizations were carried out over a wide range of monomer compositions. The resulting polymer products were analyzed by 13C NMR spectroscopy to gain information about the copolymer microstructure.
