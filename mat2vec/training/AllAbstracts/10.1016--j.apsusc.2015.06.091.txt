Zirconocene catalyst supported on silica gel was prepared for olefin polymerization by surface modification of calcined silica with SiCl 4 , and the reaction between the modified silica and cyclopentadienyl sodium and ZrCl 4 . The catalyst was characterized by using Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer, thermogravimetric (TG), and differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) analytic spectrometer. It was found that the metallocene structure could be formed and connected on silica surface by chemical bond. Initial catalytic tests showed that the supported metallocene was catalytically active (methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst), producing polymer with higher molecular weight than the metallocene just immobilized on the surface of silica gel.
