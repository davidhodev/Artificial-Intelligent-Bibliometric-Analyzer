Â© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Abstract: In this review, we discuss the nature and bonding, role of metal acetylacetonates as precursors for nanoparticle research, polymer science, catalysis and their mechanistic aspects, which we believe to provide an illustrative overview of current research directions in this rapidly developing field. The chosen examples within this review reflect the remarkable broadness of nanoparticle research, polymer and applications of metal acetylacetonates as catalysts in organic syntheses. The purpose of this review is to provide recent advancements of several catalytic reactions employing well defined metal enolate complexes. Metal enolates are used in a plethora of catalysed reactions. Several catalytic reactions have been highlighted in this review to show where metal enolate complexes have played a significant role in recent years. The ultimate goal of this effort is towards the development of catalysts that impart the selectivities, reactivity, and atom economy needed for cost-effective approaches to a variety of critical chemical transformations.
