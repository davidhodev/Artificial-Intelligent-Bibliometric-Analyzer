The dimer of lithium μ2,η1-N-[(N,N- dimethylamino)dimethylsilyl]-2,6-diisopropylanilidate [1c, [LiN(2,6- iPr2C6H3)Si(CH3) 2N(CH3)2]2 represented as (LiL) 2] reacted with group 4 chlorides to form corresponding compounds, which were crystallized and confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis as compounds of pseudotetrahedral ZrL2Cl2 (2) and chloro-bridged dinuclear tetrahedral compounds ZrLCl2(μ-Cl)2Li'2THF (3), ZrLCl2(μ-Cl)2Li'2Et2O (4), HfLCl 2(μ-Cl)2Li'2Et2O (5), and [ZrLCl 2(μ-Cl)]2 (6). The catalytic behaviors of group 4 compounds were investigated in the presence of MAO as a cocatalyst. Compound 4 exhibited high activity for ethylene polymerization, while compounds 2 and 6 showed good activities for both ethylene polymerization and ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization. © 2010 American Chemical Society.
