Ethylene polymerizations by Cp2ZrCl2/MAO (MAO=methyl-alumoxane) and Cp2HfCl2/MAO catalysts are compared. The Hf catalysts have about two-thirds the activity of the Zr catalysts. This difference may be attributed to the greater number of active centers present in the Zr catalyst. The Hf catalyst shows a smaller dependence of: (1) polymer MW on temperature and (2) polymerization activity on transition metal concentration than the Zr catalyst. Â© 1988 Springer-Verlag.
