The ring-opening polymerization (ROP) behavior of a variety of substituted l,l'-ethylenylferrocenes, or dicarba[2]ferrocenophanes, is reported. The electronic absorption spectra and tilted solid-state structures of the monomers rac-[Fe(nη-C5H4)2(CHi(Pr)2] (7), [Fe(nη5-C5H4)2(CHMeCH 2)] (8), and rac-[Fe(nη-C5H4) 2(CHPh)2] (9) are consistent with the presence of substantial ring strain, which was exploited to synthesize soluble, well-defined polyferrocenylethylenes (PFEs) [Fe(nη5C5H 4)2(C(H)MeCH2)]n (12) and [Fe(nη 5C5H4)2(CHPh)2]n (13) through photocontrolled ROP. Polymer chain lengths could be controlled by the monomerto-initiator ratio up to about 50 repeat units and, consistent with the "living" nature of the polymerizations, sequential block copolymerization with a sila[l]ferrocenophane led to polyferrocenylethylene- polyferrocenylsilane (PFE-b-PFS) block copolymers (14 and 15). PFE polymers 12 and 13 showed two reversible oxidation waves, indicative of appreciable Fe-Fe interactions along the polymer backbone. The diblock copolymers were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, GPC analysis, and cyclic voltammetry. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA,.
