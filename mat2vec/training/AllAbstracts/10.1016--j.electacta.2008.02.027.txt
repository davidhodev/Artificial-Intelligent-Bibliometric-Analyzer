New co-oligomers based on 4,4′-dialkyl-2,2′-bithiazole and 3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene (EDOT) in a donor-acceptor type molecule were obtained using organometallic polycondensation mediated by organotransition metal complexes. The properties of electrochemically obtained polymer films from these monomers were characterized by cyclic voltammetry combined with in situ conductivity, UV-vis spectra, and electrochemical quartz microbalance (EQCM) method. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
