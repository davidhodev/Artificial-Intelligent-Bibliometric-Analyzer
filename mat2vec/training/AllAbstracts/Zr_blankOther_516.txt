Dimethyl zirconocene and its derivatives are effective catalysts for the dehydrogenative coupling of primary organosilaes to poly(organosilylenes). The backbone Si-H functions of these polymers can be functionalised by catalytic hydrosilylation. Since the zirconocene polymerization catalyst is also an active hydrosilylation catalyst, it is possible to perform one-pot syntheses of functionalised polysilylenes.
