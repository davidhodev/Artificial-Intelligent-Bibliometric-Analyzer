The polymerization of norbornene has been investigated in the presence of two novel bispyrazolylimine dinickel(II) complexes bis-2-(C3HN 2Me2-3,5)(C(Ph) = N(4-RC6H4)Ni 2Br4 (complex 1, R = H; complex 2, R = OCH3) activated by methylaluminoxane. The two catalytic systems show high activity (up to 1.83 × 106 gPNBE/(molNi·h)) for norbornene polymerization and provide polynorbornene (PNBE) with higher molecular weights (M w = 4.44 × 105-11.57 × 105 g/mol) and narrower molecular weight distributions about 2.0. The electron-donating of methoxyl group in complex 2 could enhance the catalytic activity for norbornene polymerization, however, the molecular weights of polymers were decreased. The influences of polymerization parameters such as polymerization temperature, Al/Ni molar ratio, reaction time and catalyst concentration on catalytic activity, and molecular weight of the PNBEs were investigated in detail. The obtained PNBEs were characterized by means of 1H NMR, FTIR, and thermogravimetric analyses. The analyses results of PNBE indicated that the norbornene polymerization is vinyl-type polymerization rather than ring-opening metathesis polymerization. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.
