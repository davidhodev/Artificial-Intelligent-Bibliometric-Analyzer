The 1-metallacyclopent-3-ynes Cp2Ti(η4-H 2C4H2) (1) (Cp = η5- cyclopentadienyl) and rac(ebthi)Zr(η4-H2C 4H2) (2) (ebthi = 1,2-ethylene-1,1′- bis(η5-tetrahydroindenyl) react with B(C6F 5)3 under ring opening of the metallacycle and formation of the zwitterionic complexes [Cp2Ti]+-CH 2C≡CCH2-[B-(C6F 5)3] (3) and [rac-(ebthi)Zr]+-CH 2C≡CCH2-[B-(C6F5) 3] (4). Crystal structures of 3 and 4 show a but-2-yne-1,4-diyl ligand bridging the metallocenium center and the formed boranate. Complex 4 is an active catalyst for ethylene polymerization. © 2005 American Chemical Society.
