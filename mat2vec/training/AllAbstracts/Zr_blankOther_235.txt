The kinetics of 1-butene polymerization promoted with η5-pentamethylcyclopentadi enyltribenzyioxydetitanium [Cp*Ti (OBz)3] activated by modified methylaluminiumoxane (mMAO) was investigated. The effects of polymerization temperature, catalyst concentration, and 1-butene concentration on polymerization behavior were described. The results showed that the polymerization rate followed the first order with respect to monomer and catalyst concentration. The apparent polymerization rate constant κp were 3.19 × 104, 2.59 × 104, 2.25 × 104 at 30, 40, 50°C, respectively. The apparent polymerization activation energy was 14.3 kJ/mol.
