The simultaneous radical polymerization of three component system, i.e., N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM), a dihalide with multidentate ligand for organotitanium, and unconjugated diene, was examined with the CuCl/Me6TREN system in DMF/H2O = 1/1 at 20 °C to result in the periodically functionalized poly(NIPAM). The periodically-introduced multidendate ligands originating from the dihalide were subsequently reacted with Cp∗TiCl3, the organotitanium part of which was introduced periodically into the poly(NIPAM) as the titanatrane complex. Since the Cp∗-titanatrane structure was stable in water, the thermoresponsive behavior of the periodically titanatrane-containing poly(NIPAM) could also be evaluated in an aqueous solution.
