The disiloxane-bridged zirconocene complexes, tetramethyldisiloxanediylbis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride and tetramethyldisiloxanediylbis(cyclopentadienyl)dimethylzirconium initiate the homopolymerization of ethene as well as the copolymerization of ethene and Î±-olefin with a modified methylaluminoxane as cocatalyst. The catalyst systems give resonable activity but the molecular weight of polyethene decreases drastically with increasing polymerization temperature.
