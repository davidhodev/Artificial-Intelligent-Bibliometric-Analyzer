The synthesis of heterobimetallic (TiCu, TiAg) and tetranuclear heterobimetallic (Ti 2Ag 2) transition metal complexes based on the organometallic π-tweezer building blocks [Ti](CCSiMe 3) 2 is described. In [{[Ti](μ-σ,π-CCSiMe 3) 2}M-LL] + and [{[Ti](μ-σ,π- CCSiMe 3) 2}MLLM{(Me 3SiCC-μ-σ,π) 2[Ti]}] 2+ (M = Cu, Ag; LL = pyrazine- or pyridine-based bridging units) the metal containing parts are spanned by π-conjugated organic bridges LL. Depending on the nature of LL coordination polymers are also accessible. Pyrazine- and pyridine-based π-conjugated σ-donor molecules, such as 4,4′-bipyridine, 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene, 3,5-dipyridyl-1,2,4-triazole, N,N′-bis(4-pyridylmethylidene)benzene-1,4- diamine, 2,5-di(pyridylmethylidene)cyclopentanone, 2,6-di(4-pyridylmethylidene) cyclohexanone (LL, 2a-2g) can successfully be used to span heterobimetallic π-tweezer units of the type [{[Ti](μ-σ,π-CCSiMe 3) 2}M] + ([Ti] = (η 5-C 5H 4SiMe 3) 2Ti; M = Cu, Ag). The thus accessible di-cationic species [{[Ti](μ-σ,π-CCSiMe 3) 2}MLLM{(Me 3SiCC-μ-σ,π) 2[Ti]}] 2+ (4), which are formed via the formation of [{[Ti](μ-σ, π-CCSiMe 3) 2}MLL] + (3) complexes, can be isolated in yields between 66% and 99%. However, when C 5H 4NCHCHC 6H 4CHCHNC 5H 4 (5a) and C 5H 4NCHNC 6H 4CHCHNC 5H 4 (5b), respectively, are reacted with {[Ti](μ-σ,π-CCSiMe 3) 2}AgBF 4(1c) in a 1:1 molar ratio, then the silver(I) ion is released from the organometallic π-tweezer 1c and coordination polymers [AgBF 4 • 5a] n (6a) and [AgBF 4 • 5b] n (6b) along with [Ti](CCSiMe 3) 2 (7) are formed in quantitative yield. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.
