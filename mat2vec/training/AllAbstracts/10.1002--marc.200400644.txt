The TiIIICp2Cl-catalyzed radical ring opening of epoxides produces Ti alkoxides which initiate the ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone. A linear dependence of M̄n on conversion, linear kinetics, low M̄w/M̄n values, and the synthesis of block copolymers demonstrate a living process, while NMR spectroscopy confirms the presence of the initiator chain end. Epoxides are thus introduced as a new class of initiators for the Ti-catalyzed living ring-opening polymerization of cyclic esters. © 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
