(Chemical Equation Presented) Taking the high road is what reactions of primary amine boranes do, according to results recently obtained by Manners and co-workers, when a homogeneous catalyst is used to prepare soluble aminoborane polymers and copolymers (see scheme; pocop=κ3-1,3-(OPtBu2) 2C6H3). Such metal-catalyzed dehydrocoupling reactions for the synthesis of new B-N analogues of α-olefins are of fundamental interest for materials science. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.
