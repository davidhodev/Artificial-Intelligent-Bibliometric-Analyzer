NMR-spectra of new coordination compounds of zirconocene with 5-norbornene-2-ol and 5-norbornene-2-methanol were studied. Besides traditional NMR techniques, a series of bidimensional ones were applied, such as: COSY, HMQC and NOESY. The possibility of obtaining of new metallopolymers via photoinduced polymerization of new Zr-containing monomers is discussed.
