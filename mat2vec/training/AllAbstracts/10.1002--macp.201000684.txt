Poly(hydrosilane)s, [R(H)Si]n [R = Ph, Si(CH2) 3SiMe2Th, cy-Hex], are investigated as sources of silyl radicals. The Si-H bonds in these oligomers exhibit good to excellent hydrogen donating properties which ensure the formation of reactive silyl radicals. For free radical photopolymerization, the polymerization initiating properties of these structures are checked. These polymers are found to be advantageous to overcome the classical oxygen inhibition of the FRP process. Their ability in FRPCP is also evaluated for an epoxy monomer. The mechanisms are investigated through ESR and laser flash photolysis experiments. Poly(hydrosilane)s are investigated as sources of silyl radicals. The examples shown outline the interest of poly(hydrosilane)s as co-initiators in FRP or radical sources in FRPCP. A huge additive effect in Type-I PI is also found. The specific behavior of PHSs under air is based on a fast conversion of the peroxyls into new silyl initiating species. Copyright Â© 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
