Methylene-bridged ansa-metallocene complexes bearing substituents on the cyclopentadienyl (Cp) and fluorenyl (Flu) moieties, namely methylene[9-(2,7-di-tert-butyl)fluorenyl (2-(1,3-dimethylcyclopentadienyl)]zirconium dichloride (1a) and its analogue, methylene [(9-(2,7-di-tert-butyl)fluorenyl (2-(1-methyl-3-phenyl)cyclopentadienyl) ]zirconium dichloride (2a), have been prepared from (2,7-di-tert-butyl)-9-prop-2-ynyl-9H-fluorene (2). This procedure includes the use of 3-bromo-1-propyne which affords the methylene bridging unit by way of an intermolecular Pauson-Khand reaction in which norbornadiene and a pendant alkyne cyclize to form a ring that later becomes a substituted cyclopentadienyl group. Ethylene-norbornene (E-N) copolymerization was then carried out using these new complexes (1a and 1b) in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO) as a cocatalyst; these activities can be compared to that of isopropylene[9-fluorenyl-cyclopentadienyl]zirconium dichloride (3a). The activity of catalyst 1a was comparable to that of 3a but much higher than that of 2a. In addition, 1a shows higher norbornene insertion performance, and gives an E-N copolymer with a higher glass transition temperature (Tg) than 2a under identical conditions; both 1a and 2a give a lower Tg polymer than 3a does.
