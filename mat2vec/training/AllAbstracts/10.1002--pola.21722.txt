Vinylcyclohexane (VCH) was copolymerized with ethene and propene using methylaluminoxane-activated metallocene catalysts. The catalyst precursor for the ethene copolymerization was rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)ZrCl2 (1). Propene copolymerizations were further studied with Cs-symmetric isopropylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl)ZrCl2 (2), C 1-symmetric ethylene(l-indenyl-2-phenyl-2-fluorenyl)ZrCl2 (3), and "meso"-dimethylsilyl[3-benzylindenyl)(2-methylbenz[e]indenyl) ]ZrCl2 (4). Catalyst 1 produced a random ethene-VCH copolymer with very high activity and moderate VCH incorporation. The highest comonomer content in the copolymer was 3.5 mol %. Catalysts 1 and 4 produced poly(propene-co- vinylcyclohexane) with moderate to good activities [up to 4900 and 15,400 kg of polymer/(mol of catalyst × h) for 1 and 4, respectively] under similar reaction conditions but with fairly low comonomer contents (up to 1.0 and 2.0% for 1 and 4, respectively). Catalysts 2 and 3, both bearing a fluorenyl moiety, gave propene-VCH copolymers with only negligible amounts of the comonomer. The homopolymerization of VCH was performed with 1 as a reference, and low-molar-mass isotactic polyvinylcyclohexane with a low activity was obtained. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
