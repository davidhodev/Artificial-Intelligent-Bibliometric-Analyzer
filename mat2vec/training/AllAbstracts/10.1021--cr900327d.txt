A scientific review informed about the functions and applications of dendrimers resulting from supramolecular and physical properties. The review focused on the importance of the purities of dendrimers that potentially varied from one family to the other and significantly influencing the adequate achievement of the functions. It focused on the powerful concepts of dendrimer chemistry in terms of functions and potential applications. The findings revealed that dendrons bonded to polymers were called dendronized polymers and they disclosed properties relevant to those of dendrimers. Branched or hyperbranched polymers were found to be useful alternatives to dendrimers that had significant commercial view and showed closely related properties for functions. Local dendrimer dynamics, such as local motion were also compared to supercooled liquids and linear polymers, including glass transition aspects.
