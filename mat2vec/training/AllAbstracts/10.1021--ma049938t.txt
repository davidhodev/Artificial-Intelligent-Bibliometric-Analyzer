Polymerization of 1,5-hexadiene (HD) by the nonbridged half-titanocene complex is discussed. The remarkable difference in the selectivity of repeated 1,2-insertion is also discussed. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) are explored to observe differences in both the microstructure and the thermal properties for resultant polymers. It is shown that half-titanocene complex favored repeated 1,2 insertion rather than cyclization, affording a polymer with an olefinic double bond in the side chain.
