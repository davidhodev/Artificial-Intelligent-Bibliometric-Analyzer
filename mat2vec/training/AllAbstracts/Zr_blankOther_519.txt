An experimental study is reported which was carried out to obtain and characterize a new class of metalorganic polymers. In this paper, the authors describe the synthesis of copolymers of cobalticinium 1,1 dicarboxylic acid (IV) with zirconocene dichloride and compare their properties with those of tin and titanium polymers prepared previously. The polymers are prepared as shown in equation. Polymers were characterized by IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, viscometry measurement, thermogravimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry. Experimental results are plotted and discussed in terms of reaction mechanisms and polymer thermal performance.
