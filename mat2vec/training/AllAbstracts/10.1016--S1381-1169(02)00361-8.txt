Five new hetero-bimetallic metallocene complexes were synthesized by the reaction of RCpTiCl3 and a Si-bridged zirconocene complex in refluxing toluene. They were all well characterized. These complexes activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO) are highly active catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene. The molecular weight (Mw = 28,957-124,089) and the molecular weight distribution (MWD = 2.04-3.01) of the polymer generated from the bimetallic catalytic system were higher than that obtained by Cp2ZrCl2.
