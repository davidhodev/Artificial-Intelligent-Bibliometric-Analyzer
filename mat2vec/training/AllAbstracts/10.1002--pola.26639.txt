An efficient introduction of vinyl group into poly (ethylene-co-styrene) or poly(ethylene-co-1-hexene) has been achieved by the incorporation of 3,3′-divinylbiphenyl (DVBP) in terpolymerization of ethylene, styrene, or 1-hexene with DVBP using aryloxo-modified half-titanocenes, Cp′TiCl 2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) [Cp′ = Cp*, tBuC5H4, 1,2,4-Me 3C5H2], in the presence of MAO cocatalyst, affording high-molecular-weight polymers with unimodal distributions. Efficient comonomer incorporations have been achieved by these catalysts, and the content of each comonomer could be varied by its initial concentration charged. The postpolymerization of styrene was initiated from the vinyl group remained in the side chain by treatment with n-BuLi. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
