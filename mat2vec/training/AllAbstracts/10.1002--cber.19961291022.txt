Depending on the nature of the metal and the ring size, lactams react with titanocene and zircocene complexes of bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene Cp2Ti(Me3SiC2SiMe3) and Cp2Zr-(L)(Me3SiC2SiMe3) (L = Py, THF) to yield different products. In the reaction of Cp2Zr(Py)(Me3SiC2SiMe3) with N-methyl- ε-caprolactam a simple ligand exchange reaction occurs and the complex Cp2Zr(Me3SiC2SiMe 3)[O=C-N(Me)-(CH2)5] (1) was isolated. With B-propiolactam the alkenyl-amido complex Cp2Zr[-C(SiMe3) = N(H) (SiMe3) ] [-rN-CO-CH2-CH2] (2) was obtained, which indicates that an agostic rnetal-hydrogen interaction has taken place. The reaction of Cp2Ti(Me3-SiC2SiMe3) with ε-caprolactam gives after elimination of the alkyne and molecular hydrogen the first early transition metal complex with a deprotonated coordinated ε-caprolactam in a η2-amidate bonding fashion Cp2Ti-OCN-(CH2)5 (3). The obtained complexes were characterized by KMR spectra (1, 2) and crystal structure analysis (1-3) and discussed as elemental steps in anionic ring-opening polymerization of lactams catalyzed by metallocene-alkyne complexes. © VCH Veriagsgeselischaft mbH, 1996.
