The polymers are synthesized in moderate to high yields and are moderate to high polymers. MALDI MS, IR spectral, and NMR spectral results are consistent with the proposed structure. The Sn–O stretching band is found at about 1,028 cm−1. Infrared spectra are consistent with majority of the products having a non-bridged structure about the tin. All of the polymers exhibit some inhibition of two pancreatic cancer cell lines. The dibutyltin and dicyclohexyltin products show sufficiently good inhibition of both cell lines as to merit further testing.
