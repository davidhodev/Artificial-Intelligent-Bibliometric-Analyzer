Ethylene homopolymerizations and copolymerizations were catalyzed by zirconocene catalysts entrapped inside functionalized montmorillonites that had been rendered organophilic via the ion exchange of the interlamellar cations of layered montmorillonite with hydrochlorides of L-amino acids (AAH+Cl-) or their methyl esters (MeAAH+Cl-), with or without the further addition of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (C16H33N+Me3Br-; R4N+Br-). In contrast to the homogeneous Cp2ZrCl2/methylaluminoxane catalyst for ethylene homopolymerizations and copolymerizations with 1-octene, the intercalated Cp2ZrCl2 activated by methylaluminoxane for ethylene homopolymerizations and copolymerizations with 1-octene proved to be more effective in the synthesis of polyethylenes with controlled molecular weights, chemical compositions and structures, and properties, including the bulk density. The effects of the properties of the organic guests on the preparation and catalytic performance of the intercalated zirconocene catalysts were studied. Â© 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
