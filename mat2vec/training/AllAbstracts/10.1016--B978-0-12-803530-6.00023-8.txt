Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.This chapter comprises new synthetic routes to branched polysilanes, polycarbosilanes and the functionalization/cross-linking of polysiloxanes. The polysilanes are synthesized via a metal-free borane-catalyzed polymerization reaction. Via a Pt-NHC-catalyzed hydrosilylation branched polycarbosilanes are obtained. Hydroxymethyl terminated polydimethylsiloxanes can be formed by the reaction of hydroxy-terminated polydimethylsiloxanes and a dioxadisilacyclohexane. The dioxadisilacyclohexane is synthesized via an organotin-catalyzed ring-closing reaction. Spirosiloxanes, formed by borane-catalyzed hyrdosilylation reactions can be applied as a cross-linking agent in silicones using photoacid generators.
