In the presence of an adduct of a stable radical [bis(triphenylphosphino) (3,6-di-tert-butylbenzosemiquinone-1,2)copper(I)] at 25°C under UV initiation, the block copolymerization of styrene with butyl methacrylate was conducted using an active polystyrene (Mw/Mn = 1.32) prepared under the same conditions, as well as the azeotropic copolymerization of styrene with butyl methacrylate. NMR studies showed that, in the photoinduced polymerization of methyl methacrylate, [bis(triphenylphosphino)(3,6-di-tert- butylbenzosemiquinone-1,2)copper(I)] affects the microtacticity of the polymer strongly. In the absence of UV irradiation, the above effects are not observed. It was proposed that the effect of the semiquinolate complex on the elementary event of chain growth is related to the photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer that is accompanied by the Cu(I) → Cu(II) transition.
