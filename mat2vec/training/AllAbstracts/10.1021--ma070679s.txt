A series of novel polymers have been obtained by the condensation polymerization of different dibromoarenes with different primary aromatic diamines via palladium-catalyzed aryl amination reaction. The structures of polymers are characterized by means of FT-IR, 1H NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis; the results show an agreement with the proposed structure. DSC and TG measurements show that polymers possess high glass transition temperature (Tg > 170°C) and good thermal stability with high decomposition temperatures (TD > 450°C). Thesis novel polymers also exhibit good mechanical behavior and good solubility. © 2007 American Chemical Society.
