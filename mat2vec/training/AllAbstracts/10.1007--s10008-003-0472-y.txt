We report electrochemical studies on the influence of a small concentration of chloride ions on the electroactivity of the polymer matrix of polypyrrole (PPy), poly(N-methylpyrrole) [p(N-MePy)] and a poly(titanocene-propyl-pyrrole) derivative, p(Tc3Py) [Tc(CH2)3NC4H4; Tc=CpCpTiCl2; Cp=C5H5; Cp′ = C 5H4] in acetonitrile (AN), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The polymer films were obtained on Pt disc electrodes from AN solutions of the monomers containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte and then transferred to the corresponding monomer-free solution. Studies in Cl --containing solutions have shown that the p(Tc3Py) matrix is very sensitive to the presence of Cl- ions in all the above solvents, namely that it was subjected to electrochemical degradation at potentials above 0.1 V vs. a Ag/ 0.01 M Ag+ in AN reference electrode. Degradation of the p(Tc3Py) matrix was also observed in chloride-free DMF+ TBAPF6 solutions. Addition of chloride ions to the AN solution containing pyrrole, N-methylpyrrole or Tc3Py inhibits the deposition of the polymer films. On the other hand, we have found that PPy and p(N-MePy) matrices after their deposition in chloride-free AN solutions show much more stable redox responses in contact with chloride and/or DMF solutions. Possible mechanisms of these effects are discussed. © Springer-Verlag 2004.
