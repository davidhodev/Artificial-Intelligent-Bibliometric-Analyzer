A series of trinuclear half-titanocenes, [Cp′TiX 2 {(O-2,4-R 2 C 6 H 2 )-6-CH 2 }] 3 N [X = Cl, R = Me, Cp′ = Cp (1); X = Cl, R = t Bu, Cp′ = Cp (4), Cp∗ (5), t BuC 5 H 4 (6), 1,2,4-Me 3 C 5 H 2 (7); X = Me, Cp′ = Cp∗, R = Me (8), t Bu (9)] and the related bimetallic complexes, [Cp′TiCl 2 {(O-2,4-Me 2 C 6 H 2 )-6-CH 2 }][Cp′TiCl{(O-2,4-Me 2 C 6 H 2 )-6-CH 2 } 2 ]N [Cp′ = Cp∗ (2), 1,2,4-Me 3 C 5 H 2 (3)], have been prepared and identified. Structures of 1-5, 7 and 9 were determined by X-ray crystallography, and all complexes fold with distorted tetrahedral geometries around titanium. These complexes (2-9) are stable in solution except the Cp analogue (1), which presents as a mixture of the trinuclear analogue (1) and the (proposed) binuclear analogue, CpTiCl 3 , and CpTi[{(O-2,4-Me 2 C 6 H 2 )-6-CH 2 }] 3 N in solution; there is an equilibrium between 1 and the binuclear analogue (and CpTiCl 3 ) depending on the temperature, solvent and concentration. The Cp∗ analogues (2, 8, 9), exhibited high catalytic activities for ethylene polymerisation in the presence of MAO cocatalyst, affording ultrahigh molecular weight polymers with uniform molecular weight distributions in most cases. [Cp∗TiMe 2 {(O-2,4-Me 2 C 6 H 2 )-6-CH 2 }] 3 N (8) showed the higher catalytic activities than the related mononuclear analogue, Cp∗TiCl 2 (O-2-R-4,6-Me 3 C 6 H 2 ) (R = Me, t Bu); the activity by 8 in the presence of Al i Bu 3 -[Ph 3 C][B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ] cocatalysts was higher than that in the presence of MAO.
