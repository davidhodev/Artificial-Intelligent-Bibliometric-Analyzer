The introduction of fluorine substituents significantly increased the catalytic activity of the β-diiminato titanium complexes compared with their alkyl-substituted counterparts. Furthermore, both the position and the amount of fluorine substitution greatly influenced the catalytic behavior. The activity was increased when the ortho-positions of the N-aryl were substituted by fluorine, and the more ortho-positions were substituted, the higher the activity. All of the three o-fluoro substituted complexes (2a, 2e and 2f) exhibited very high activity (up to 106gmol−1 h−1 atm−1); whereas the m- and p-fluoro derivatives (2b and 2c) were much less active. The high activity of the o-fluoro-substituted complexes is suggested to be due to the formation of non-covalent interactions between the o-fluorine atom and the ethylene monomer, which may assist in the enrichment and coordination of ethylene to the central metal, thus increase the catalytic activity.
