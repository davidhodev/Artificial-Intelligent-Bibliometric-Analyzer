©2014 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.The production of polyolefin nanocomposites has been the field of many studies for improving polymer properties for many applications. The most important challenge on the area is the preparation of the fillers randomly dispersed on polymer matrix. It is general agreement, however, that the dispersion obtained through in situ polymerization is the most efficient, additionally, confers to the system the advantages of heterogeneous catalysis. This contribution offer a review of characteristics of the most employed fillers, their use as metallocene catalysts supports and the application on in situ production of nanocomposites.
