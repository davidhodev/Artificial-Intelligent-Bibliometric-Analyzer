Isotatic polymerizations of methyl methacrylate (MMA), t-buyl acrylate and 2-ethyl hexyl acrylate in both toluene and CH 2Cl 2 with an ansa-zirconocenedimethyl were investigated using bis(4-methyl-2,6-dibutyl phenoxyl) methyl aluminum as the activator. The results indicate that polymers with high molecular weights were produced in high yields.
