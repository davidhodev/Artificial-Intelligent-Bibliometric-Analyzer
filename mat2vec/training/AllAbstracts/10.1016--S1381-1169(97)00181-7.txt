Four newly synthesized bridged bisindenyl zirconocenes which are derivatives of known structures have been tested in polymerizations of liquid propylene with methylaluminoxane as cocatalyst. They include two asymmetric and two binuclear systems which are suitable for isotactic polymerization. Surprising differences from the behavior of similar systems (regiospecificity, chain termination) are found and discussed.
