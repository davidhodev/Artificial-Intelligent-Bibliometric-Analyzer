Â© 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.We report stable and mechanically robust bi-component nanocomposites capable of post modification for the development of multifunctional liquid-infused materials. The non-polar polymer network provides mechanical robustness and compatibility to mineral oils for lubrication and surface slipperiness, and the polar nanoparticles improve the loading capacity of polar molecules for functionalization. Besides the surface slipperiness, we successfully integrate desirable physicochemical properties into nanocomposites by printing specific inks on the nanocomposites. Unique properties including controlled surface slipperiness, self-reporting on the loss of liquid repellency, and sensing the temperature of contacting liquids are demonstrated on the printed nanocomposites with lubrication treatment. Our design strategy could be applied in the development of multifunctional liquid-infused materials for applications in anti-fouling coating, food/medical packaging, smart windows and sensors.
