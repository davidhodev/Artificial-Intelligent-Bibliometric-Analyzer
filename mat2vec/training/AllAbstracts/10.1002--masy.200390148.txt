Combined systems including diphenylzinc, Ph2Zn, a metallocene, and methylaluminoxane, MAO, have been employed to initiate styrene polymerization and the copolymerization of styrene with p-alkylsubstituted styrenes and Î±-olefins. Both polymerization and copolymerization processes depend on the nature of the metallocene included in the initiator system, the presence of Ph2Zn, the temperature, and the solvent used. S/1-alkene copolymers were obtained when the initiator systems included a zirconocene, but not when a titanocene participated.
