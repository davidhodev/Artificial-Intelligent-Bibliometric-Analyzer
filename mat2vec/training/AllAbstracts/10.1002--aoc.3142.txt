A series of ethylene-bridged C1-symmetric ansa-(3-R-indenyl) (fluorenyl) zirconocene complexes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) incorporating a pendant arene substituent on the 3-position of indenyl ring have been synthesized. The structure of complex 4 was further confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. When activated with methylaluminoxane, four sterically less encumbered complexes 1, 2, 4 and 5 could catalyze the dimerization of propylene in toluene at 100°C to afford 2-methyl-1-pentene with high selectivities up to 95.7-98.4% and moderate activities of 2.00×10 4 to 7.89×104g (mol-Zrh)-1.
