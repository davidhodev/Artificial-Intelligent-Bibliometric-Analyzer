Reported examples of vanadium complexes employed as homogeneous catalyst precursors for olefin polymerization, including some of the recent efforts using (arylimido) vanadium(V) complex catalysts for precise olefin polymerization, are summarized. More recent examples for ethylene dimerization and ring-opening metathesis polymerization to demonstrate the unique characteristics of vanadium are also compiled. Use of thiobis(phenoxy) ligand in place of the dithiolato ligand improved the catalytic activity, and a complex showed remarkable catalytic activities in the presence of cocatalyst. arylimido)vanadium(IV) dichloride complexes has shown high catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization in the presence of Et2AlCl cocatalyst. Feher et al. reported that vanadium-containing silsesquioxane showed catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization in the presence of AlMe3 as the cocatalyst affording polymer with unimodal distribution.
