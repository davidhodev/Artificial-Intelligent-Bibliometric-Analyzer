The structural and kinetic studies of polymerization reactions of ε-caprolactone (ε-CL) using (pyrazolylmethyl)pyridine Cu(ii) and Zn(ii) complexes as initiators is described. Reactions of 2-(3,5- dimethylpyrazol-1-ylmethyl)pyridine (L1) and 2-(3,5-diphenylpyrazol-1-ylmethyl) pyridine (L2) with Zn(Ac)<inf>2</inf>·2H<inf>2</inf>O or Cu(Ac) <inf>2</inf>·2H<inf>2</inf>O produced the corresponding complexes [Zn(Ac)<inf>2</inf>(L1)] (1), [Cu(Ac)<inf>2</inf>(L1)] (2), [Zn(Ac) <inf>2</inf>(L2)] (3) and [Cu<inf>2</inf>(Ac)<inf>4</inf>(L2)<inf>2</inf>] (4) respectively. Solid state structures of 1 and 4 confirmed that complexes 1 and 4 are monomeric and dimeric respectively and that L1 is bidentate in 1 while L2 is monodentate in 4. X-band EPR spectra of 2 and 4 revealed that complex 2 is monomeric both in solid and solution state, while the paddle-wheel structure of 4 is retained in solution. Complexes 1-4 formed active initiators in the ring opening polymerization of ε-CL. Zn(ii) complexes 1 and 3 exhibited higher rate constants of 0.044 h<sup>-1</sup> and 0.096 h<sup>-1</sup> respectively compared to rate constants of 0.017 h<sup>-1</sup> and 0.031 h<sup>-1</sup> observed for the corresponding Cu(ii) complexes 2 and 4 respectively at 110 °C. All the polymerization reactions follow pseudo first-order kinetic with respect to ε-CL monomer. Initiator 1 showed first-order dependency on the polymerization reactions and utilizes only one active site as the initiating group. The molecular weights of the polymers produced range from 1982 g mol <sup>-1</sup> to 14568 g mol<sup>-1</sup> and exhibited relatively broad molecular weight distributions associated with transesterification reactions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.
