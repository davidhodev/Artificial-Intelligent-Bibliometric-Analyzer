ansa-Ligands, Me 2 Si(RInd) 2 [R = 2-p (1) and 3-p-tolyl (2)], have been prepared as a mixture of rac- and meso-isomers in a ratio of 1:1 from the reactions of Me 2 SiCl 2 with cyanocuprates of 1-p-tolylindene and 2-p-tolylindene in diethyl ether, respectively. Pure rac-isomers, 1r and 2r, have been isolated by fractional recrystallization of 1 and 2. Thermal diastereomerization of 1 and 2 between rac- and meso-isomers has been studied by 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. These results imply that 1 and 2 undergo the diastereomerization process by migration of silicon moiety and hydrogen atom, respectively. ansa-Zirconocenes, Me 2 Si(RInd) 2 ZrCl 2 [R = 2-p (3) and 3-p-tolyl (4)], have been prepared from the reactions of the corresponding dilithiated ligands with ZrCl 4 in diethyl ether and hexane at -78°C. The molecular structure of rac-3 has been determined by a single crystal X-ray diffraction study. Propylene polymerization has been studied using rac-3 and meso-4 in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO). Catalyst rac-3 produces a highly isotactic polypropylene (PP) at 0°C by the enantiomorphic site control mechanism and meso-4 affords a syndiotactic dominant PP having a rr triad of 49% at - 30°C by the chain end control mechanism. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.
