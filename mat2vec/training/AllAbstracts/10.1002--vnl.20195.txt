Polymerization of vinyl chloride (VC) with a Cp*Ti(OPh) 3/MAO catalyst in toluene was investigated. The polymerization rate was lower than that in CH2Cl2, and the mm triad concentration of the PVC obtained in toluene was somewhat higher than that of the PVC obtained in CH2Cl2. As the polymerization in toluene proceeded at a considerable rate, a kinetic study of this polymerization was undertaken. The polymer yield increased with reaction time, and the molecular weight of the polymer increased with increasing polymer yield. The Mw/Mn ratio of the polymer decreased with increasing polymerization temperature. The initiator efficiency of the catalyst was low at the initial stage of the polymerization in toluene, but it reached nearly 100% when the polymerization was carried out for more than 30 h. The control of both the molecular weight of PVC and its main-chain structure was found to be possible in the polymerization of VC with the Cp*Ti(OPh)3/MAO catalyst in toluene.
