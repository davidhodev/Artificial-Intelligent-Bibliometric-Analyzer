The complexes were characterized by NMR and elemental analyses. And the quality Ni1 and Ni2 crystals structure was confirmed from X-ray with C-C bridged constrained geometry configuration. On activation with B(C<inf>6</inf>F<inf>5</inf>)<inf>3</inf>, the Ni-based complexes showed high catalytic activities for norbornene homo-polymerization, activities up to 10<sup>6</sup> g PNB mol per Ni per h. The copolymerization of 2-heptoxymethylene norbornene (HN) with norbornene by the pre-catalysts Ni1 and Ni2 was also explored in the presence of B(C<inf>6</inf>F<inf>5</inf>)<inf>3</inf>. High molecular weight polymers with unimodal molecular weight distributions were obtained, indicating that the nature of the polymerization was single site. The catalytic activity, co-monomer incorporation and the properties of the resultant polymers can be controlled over a wide range by tuning the catalyst structures and reaction parameters.
