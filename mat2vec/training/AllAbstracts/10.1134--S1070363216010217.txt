Â© 2016 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.Experimental data on the application of metal complexes in radical polymerization of vinyl monomers collected over the recent 15 years have been analyzed and generalized. Special attention has been given to (un)substituted ferrocenes, macrocyclic (clathro)chelates, and iron porphyrinates as well as to the approaches to enhance their catalytic activity in controlled synthesis of macromolecules. The mentioned systems have been compared with each other as well as with selected complexes of other transition metals. It has been shown that the electronic and spatial structures of the metal complexes are related to their efficiency in the radical polymerization reactions.
