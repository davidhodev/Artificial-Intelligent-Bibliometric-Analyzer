Â© 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.In this study, we have reported the preparation of bi-supported Ziegler-Natta catalysts using magnesium ethoxide and graphene oxide as support. The polymerization process was carried out in slurry phase using triisobutylaluminum as a co-catalyst.The XRD analysis of TiCl4/graphene oxide/Mg(OEt)2 catalyst demonstrated that the space between the layers of graphene oxide had increased to 0.2 nm.The catalyst was characterized by XPS, BET, BJH, SEM, and TGA. The catalyst activity was studied for various Al/Ti molar ratios, and the catalyst activity was optimum at Al/Ti molar ratio of 315.
