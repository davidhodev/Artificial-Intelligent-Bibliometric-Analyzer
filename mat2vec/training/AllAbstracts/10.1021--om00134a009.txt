The compounds Cp 2 ScR (Cp = R = H, Me, p-tol) react readily with nitriles R’CN to provide azomethine complexes Cp 2 ScNC(R)R‘ containing a C=N double bond 1640–1680 cm -1 ). If is used, further reaction may occur to give products containing two nitriles. The related complex Cp 2 ZrH 2 will insert two nitriles in a stepwise manner; however, the dimethyl analogue is unreactive toward nitriles. The compounds Cp 2 ScNC(H)R may be hydrogenated under relatively mild conditions to yield the corresponding amide complexes This transformation is reversible; addition of ethylene leads to dehydrogenation of the amide complex and production of ethane. The amide complexes may be independently synthesized by reaction of Cp 2 ScR (R = H, Me) and the corresponding amine, with resultant elimination of hydrogen or methane, respectively. Cp 2 ScNHCH 2 CMe 3 will catalytically hydrogenate (4 atm of H 2 ) Me 3 CCN to Me 3 CCH 2 NH 2 ; however, termination occurs by insertion of the nitrile into the scandium-amide bond to form Cp 2 ScNC(CMe 3 )NHCH 2 CMe 3 , the NC bond of which is not hydrogenated under these conditions. Labeling experiments show that hydrogen can add reversibly across the Sc-N bond of the amide, and this step is believed to play a crucial role in the catalytic reaction. © 1986, American Chemical Society.
