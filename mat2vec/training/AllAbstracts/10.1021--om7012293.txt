Reacting tetrabenzo[a,c,g,i]fluorenyllithium {TbfLi(THF)4 (1)} with TiCl3(THF)3 (2) leads to the formation of the η5-tetrabenzo[a,c,g,i]fluorenyltitanium(III) derivative TbITiCl2(THF) (3), which can be conveyed to the titanium(IV)complex TbfTiCl3 (4) by oxidative chlorination with CCl4- Subsequent reaction with various lithium phenoxides gives a series of titanium complexes of the type TbITiCl2(OAr) (Ar = 4-tBuC 6H4 (5), 2,6-Me2C6H3 (6), 2,4,6-Me3C6H2 (7), 2,6-iPrC 6H3 (8), 2,6-Ph2C6H3 (9)). Furthermore, 3 was reacted with radicals or radical-generating peroxides to form the complexes TbfTiCl2TEMPO (10) and TblTiCl2CBu (11). All compounds were characterized by IR, MS, and NMR measurements and X-ray crystallography. Finally, compounds 6, 8, 9, and 10 were subjected to ethylene polymerization experiments using d-MAO. The activities increase in the following order [kG(PE)mol(Ti)-1 h-1 bar-1]: 6 (320) < 8 (320) < 10 (760) < 9 (1000). © 2008 American Chemical Society.
