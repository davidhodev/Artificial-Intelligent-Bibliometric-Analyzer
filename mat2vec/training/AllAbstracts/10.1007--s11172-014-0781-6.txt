Synthesis and characterization of the titanocene bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complex Cp<inf>2</inf>Ti(η<sup>2</sup>-Me<inf>3</inf>SiC<inf>2</inf>SiMe<inf>3</inf>) paved the way towards the discovery of three-membered metallacyclopropenes of Group 4 metals (titanium, zirconium, and, later, hafnium) having their own history which is strongly connected with the names of M. E. Voĺpin and his co-workers. Starting from these compounds the very unusual ring-strained "all-C"-five-membered metallacyclocumulenes, metallacyclopentynes, and metalla-cycloallenes of Group 4 metals were obtained and characterized having all their roots in Voĺpińs chemistry. This mini review gives an overview of these unusual molecules as well as some more common molecules like metallacyclopentanes, metallacyclopentenes, and metalla-cyclopentadienes. Very recently instead of these "all-C"-metallacycles the analogous heteroring systems (with N, S, O atoms instead of C) as well as the smaller four-membered metallacycles became the focus of our interest.
