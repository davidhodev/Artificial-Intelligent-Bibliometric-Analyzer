The title compound, [Ti(C5H5)2(C 16H11NO5)]·H2O, exhibits a titanocene unit coordinated to a styrene-substituted pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate ligand synthesized for use as a monomer for polymerization or copolymerization yielding metallocene-containing polymers. The compound crystallized as a monohydrate and the solvent water molecule forms strong O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate O atoms of the Ti complex, which play an important role in the connection of adjacent molecules. In addition, weak inter-molecular C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds also contribute to the crystal packing arrangement.
