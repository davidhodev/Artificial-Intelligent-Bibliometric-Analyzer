The indene ligands {1-C9H7R} [R = C2H 4(C4H7O2) (1), C2H 4(C3H5O2) (2), CH2(C 5H9O) (3)] were prepared by alkylation of indene and used to prepare the SiMe2-bridged indenylcyclopentadiene ligands {Me 2Si(3-C9H6R)(C5Me4H)} [R = C2H4(C4H7O2) (4), CH2(C5H9O) (5)]. Bis(indenyl)-and ansa-indenylcyclopentadienyl zirconocenes [Zr{1-η5-C 9H6R}2Cl2] {R = C2H 4(C4H7O2) (6), C2H 4(C3H5O2) (7), CH2(C 5H9O) (8)} and [Zr{Me2Si(3-η5- C9H5R) (η5-C5Me 4)}Cl2] {R = C2H4(C 4H7O2) (9), CH2(C5H 9O) (10)} were prepared by the reaction of ZrCl4 with the appropriate mono- or dilithium salts of 1-5. The molecular structure of [Zr{Me2Si(3-η5-C9H5C 2H4(C4H7O2)) (η5-C5Me4)}Cl2] (9) was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Indenylzirconium complexes 6-10 were immobilized on thf-modified MgCl2, and these supported systems were used to polymerize ethylene in the presence of methylaluminoxane. The catalytic activity of these complexes in both homogeneous and supported polymerization reactions is discussed. © Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 2008.
