© 2018, The Society of Polymer Science, JapanThe authors had published a novel development of metallocene-based catalysts for the first time in 1985 that made it possible to synthesize syndiotactic polystyrene (SPS). Here, we review the structure and characteristics of SPS, which is a semi-crystalline engineering thermoplastic with a crystalline melting point of 270°C. Because of its crystalline nature, SPS has a high heat resistance, an excellent chemical and water/stream resistance. Furthermore, some mechanistic model for polymerization and stereo regulation as well as the factors which affect the activity and stereospecificity of the catalysts, are discussed.
