Up to 94% yields of isotactic pentads are achieved in the polymerization of propene with the ansa‐zirconocene catalysts 1. It emerges that bulky substituents are decisive for the stereoselectivity, while α‐substituents are decisive for the regioselectivity. Moreover, α‐substituents favor the synthesis of long chains (Mw up to 9190). R1  tBu, iPr; R2  H. Me; μ‐X  Me2CCMe2, Me2Si. (Figure Presented.)
