The novel titanium complex can catalyze the copolymerization of ethylene and N-acetyl-O-(ω-alkenyl)-L-tyrosine ethyl esters efficiently and the highest catalytic activity was up to 6.86 × 104 gP ·(molTi)-1·h-1. The structures and properties of the obtained copolymers were characterized by FT-IR, (1H)13C NMR, GPC, DSC, and water contact angle. The results indicated that the obtained copolymers had a uniformly high average molecular weight of 2.85 × 105 g·mol-1 and a high incorporation ratio of N-acetyl-O-(but-3-enyl)-L-tyrosine ethyl ester of 2.65 mol % within the copolymer chain. The units of the comonomer were isolated within the copolymer chains. The insertion of the polar comonomer into a copolymer chain can effectively improve the hydrophilicity of a copolymer.
