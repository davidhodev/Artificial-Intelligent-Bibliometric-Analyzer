KGaA.Terpolymerization of ethylene and styrene (St) with 1,7-octadiene (OD) using aryloxo-modified half-titanocenes, Cp′ TiCl2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) [Cp′ = Cp∗ (1), tBuC5H4 (2), 1,2,4-Me3C5H2 (3)], proceeds with high catalytic activity and efficient comonomer incorporation, affording high-molecular-weight polymers with unimodal molecular-weight distributions (uniform compositions). An efficient introduction of the reactive functionality, terminal olefinic double bonds, into the side-chain is attained by adopting this method by incorporation of OD without cyclization: the comonomer contents (St, OD) can be controlled by varying the comonomer concentration charged. The resultant polymers possess negligible resonance, ascribed to St-OD repeated insertion. (Chemical Equation Presented).
