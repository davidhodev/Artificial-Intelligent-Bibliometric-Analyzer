Metal contents in polymerization catalysts were comparatively determined by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy. Catalysts were prepared by grafting metallocene onto bare silica or onto silica chemically modified with methylaluminoxane (MAO). Catalysts were compressed as self-supporting pellets (RBS and XRF), or mounted on adhesive copper tape (XPS). The proximity of the mass of the atomic nuclei did not allow resolution by RBS of the signals corresponding to Zr and Nb, nor Si and Al in catalyst systems such as (nBuCp)2ZrCl2/Cp2NbCl2/MAO/SiO 2. On the other hand, Zr, Nb, Si and Al lines were completely resolved in an XRF spectrum. For supported metallocenes on bare silica, XPS measurement was ca. 40% higher than that obtained by RBS. Silica-supported zirconocene showed good agreement in Zr content determination by XRF and RBS. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
