All rights reserved.Oligomeric Cp<inf>2</inf>Zr<sup>+</sup>-allyl species were detected in reaction mixtures of either [Cp<inf>2</inf>ZrMe][MeB(C<inf>6</inf>F<inf>5</inf>)<inf>3</inf>] or [Cp<inf>2</inf>ZrMe][B(C<inf>6</inf>F<inf>5</inf>)<inf>4</inf>] with propylene by a combination of <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionization (tandem) mass spectrometry techniques. Conjointly, the data imply that formation of Cp<inf>2</inf>Zr<sup>+</sup>-allyl species occurs via (re)coordination of alkene (propylene and vinylidene end groups of unsaturated polymer chains, respectively) to Cp<inf>2</inf>Zr<sup>+</sup>R (R = CH<inf>3</inf>, H, polymeryl), followed by intramolecular proton transfer from Cγ to R and release of RH. Analysis of the olefinic region of the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of the reaction mixture obtained from [Cp<inf>2</inf>ZrMe][MeB(C<inf>6</inf>F<inf>5</inf>)<inf>3</inf>] and propylene reveals the presence of a triplet resonance at δ ∼ 5.2, which was attributed to the unprecedented 3-propenyl end group. A plausible mechanism for the origin of the 3-propenyl end groups is discussed. Additionally, a mechanism for incorporation of stereodefects into stereoregular polymers is also discussed. The cationic Cp<inf>2</inf>Zr<sup>+</sup>-allyl intermediates formed during polymerization may contribute to catalyst deactivation.
