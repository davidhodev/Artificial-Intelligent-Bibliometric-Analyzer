Cyclic olefins like cyclobutene, cyclopentene, and norbornene can be polymerized to give isotactic polymers with chiral metallo-cene/aluminoxane catalysts, especially with et(bisindenyl)zir-coniumdichloride/methylalumoxane. The polycycloalkenes show extremely high melting points which are 395°C for polycyclopentene, 485°C for polycyclobutene and over 600°C for polynorbornene, which is more than the decomposition temperature. 13C-NMR spectroscopy provides information about the structure of the highly crystalline homopolymers. To lower the melting points, copolymerization with ethene or propene is carried out. The co-polymerization parameter r1 of the olefins ethene/cyclopentene increases with temperatures from 80 (−10°C) to 300 (20°C). Even when in solution the copolymers obtained using one enantiomer of the chiral zirconocene show a small optical rotation. Polymers of rigid cycloalkenes like dimethanooctahydronaphthalene with ethylene are amorphous and feature high Tg values. They could be used as starting materials for optical discs. The information about aging reactions between zirconocene and aluminoxane sheds more light on the mechanism of homogeneous olefin catalysts. © 1990, Elsevier Science & Technology.
