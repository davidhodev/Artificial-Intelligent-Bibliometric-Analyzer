Based on the reaction of bis(η5-methylcyclopentadienyl) dichlorotitanium(Cp′2TiCl2, Cp′ =η5-C5H4Me) with 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (HNA-1) and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (HNA-2), in the presence of β-cyclodextrin polymer (β-CDP) as a catalyst, two titanocene complexes: bis(η5-methylcyclopentadienyl) 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoatotitanium (1) and bis(η5-methylcyclopentadienyl) 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoatotitanium (2), were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, IR and 1H NMR spectra. X-ray diffraction analysis of 1 and 2 show mononuclear TiIV and indicate that the geometries at titanium are distorted tetrahedra with coordination number four. Both complexes exhibit 3-D frameworks constructed through H-bonding and C-H...π interactions. There are no π-π stacking interactions between the naphthyl rings and cyclopentadienyl rings of 1, while there are three types of π-π interactions in the structure of 2, owing to their different hydroxyl position in naphthalene rings. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.
