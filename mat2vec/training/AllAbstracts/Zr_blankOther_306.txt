Homopolymerization of 4-methyl-1-pentene and its copolymerization with ethylene in the presence of catalysts based on zirconocenes, [(CH3)5Cp]ZrCl3, [(CH3)2C(Cp)2]ZrCl2, [(CH3)2C(Ind)2]ZrCl2, [(C6H5)(C2H5)C(Ind)2]ZrCl 2, [(CH3)2Si(Ind)2]ZrCl2, [(CH3)2C(CH3Cp)(Flu)]ZrCl2, and [(Ph)2C(Cp)(Flu)]]ZrCl2, were studied. It was shown that the order of loading of the reagents affects the yield of poly (4-methyl-1-pentene). Unsymmetrical, bridged metallocenes exhibit the highest activity in polymerization. For the [(CH3)2C(CH3Cp)(Flu)]ZrCl2-methylalu minoxane system, formation of a syndiotactic poly(4-methyl-1-pentene) was observed. In the copolymerization of 4-methyl-1-pentene with ethylene, conditions providing preparation of a linear LDPE with a variable content of 4-methyl-1-pentene units were determined. The effect of the molar ratio of methylaluminoxane : Zr on the yield and composition of the resulting copolymer was revealed.
