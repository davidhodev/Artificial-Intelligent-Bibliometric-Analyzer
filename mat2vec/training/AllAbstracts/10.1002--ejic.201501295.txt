KGaA, WeinheimThe ferrocene-chelating heteroscorpionate complex [(fc(PPh2){BH{(3,5-Me)2pz}2})PdMe] {(fcP,B)PdMe, fc = 1,1′-ferrocenediyl, pz = pyrazole} catalyzes the addition polymerization of norbornene and norbornene derivatives upon oxidation with [AcFc][BArF] {acetyl ferrocenium tetrakis(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)borate}. In situ reduction of [(fcP,B)PdMe][BArF] in the presence of a substituted norbornene results in significant decrease of catalytic activity. Addition of one equivalent of oxidant restores the activity.
