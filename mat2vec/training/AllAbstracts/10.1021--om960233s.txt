Titanium(IV) and zirconium(IV) bent-sandwich complexes containing the new donor substituted [2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl]cyclopentadienyl (CpN) ligand are described. CpNH (1; C5H5CH2CH2NiPr 2) is prepared from sodium cyclopentadienide and 2-chloro-1-(diisopropylamino)ethane. The highly moisture-sensitive metallocene dichlorides Cp2NTiCl2 (2) and Cp2NZrCl2 (3) are synthesized by reaction of CpNLi with TiCl4 and ZrCl4, respectively. In combination with the cocatalyst methylaluminoxane (MAO) they are precursors for ethylene polymerization catalysts. Compounds 2 and 3 react with 2 equiv of HCl with protonation of the amino groups to give the air- and moisture-stable metallocene dichloride dihydrochlorides Cp2NTiCl2·2HCl (4) and Cp2NZrCl2·2HCl (5), which also are found to be precatalysts for the polymerization of ethylene. The dimethyl compounds Cp2NTiMe2 (6) and Cp2NZrMe2 (7) can be obtained by reaction of 2 and 3 with 2 equiv of methyllithium. The dibenzyl complexes Cp2NTiBz2 (8) and Cp2NZrBz2 (9) are formed analogously with a stoichiometric amount of benzylmagnesium bromide. The diphenoxy complex Cp2NTi( OPh)2 (10) is synthesized by reaction of 2 with 2 equiv of lithium phenoxide. The dialkyl compounds 6-8 and the diphenoxy compound 10 show a remarkable activity in the catalytic dehydrocoupling of phenylsilane. Zr(NMe2)4 reacts with 2 equiv of CpNH (1) to give the zirconocene derivative Cp2NZr(NMe2)2 (11) in quantitative yield. The structure of 2 has been determined by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study. The effects of the (dialkylamino)- and (dialkylammonio)-ethyl substituents in metallocene-type compounds of titanium and zirconium are described.
