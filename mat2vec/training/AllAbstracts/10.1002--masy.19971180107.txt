Metallocene/MAO catalysts are useful for the production of syndiotactic polystyrene - a new class of high performance polymers. The melting point of the obtained syndiotactic polystyrene depends on the metallocene used and can reach up to 275°C. In the past, the most active catalysts in polymerization have been half-sandwich titanocenes such as CpTiCl3 and Cp*TiCl3. If the chlorinated compounds are changed into the fluorinated compounds as CpTiF3 and Cp*TiF3, the activity increases by a factor of 5 to 100. The fluorinated titanocenes are more stable at higher temperatures and need a lower MAO excess in order to obtain optimal activities. Polymers obtained with the unsubstituted CpTiF3 show melting points which are 17°C lower than those synthesized by pentamethylcyclopentadienyltitaniumtrifluoride. Especially Cp*TiF3 shows a much higher activity and, compared with the chlorinated compound, gives polymers with a higher molecular weight. Substituted cyclopentadienyltitanocenes have even higher activities. Ethene/styrene copolymers can be obtained by catalysis with zirconocene compounds.
