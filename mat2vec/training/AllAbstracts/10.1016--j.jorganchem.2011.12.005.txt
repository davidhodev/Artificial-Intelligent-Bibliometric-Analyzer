The energies of formation and the heterolytic dissociation energies for the ion pairs Cp′ 2ZrMe +A - (active sites in olefin polymerization) in the presence of Al- and B-containing activators including low-molecular-weight ones X(C 6F 5) 3 (X = Al, B) and a number of models for Al-sites in polymethylaluminoxane (MAO) were obtained from DFT calculations. The reaction mechanisms were thoroughly studied and the energy characteristics of the reactions of the ion pairs Cp′ 2ZrMe +A - with ethylene molecule (Cp′ = η 5-C 5H 5, η 5- C 5Me 5, A - = MeB(C 6F 5) 3 -, MeAl(C 6F 5) 3 -, and [(C 6F 5) 3Al-Me- Al(C 6F 5) 3] - or three models for anions in MAO-containing systems [Me-AOTMA] -, [Me-2AOTMA] -, [Me-3AOTMA] -, AOTMA = Me 2AlO(Al 2Me 5)) were calculated. Heterolytic dissociation energy (energy needed for complete separation of counterions) is found to be a crucial parameter which determines the energy characteristics of the polymerization reaction. We propose that the involvement of the second and third Lewis acid Al-sites in the formation of the ion pair could explain why high Al:Zr ratios (>1 for Al(C 6F 5) 3 and ≫1 for MAO) are necessary for a high catalytic activity of zirconocenes, whereas for B(C 6F 5) 3 an equimolar B:Zr ratio is quite sufficient. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
