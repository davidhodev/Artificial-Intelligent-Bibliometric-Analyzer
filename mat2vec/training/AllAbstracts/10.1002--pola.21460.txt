The formulation of the 4-butenyl end group in zirconocene with catalyzed propulene polymerization, was analyzed. The olefin polymerization with metallocene catalysts has attracted much academic and industrial research interest. The analysis of polymer chain ends provides key structural information for the determination of the chain transfer mechanisms in olefin polymerization. The catalyst solution was prepared in an inert atmosphere adding 1.2 Î¼mol of RhCl(PPh 3) 3 in 10 ml of dry toluene. The evaluation of the intensity of unsaturated groups shows the percentage of 4-butenyl increases with respect to 2-butenyl in the treatment of the polymer with the hydride complex derived from RhCl(PPh 3) 3. The results show that the mechanism of the formation of 4-butenyl chain ends may be the isomerization of cis 2-butenyl catalyzed by a zirconocene hydride complex formed in situ during polymerization.
