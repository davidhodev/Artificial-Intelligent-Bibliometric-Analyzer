Isotactic polybutenes of variable isotacticity and melting points of form I in the range 100-125 °C have been prepared with both C2- and C1 -symmetric zirconocenes. The C1-symmetric zirconocenes bearing the bilateral symmetric 2,5-dimethyl-7H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:4,3-b′] dithiophene ligand connected by a dimethylsilandiyl bridge to a substituted indenyl ligand produce iPB with higher molecular mass, up to 400000 at polymerization temperature of 70 °C in liquid butene. The degree of isotacticity depends on the substitution pattern of the indenyl ligand. The correlations between microstructure and melting points of the crystalline forms I and II of iPB have been defined. Some relevant differences in catalyst selectivity between propylene and 1-butene polymerizations have been identified. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.
