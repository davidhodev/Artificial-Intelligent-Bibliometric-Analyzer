Comparison with the conventional Ziegler-Natta catalyst TiCl4/MgCl2 (I), the modified supported Ziegler-Natta catalysts (iso-PentylO)TiCl3/MgCl2 (II) and (BzO)TiCl3/MgCl2 (III) were prepared as efficient catalysts for copolymerization of ethylene with 1-octene. The complexes (II) and (III) were desirable for the production of random ethylene/1-octene copolymers coupled with higher molecular weight, higher comonomer incorporation within copolymer chain and good yield even at high temperature 80 °C and fairly low Al/Ti molar ratio of 100. The effects of catalysts ligands, Al/Ti molar ratio, polymerization temperature, as well as concentration of 1-octene on the catalytic activity, molecular weight and microstructure of the copolymer were investigated in detail. The structure and properties of the copolymers were characterized with 13C NMR, GPC, DSC and WAXD. The kinetic results also indicate that these catalysts (II) and (III) show higher catalytic activity and the produced polymers feature higher molecular weight, because of lower ratio of Ktrm/Kp and Ktra/Kp, and higher ratio of Ktra/Ktrm which indicates that chain transfer to cocatalyst is predominant. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
