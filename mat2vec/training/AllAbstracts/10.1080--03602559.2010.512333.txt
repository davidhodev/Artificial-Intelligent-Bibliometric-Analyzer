In this paper, the recent development of branched and functional branched polyethylene prepared using Ni- and Pd-based catalysts are reviewed. The influence of ligand species, steric effect, electronic effect and polymerization condition on branching density of resultant polymer prepared using Ni- and Pd-based catalysts is discussed. In addition, the review is also focused on functional branched polyethylene produced by copolymerization of ethylene and polar monomer and copolymerization mechanism. Â© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
