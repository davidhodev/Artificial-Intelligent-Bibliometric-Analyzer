Nearly ten years ago, a research program concerning materials and technologies was defined to develop the very complex cryogenic target for obtaining the combustion of a deuterium-tritium mixture by inertial confinement fusion in the laser megajoule facility. The CEA target fabrication project includes research and development on various organic polymers and materials for the cryogenic laser megajoule target assembly as well as for other targets that can be useful for the fusion program (pre and post-ignition). Recent advances have been accomplished concerning the development of specific organic materials for the fabrication of targets components, including the synthesis of polymers for the laser megajoule microshells and metal-doped organic foams for the elaboration of doped-foam microshells or for the micromachining of components.
