Nickel halide complexes of the type L 2NiX 2 (Ni1-Ni6, X = Cl; Ni7-Ni12, X = Br) bearing 2-benzimidazolyl-N-arylquinoline-8-carboxamide derived ligands have been synthesized and characterized by IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The molecular structures of the representative nickel complexes Ni8 and Ni11 revealed a distorted octahedral geometry at the nickel center. Upon activation with Et 2AlCl, all such nickel pre-catalysts exhibited high activities for ethylene oligomerization. Furthermore, in the presence of MAO, they were shown to perform with good activities for the vinyl polymerization of norbornene. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
