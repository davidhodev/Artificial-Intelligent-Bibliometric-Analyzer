Â© The Author(s) 2014.Polystyrene (PS) nanolatexes were successfully prepared via emulsion polymerization using sodium dodecyl sulfonate as the emulsifier. The effects of emulsifier concentration, initiator concentration, polymerization reaction time, and polymerization reaction temperature on particle size and size distribution of PS colloidal spheres were investigated, respectively. The particle size of the diluted polymer emulsion was about 20 nm, as determined by laser scattering. These obtained PS particles were also characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy.
