In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of deposition of polypyrrole (PPy) films by electropolymerization on stainless steel substrates and fabrication of PPy powders by chemical polymerization using sulfanilic acid azochromotrop (SPADNS) as a new anionic dopant. The problem of low adhesion of PPy films to stainless steel substrates is addressed by the use of SPADNS, which exhibits chelating properties, promoting film formation. The use of fine particles, prepared by the chemical polymerization method, allows impregnation of Ni foams and fabrication of porous electrodes with high materials loading for electrochemical supercapacitors (ES). PPy films and Ni foam based PPy electrodes show capacitive behaviour in Na2SO4 electrolyte. The electron microscopy studies, impedance spectroscopy data and analysis of the SPADNS structure provide an insight into the factors, controlling capacitive behaviour. The Ni foam based electrodes offer advantages of improved capacitive behaviour at high materials loadings and good cycling stability. The area normalized and volume normalized specific capacitances are as high as 5.43 F cm-2 and 93.6 F cm-3, respectively, for materials loading of 35.4 mg cm-2. The capacitance retention of Ni foam based electrodes is 91.5% after 1000 cycles. The Ni foam based PPy electrodes are promising for application in ES. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
