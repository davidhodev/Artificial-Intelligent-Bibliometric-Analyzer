New photoinitiating systems allowing an efficient cationic photopolymerization of epoxides under air using different diode lasers are presented. These new photoinitiating systems are based on various three-component photoinitiating systems i.e. violanthrone-78 (or violanthrone-79, tris(2,2′-bipyridine)ruthenium(ii) dichloride, methylene blue, and iridium(iii) complexes)/diphenyl iodonium salt/tris(trimethylsilyl) silane. Excellent polymerization profiles with high monomer conversions were obtained. These results allow the design of less shrinkable high speed photopolymers usable in the visible wavelength range for a variety of applications in e.g. the manufacture of optical elements. A reaction mechanism is also proposed. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
