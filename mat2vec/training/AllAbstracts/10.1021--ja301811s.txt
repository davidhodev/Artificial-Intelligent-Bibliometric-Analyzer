Coordination polymerization of renewable α-methylene-γ-(methyl) butyrolactones by chiral C 2-symmetric zirconocene catalysts produces stereo-random, highly stereo-regular, or perfectly stereo-regular polymers, depending on the monomer and catalyst structures. Computational studies yield a fundamental understanding of the stereocontrol mechanism governing these new polymerization reactions mediated by chiral metallocenium catalysts. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
