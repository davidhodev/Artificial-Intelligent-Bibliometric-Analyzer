The synthesis and characterization of 16 new boryl-substituted zirconocene dichloride complexes are reported. After activation with methyl aluminoxane (MAO) these complexes are catalysts for homogeneous ethylene polymerization. The combination of these complexes with nickel catalysts containing Lewis basic substituents produces polymers with bimodal molecular weight distributions. © 2007 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung,.
