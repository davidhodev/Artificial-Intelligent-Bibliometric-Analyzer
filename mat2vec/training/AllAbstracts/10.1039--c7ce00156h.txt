Compound 1 displays infinite 2D sheets, which stack upon each other to form a supramolecular 3D network. Topologically, the network can be viewed as a 3,3,3,5-connected four nodal net, which was assigned to a novel topological type, pkb9. Compound 2 shows a 3D assembly with the 3,4,6-connected topology sqc130. Compound 3 and 4 form interdigitated 3D supramolecular networks with a 4-connected sql/Shubnikov topology. Compound 5 shows an unusual 2D → 3D framework with a 3,8-connected tfz-d; UO3 topology. In compound 6, 2D → 3D packing was observed due to weak C-H⋯O interactions that aided in the formation of a 3D network with a 4-connected sql/Shubnikov topology. The luminescence properties of all the compounds in their solid state and as emulsions in various solvents were investigated using nitroaromatic compounds.
