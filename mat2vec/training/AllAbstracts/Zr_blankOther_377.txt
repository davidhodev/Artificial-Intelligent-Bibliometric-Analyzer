Unexpected inactive byproducts were observed in the catalytic polymerization of acetylene using metallocene alkyne complexes Cp2M(L)(η2-Me3SiC2SiMe 3), 1: M = Ti, without L; 2: M = Zr, L = thf. The reaction of 1 was investigated in detail by NMR to give quantitatively at -20 °C the titanacyclopentadiene Cp2Ti-CH=CH-C(SiMe3)=C(SiMe3) (3). Around 0°C 3 starts to rearrange to yield the dihydroindenyl complex 4 via coupling of one Cp-ligand with the titanacyclopentadiene. In the reaction of 2 under analogous conditions a zirconacyclopentadiene Cp2Zr-CH=CH-C(SiMe3)=C(SiMe3) (5) and the dimeric complex [Cp2Zr(C(SiMe3)=CH(SiMe3)] 2[μ-σ(1,2)-C≡C] (6) were observed. Whereas 5 decomposes to a mixture of unidentified paramagnetic species, 6 was isolated and investigated by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray analysis. In the reaction of rac-(ebthi)Zr(η2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) (ebthi = ethylenbis-tetrahydroindenyl) with 2-ethynyl-pyridine the complex rac-(ebthi)ZrC(SiMe3)=CH(SiMe3)](σ-C≡CPy) 7 was obtained, which was investigated by an X-ray analysis. © Johann Ambrosius Barth 1998.
