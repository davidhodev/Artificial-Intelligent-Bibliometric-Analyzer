A new procedure focused on the design and preparation of structured and functional polymer surfaces by combination of two approaches acting simultaneously is developed. The elaboration of micrometer size patterned surfaces by UV-light lithography is reported where, in addition, the surface chemical composition can be controlled by surface segregation of a fluorinated copolymer incorporated in the photopolymerizable mixture. As evidenced by contact angle and XPS measurements, the surface composition can be modified depending on such factors as with the environmental conditions or the concentration of copolymer in the blend. Moreover, the functionality of the copolymer is enhanced by the surface pattern created. As a consequence, the wettability of the films can be modified depending on the pattern and composition of the blend. By using this methodology, functional adaptive sensitive surfaces with a well-defined topography will be obtained in one single step and without the use of tedious and time-consuming multistep procedures.
