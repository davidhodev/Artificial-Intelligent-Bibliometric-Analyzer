The photo-initiated cationic polymerization (PCP) of epoxides using diaryliodonium salt photoacid generators (PAGs) bearing alkyl groups and anions was investigated. The properties and reactivities of a series of iodonium salts containing various cations and anions were compared in the context of a PCP reaction. The products from the decomposition of the cations of these salts were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) spectra. The relationship between the molecular structure of the salts and their reaction mechanism in the PCP reaction was investigated. Based on the results of the investigation, it was concluded that the structures of the cations and anions of the iodonium salts affect the PCP reaction rate, which was controlled by the products from the diaryliodonium salts. As part of an additional investigation, the diaryliodonium salts-epoxide materials were applied to 254 nm-photo-patterning. Copyright Â© 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
