Ti(III)Cp2Cl-catalyzed radical ring opening (RRO) of epoxides or single electron transfer (SET) reduction of aldehydes generates Ti alkoxides and carbon centered radicals which add to styrene, initiating a radical polymerization. This polymerization is mediate in a living fashion by the reversible termination of growing chains with the TiCp2Cl metalloradical. In addition, polymers or monomers containing pendant epoxide groups (glycidyl methacrylate) can be used as substrates for radical grafting or branching reactions by self condensing vinyl polymerization. In addition, Ti alkoxides generated in situ by both epoxide RRO and aldehyde SET initiate the living ring opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone. Thus, new initiators and catalysts are introduced for the synthesis of complex polymer architectures. © 2005 Materials Research Society.
