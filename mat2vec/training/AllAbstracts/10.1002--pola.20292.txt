Metallocene and other transition metal complexes activated by methylaluminoxane are highly active catalysts for the polymerization of olefins, diolefins, and styrene, which was discovered at the University of Hamburg about 25 years ago. These catalysts allow the synthesis of polymers with a highly defined microstructure, tacticity, and stereo-regularity, as well as new copolymers with superior properties such as film clarity, tensile strength, and lower extractables. A better understanding of the mechanism of olefin polymerization leads to findings of other new single site catalysts. The development of the metallocene/MAO-catalysts from their discovery to their present state of the art is presented. Â© 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
