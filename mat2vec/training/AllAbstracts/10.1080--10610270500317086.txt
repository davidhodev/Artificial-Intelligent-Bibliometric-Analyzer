Three chiral coordination polymers have been prepared by reaction of (S)-(-)-nicotine with silver(I) salts. X-Ray crystal structure determinations revealed that these all contain polymer chains in which the nicotine molecule acts as a bridging ligand between four-coordinate silver atoms. In one case additional bridging by nitrate anions leads to a three-dimensional network structure. Â© 2005 Taylor & Francis.
