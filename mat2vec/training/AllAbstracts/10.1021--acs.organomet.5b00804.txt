The concentration of [Cp∗2ZrMe]+ on the support was quantified using a newly developed and straightforward method that involves trapping and releasing the active species by subsequent treatment with vinyl methyl thioethers (CH2CH(CH2)nSMe, n = 1, 2) and ammonium bromide, [Bu4N]Br, followed by quantification using simple 1H NMR spectroscopic tools. Reaction of [Cp∗2ZrMe]+ with the trapping agent results in formation of stable metallacycle [Cp∗2Zr(CH2CHMe(CH2)nSMe)]+ (n = 1, 2); ion exchange in Cp∗2Zr(Br)(CH2CHMe(CH2)nSMe) (n = 1,2). This affords a measure for the number of ionic species that were initially present on the support. In this particular case, full conversion of the decamethyl zirconocene precursor to the corresponding cation, [Cp∗2ZrMe]+, was observed. Whereas trapping with allyl methyl thioether renders a species that is not active in olefin polymerization catalysis, using butenyl methyl thioether as trapping agent provided a species that is catalytically active in the polymerization of olefins. Furthermore, this study shows that the fate of ionic [Cp∗2ZrMe]+ is the same on the support as it is in solution phase.
