Employing a Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation algorithm, tandem polymerization of ethylene is thoroughly investigated. To do this, the evolution of ethylene copolymerization is evaluated in terms of ethylene consumption and 1-hexene accumulation. The results obtained are in good agreement with the existing experimental kinetic data. It is revealed that the pre-trimerization time is a key factor in controlling the architecture of copolymer chains. Moreover, the precise computation of instantaneous and cumulative comonomer contents along with the chemical composition distribution of simulated copolymers provides a comprehensive image of the growing chains during tandem polymerization. A well-established crystallization fractionation (CRYSTAF) analysis mathematical model is applied to delve into the molecular architecture and the crystallization fractionation behavior of the produced polyolefins.
