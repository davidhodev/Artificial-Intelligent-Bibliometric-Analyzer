Â© 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.Abstract: The influence of metallocenes ferrocene, dimer cyclopentadienyl dicarbonyl iron, cyclopentadienyl tricarbonyl manganese, and titanocene dichloride on copolymerization of methyl methacrylate and stryrene initiated by benzoyl peroxide was studied. It was shown that the values of copolymerization constants of monomers and copolymer microstructure change in presence of metallocenes.
