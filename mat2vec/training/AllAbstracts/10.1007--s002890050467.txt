Allylbenzene was polymerized in the presence of two types of homogeneous zirconocene catalysts (co-catalyst methylaluiminoxane). Selective chain termination through ß-hydride elimination or chain transfer to aluminum was observed depending upon the catalysts employed. The rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2, and rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2, catalysts gave the polyallylbenzenes with saturated end groups due to chain transfer to aluminum, while the Cp2ZrCl2 catalyst gave the polyallylbenzenes with vinylidene end groups due to ß-hydride elimination. © Springer-Verlag 1999.
