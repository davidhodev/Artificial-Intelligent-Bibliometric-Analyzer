Nonbridged zirconocene dichlorides, (1,2-Me 2 -4-RC 5 H 2 ) 2 ZrCl 2 (R = Me (3), Ph (4), p-FC 6 H 4 (5), 2-furyl (6), 2-thienyl (7), and Fc (8)), and meso- and rac-(1-Me-3-PhC 5 H 3 ) 2 ZrCl 2 (9 and 10), in the presence of MAO show a high catalytic activity (8.1-17.4 × 10 6 gPP/molZr · h) in the polymerization of propylene and produce almost an atactic elastomeric polymer of high molecular weight (M w = 10.5 - 23.2 × 10 4 ). In contrast, rac-(1-Me-3-t-BuC 5 H 3 ) 2 ZrCl 2 (12) shows very low activity and produces a rather high isotactic polymer of low molecular weight.
