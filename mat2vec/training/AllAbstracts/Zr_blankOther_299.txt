The use of zirconocene coupling reactions for the synthesis of novel conjugated polymers with interesting electronic properties is explored. It is demonstrated that zirconocene-coupling reactions provide a versatile method for tuning the electronic and optical properties via manipulation of the chemical structure and composition of the polymer backbone. This chemistry is used to synthesize highly emissive polymers containing electron-deficient thiophene-1-oxide and dioxide units and a base-dopable Cp-containing polymer.
