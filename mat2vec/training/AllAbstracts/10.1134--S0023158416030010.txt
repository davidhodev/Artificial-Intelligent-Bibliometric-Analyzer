© 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.The effects of the structure of organomodified montmorillonite and the conditions of its catalytic activation by titanium and vanadium chlorides on the synthesis of nanocomposite materials based on ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene with an exfoliated structure by an in situ polymerization method were studied. It was shown that, with the use of organomodified montmorillonite with the interplanar spacing d001 = 1.6–1.8 nm, in which the alkyl radicals of a modifier are arranged in parallel to the basal silicate surfaces, the catalyst is adsorbed only on the external surface of particle, and it does not penetrate into the interlayer space (in this case, the exfoliation of a filler does not occur). With the use of montmorillonite samples with d001 > 2 nm with the packing of a modifier as paraffin-like mono- or bilayers, the catalyst is predominantly intercalated into the interlayer space of the layer silicate. As a result, in the course of polymerization, polyethylene is formed in the interlayer space of particles to facilitate the exfoliation of the filler in separate nanolayers. Conditions for the supporting of a catalyst onto organomodified montmorillonite, which prevent the transfer of the catalyst into solvent and the formation of a free polymer on the synthesis of nanocomposites under the conditions of suspension polymerization in n-heptane, were determined. The intercalation of a catalyst into the interlayer space of the particles of layered silicates and the exfoliation of filler particles in the course of the synthesis of composites were confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis.
