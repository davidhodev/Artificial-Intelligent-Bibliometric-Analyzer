The copolymerization of ethylene(E) and norbornene (N) was examined by using various metallocene catalysts and modified-MAO(MMAO) cocatalyst. For C2-symmetry catalysts such as rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2, Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2, Me2 Si(Cp)2ZrCl2 and Cs-symmetrical iPr(FluCp)ZrCl2 as well as CGC and di-bridged zirconocene, the effects of catalyst structure and [N]/[E] feed ratio on catalyst activity, thermal property and [N] content of copolymer (COC) was investigated. For rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst of a constant [N]/[E] feed ratio, the appropriate conditions of [Al]/[Zr] mole ratio, polymerization temperature and cocatalyst structure were found to be 3000, 40 °C, MMAO cocatalyst, respectively. As [N]/[E] feed ratio increased, the incorporation of norbornene to copolymer increased while the activity of catalyst decreased except for iPr(FluCp)ZrCl2. With consideration of catalyst activity as well as N content, it was found that rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2/MMAO system exhibited relatively high activity and controllable Tg. Monomer reactivity ratio was determined by Kelen-Tüdös method.
