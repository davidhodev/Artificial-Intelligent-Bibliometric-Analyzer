The catalyst systems (FI)TiCl3/MAO (FI = phenoxyimine ligand with an additional aryl-O-CH3 donor) display exceptionally high activity in selective ethylene trimerization. By means of NMR and EPR spectroscopy, the nature of the Ti species formed in the catalyst systems (FI)TiCl3/MAO, (FI)TiCl3/MMAO, and (FI)TiCl 3/AlR3/[Ph3C]+[B(C6F 5)4]- (R = Me, Et, iBu) has been studied. It was shown that outer-sphere ion pairs of the type [(FI)Ti IVMe2]+[A]- ([A]- = [MeMAO]-, [MeMMAO]-, [B(C6F5) 4]-) are formed at the initial stage of the reaction of (FI)TiCl3 with MAO, MMAO, and AlMe3/[Ph3C] +[B(C6F5)4]-. These ion pairs further partially convert into TiIII and TiII species. In the systems (FI)TiCl3/MAO and (FI)TiCl 3/AlMe3/[Ph3C]+[B(C 6F5)4]-, complexes with the proposed structures (FI)TiIIIMe2, (FI)TiIICl, and [(FI)TiII(S)]+[A]- ([A]- = [MeMAO]-, [B(C6F5)4)]-, S = solvent, vacancy) were observed (concentrations of TiIII species was lower than those of the TiII congeners). In contrast, in the system (FI)TiCl3/MMAO, the concentrations of TiIII species (ion pairs of the type [(FI)TiIII(μ-H)(μ-Cl)Al iBu2]+[MeMMAO]-) were higher than those of the TiII counterparts (ion pairs [(FI)TiII(S)] +[MeMMAO]-). The system (FI)TiCl3/MMAO displays lower activity and selectivity in 1-hexene formation, in comparison to (FI)TiCl3/MAO, due to undesirable PE generation. Probably, Ti II and TiIV ion pairs are those participating in ethylene trimerization. © 2014 American Chemical Society.
