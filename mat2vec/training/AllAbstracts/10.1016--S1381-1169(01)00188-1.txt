The different elementary steps in the racEt(Ind)2ZrCl2 activation process by commercial methylaluminoxane (MAO) are studied by UV-VIS spectroscopy technique and correlated with hexene polymerization kinetics. After monomethylation of the zirconocene dichloride (λ = 396 nm), abstraction of Cl ligand by MAO at low Al:Zr ratios (Al:Zr = 150) yields tight ion pairs, [racEt(Ind)2ZrMe]+, [MAOCl]- with an absorption band centered at λ = 440 nm, inactive towards hexene polymerization. Addition of MAO in large excess (Al:Zr = 2000) is therefore required to form active species identified as TMA separated ion pairs, [racEt(Ind)2Zr+ (μ-Me)2AlMe2], [MAO∼Cl]- (λ = 470 nm). The activation of racEt(Ind)2ZrMe2 by MAO reveals much easier and is complete at low Al:Zr ratios (Al:Zr = 150), yielding directly active ion pairs [racEt(Ind)2ZrMe]+, [MAOMe]-, absorbing at λ = 439 nm. These data underline the negative role of [MAOCl]- as a counter-anion in the activation process of zirconocene dichloride precursor for olefin polymerization. In the same conditions, the use of TMA-depleted MAO allows the direct formation, at low Al:Zr ratio, of active tight ion pairs λ = 440 nm). © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
