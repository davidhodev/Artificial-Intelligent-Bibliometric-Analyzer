Monocyclopentadienyl titanium complexes of the type Cp∗TiX2L (Cp∗ = C5Me5, 1: L = C6F5S, X = OMe; 2: L = C6F5S, X = Cl; 3: L = 2, 6-Me2-C6H3S, X = OMe) have been synthesized with high yields. These complexes are used as the catalysts for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene. High catalytic activity is observed, and a polymer with high molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution is obtained. It is concluded that not only the sulfur-containing donor ligand but also the anion ligand strongly affects the polymerization activity and the molecular weight of the resultant polymer.
