Approaches for control over polymer chain growth under radical initiation polymerization with the use of organometallic compounds are considered. The effect of metallocomplexes on the kinetic parameters of polymerization, the molecular-mass characteristics of macromolecules, and the structure and composition of the copolymers has been analyzed by the example of specific compounds. It has been shown that, in some cases, transition-metal complexes may be regarded as reversible scavengers of radicals and efficient agents of controlled free-radical polymerization. The main pathways of interaction of propagation radicals with organometallic compounds, including the reversible acceptance of macroradicals by metallocomplexes, have been estimated.
