With homogenous catalysts on the basis of chiral metallocenes and methylaluminoxane it has become possible to polymerize cyclic olefins like cyclobutene, cyclopentene or norbornene. No ring opening reaction occurs. The crystalline polycycloalkenes show extremly high melting points between 400 and 600°C. Copolymers of cyclopentene with propene are amorphous. They have a low molecular weight and glass transition point. On the other hand the glass transition temperature of norbornene/ethene copolymers exceeds 130°C. These copolymers could be used as materials for optical discs and fibers. Copyright © 1991 Hüthig & Wepf Verlag
