The reaction of the lithium salt of backbone fluorinated β-diketiminate ligands, ArNC(CF3)CHC(CF3) NArLi, with trans-[NiCl(Ph)(PPh3)2] gives nickel (II) complexes, ArNC(CF3)CHC(CF3)NAr(Ph) (PPh3)Ni (Ar = 2, 6-Me2C6H3:1; 2, 6-iPr 2C6H3:2). When activated by methylaluminoxane (MAO), both complexes polymerize norbornene rapidly via a vinyl-type polymerization mechanism. Treatment of nickel complex 1 with oxygen gives rise to intramolecular aerobic hydroxylation. The oxygenated species 3 was characterized by X-ray crystallography.
