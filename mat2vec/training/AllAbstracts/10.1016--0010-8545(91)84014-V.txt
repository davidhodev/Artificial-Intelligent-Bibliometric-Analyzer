This paper gives an introduction to photopolymerchemistry with special emphasis to photopolymerzations using organometallic initiators. Photopolymers are used in various processes for the manufacturing of printed circuit boards (PCBs) and for integrated circuits in microelectronic applications. Organometallic compounds have a great potential as photoinitiators for free-radical initiated (vinyl-group-bearing compounds, i.e. acrylates) and cation initiated (epoxides or vinyl ethers) polymerizations. Two new photoinitiators from our research laboratories, titanocenes and iron arenes shall demonstrate the usefulness of organometallic chemistry for imaging systems. The bis-cyclopentadienyl-titanium-bis-pentafluorophenyl shows high sensitivity in radical initiated processes and has exceptional stability in acrylic resist formulations. Trapping experiments of the titanocene under exposure with the stable radical TMPO gave a Cp(C6F5)Ti(TMPO)2 and a pentafluorophenyl-cyclopentadienyl. The observed primary photoproduct is assigned to a mono-hapto-cyclopentadienyl derivative which has free coordination sites for the addition of i.e. acrylates. From (η5-cyclopentadienyl)(η6-benzene)Fe(II)hexafluorophos phate a Lewis acid is generated under exposure with the loss of the benzene ligand. The free coordinatior sites can be captured by nucleophiles, i.e. epoxides, which react to cyclic polyethers With ethylene oxide, bis-[12]crown-4-iron-bishexafluorophosphate is formed. Two new preparation procedures are described for the synthesis of iron arene complexes. Starting from ferrocene, iron arene complexes can be synthesized in the presence of an aromatic compound, AlCl3 and TiCl4 in high yields. Beside the iron sandwich compound, also titanocene-dichloride is formed. Thermal ligand exchange reactions with thermally labile iron arene complexes allow to synthesize new derivatives with heterocyclic ligands or functionalized aromatics. © 1991.
