The study of ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization with the zirconocene catalyst, bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride (Cp2ZrCl 2)/methylaluminoxane (MAO), anchored on a MgCl2(THF) 2 support was carried out. The influence of 1-hexene concentration in the feed on catalyst productivity and comonomer reactivity as well as other properties was investigated. Additionally, the effect of support modification by the organoaluminum compounds [(MAO, trimethlaluminum (AlMe3), or diethylaluminum chloride (Et2AlCl)] on the behavior of the MgCl 2(THF)2/Cp2ZrCl2/MAO catalyst in the copolymerization process and on the properties of the copolymers was explored. Immobilization of the Cp2ZrCl2 compound on the complex magnesium support MgCl2(THF)2 resulted in an effective system for the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene. The modification of the support as well as the kind of organoaluminum compound used as a modifier influenced the activity of the examined catalyst system. Additionally, the profitable influence of immobilization of the homogeneous catalyst as well as modification of the support applied on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the copolymers was established. Finally, with the successive self-nucleation/annealing procedure, the copolymers obtained over both homogeneous and heterogeneous metallocene catalysts were heterogeneous with respect to their chemical composition.
