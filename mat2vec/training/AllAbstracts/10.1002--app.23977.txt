Ethylene polymer was synthesized by the treatment of a metallocene catalyst Zr(CP)2Cl2 solution with ultrasonic energy. Ultrasonic energy irradiation was used to change the polymer structure of the formed polymer. Different ultrasonic energy irradiation times were applied to the metallocene catalyst solution. The ultrasonic energy had an effect on the average molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and polymer productivity. A lower average molecular weight and a narrower molecular weight distri bution were produced with a longer ultrasonic irradiation time. The polymer productivity was almost constant when the metallocene catalyst was treated with ultrasonic energy. Finer polyethylene particles were produced with longer ultrasonic irradiation times.
