The interactions, in the excited states, between a coumarin and a ketocoumarin together with bisimidazole derivative, mercaptobenzoxazole, titanocene have been studied by laser absorption spectroscopy and by photoconductivity. The redox potentials of these different compounds have been measured and led to the calculation of free enthalpy change for a possible electron transfer reaction. The whole results show that the coumarin is able to demonstrate the formation of radicals through an electron transfer reaction with the additives. On the other hand, the ketocoumarin rather leads to an energy transfer reaction with bisimidazole and to a hydrogen abstraction reaction with the benzoxazole derivative. This study presumes that several coumarin or ketocoumarin / additives combinations should be able to initiate a radical polymerization reaction.
