KGaA, Weinheim Dynamic and static nature of intramolecular π-π interactions between ethylene moieties in diethenodihydronaphthanaphtalene (1 b) and derivatives (2 b–12 b) are elucidated by employing QTAIM-DFA (QTAIM dual functional analysis). During the course of the investigations, doubly degenerated bond paths were detected between carbon atoms in opposite benzene rings of dibenzo-derivative of 1 b with an etheno-bridge on the backside (11 b). It must be very curious, since one BP should correspond to an interaction between two carbon atoms. Intramolecular π-π interactions in 1 b–12 b are all classified by the pure CS (closed shell) interactions. The interactions between ethylene groups, with no substituents as in 1 b–8 b, are predicted to have the van der Waals (vdW) nature. Those for 9 b–12 b have the hydrogen bond (HB) nature with no covalency, where the ethylene moieties are included in one or two benzene ring(s), except for 10 b, if evaluated with MP2/6-311G(3d). The character in 10 b is close to the borderline area between the vdW and HB nature with no covalency, although should be the vdW type. The interactions in 2 b–12 b evaluated with MP2/6-311G(3d) are predicted to be somewhat stronger than the case with MP2/6-311G(d), as a whole.
