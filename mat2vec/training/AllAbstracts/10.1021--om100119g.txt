Hetero-bimetallic Ti-Al complexes containing tris(aryloxo)amine ligands of type [TiR′{(μ2-O-2,4-R2C6H 2-6-CH2)(O-2,4-R2C6H 2-6-CH2)2N}][R′2Al(μ 2-OiPr)] [3a,b and 4a; R = Me (3), tBu (4); R′ = Me (a), Et (b)] have been prepared by reacting Ti(O iPr)[(O-2,4-R2C6H2-6-CH 2)3N] [R = Me (1), tBu (2)] with 1.0 equiv of AlR′3 in toluene. Crystallographic analyses of 3a,b and 4a reveal that these complexes have a distorted octahedral geometry around Ti and a distorted tetrahedral geometry around Al. Complexes 3a,b and 4a exhibited moderate catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization in toluene in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO) at 80-120 °C, and 4a showed higher activity than 3a,b. The tert-butyl analogue (4a) itself polymerizes ethylene without cocatalysts to afford high molecular weight polymer with a uniform distribution, clearly suggesting a hypothesis that cleavage of Ti-O bonds would generate the catalytically active cationic species in this catalysis. © 2010 American Chemical Society.
