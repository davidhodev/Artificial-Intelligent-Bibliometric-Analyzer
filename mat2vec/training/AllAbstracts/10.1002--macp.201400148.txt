New thiophene derivatives (THs) are prepared and proposed here as new photoinitiators in combination with an iodonium salt for the cationic polymerization of vinylethers. They contain electron donor and electron acceptor (D-A) moieties and exhibit red-shifted absorption spectra. They allow the use of a long-wavelength excitation at 532 nm using a laser diode. Irradiation from a green light-emitting diode (LED) at 514 nm can also be used. The high reactivity upon irradiation from the low-intensity green LED highlights the high reactivity of the proposed structures. Interesting polymerization profiles (with conversions up to 70%) are obtained. The initiation step mechanisms are analyzed by electron spin resonance (ESR), fluorescence measurements, steady-state photolysis, and laser flash photolysis experiments. New thiophene derivatives (THs) are prepared and proposed as new highly efficient photoinitiators in combination with an iodonium salt for the cationic polymerization of vinylethers. They contain electron donor and electron acceptor (D-A) moieties and exhibit excellent visible light absorption. Â© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
