Â© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Si-H-containing syndiotactic polystyrene is synthesized by the direct polymerization of 4-vinyiphenyldimethylsilanol in the presence of a half-sandwich scandium catalyst system [(C5Me4SiMe3)Sc(CH2C6H4NMe2-o)2]/[Ph3C][B(C6F5)4]. By the one-step efficient hydrosilylation reaction, the perylene bisimide units are quantitatively linked to the Si-H-containing syndiotactic polystyrene backbone. The perylene bisimide units functionalized syndiotactic polystyrene exhibits liquid crystallinity, fluorescence, and electron transporting properties.
