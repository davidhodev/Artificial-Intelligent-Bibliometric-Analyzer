We report the synthesis of poly(l-lactide) and poly(hexyl isocyanate) macromonomers using bischloro-η5-cyclopentadienyl(bicyclo[2.2.1]-hept-5-en-2-oxy) Titanium (IV), [CpTiCl2(O-NBE)]. These macromonomers bearing a norbornene end group were polymerized towards brush copolymers employing Grubbs' first generation catalyst. Brush copolymers consisting of blocks with different side chains were synthesized. The polymers were characterized by Size Exclusion Chromatography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, and their thermal properties were investigated by Thermogravimetric Analysis, and Differential Scanning Calorimetry analysis. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
