The recently described reaction products of zirconacyclopropenes Cp 2Zr(η2-Me3SiC2SiMe3) and five-membered zirconacyclocumulenes (zirconacyclopenta-2,3,4-trienes) Cp*2Zr(η4-1,2,3,4-RC4R), Cp* = η5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, R = Me, Me3Si and Ph, with i-Bu2AlH are active catalysts in the polymerization of ethylene and in the ring opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone. Here we describe the different activity of these complexes after thermal activation or if additional i-Bu2AlH together with water are added. These results are compared to those which were obtained with the complexes Cp2Zr(η 4-1,2,3,4-H2C4H2), rac-(EBTHl)ZrF2, roc(EBTHI)ZrCl2, [rac-(EBTHI)Zr(H)(μ- H)]2 and roc (EBTHI)Zr(F)CH2-CH2( 2-Py) after activation with i-Bu2AlH together with water. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
