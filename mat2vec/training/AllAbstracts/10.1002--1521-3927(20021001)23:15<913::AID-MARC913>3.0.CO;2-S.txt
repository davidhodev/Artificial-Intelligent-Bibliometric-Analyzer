The polymerization of vinyl chloride with Cp*TiX3/MAO (X = OCH3, OC4H9, OPh, Cl) catalysts in CH2Cl2 was investigated. The activity of the Cp*TiX3/MAO catalytic systems depends on ligand X in that increased activity was found for increasing electron-donating capacity of X. The relationship between Hammet's Ïƒm of ligand X and polymer yield gave a straight line, indicating that the electronic effect of X plays an important role.
