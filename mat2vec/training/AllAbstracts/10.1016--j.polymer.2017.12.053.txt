© 2017 Elsevier Ltd Copolymerization of norbornene (NB) and 1,5-hexadiene (HD) was performed using a fluorenylamido-ligated titanium catalyst which conducts copolymerization of NB and 1-alkene. The obtained copolymers possessed pendant vinyl groups, of which content was varied from 0 to 9.4% by the initial feed ratio of the monomers. The copolymers were soluble in various solvents even at high conversion (>85%), showing that the crosslinking of pendant vinyl groups was negligible. The glass transition temperature of the copolymer was changed from 79 °C to over 300 °C, depending on the comonomer composition. Post-functionalization of the pendant vinyl groups with 3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-nonafluoro-1-hexene via ruthenium-catalyzed metathesis reaction was also performed and fluoroalkyl-functionalized cyclic olefin copolymer was successfully obtained. The fluorinated copolymer film showed higher contact angle than the unfunctionalized copolymer.
