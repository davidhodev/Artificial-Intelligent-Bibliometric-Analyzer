Three tantalocene dichloride complexes, Cp*(Cp-R)Ta(IV)Cl 2, with one pentamethylated cyclopentadienyl ligand, Cp*= η 5-C 5Me 5, Me = CH 3, and one monosubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligand, Cp-R, Cp = η 5-C 5H 5, R = H, SiMe 3 or (CH 2) 3NC 4H 4, have been studied in acetonitrile solutions with cyclic voltammetry in the ranges of the Ta(IV) oxidation to Ta(V) or of its reduction to Ta(III). The former transition is reversible, while the latter one gives an irreversible wave due to the dissociation of the reduced complex with the loss of one chloride ligand. The redox transformation from the initial state of complex Cp*CpSiMe 3TaCl 2 to its oxidized state, Cp*CpSiMe 3TaCl 2 +, and back was monitored by spectroelectrochemical measurements in a thin-layer acetonitrile solution. Kinetic data for the evolution of the UV-visible spectrum of the system in the course of the double potential step experiment were treated on the basis of two theoretical models as the reactant diffusion across the solution layer without or with taking into account ohmic losses. The values of the diffusion coefficients of the complex in its initial and oxidized (cationic) states have been estimated. It was demonstrated that this complex in each of two oxidation states, Ta(IV) or Ta(V), is represented by a single molecular form. An attempt to deposit a conducting polymer film by oxidation of the tantalocene complex containing a pyrrole group attached to the Cp ring, Cp*Cp(CH 2) 3PyTaCl 2, led to a thin insulating layer at the electrode surface because of an inhibiting effect of chloride anions. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.
