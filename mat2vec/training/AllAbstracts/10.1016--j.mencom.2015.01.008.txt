Â© 2015 Mendeleev Communications. Published by Elsevier B.V. The DFT study of magnesium dichloride effect on the catalytic activity of titanium complexes LTi(Y)Cl (where L is a saligenin-type ligand, and Y is Cl or Me) in olefin polymerization has demonstrated that heterobinuclear titanium-magnesium complex with -O- and -Cl- bridging bonds is the most stable product of the reaction between MgCl2 and LTi(Y)Cl and the most probable catalytic particle for ethylene polymerization.
