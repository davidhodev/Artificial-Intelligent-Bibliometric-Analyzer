Recent examples for synthesis and reaction chemistry with (imido)vanadium(V)-alkyl, -alkylidene complexes have been briefly summarized. (Arylimido)vanadium(V) dichloride complexes especially containing aryloxo ligands exhibited notable activities for ethylene polymerization, and the reacition pathways for the polymerization/dimerization using (imido)vanadium(V) dichloride complexes containing (2-anilidomethyl)pyridine ligands can be tuned by modification of the steric bulk in the imido substituents; the adamantylimido analogues exhibited exceptionally high both activity and selectivity in the dimerization. These vanadium(V)-alkyl complexes showed unique reactivity toward phenols; the reaction proceeds via coordination of phenols to the vanadium. The vanadium(V)-alkylidene complexes were generated by α-hydrogen elimination from the dialkyl analogues in the presence of PMe 3 etc.; the subsequent 1,2-C-H bond activation of benzene with (arylimido)vanadium(V)- alkylidene containing 1,3-(2',6'-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin-2-iminato (Im DIPPN) ligand took place cleanly. © 2012 The Chemical Society Located in Taipei & Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
