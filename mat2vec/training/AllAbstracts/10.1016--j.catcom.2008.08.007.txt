Here, the copolymerization of ethylene/1-octene with zirconocene/dMMAO catalyst using different pore sized silica-based supports was investigated. It revealed that the large pored silica [SiO2 (LP)] exhibited the highest polymerization activity due to both highest amount of available active sites present along with the moderate interaction between dMMAO and the support. The strong interaction between dMMAO and the support as proven by TGA analysis apparently resulted in dramatically decreased polymerization activity for the bimodal pored silica-alumina [Si-Al (BP)]. The copolymers produced were further characterized by means of DSC and 13C NMR. Although they exhibited the similar triad distribution, the degree of 1-octene insertion was different.
