Characteristics of methyl methacrylate (MMA) polymerization using oscillating zirconocene catalysts, (2-Ph-Ind)2ZrX2 (X = Cl, 1; X = Me, 2), mixtures of rac- and meso-zirconocene diastereomers, (SBI)ZrMe2 [3, SBI = Me2Si(Ind)2] and (EBI)ZrMe2 [4, EBI = C2H4(Ind)2], as well as diastereospecific metallocene pairs, rac-4/Cp2ZrMe 2 (5) and rac-4/CGCTiMe2 [6, CGC = Me 2Si(Me4C5)(t-BuN)], are reported. MMA polymerization using the chloride catalyst precursor 1 activated with a large excess of the modified methyl aluminoxane is sluggish, uncontrolled, and produces atactic PMMA. On the other hand, the polymerization by a 2/1 ratio of 2/B(C6F5)3 or 2/Ph3CB(C 6F5)4 is controlled and produces syndiotactic PMMA. Mixtures of diastereomeric ansa-zirconocenes 3 or 4 containing various rac/meso ratios, when activated with B(C6F5)3, yield bimodal PMMA; this behavior is attributed to the meso-diastereomer that, in its pure form, affords bimodal, syndio-rich atactic PMMA. For MMA polymerization using diastereospecific metallocene pairs, rac-4/5 and rac-4/6, the isospecific catalyst site dominates the polymerization events under the conditions employed in this study, and the aspecific and syndiospecific sites are largely nonproductive, thereby forming only highly isotactic PMMA.
