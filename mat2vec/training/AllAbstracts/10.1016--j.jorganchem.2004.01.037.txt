An easy and inexpensive three-step synthesis of new 2,3-dimethyl-1,4-diphenylcyclopentadiene (3) ligand and the titanium and zirconium homometallocene dichlorides [TiCl2 (η5-C5H-2,3-Me2-1, 4-Ph2)2] (4), [ZrCl2 (η5-C5H-2,3-Me2-1, 4-Ph2)2] (5), and the mixed ligand zirconium complex [ZrCl2(η5-C5H-2, 3-Me2-1,4-Ph2)(η5-C5 H5)] (6) prepared thereof are described. The polymerization of ethene using 4-6/MAO catalysts revealed that zirconocene complexes 5 and 6 displayed moderate and high activity, respectively, whereas the titanium catalyst 4/MAO was inactive. The crystal structures of 4 and 5 were determined by X-ray crystallography. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
