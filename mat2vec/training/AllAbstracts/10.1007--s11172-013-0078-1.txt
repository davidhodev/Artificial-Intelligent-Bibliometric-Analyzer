Isobutylalumoxanes of different composition were synthesized by the hydrolysis of triisobutylaluminum (TIBA) with crystalline hydrate CuSO 4·5H2O and water taken as cooled ice or as vapor. The composition of the formed alumoxanes and the degree of water participation in their formation was monitored by 1H NMR. The hydrolysis of TIBA on CuSO4·5H2O is rather selective method of synthesis of alumoxanes. The synthesized alumoxanes were used for the activation of dimethylated zirconocenes rac-Me2Si(2-Me,4-PhInd) 2ZrMe2 and rac-Et(2-MeInd)2ZrMe2 in propylene polymerization at the molar ratios Al/Zr = 50-750. It was concluded that the hydrolysis afforded several products with different structures and different activating ability. The systems with oligomeric forms of isobutylalumoxanes, especially those obtained by TIBA hydrolysis with water, showed the highest activity. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.
