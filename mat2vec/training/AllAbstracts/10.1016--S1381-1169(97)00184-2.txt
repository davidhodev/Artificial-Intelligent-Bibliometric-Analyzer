The polymerization of propylene was studied with a series of dinuclear early transition metal zirconocene-late transition metal complexes bridged by phosphido and arsenido moieties of general formula [(η5-C5H4R'')2Zr{μ-ERR'}2M(CO)(n)] (E = P, R = R' = SiMe3, R''= H, M = Mo, n = 4 (1); E = P, R = R' = SiMe3, R'' = H, M = Ni, n = 2 (2); E = As, R = R' = SiMe3, R''= H, M = Cr, n = 4 (3); E = P, R = H, R' = 2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2, R''= Me, M = Mo, n = 4 (4); E = P, R = H, R' = 2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2, R''= Me, M = Cr, n = 4 (5)), as well as with the corresponding monometallic zirconocene precursor complexes of the type [(η5-C5H4R'')2Zr(ERR')2] (E = P, R = R' = SiMe3, R'' = H (6); E = P, R = H, R' = 2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2, R'' = H (7)) and [(η5-C5H4Me)2Zr(ERR')Cl] (E = P, R = H, R' = 2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2 (8)). The active cationic species were generated treating the complexes with an excess of methylalumoxane (MAO). The catalytic activity was found to be strongly dependent on temperature and catalyst/MAO ratio.
