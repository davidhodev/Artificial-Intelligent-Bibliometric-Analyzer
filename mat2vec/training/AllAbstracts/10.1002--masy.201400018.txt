Amongst the three classes of chain transfer agents (metal hydrides, metal aryl/alkyls, organics) investigated for the MMA polymerization catalyzed by Cs-ligated catalyst 1, the Lewis acid B(C6F5)3, metal hydrides MH (M = K, Na, Li) and the organic PhNMe2 promote efficient catalytic polymerization, while metal alkyls such as Et3Al and Et2Zn serve only as the scavenger and/or monomer activator and thus do not promote chain transfer. In the presence of 5 equivalents of KH, both Cs-ligated catalyst 1 and achiral C2v-ligated catalyst 3 promote catalytic MMA polymerization through effective chain transfer, whereas C2-ligated catalyst 2 shows no chain transfer. Of several other conjugated polar vinyl monomers investigated, including acrylamides and α-methylene-γ-butyrolactones, only N,N-diphenylacrylamide (DPAA) exhibits catalytic polymerization behavior. Thus, in the presence of enantiopure pre-catalyst (S,S)-4 and excess B(C6F5)3, DPAA is polymerized catalytically and asymmetrically to optically active poly(DPAA) with a narrow MWD of 1.02.
