© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.An efficient mediated electrosynthesis of the spherical (85 nm) nanocomposite material Pd@p(MVCA8+-co-St) was carried out in an aqueous medium. Ultrasmall palladium nanoparticles (3—8 nm) are stabilized in nanocapsules of water-soluble nanoparticles of the copolymer p(MVCA8+-co-St) consisting of tetraviologen calix[4]resorcinol (MVCA8+) with styrene (St). The role of the mediator is played by viologen units of a polymer nanoparticle at potentials of the MV2+/MV∙+ redox couple. The high catalytic activity of the nanocomposite material in the reduction of nitrophenol with sodium borohydride is shown.
