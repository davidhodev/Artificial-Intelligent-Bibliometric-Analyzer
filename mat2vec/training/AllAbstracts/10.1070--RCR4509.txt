Â© 2015 Russian Academy of Sciences and Turpion Ltd.The electrochemical and chemical methods for synthesizing conducting polymer-metal nanocomposite materials are considered as well as the main factors affecting the structure and electrochemical properties of these composites. The experimental data on the catalytic activity of conducting polymer - metal electrodes are analyzed in respect to several electrochemical reactions. The approaches to theoretical description of electrochemical processes on heterogeneous conducting polymer - metal electrodes are discussed and examples of experimental testing of applicability of the proposed the theoretical models are shown. The bibliography includes 335 references.
