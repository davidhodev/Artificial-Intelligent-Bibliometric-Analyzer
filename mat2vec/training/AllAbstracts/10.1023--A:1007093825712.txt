Mixed-ring metallocenes Cp′Cp″MCl2 (Cp′ and Cp″ = cyclopentadienyl and its substituted derivatives; M = Ti and Zr) have been prepared by reacting Cp′MCl3 with the Cp″ anion salt, in which the Cp′-M bond is stronger than the Cp″-M bond. Ethene has been polymerized with these complexes in the presence of methyl aluminoxane (MAO) as co-catalyst. The catalytic properties of titanocenes were influenced mainly by the steric effects of cyclopentadienyl ring substituents. Both steric and electronic effects of substituents influenced the catalytic properties of zirconocenes.
