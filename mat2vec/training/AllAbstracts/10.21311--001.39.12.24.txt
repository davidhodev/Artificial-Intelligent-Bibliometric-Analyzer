Monocatalyst is a kind of titanocene compound with special structure and properties, which has been widely used in scientific research, chemical industry and medical field. In this paper, the authors analyse the synthesis and research progress of monotitanocene complexes. Monocatalyst is a kind of olefin polymerization catalyst with great potential in industrial application, it is possible to control the microstructure of the target polymer effectively by synthesizing different monocatalytic catalysts. Based on the analysis of the synthesis of trichloro monocene titanium, we have determined the crystal structure of the compound.
