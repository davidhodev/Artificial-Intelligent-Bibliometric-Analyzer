In principle, polystyrene can occur with atactic, isotactic, and syndiotactic configurations. With the extensive studies concerning the stereoselective polymerization of olefins by Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems discovered DK3712: “dk3712_c014” - 2007/10/10 - 14:10 - page 364 - #2 in the early 1950s, the first stereoregular polystyrene, isotactic polystyrene (iPS), was obtained by Natta using the TiCl4/AlEt3 system in 1955.1 iPS is a semicrystalline polymer that has a high melting point, Tm = 240 °C.2 Several companies have tried to commercialize iPS, but its crystallization rate is too slow to be practical in industrial processes.
