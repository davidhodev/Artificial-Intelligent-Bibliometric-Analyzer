KGaA, Weinheim In this contribution, we investigated the key factors for the successful preparation of methylaluminoxane (MAO) from CO 2 and Me 3 Al by analyzing the reaction intermediates and by-products. The preparation of MAO, which possesses high cocatalytic ability, requires a precise amount of CO 2 feed. GC–MS and NMR analysis of the product suggested that tert-butoxyaluminum species was a key intermediate, which guaranteed the involvement of CO 2 in the formation of MAO. The prepared MAO can be applied as a cocatalyst in propylene polymerization using zirconocene, titanocene, nickel, and iron catalysts; its performance as cocatalyst reached to almost the same level as that of the commercially available MAO. Considering that currently olefin monomers require thorough removal of CO 2 before polymerization, this method can open the way to omitting some purification processes in the polyolefin industry.
