O,N,O-tridentate ligands 2-H 2 based on a 2,6-substituted pyridine structure and their dichlorotitanium complexes 3 were synthesized and structurally characterized. The complexes have five-coordinated, trigonal bipyramidal structure, in which one chlorine atom was located at trans-position to the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring and the other was at cis-position. NMR spectroscopy indicated their fluxional structure in solution. The complexes showed low to modest catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO) as a co-catalyst. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
