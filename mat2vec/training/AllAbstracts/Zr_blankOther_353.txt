A stereoregular alternating ethylene-styrene copolymer, also stretchable in fiber form, has been obtained with rac-isopropylidenebis(1-indenyl)zirconium dimethyldiamide activated by the methyl-alumoxane catalytic system. From X-ray diffraction fiber spectra, an isotactic structure has been assigned to this copolymer as well as the previously described stereoregular ethylene-styrene copolymers. The polymer has zigzag planar chain conformation with phenyl groups oriented perpendicularly to the chain axis. The crystallographic symmetry in B2/m. Lattice constants (monoclinic, unique axis c): a = 10.23, b = 15.53, c = 5.12 Å; γ = 98.6 °. The disagreement index for measured reflections is R1 = 0.10.
