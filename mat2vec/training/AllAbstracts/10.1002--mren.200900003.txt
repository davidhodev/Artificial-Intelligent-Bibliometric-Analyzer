A bis-IndZrCl2 catalyst was synthesized and used for ethylene homo- and copolymerization. The activity of the catalyst increases with increasing Al/Zr ratio; optimum activity was reached at 60 °C. Mv of the polymer decreased as the polymerization temperature increased; increasing reaction pressure increased both Mv and catalyst activity. The copolymerization of ethylene with different a-olefins was studied using the same catalyst system. The results indicate that under identical conditions there was a general decrease in the rate of polymerization as compared to the homopolymerization. The CCD and the lamellar thickness were investigated using DSC. The heterogeneity of the CCD increased with increasing comonomer content and molar mass. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
