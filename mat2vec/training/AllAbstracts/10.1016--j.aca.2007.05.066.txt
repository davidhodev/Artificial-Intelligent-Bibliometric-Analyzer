Laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) was performed on selected azaborolinyl zirconium complexes in order to study them as potential industrial polyolefin catalyst compounds. UV-vis absorption data in conjunction with negative and positive ionization analyses revealed the mechanistic workings of the compounds when such single-site catalysts function in olefin polymerization reactions. Results presented highlight the many benefits of LDI-MS in the study of single-site zirconium azaborolinyl catalyst complexes including minimal sample preparation, the absence of matrix/pH/solvation effects, a lower degree of fragmentation as compared to EI ionization, high sensitivity and the ability to observe interesting and unique gas phase chemistry including ring slippage, and distinctive metal coordination and oxidation states. The extreme lability of the chlorine ligands was apparent, as well as the reactivity of the resulting zirconium metal center as demonstrated by the appearance of numerous similar four-coordinate zirconium species along with di-chloro-bridged dimers. LDI-MS permits analysis at low molecular weights, improving spectral characterization of these zirconium complexes. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
