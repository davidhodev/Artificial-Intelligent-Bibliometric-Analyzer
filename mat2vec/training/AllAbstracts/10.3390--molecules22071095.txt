Cationic methylpalladium complexes bearing hemilabile bidentate α-amino–pyridines can serve as effective precursors for catalytic alternating copolymerization of norbornene (N) and ethylene (E), under mild conditions. The norbornyl palladium complexes in the formula of {[RHNCH2(o-C6H4N)]Pd(C7H10Me)(NCMe)}(BF4) (R = iPr (2a), tBu (2b), Ph (2c), 2,6-Me2C6H3 (2d), 2,6-iPr2C6H3 (2e)) were synthesized via single insertion of norbornene into the corresponding methylpalladium complexes 1a–1e, respectively. Both square planar methyl and norbornyl palladium complexes exhibit facile equilibria of geometrical isomerization, via sterically-controlled amino decoordination–recoordination of amino–pyridine. Kinetic studies of E-insertion, N-insertion of complexes 1 and 2, and the geometric isomerization reactions have been examined by means of VT-NMR, and found in excellent agreement with the results estimated by DFT calculations. The more facile N-insertion in the cis-isomers, and ready geometric isomerization, cooperatively lead to a new mechanism that accounts for the novel catalytic formation of alternating COC.
