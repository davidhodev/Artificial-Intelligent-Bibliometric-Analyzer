The isoselective propene polymerization using the supported catalyst SiO2/MAO/Me2Si(2-Me-Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl 2/AlR3 was investigated and compared with propene polymerization using the corresponding homogeneous catalyst system. The influence of propene concentration, polymerization medium, temperature, comonomer, and external aluminium alkyls on polymerization kinetics and polypropene properties such as molecular mass, stereo- and regioselectivity, morphology, and bulk density was studied.
