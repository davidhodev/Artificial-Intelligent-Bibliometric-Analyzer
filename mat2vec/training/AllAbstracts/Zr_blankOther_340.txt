Thermally induced elimination of bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene from its titanocene complex [{η5-C5Me4(SiMe3)} 2Ti(η2-Me3SiC≡CSiMe3)] (1) afforded the stable titanocene [{η5-C5-Me4(SiMe3)} 2TiII] (2) in high yield under mild conditions. Compound 2 exhibits paramagnetic line broadening of 1H NMR signals, although it is silent in EPR spectra down to -196°C. The solid-state structure determination revealed an exactly parallel arrangement of the cyclopentadienyl rings in 2 due to crystallographically imposed symmetry. Complex 2 smoothly reacts with ethylene to give the yellow η2-ethylene complex [{η5-C5Me4(SiMe3)} 2-Ti(η2-CH2=CH2)] (3). The structures of 1 and 3, determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, show the bent-titanocene moieties with the η2-coordinated Me3SiC≡CSiMe3 and CH2=CH2 ligands, respectively. © 1999 American Chemical Society.
