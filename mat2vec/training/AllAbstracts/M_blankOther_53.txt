4,4′-Dibromobiphenyl reacted with n-BuLi to form 4,4′-dilithiobiphenyl, which further reacted with 2, 3, 4, 5-tetramethylcyclopent-2-enone following the elimination of water to give the ligand 4-(C5Me4H) C6H4 - C6H4 (C5Me4H)-4 (1). Ligand 1 reacted with n-BuLi and ZrCl4 to form the p-biphenylene-bridged dinuclear tetramethylcyclopentadienyl zirconium trichlorides 4-(C5Me4ZrCl3) · C6H4 - C6H4 (C5Me4ZrCl3)-4, which reacted in situ with cyclopentadienyl lithium(CpLi) or indenyl lithium (IndLi) to give the corresponding p-biphenylene-bridged dinuclear zirconocenes 4-(C5Me4ZrCl2Cp′) C6H4 - C6H4(C5Me4ZrCl 2Cp′)-4 [Cp′ = Cp(2), Ind(3)]. The zirconocenes 2 and 3 were characterized by 1H NMR, MS spectra and elemental analysis, and were studied for ethylene polymerization with methyl a-luminoxane (MAO) as cocatalyst. Both 3 and 4 show very high activities and reach the maximum at a higher temperature, indicating that the introduction of the p-biphenylene-bridge increased the catalytic activity and thermal stability of the dinuclear zirconocene catalysts.
