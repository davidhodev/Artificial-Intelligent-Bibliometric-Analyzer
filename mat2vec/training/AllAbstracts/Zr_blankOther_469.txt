Reaction of zirconocene dichloride Cp2ZrCl2 with aromatic polymers bearing α-diketone and α-hydroxyketone fragments was studied. Using reactions of Cp2ZrCl2 with benzil and benzoin, which model α-diketone and α-hydroxyketone fragments, it was shown that zirconocene dichloride reacts only with hydroxyketone groups of the polymer through both reaction with OH group and coordination of Zn to the keto group. The prepared polymers are rather stable and can show promise as catalysts for a number of organic reactions.
