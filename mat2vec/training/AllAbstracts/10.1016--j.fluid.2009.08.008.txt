As a part of a series of reviews, a compilation of systems for which high-pressure phase-equilibrium data were published between 2000 and 2004 is given. Vapor-liquid equilibria, liquid-liquid equilibria, vapor-liquid-liquid equilibria, solid-liquid equilibria, solid-vapor equilibria, solid-vapor-liquid equilibria, critical points, the solubility of high-boiling substances in supercritical fluids, the solubility of gases in liquids and the solubility (sorption) of volatile components in polymers are included. For the systems investigated, the reference, the temperature and pressure range of the data, and the experimental method used for the measurements are given in 54 tables. Most of experimental data in the literature have been given for binary systems. Of the 1204 binary systems, 681 (57%) have carbon dioxide as one of the components. Information on 156 pure components, 451 ternary systems of which 267 (62%) contain carbon dioxide, 150 multicomponent and complex systems, and 129 systems with hydrates is given. Experimental methods for the investigation of high-pressure phase equilibria are classified and described. Work on the continuation of the review series is under way, covering the period between 2005 and 2008, and will be published in 2010. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
