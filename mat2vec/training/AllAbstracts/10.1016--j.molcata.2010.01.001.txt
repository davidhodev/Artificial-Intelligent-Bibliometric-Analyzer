In this work the cross-linked polystyrene beads were functionalized with silyl hydride groups. Two synthetic procedures were employed to tether of indenyltrichlorotitanium (IndTiCl3) on the functionalized polystyrene beads. In one approach (method A), the half-titanocene catalyst bearing an allyl group (1-allylindenyltrichlorotitanium) was synthesized and covalently anchored on the functionalized polystyrene by using of hydrosilylation chemistry. In the second approach (method B), the half-titanocene complex was synthesized on the functionalized polystyrene beads. The polymer-supported catalysts were tested for styrene polymerization using methylaluminoxane (MAO) as a cocatalyst. The obtained results revealed that the supported catalyst prepared with method (A) has higher catalytic activity and syndiotacticity than the supported catalyst obtained by method (B). In addition the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that the polymer particle replicates the shape of the carrier. Furthermore, the 13C NMR and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies confirmed the high syndiotacticity of obtained polymers. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
