Copolymerization of ethylene/1-octene with three ansa-zirconocene/MAO catalyst systems were investigated. The polymerization activity is dependent upon the influence of electronic effects. It decreases in the following order; C 6H 4(CH 2) 2Cp 2ZrCl 2> C 5H 3N(CH 2) 2Cp 2ZrCl 2>CH 3N(CH 2) 2ZrCl 2. The composition and sequence distribution of copolymer were calculated from 13C-NMR spectra. It was found that the activityes of three ansacatalysts were lower than Et(Ind) 2ZrCl 2 under the same 1-octeone concentration. And their copolymer had lower 1-octene incorporation than that of Et(Ind) 2ZrCl 2. Other properties such as molecular wieght, melting point of copolymer were compared.
