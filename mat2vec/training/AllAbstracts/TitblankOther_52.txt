This article describes recent studies on precision copolymerization by rare earth catalysts. The reaction of the rare earth dialkyl complexes with an equivalent of a borate compound such as [Ph3C] [B(C 6F5)4] or [PhNMe2H] [B(C6F 5)4] generates easily the corresponding cationic monoalkyl species, which serve as excellent catalysts for the polymerization and copolymerization of a variety of olefins to yield a new family of polymer materials that show novel properties but are difficult to prepare by other catalysts.
