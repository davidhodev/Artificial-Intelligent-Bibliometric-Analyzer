Syndiotactic polystyrene and atactic polypropene were synthesized with different titanium compounds, in particular of η 5-cyclopentadienyltri-n-propoxy titanium [ CpTi (OPr n) 3] and modified methylaluminoxane (m-MAO) homogeneous catalytic system. The titanium ligands affect catalytic activity of styrene syndiospecific polymerization and propene polymerization. The effects of the percentage contents of the trimethylaluminum (TMA) coexisted in m-MAO, which can be controlled by changing H 2O and TMA molar ratio during the preparation of MAO by partial hydrolysis of TMA with Al 2 (SO 4) 3 · 18H 2O, on polymerization of styrene and propene have been studied in detail. The external addition of alkylaluminium (AIR 3, trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, tri-isobutylaluminum) to CpTi (OPr n) 3/m-MAO catalytic systems may also influence both catalytic activity and molecular weights of syndiotactic polystyrene produced. The oxidation states of titanium in different CpTi (OPr n) 3/m-MAO catalytic systems were determined by redox titration method. It results that Ti (III) is good for styrene syndiospecific polymerization in higher catalytic activity, while Ti (IV) is good for propene's polymerization. Oxidation state of tinanium in catalyst system does not clearly affect the tacticity of these two kind of polymers obtained.
