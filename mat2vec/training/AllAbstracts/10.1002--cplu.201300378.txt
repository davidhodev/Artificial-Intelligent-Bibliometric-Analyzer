ZrIV complexes of the type [Me2Si{(NR)(6-{2-(diethylboryl) phenyl} pyridyl-2-yl-N)}ZrCl2 thf] (R=tBu (4), adamantyl (7a); thf= tetrahydrofuran), [Me2Si{(NAd)(6-{2-(diphenylboryl)phenyl}pyridyl- 2-yl-N)}ZrCl2] (Ad=adamantyl (7b)), the nonbridged half-titanocene complexes of the type [(N-{6-(2-diethylborylphenyl)pyrid- 2-yl}-NR)Cp'TiCl2] (R=Me, Cp'=C5H5 (12), Cp'=C5Me5 (13)), and the titanium(IV)-based metallocene-type complex [bis{N- (6-{2-(diethylboryl)phenyl}pyrid-2-yl)NMe}TiCl2] (14) have been synthesized. The structures of complexes 7b, 12, and 13 were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. In solution, complex 4 slowly rearranges to [Me2Si{(N-tBu)(6-{2-(diethylboryl) phenyl}pyridyl-2-yl- N)}2Zr] (4a), the structure of which was unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Similarly, reaction of HfCl4 with Me 2Si({RNLi}{6-[2-(diethylboryl) phenyl]pyridyl-2-ylNLi}) yielded the corresponding HfIV complexes [Me2Si{(NR)(6-{2-(diethylboryl)phenyl} pyridyl-2- ylN)}2Hf] (R=tBu (8) and Ad (9)). Upon activation of these complexes with methylalumoxane (MAO), complexes 4, 7a, 7b, and 12-14 showed activities up to 750 kg of polyethylene (PE)/molcat. barh in the homopolymerization of ethylene (E), producing mainly linear PE (high-density PE, HDPE) with molecular weights in the range of 1800 000<Mn<4-106 gmol-1. In the copolymerization of E with cyclopentene (CPE), the polymerization activities of complexes 4, 7a, and 7b can be enhanced by a factor of 140 up to 7500 kgPE/molcat. bar h, which produced PE-co-poly(CPE) containing 3.5 mol% of CPE. This dramatic increase in polymerization activity for E in the presence of CPE can be attributed to an involvement of CPE in the polymerization process rather than to solvent polarity.
