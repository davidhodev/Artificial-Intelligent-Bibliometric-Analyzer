In this paper we report on a zirconocene dichloride/methylaluminoxane catalyst system supported on a crosslinked polystyrene in order to provide ethylene polymerization catalysts for gas phase or slurry processes. Our novel approach uses the Diels-Alder reaction of cyclopentadiene functions as the final, crosslinking synthetic step. This provides polymer supported zirconocene catalysts with a homogeneous distribution of active sites. The catalysts were shown to be highly active and to form spherical beads as proven by scanning electron microscopy. Â© WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1999.
