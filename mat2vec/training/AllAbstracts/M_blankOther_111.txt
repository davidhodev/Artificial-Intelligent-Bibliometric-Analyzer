A closely related ansa-metallocene system was investigated as a model for propylene polymerization utilizing unbridged 2-arylindenyl metallocenes. The propylene polymerization behavior of rac- and meso- dimethylsilyl(bis(2-phenylindenyl))zirconium dichloride was also examined. Polymerizations were run with mixtures 1-rac and 1-meso to give visually homogeneous reactor blends of isotactic and atactic polypropylene. The 1-meso was more productive than 1-rac which was consistent with the polymerization results from unbridged catalyst. The polymerization for meso conformation was higher than that for the rac conformation in the unbridged system as well.
