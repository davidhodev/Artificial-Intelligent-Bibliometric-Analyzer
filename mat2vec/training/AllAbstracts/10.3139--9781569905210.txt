This book bridges the meaning of engineering end-use parameters of polyethylene resins (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE, VLDPE) and their molecular characteristics. The goal is to translate common end-use characteristics of the resins or properties of standard items manufactured from resins into the universal language of the polymer science, average molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of a polymer, and composition and a statistical description of a copolymer.
