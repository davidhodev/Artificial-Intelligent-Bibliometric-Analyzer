Research on "post-metallocene" polymerization catalysis ranges methodologically from fundamental mechanistic studies of polymerization reactions over catalyst design to material properties of the polyolefins prepared. A common goal of these studies is the creation of practically useful new polyolefin materials or polymerization processes. This Review gives a comprehensive overview of post-metallocene polymerization catalysts that have been put into practice. The decisive properties for this success of a given catalyst structure are delineated. Â© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
