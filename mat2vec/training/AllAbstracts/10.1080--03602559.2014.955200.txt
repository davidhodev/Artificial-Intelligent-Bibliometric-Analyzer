Besides that, the review on the relationship between activation energies of polymer/metal composites, which was obtained from various degrade models, and the content of metallic fillers have also been defined. Other thermal properties such as glass transition temperature (Tg) and melting temperature (Tm) have also been reviewed based on the evaluation of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis.
