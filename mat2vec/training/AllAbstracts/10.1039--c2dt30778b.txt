Bis(imino)aryl NCN pincer Ni(ii) complexes 2,6-(ArNCH) 2C 6H 3NiBr (1: Ar = 2,6-Me 2C 6H 3; 2: Ar = 2,6-Et 2C 6H 3; 3: Ar = 2,6- iPr 2C 6H 3) were prepared via the oxidative-addition of Ni(0)(Ph 3P) 4 with bis(N-aryl)-2-bromoisophthalaldimine. These nickel complexes were characterized by NMR and elemental analyses. Their solid molecular structures were established by X-ray diffraction analyses. The nickel metal centers adopt distorted square planar geometries with the bromine atoms acting as one coordinate ligands. The NCN pincer Fe(ii) complexes 2,6-(ArNCH) 2C 6H 3Fe(μ-Cl) 2Li(THF) 2 (4: Ar = 2,6-Me 2C 6H 3; 5: Ar = 2,6-Et 2C 6H 3; 6: Ar = 2,6- iPr 2C 6H 3) were synthesized by lithium salt metathesis reactions of the ligand lithium salts with FeCl 2. X-ray structure analyses of 4 and 5 revealed that the Fe(ii) complexes are hetero-dinuclear with the iron atoms in trigonal bipyramidal environments. When activated with MAO, the nickel complexes are active for norbornene vinyl polymerization but are inert for butadiene polymerization. The Fe(ii) complexes show moderate activities in butadiene polymerization when activated with alkylaluminium, affording the cis-1,4 enriched polymer. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
