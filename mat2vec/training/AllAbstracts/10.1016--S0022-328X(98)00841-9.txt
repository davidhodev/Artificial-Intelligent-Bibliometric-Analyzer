Two kinds of fluorenyl containing zirconocene catalysts, supported on polymethylsiloxane micro gels and on silica, were prepared and applied for ethylene polymerizations using methylaluminoxane as cocatalyst. The observed activities were comparable with those of the corresponding silica supported catalysts. The average molecular weights of the obtained polymers differ from those of the corresponding homogeneous catalysts as from those of the silica supported systems.
