Immobilized single-site polymerization catalysis has been the subject of several reviews in both length and scope. The present review comprehensively covers the substantial body of research within this field, focusing particularly on the requirements, challenges, protocols, and ingenious solutions to the successful immobilization of single-site catalysts. It describes inorganic oxide supports, zeolites and mesoporous materials, tethering to inorganic oxides, magnesium chloride, surface organometallic complexes and superacids, clays, "hybrid" multicomponent catalyst systems, modeling supports and supported catalyst systems, and polymeric supports.
