The synthesis of a series of titanium dichloro and di(isopropoxy) complexes with a 1,4-dithiabutanediyl-linked bis(4,6-disubstituted phenolato) ligand was analyzed. The NMR spectra of the dichloro complexes with small ortho substituents R1 = H, Me, 1Pr were in agreement with C 2-symmetrical helical structure and the complexes became fluxional at higher temperature. The corresponding di(isopropoxy) complexes were fluxional in solution at room temperature due to rapid interconversion between the δ and λ isomers. The results show that upon activation with methylaluminoxane, the stereorigid derivatives efficiently polymerize styrene to give isotactic polystyrene.
