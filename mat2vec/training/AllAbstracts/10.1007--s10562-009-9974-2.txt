Two new ionic liquid-supported bis-(salicylaldimine) Ni(II) complexes Ni[2-(O)C6H4CH=N(CH2) 3(methylimidazole)Br]2 (1) and Ni[3, 5-tBu 2-2-(O)C6H2CH=N(CH2) 3(methylimidazole)Br]2 (2) have been synthesized and characterized. Ethylene oligomerizations were carried out with these two complexes in biphasic solvent systems consisting of chloroaluminate ionic liquid and n-heptane or toluene under mild reaction conditions. In the presence of diethylaluminum chloride, both complexes 1 and 2 are highly active for ethylene oligomerization. The olefinic products can be easily separated from the catalytic ionic liquid phase by simple decantation, and the nickel catalysts can be reused in successive ethylene oligomerization cycles. GC-MS analyzes showed that the obtained oligomers contained mainly C4, C6, and C8 olefins. Â© 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
