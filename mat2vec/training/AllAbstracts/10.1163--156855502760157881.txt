Different metallocene catalysts were used to synthesize propene/1-hexene and ethene/ styrene copolymers. For the propene/1-hexene copolymerization, [Me2Si(2-Me-4-PhInd)2]ZrCl2 and [Me2Si(2-Me-4-NaphthylInd)2]ZrCl2 give high activity and random copolymers. In contrast for the ethene/styrene copolymerization, silyl-bridged zirconocenes produce polymers with only a low amount of styrene units. Here, isopropyl-bridged C2 and CS symmetric zirconocenes incorporate high amounts of styrene up to 50 mol%. A comparison was carried out in respect of the catalyst activity and its ability to incorporate styrene as well as of the properties of the resulting polymers, such as molar masses, melting and glass transition temperatures.
