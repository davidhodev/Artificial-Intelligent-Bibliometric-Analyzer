An extensive review covering all aspects of Calcium-mediated reactions, which include application of calcium compounds as homogeneous catalysts, is presented. Considerable contributions is made to an understanding of Schlenk equilibria in organocalcium chemistry and it is found that the stability of heteroleptic calcium complexes depend on temperature, concentration, presence of polar (co)solvents, amd ligand bulk. Studies also found that the homoleptic complex of calcium is fast in Îµ-CL polymerization and slow in the polymerization of L-lactide. Investigation of calcium catalysts based on Schiff base ligands shows that polymerizations are initiated either by a salen-Ca complex or by well-defined single-site catalysts. Successful use of organocalcium species as initiators for syndioselective and living styrene polymerization can be attributed to the right balance of Lewis-basic and Lewis acidic properties.
