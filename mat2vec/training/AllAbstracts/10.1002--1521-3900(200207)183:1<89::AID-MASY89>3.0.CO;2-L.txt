Meso-[Me2Si(2-Me-4,6-iPr2Ind)2 ZrCl2 was synthesized in a pure form and used as catalyst for the copolymerization of ethene and α-olefins. The results are compared with polymers obtained by C1-symmetric metallocenes and constrained geometry catalysts. The activity of the meso form is remarkable high and reaches more than 100 000 kg polymer/mol Zr·h. The ligand structure has large influence on the incorporation of 1-octene forming thermoplastics (LLDPE) and thermoplastic elastomers (POE).
