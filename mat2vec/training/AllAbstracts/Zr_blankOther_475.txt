The copolymerization of propene and octene-1 using rac-Et(Ind) 2 ZrCl 2 / MAO catalyst has been investigated. Results show that with increasing the concentration of octene-1 in the system, the catalytic activity increased first and then decreased, the incorporation rate of octene-1 increased, and in consequence, M Î· , T m , crystallinity of copolymer decreased. The monomer composition and sequence distribution of the copolymers were determined by IR and 13 C-NMR.
