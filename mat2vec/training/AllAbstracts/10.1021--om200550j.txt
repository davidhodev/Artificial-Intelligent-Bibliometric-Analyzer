The N-heterocyclic carbene ligated scandiumtrialkyl complexes [{2,6-C 6H3R2NCH}2CSc(CH 2SiMe3)3] (R = Me (1); R = iPr (2)) were synthesized by the reaction of 1 equiv of [Sc(CH2SiMe 3)3(THF)2] with the corresponding ligand [{2,6-C6H3R2NCH}2C]. Their molecular structures have been established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Upon activation with 2 equiv of [Ph3C][B(C6F5) 4], complexes 1 and 2 exhibited high activities up to 2520 (kg of polymer) (mol of Sc)-1 h-1 for 1-hexene homopolymerization, affording polymers with moderate molecular weight (18-46 kg mol-1) at room temperature. The use of a low reaction temperature of-30 °C resulted in high molecular weight (up to 631 kg mol-1). The catalyst systems based on complex 1 or 2 also showed excellent activities for 1-octene or 1-decene polymerization. Moreover, in the presence of 2 equiv of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4], complex 1 proved to be an excellent catalyst for copolymerization of 1-hexene(h) with 1,5-hexadiene (HD) to give random atactic H/HD copolymers with a wide range of HD contents (26.6-98.6 mol %), a previously unreported copolymer. © 2011 American Chemical Society.
