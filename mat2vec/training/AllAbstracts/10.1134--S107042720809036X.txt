Review embarrasses the problems of low molecular weight olefins (ethylene and propylene) selective oligomerization to butene-1, hexene-1, octene-1, 4-methylpentene-1; selective polymerization of olefins to obtain polymers with a given molecular mass, molecular mass distribution, branching (for the polyethylene), chain structure [atactic, iso-, syndio-, gemiisotactic, stereoblock type and containing terminal vinyl and vinylidene bonds (for polypropylene)]; "live" homo-and copolymerization of olefins, and alternating copolymerization of olefins in the presence of complex organometallic catalysts.
