Selected results for the synthesis of cyclic olefin copolymers (COCs)—especially copolymerizations of norbornene (NBE) or tetracyclododecene (TCD) with ethylene and _-olefins (1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-dodecene)—using group 4 transition metal (titanium and zirconium) complex catalysts have been reviewed. Half-titanocenes containing an anionic ancillary donor ligand, Cp′TiX2(Y) (Cp′ = cyclopentadienyl; X = halogen, alkyl; Y = anionic donor ligand such as aryloxo, ketimide, imidazolin-2-iminato, etc.), are effective catalysts for efficient synthesis of new COCs; ligand modifications play an important role for the desired copolymerization. These new COCs possess promising properties (high transparency, thermal resistance (high glass transition temperature), low water absorption, etc.), thus it is demonstrated that the design of an efficient catalyst plays an essential role for the synthesis of new fine polyolefins with specified properties.
