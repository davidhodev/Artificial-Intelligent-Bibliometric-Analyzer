NaCl doped MgCl2 supported TiCl4 catalysts were used for 1-hexylene polymerizations in this paper. The catalysts' activity, the molecular weight distribution and the tacticity of polyhexylene are influenced strongly by the doping of NaCl in MgCl2, based on the polymerization experiment, the deconvolution analysis of molecular weight distribution (MWD) profiles and the 13C NMR analysis. The results show that it is possible to control the active center distribution of supported TiCl4/MgCl2 catalysts by doping of support with NaCl. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
