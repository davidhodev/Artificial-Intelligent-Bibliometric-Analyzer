Additive effects of dialkylaluminum hydrides on propylene-1,3-butadiene copolymerization were investigated with an isospecific zirconocene catalyst, rac-dimethylsilylbis(2-methyl-4-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride (4Ph), activated by modified methylaluminoxane. Dialkylaluminum hydrides improved the apparent selectivity for 1,2-insertion of 1,3-butadiene to give a pendant vinyl group. 13C NMR analysis of the copolymers indicated that the dialkylaluminum hydride converted the 1,4-inserted butadiene unit in the copolymer to tetramethylene unit after methanolysis.
