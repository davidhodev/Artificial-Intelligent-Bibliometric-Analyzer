Â© 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.This chapter is devoted to the presentation of the new trends in the electrochemistry of electronically conducting polymers (ECPs) that appeared during the past decade. It is divided into three major sections corresponding to the main uses of electrochemistry in the field of conducting polymers: electrosynthesis from specially designed monomers (Section 18.2), characterization of polymer films (Section 18.3), and investigation of related materials as modified electrodes for specific applications (Section 18.4).
