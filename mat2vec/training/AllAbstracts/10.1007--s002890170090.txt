Synthesis and activity ofbis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride catalyst supported on unconventional silica-type material obtained in sol-gel process and activated by organoaluminium co-catalyst were studied. The effect of support modification conditions (thermal dehydration and/or modification by organoaluminium compound) and a type of co-catalyst on an activity of the catalytic system in ethylene polymerization and properties of resulting polymers were investigated and compared with results obtained earlier for vanadium catalysts supported on mentioned sol-gel carrier. The most appropriate method of the sol-gel silica-type support preparation is thermal pre-treating (200°C) followed by modification with AlEt2Cl. Metallocene catalyst supported on such sol-gel product and activated by MAO appeared to be most active among studied systems. Studied Cp2ZrCl2/MAO supported on silica-type sol-gel carrier allow to obtain polyethylene (at 50°C polymerization temperature) with yield up to 30·106 g/(molZr·h), molecular weight below 300 000 and MWD=2-4.
