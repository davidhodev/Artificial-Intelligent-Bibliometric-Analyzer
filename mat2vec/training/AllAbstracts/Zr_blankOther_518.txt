The authors describe the current state of knowledge on how the polymerization of silanes by dehydrogenative coupling occurs, how general (or limited) catalytic dehydrogenative coupling may be as a method for catenation of main group atoms, what other catalysts may effect reaction and what other catalytic reactions can be effected by the unusual metallocene intermediates produced in this reaction.
