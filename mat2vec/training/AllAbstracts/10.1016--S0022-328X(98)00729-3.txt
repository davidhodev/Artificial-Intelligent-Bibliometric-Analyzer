Chiral silicon bridged yttrio- and lanthanidocene chlorides [MeRSi(C 5 H 4 )(C 5 Me 4 )LnCl] 2 (R=Et (a), Ph (b); Ln=Y (4a, b), La (5a, b), Sm (6a, b), Lu (7a, b)) and zirconocene dichlorides [MeRSi(C 5 H 4 )(C 5 Me 4 )ZrCl 2 ] (R=Et (8a), Ph (8b)) were synthesized. Compounds 4-7 react with sodium acetate yielding the corresponding monomeric acetates [MeRSi(C 5 H 4 )(C 5 Me 4 )LnO 2 CMe] (R=Et (a), Ph (b); Ln=Y (9a, b), La (10a, b), Sm (11a, b), Lu (12a, b)). All compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, 1 H and 13 C{ 1 H}-NMR spectroscopy, and by mass spectrometry. Single crystal X-ray structure determinations show a dimer for 6a and a monomer for 8a. The zirconocenes 8a, b are active catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene and propylene in the presence of methylalumoxane (MAO).
