By one-pot technique the copolymerization of styrene with ethylene promoted by a cyclopentadienyl titanium trichloride (CpTiCl3)/1, 4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDGE)/Zn catalytic system to yield aPs-b-P(S-co-E)-6-PE block copolymers was investigated via sequential monomer addition strategy in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO) as cocatalyst for the coordination polymerization stage. The effect of temperature, time, ethylene pressure and the ratio of Al/Ti in mol on the polymerization performance was discussed in detail. Basically, aPs-b-P(S-co-E)-b-PE block copolymers was obtained, together with atactic polystyrene through the approach, which was determined by solvent extraction. The CHC13-soluble product was determined by GPC, DSC, WAXD and 13C-NMR. The molecular weight distribution (MWD) of the copolymer varied slightly at the range from 1.71 to 2.11. The DSC result showed that the copolymer featured one glass transition temperature (for example Tt = 86°C) attributed to the Tt of oPs domains and one melting point (for example Tm = 114°C) attributed to the Tg of PE domains. The blocky microstructure of the copolymer was further confirmed by WAXD and C-NMR. These results indicated that the copolymer was consisted of amorphous aPs segments, P(S-co-E) segments and crystalline PE segments.
