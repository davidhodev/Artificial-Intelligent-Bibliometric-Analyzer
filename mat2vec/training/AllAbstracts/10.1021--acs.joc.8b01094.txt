Â© 2018 American Chemical Society.Highly effective hydroboration precatalyst is developed based on a cobalt(II)-terpyridine coordination polymer (CP). The hydroboration of ketones, aldehydes, and imines with pinacolborane (HBpin) has been achieved using the recyclable CP catalyst in the presence of an air-stable activator. A wide range of substrates containing polar C=O or C=N bonds have been hydroborated selectively in excellent yields under ambient conditions.
