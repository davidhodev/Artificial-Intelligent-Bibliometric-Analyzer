Styrene/ethylene copolymerization was performed by Longo et al. with the use of a cyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride (CpTiCl3)/ methylaluminoxane (MAO) system with various aluminum/titanium ratios and various monomer compositions. The obtained polymer consisted of a mixture of an ethylene-styrene pseudorandom copolymer, polyethylene, and poly(styrene-block- ethylene) with a syndiospecific styrene-styrene unit (SPS-b-PE). In this work, from the whole polymer obtained with the CpTiCl3/MAO catalyst system, the SPS-b-PE copolymer was separated with the temperature rising elution fractionation method, and the structure was specified by 13C NMR. The polymer obtained from the trivalent titanium catalyst, which was thought to be the active species of syndiotactic polystyrene, included both a styrene-styrene sequence and a styrene-ethylene-ethylene-styrene sequence. However, neither the styrene-ethylene-styrene sequence nor the long chain of. polyethylene was included. Â© 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
