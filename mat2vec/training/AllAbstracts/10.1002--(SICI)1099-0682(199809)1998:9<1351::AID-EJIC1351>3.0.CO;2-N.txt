The reactions of Cp 2 Zr(L)(η 2 -Me 3 SiC 2 SiMe 3 ) (L = THF, pyridine) with ε-caprolactone, cyclohexanone and cycloheptanone result in an insertion of the carbonyl group into the zirconacyclopropene ring system of the alkyne complexes to yield the five-membered metallacyclic spirozirconadihydiofurane complexes 1, 3, 4. The product with ε-caprolactone is not stable at room temperature and was identified only by NMR spectra and chemical reactions. Starting from rac-(ebtru)Zr(η 2 -Me 3 SiC 2 SiMe 3 ) with ε-caprolactone and ethylene carbonate under analogous conditions more stable complexes (2, 5) were obtained. Complexes 2 and 3 were characterized by X-ray crystal-structure analysis. Complexes 1 and 2 react with further ε-caprolactone in a catalytic ring-opening polymerization. The polymerization reactions were monitored by NMR spectroscopy.
