A general investigation of the elementary reactions involved in the activation processes of zirconocene and Ni-based derivatives by methylaluminoxane (MAO) was performed through the association of polymerization kinetics and spectroscopic investigation of the catalytic system. This study demonstrates the close correlation between polymerization activities and the changes in the UV/visible characteristic absorption bands of the transition metal derivative used as catalyst. Hex-1-ene was chosen as model monomer. Â© 1999 Society of Chemical Industry.
