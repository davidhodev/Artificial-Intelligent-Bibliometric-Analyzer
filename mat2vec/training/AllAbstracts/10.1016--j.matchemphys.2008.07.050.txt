The present study revealed the effect of different TiO2 nanoparticles employed on catalytic and characteristic properties of LLDPE/TiO2 nanocomposites synthesized by the in situ polymerization with zirconocene/dMMAO catalyst. It was found that the presence of rutile phase in titania apparently resulted in decreased activities due to low intrinsic activity of active sites being present. Based on 13C NMR results, all LLDPE/TiO2 samples exhibited the random copolymer having different degree of 1-hexene insertion. The highly dispersion of titania can enhance the degree of 1-hexene insertion resulting in decreased crystallinity. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
