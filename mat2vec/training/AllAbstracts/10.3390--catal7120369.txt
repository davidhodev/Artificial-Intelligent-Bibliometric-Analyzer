Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.A series of vanadium(III) complexes bearing monodentate tertiary phosphine ligands of the type VCl3(PRnPh3-n)2 (n = 0 (1a); n = 1 and R = Me (1b), Et (1c), iPr (1d), Cy (1e); n = 2 and R = Me (1f), Et (1g), Cy (1h)), and VCl3(PR3)2 (R = Cyp (2a), Cy (2b),nPr (2c),tBu (2d)) were synthesized and characterized. In the case of 1c, 1g and 2a single crystals were also obtained and their molecular structures were determined. All the complexes were used, in combination with methylaluminoxane (sMAO) or AlMe3–free MAO (dMAO), for the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene, exhibiting rather good activity and giving polymers with different microstructure depending on the nature of the phosphine ligand and the type of co-catalyst employed.
