Analysis of the published data on the interaction between the components of a zirconocene-poly(methylaluminoxane) system used as the catalyst of olefin polymerization indicates that the yield of the reaction product, methane, is virtually independent of the concentration of the components over a wide concentration range. It is assumed that methane is formed in the absence of the monomer on the catalytic site of the process formed by the interaction of the major components and the activating admixtures, including uncontrollable admixtures (H2O, O2). Under specified conditions, it is the admixtures that control the concentration of the catalytic centers and the methane yield. For this reason, the yield of methane is independent of the concentration of zirconocene and poly(methylaminoxane).
