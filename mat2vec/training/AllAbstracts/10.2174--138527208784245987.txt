Alkalides are salts containing alkali metal anions and complexed metal cations. These unusual species discovered by Dye (Dye, J.L.; Andrews, C.W.; Mathews, S.E. J. Phys. Chem., 1975, 79, 3065) are strong reductants of many organic and inorganic compounds. These reactions occur rapidly under mild homogeneous conditions. In this paper we discuss new data concerning the application of potassium potassides selected from the group of alkalides to polymerization processes. Their now and corrected mechanisms for some vinyl and oxacyclic monomers are presented. Â© 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.
