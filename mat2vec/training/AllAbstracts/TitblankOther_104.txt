Recent examples for synthesis of new polyolefins containing polar functionalities by coordination insertion copolymerization using group 4 metal complex (Ti, Zr) catalysts have been reviewed. In particular, examples by adopting the approaches by direct copolymerization of olefin with polar monomer using coordination insertion methods, and (b) controlled incorporation of reactive functionalities (and the subsequent introduction of polar funtionalities under mild conditions) have been described. Our recent efforts for precise synthesis of polyolefins containing polar functionalities by (i) efficient incorporation of reactive functionality by copolymerization of ethylene with nonconjugated diene using nonbridged half-titanocene catalysts and (ii) subsequent chemical modifications under mild conditions have been introduced.
