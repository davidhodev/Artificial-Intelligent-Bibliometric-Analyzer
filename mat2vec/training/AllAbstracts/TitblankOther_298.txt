Novel spherical MgCl2 supported mono-titanocene catalysts were prepared by reaction of spherical MgCl2 supported Xiegler-Natta catalyst with silciane compounds. The catalysts were utilized in the copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene. Catalysts with different ligands displayed obvious comonomer effect in copolymerization. The copolymerization activity of catalyst was the highest under optimal copolymerization conditions. 1-Hexene concentration was also an important factor that affected the copolymerization.
