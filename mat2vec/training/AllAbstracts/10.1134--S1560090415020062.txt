© 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.The polymerization of methyl methacrylate in the presence of metallocenes and radical initiators has been shown to proceed as radical-coordination polymerization, with the propagation of some chains following a coordination mechanism involving metallocenes. The polymerization products are capable of initiating monomer polymerization in the absence of an initiator. The catalytic activities of “metallocene” polymers are determined by the history of their synthesis.
