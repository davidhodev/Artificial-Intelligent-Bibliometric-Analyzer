Liquid co- and terpolymers based on inexpensive and abundant Î±-olefins and ethylene feed stocks were produced using a single site zirconocene catalyst. The process is based, in part, on the formation of synthetic hydrocarbon base oils (SHC) with catalysts having a high viscosity index, low pour point, low volatility, low cold cranking viscosity, high flash point, and excellent oxidation stability. The characteristics of the liquid polymers were modified by cracking and hydrogenation to generate SHC. The oils' performance properties were comparable to or better than PAO and are an economical alternative to formulating high performance motor oils and lubricants.
