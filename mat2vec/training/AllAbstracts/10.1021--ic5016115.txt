© 2014 American Chemical Society.New insights into the synthesis of high-nuclearity polycarbonatolanthanoid complexes have been obtained from a detailed investigation of the preparative methods that initially yielded the so-called "lanthaballs" [Ln13(ccnm)6(CO3)14(H2O)6(phen)18] Cl3(CO3)·25H2O [α-1Ln; Ln = La, Ce, Pr; phen = 1,10-phenanthroline; ccnm = carbamoylcyanonitrosomethanide]. From this investigation, we have isolated a new pseudopolymorph of the cerium analogue of the lanthaball, [Ce13(ccnm)6(CO3)14(H2O)6(phen)18]·Cl3·CO3 (β-1Ce). This new pseudopolymorph arose from a preparation in which fixation of atmospheric carbon dioxide generated the carbonate, and the ccnm ligand was formed in situ by the nucleophilic addition of water to dicyanonitrosomethanide. From a reaction of cerium(III) nitrate, instead of the previously used chloride salt, with (Et4N)(ccnm), phen, and NaHCO3 in aqueous methanol, the new complex Na[Ce13(ccnm)6(CO3)14(H2O)6(phen)18](NO3)6·20H2O (2Ce) crystallized. A variant of this reaction in which sodium carbonate was initially added to Ce(NO3)3, followed by phen and (Et4N)(ccnm), also gave 2Ce. However, an analogous preparation with (Me4N)(ccnm) gave a mixture of crystals of 2Ce and the coordination polymer [CeNa(ccnm)4(phen)3]·MeOH (3), which were manually separated. The use of cerium(III) acetate in place of cerium nitrate in the initial preparation did not give a high-nuclearity complex but a new coordination polymer, [Ce(ccnm)(OAc)2(phen)] (4). The first lanthaball to incorporate neodymium, namely, [Nd13(ccnm)4(CO3)14(NO3)4(H2O)7(phen)15](NO3)3·10H2O (5Nd), was isolated from a preparation similar to that of the second method used for 2Ce, and its magnetic properties showed an antiferromagnetic interaction. The identity of all products was established by X-ray crystallography.
