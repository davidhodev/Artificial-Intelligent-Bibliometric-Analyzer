Creating micropatterns of electrically conductive polymers on solid substrates is important for the low-cost construction of organic microelectronic devices. This work develops a novel strategy for the preparation of large-area polypyrrole (Ppy) micropatterns through area-selected in situ electropolymerization of pyrrole within microchannels. The effects on micropattern formation of electropolymerization procedures such as dynamic potential polymerization (DPP), static potential polymerization (SPP), and constant current polymerization (CCP), the solvent, and the polymerization time were studied systematically. The electrical conductivities of the Ppy micropatterns were measured and compared with a homogeneous Ppy thin film synthesized under the same conditions. Given the straightforward and versatile nature of this method, it is expected to contribute greatly to the convenient fabrication of low-cost organic microelectronic devices. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
