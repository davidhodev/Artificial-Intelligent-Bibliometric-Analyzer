rac‐Ethylenebis(1‐η5‐indenyl)dimethylzirconium (1) was reacted with triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (2) to produce in situ the rac‐ethylenebis(indenyl)methylzirconium cation (3). This aluminium‐free catalyst showed propene polymerization activity (A) and stereoselectivity which both increase with the decrease of polymerization temperature (Tp). At very low Tp, 3 behaved as a “single‐site” catalyst. An efficient way to produce such cation is to react ansa‐zirconocene dichloride with 2 in the presence of TEA (=triethylaluminium). A superior cationic catalyst was obtained from rac‐dimethylsilylenebis(1‐η5‐indenyl)dichlorozirconium, 2, and TEA, which polymerizes propene at −20°C(−55°C) with activity of 2×109 (3×108) g polypropene per (mol Zr η mol C3H6 η h) to polypropenes which are 93.8% (99.4%) isotactic with melting temperature Tm = 152.6°C (159.9°C) and viscosity‐average molecular weight Mv = 1.4×105 (2.2×105). The addition of methylaluminoxane lowers the A of the cationic catalyst especially at low Tp. Rigorously speaking, the cation derived from 1 or 3 behaves as a “single site” catalyst only at very low Tp. The use of TEA significantly and unexpectedly enhances the efficiency of the zirconocenium catalyst system. Copyright © 1993 Hüthig & Wepf Verlag
