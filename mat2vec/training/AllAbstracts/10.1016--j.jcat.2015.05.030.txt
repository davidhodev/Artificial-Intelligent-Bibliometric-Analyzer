© 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.Quaternary onium modulated SalenCoXY (X = Cl, Br, NO3; Y = phenoxy, benzene-1,4-bisoxy, benzene-1,3,5-trisoxy) catalysts incorporating the N,N′-bis(salicylidene)ethylene diaminato(Salen) ligand and quaternary onium units were designed, synthesized and applied to the copolymerization of CO2 and propylene oxide. The impact factors of the axial anion X, the counter anion Y and the property of quaternary onium group evidently affected PPC selectivity and degree of polymerization. Detailed kinetic investigations and mechanisms of the cycloaddition and copolymerization were documented and discussed. A second order of catalyst was restrainedly proposed for polymerization.
