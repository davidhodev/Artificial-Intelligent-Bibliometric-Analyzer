Novel metallacyclic zirconocene complexes were prepared by reacting ω-alkenyl substituted zirconocene dichloride complexes with two equivalents of n-butyllithium. The factor determining the reaction course and the structure of the respective metallacycle formed is the chain length of the alkenyl group. After activation with methylaluminoxane the metallocene dichloride complexes and the derived metallacyclic derivatives are excellently suited for ethylene polymerization. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
