The title complexes Me4Si2(1-C5H3-3-tBu) 2MCl2 (M = Ti, 1; M = Zr, 2) have been prepared by reaction of Li2Me4Si2(C5H3-3- tBu)2 with MC14·2THF in refluxing THF. Rac/meso ratio of about 2/3 was obtained for the titanocene complex 1. But for the zirconocene 2, only meso isomer was obtained. The crystal structures of meso-1 and meso-2 were determined. Their catalytic properties for ethylene polymerization have also been studied with MAO as a cocatalyst. © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.
