Six kinds of heterogeneous catalysts were prepared by supporting iPr(Flu)(Cp)ZrCl2 (1) and Cp2ZrCl2 (2) on Al2O3, MgCl2 and SiO2, and propene polymerization was conducted with these supported catalysts using a common alkylaluminium, Al(CH3)3, as cocatalyst. The 1 Al2O3 and 1 MgCl2 catalysts gave highly syndiotactic polypropylene whereas the 2 Al2O3 and 2 MgCl2 catalysts gave atactic polypropylene in fairly good yields. In contrast, the SiO2-supported catalysts were found to be inactive for propene polymerization. Â© 1992.
