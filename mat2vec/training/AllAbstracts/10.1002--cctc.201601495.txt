KGaA, WeinheimThe reaction of pentamethylcyclopentadienyl titanium trichloride (Cp*TiCl3) with lithium N,N-bis{6-[2-(diethylboryl)phenyl]pyridyl-2-yl}amide resulted in the formation of chlorido[η3-N-{6-[2-(diethylboryl)phenyl]pyridyl-2-yl}-N-(6-C6H4)pyrid-2-yl)amido]pentamethylcyclopentadienyltitanium (Ti-1). The structure of Ti-1 was elucidated by using single-crystal XRD. The same compound is formed upon the reaction of Cp*TiCl3 with lithium N-{6-[2-(diethylboryl)phenyl]pyridyl-2-yl}-N’-[6-(2-bromophenyl)pyridyl-2-yl]amide. The reaction of N,N-bis[6-(2-bromophen-1-yl)pyrid-2-yl]amine (4) with lithium hexamethyldisilazide followed by the addition of Cp*TiCl3 leads to the formation of [N,N-bis{6-(2-bromophen-1-yl)pyrid-2-yl}amide]dichloridopentamethylcyclopentadienyltitanium (Ti-2). The reaction of Ti-1 with benzylmagnesium chloride yields the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl titanium vinyl complex pentamethylcyclopentadienyl{N-(6-phenylpyridyl-2-yl)-N-[6-(2-ethyl-η2-vinylboryl-C6H4)pyrid-2-yl]amido}titanium (Ti-3) by C−H activation; Ti-3 is best described as a monosubstituted titanacyclopropane. Upon activation with methylaluminoxane (MAO), Ti-1 produces linear, high-density polyethylene with molecular weights >6×106 g mol−1, whereas Ti-2 yielded ethyl-branched polyethylene. Both Ti-1 and Ti-2 are able to copolymerize ethylene (E) with norborn-2-ene (NBE) and E with cyclopentene (CPE) and to terpolymerize E with NBE and CPE. Ti-1 activated by MAO is also active in the ring-opening metathesis polymerization of NBE to produce up to 97 % cis-syndiotactic poly(NBE). The polymer structure of all resulting homo- and copolymers was elucidated by using 13C NMR spectroscopy.
