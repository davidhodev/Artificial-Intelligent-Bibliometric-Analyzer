Plastic fantastic! Donor-acceptor zirconocenes with a donor (P)-substituted fluorenyl ligand and an acceptor (B)-substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand (see structure) are highly active ethylene polymerization catalysts that reveal an ultrahigh selectivity for chain propagation even at high temperatures, giving access to ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylenes (viscosity-average molecular weights Mη > 1 × 106 g mol-1).
