The reactions engaged by organic radicals with transition-metal complexes are reviewed with a particular focus on how they can interplay with and affect the results of radical polymerization. Radicals can either add to a metal centre to establish metal-carbon bonds, abstract an atom or group, be abstracted by an atom or group, undergo associative exchange, transfer a β-H atom or add to existing ligands in the metal coordination sphere. Reversibility is key for certain controlled polymerization methods. The various ways in which metal complexes can play a role in radical polymerization lead to atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), organometallic-mediated radical polymerization by either reversible termination (OMRP-RT) or degenerative transfer (OMRP-DT) and chain-transfer-catalysed radical polymerization (CTCRP). Radicals react with transition-metal complexes in many different ways. The type of reaction, when reversible, is relevant to the outcome of metal-mediated radical polymerizations. This article analyses all these reactivity patterns and their relevance to radical polymerization processes, attempting to identify trends and principles of general use.
