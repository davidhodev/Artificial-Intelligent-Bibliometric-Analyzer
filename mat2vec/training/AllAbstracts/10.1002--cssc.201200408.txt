Visible-light-driven photocatalysis is currently attracting a great deal of attention because of its potential application in solar water splitting. However, the development of efficient and durable catalyst systems is still a challenging problem. In Ru dye-sensitised TiO2 nanopowders, catalyst performances are found to decline as a result of poor bonding of the dye molecule to the TiO2 surface and subsequent detachment and self-aggregation of the dye. Our strategy to improve the stability of the dye-TiO2 interface is the encapsulation of the dye/TiO2 assembly in an amino-group-containing polyallylamine layer anchored to TiO 2. A low-pressure pulsed microwave discharge plasma polymerization process was employed to coat a commercial anatase nanopowder with a thin polyallylamine layer to nanoconfine the adsorbed dye molecules. Electron microscopy and UV/Vis spectroscopy was carried out to characterise the resulting encapsulated nanostructures. The long-term stability of the new nanomaterial as the photoactive component of a water reduction catalyst system for H 2 evolution investigated in a slurry reactor under visible-light irradiation showed stable evolution rates over a period of several days. To sensitise and encapsulate: Ru dye-sensitised TiO2 is encapsulated with plasma-polymerised polyallylamine to improve long-term stability under ambient conditions for photocatalytic water splitting. Using a Pd dichloro complex as the reduction catalyst and triethylamine as the electron source, a highly stable long-term performance as well as a small improvement in catalytic activity is achieved. The nanostructure is characterised by TEM as well as UV/Vis and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Copyright Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
