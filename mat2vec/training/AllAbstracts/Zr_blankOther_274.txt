The reduction in THF and oxidation in CH2Cl2 of the bent-sandwich complex (η5-Ind)2ZrMe2 (1) (Ind = C9H7, indenyl) were studied by cyclic voltammetry. Complex 1 in THF undergoes one-electron reduction to radical anion 1._, which partially decomposes with the liberation of the Ind- anion. Even at -45 °C the one-electron oxidation leads to the formation of an unstable 15-electron radical cation undergoing fast heterolytic decomposition to the Me. radical and (η5-Ind)2ZrMe+ cation, which is the key reaction center in the catalytic polymerization of olefins. Comparative analysis of electron-transfer-induced transformations of bent-sandwich dimethyl and dichloride zirconocenes of the general formula L2ZrX2 (L = η5-Ind, η5-Cp; X = Cl, Me) was performed.
