Titanocene (Cp2TiCl2) was immobilized by entrapping within a silica matrix using a non-hydrolytic sol-gel route. The catalyst was evaluated in ethylene polymerization under different experimental conditions. The catalyst was able to produce fibers of ultra-high molecular weight (UHMWPE) directly from the polymerization process. The polymer showed a well-organized and dense microstructure with evidence of extended-chain crystal formation. This resulting microstructure improved some mechanical properties in comparison with a commercial UHMWPE. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.
