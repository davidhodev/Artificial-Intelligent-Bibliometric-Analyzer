Poly(ether esters) are rapidly synthesized in moderate yield employing the interfacial polycondensation reaction system from the reaction of alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and Group IVB metallocenes. The products are high polymers. Infrared spectroscopy shows the formation of new bands derived from the M-O and M-O(CO) linkages. It also shows that the products exist as alternating M-O and M-O(CO) linkages. The products show outstanding inhibition of a variety of cancer cell lines including two pancreatic cancer cell lines. EC 50 values for the polymers are in the nanogram/mL range. The ability to inhibit the cancer cell lines is generally Hf>Zr>Ti. Thus, future synthesis and testing might consider using compounds containing hafnocene and zirconocene in addition to the titanocene moiety.
