Summary: The reaction dynamics of β-hydrogen transfer in the zirconocene olefin polymerization catalyst was modeled using DFT path sampling. Trajectories were found to cross the reaction barrier at a broad range and showed that Zr-H bonding increases during the reaction due to dynamic effects and a Zr-(η2-C2H4) fluctuation is critical to inducing the transfer. © 2008 American Chemical Society.
