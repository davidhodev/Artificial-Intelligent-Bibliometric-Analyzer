Star-shaped hydroxyl functionalized atacticpolymethylmethacrylate was synthesized via living/controlled radical polymerization promoted by titanocene complex in the presence of 4, 4′-methylenebis(N, N-diglycidylaniline) (I4) as the initiator, and Zn as the reducing agent. The effect of polymerization conditions such as temperature, time, as well as the ratio of the initiator to monomer on the polymerization performance was investigated. The results indicate that the monomer conversion is up to 90% at 90°C and [MMA]/[I4]=200/1. The number average molecular weight of the polymer linearly depends on the monomer conversion, implying that the performance shows living manner. The structure and properties of the obtained polymer were characterized by gel permeation in chromatography(GPC), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum (1H-NMR and 13C-NMR). The obtained polymer is atacticspecific and features narrow molecule weight distribution (1.41~1.65) under the typical condition. The number of arms and the functional hydroxyl groups of the polymer molecule are four, good corresponding with the number of the epoxy functional groups of the initiator (I4) used.
