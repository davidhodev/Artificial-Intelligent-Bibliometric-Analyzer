An MCM-41 has been modified by grafting several zirconocene complexes to give new materials potentially active in the polymerization of α-olefins. These materials have been activated by the cocatalyst MAO, to generate the catalysts MCM-41/metallocene/MAO (metallocene = [Zr(η5-C5H5)2Cl2] (1), [Zr{Me2Si(η5-C5Me4)(η5-C5H4)}Cl2] (2) and [Zr{Me2Si(η5-C5Me4)(η5-C5H3But)}Cl2] (3)). The resulting functionalized ordered mesoporous silica samples (1-3) were tested as catalysts in the polymerization of ethylene and compared with both the homogeneous system analogues and the functionalized silica derivatives SG/metallocene/MAO (SG = silica gel; metallocene = [Zr(η5-C5H5)2Cl2] (4), [Zr{Me2Si(η5-C5Me4)(η5-C5H4)}Cl2] (5) and [Zr{Me2Si(η5-C5Me4)(η5-C5H3But)}Cl2] (6)). The metallocenes 2 and 3 have been characterized by 13C-CP MAS NMR and 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy. The structure and surface properties of MCM-41/[Zr{Me2Si(η5-C5Me4)(η5-C5H4)}Cl2] and MCM-41/[Zr{Me2Si(η5-C5Me4)(η5-C5H4)}Cl2]/MAO systems have been studied by X-ray diffractometry, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms measurement and thermogravimetry. The grafting of the metallocene complexes, activation with MAO and subsequent polymerization reaction have been followed by an FT-IR "in situ" study. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy have been used to show the morphology of the heterogeneous catalysts as well as the resulting polyethylene obtained. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.
