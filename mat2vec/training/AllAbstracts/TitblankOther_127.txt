Hydrogenation of C=C bonds in styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) block copolymers in the presence of CpTiCl2(OC6H 4Y-p)/BuLi and CpTiCl2(OC6H4Y-p)/ Et3Al catalytic systems (Cp = cyclopentadienyl, Bu = butyl, Et = ethyl, Y =NO2, Cl, H, CH3, OCH3)was investigated. The effect of the kind of metal alkyl, Li:Ti or Al:Ti molar ratio, copolymer composition, reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure on activity of catalytic system was investigated. The best degree of hydrogenation for SBS copolymers (80-90 %), was obtained for the systems containing p-chlorophenoxy ligand with the most electron-acceptor properties.
