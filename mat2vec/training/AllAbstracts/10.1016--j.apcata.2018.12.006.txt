© 2018 Elsevier B.V.A series of SiMe2-bridged ansa-zirconocenes LZrCl2 derived from heterocyclic ligands such as cyclopenta[1,2-b:4,3-b’]dithiophene, 5,6-dihydroindeno[2,1-b]indole and 5,10-dihydroindeno[1,2-b]indole, called “heterocenes” were synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and by X-ray diffraction analysis. These complexes were activated by triisobutylaluminium (TIBA) at AlTIBA/Zr ratio ∼75 and then by MMАO-12 at AlMAO/Zr ratio ∼10, and were studied in the polymerization of 1-octene in the absence or presence of molecular hydrogen. In the absence of molecular hydrogen, derivatives of cyclopenta[1,2-b:4,3-b’]dithiophene and dihydroindeno[2,1-b]indole demonstrated high catalytic activity, while dihydroindeno[1,2-b]indole complexes catalyzed slow polymerization with the formation of ultrahigh molecular weight poly(1-octene)s. In the presence of molecular hydrogen, derivatives of dihydroindeno[1,2-b]indole showed an order of magnitude increase in the catalytic activity. β-Hydride elimination, β-hexyl elimination and Zr-Al transfer were detected as the main chain release mechanisms depending on the nature of the ligand used. A novel chain termination with selective formation of –C(Me)=CHCH2– unsaturations was detected. It was found that heterocenes maintained a high catalytic activity up to 120 °C. Due to their high thermal stability and good hydrogen response, heterocenes are promising catalysts for the oligomerization and hydrooligomerization of α-olefins in the production of high-quality motor oil base stocks.
