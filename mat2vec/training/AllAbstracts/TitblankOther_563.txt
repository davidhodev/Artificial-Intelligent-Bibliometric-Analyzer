New dinuclear half-titanocenes with polymethylene-bridged Cp ligands were prepared and applied to styrene polymerization. The polymerization behavior of the prepared half-titanocenes was compared to that of CpTiCL3 as well as polysiloxane-bridged one. The activity of the half-titanocene increased with temperature but CpTiCl3 decreased indicating that thermal stability of the half-titanocene is better than CpTiCl3. The polymerization behavior of dinuclear metallocene is influenced by not only the transition metal and ligands but also the structure of bridge linking the ligands.
