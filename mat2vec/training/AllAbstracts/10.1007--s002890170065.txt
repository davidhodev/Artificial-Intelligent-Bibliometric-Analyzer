Thirteen differently substituted long-chain amide- and amine-functional alkenes were synthesised and used as comonomers in zirconocene/methylaluminoxane-catalysed copolymerizations with ethylene and propylene. Characterization of the prepared copolymers showed the formation of functionalized copolymers with isolated comonomer units. The incorporation level of the comonomers ranged from 0.24 to 1.3 mol % with ethylene and from 0.04 to 0.96 mol % with propylene. The molar masses of the copolymers were lower than those of the corresponding homopolymers. End group analysis of the copolymers by NMR suggested that the dominant chain termination mechanism was chain transfer to aluminium. Â© Springer-Verlag 2001.
