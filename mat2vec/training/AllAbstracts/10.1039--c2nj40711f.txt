A series of trimetallic yttrium complexes, L<inf>7</inf>Y <inf>3</inf>Cl<inf>2</inf> [L = N-(2-methylquinolin-8-yl)-p-R-benzamides, 1: R = H; 2: R = OMe; 3: R = Me; 4: R = Cl], has been synthesized by the stoichiometric reaction of YCl<inf>3</inf>(THF)<inf>2</inf> with the corresponding potassium amidates. All complexes have been characterized by elemental analysis and NMR spectroscopy. The molecular structure of complex 1 bearing seven amidate ligands was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Screening of these complexes, in the presence of BnOH, for ring-opening polymerization of caprolactone (ε-CL) revealed effective activities. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.
