An isospecific heterogeneous zirconocene catalyst was prepared by supporting rac-Cl2SiInd2ZrCl2 on MgCl2 using an impregnation method. Polymerization of propene was conducted over this combined with methylalumoxane as co-catalyst. It was found that the catalyst displayed a fairly high activity to give highly isotactic polypropene at 40°C. With an increase in the polymerization temperature from 40 to 100°C, the activity increased monotonically accompanied by a decrease in isospecificity. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.
