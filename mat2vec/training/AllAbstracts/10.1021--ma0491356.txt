The coordination acrylamide polymerization by the cationic, chiral ansa-zirconocene ester enolate complex was discussed. The features of the polymerization include the high degree of control over polymerization stereochemistry and polymer molecular weight distribution. Poly(N,N- dimethylacrylamide) (PDMMA) with unprecedented isotacticity, high M n, low polydispersity index (PDI) and T m as high as 318Â°C is synthesized. The efforts are underway to synthesize other types of stereoregular polyacrylamides using this technique.
