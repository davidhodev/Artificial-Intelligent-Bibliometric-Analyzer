The reaction of Cp′2Zr(OtBu)Me (Cp′ = C5H4Me) and [Ph3C][B(C6F 5)4] yields the base-free complex [Cp′ 2Zr(OtBu)][B(C6F5)4] (6), which exists as Cp′2Zr(OtBu)(CIR)+ halocarbon adducts in CD2Cl2 or C6D 5Cl solution. Addition of alkenes to 6 in CD2Cl 2 solution at low temperature gives equilibrium mixtures of Cp′2- Zr(OtBu)(alkene)+ (12a-l), 6, and free alkene. The NMR data for 12a-l are consistent with unsymmetrical alkene bonding and polarization of the alkene C=C bond with positive charge buildup at Cint and negative charge buildup at Cterm. These features arise due to the lack of d-π* back-bonding. Equilibrium constants for alkene coordination to 6 in CD2Cl2 at -89 °C, K eq = [12][6]-1[alkene]-1, vary in the order: vinylferrocene (4800 M-1) ≫ ethylene (7.0) ≈ α-olefins > cis-2-butene (2.2) > trans-2-butene (<0.1). Alkene coordination is inhibited by sterically bulky substituents on the alkene but is greatly enhanced by electron-donating groups and the β-Si effect. Compounds 12a-l undergo two dynamic processes: reversible alkene decomplexation via associative substitution of a CD2Cl2 molecule, and rapid rotation of the alkene around the metal-(alkene centroid) axis. © 2006 American Chemical Society.
