Half-titanocene compounds were employed to polymerize propylene at ambient pressure. A novel polypropylene elastomer with high molecular weight (Mw = 20 × 104 ∼ 100 × 104) was produced, its molecular chain possessed random stereo-structure distribution. The effects of polymerization conditions such as Al/Ti ratio, polymerization temperature, etc. on catalytic activity and polymer molecular weight were discussed.
