Polybutene-1 was synthesized stereoselectively with the precursor η5-(pentamethyl-cyclopentadienyl) tribenzyloxide titanium (Cp*Ti(OBz)3) and methylaluminoxane (MAO). The effects of polymerization conditions, trimethyl alumina (TMA) content in MAO and temperature on the crystalline and molecular weight of the products, and catalytic activity were investigated. The structural properties of the polybutene-1 were characterized with 13C NMR and WAXD. © 2007 Qi Gu Huang.
