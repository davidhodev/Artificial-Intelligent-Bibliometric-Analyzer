The inadequacy of strategies used for the heterogeneization of metallocene catalysts is pointed out as one of the main causes of the lack of industrial employability of such polymerization catalysts. The main problems are the necessity of large quantity of MAO (cocatalyst) and the inability to control molecular mass distribution of the polymers. Based on this background, the main strategies for the heterogeneization of metallocenes are here reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of each strategy are presented and discussed on theoretical and practical perspective. Considering the results reported on the different researches, outcomes of heterogeneization strategies are pointed out.
