Metallocene catalysts in dissolved form are in most cases unsuitable for the production of polyethylene or polypropylene on an industrial scale. In order to use them in existing technical processes, metallocenes have to be supported. Cs-symmetric zirconocenes show a high activity and no leaching additional triisobutyl aluminum is used as scavenger and MAO-covered silica for heterogenization. The aluminum : zirconium ratio can be reduced to values of 500:1 to get optimal activities. The syndiotacticity of the obtained polypropylene is lower compared with polymers of the homogeneous catalyst and decreases strongly with a thinner propene concentration.
