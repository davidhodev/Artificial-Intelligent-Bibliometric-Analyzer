© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim The reaction of YCl3·3.5THF with 1 equiv. of Li(C5Me4SiMe3) afforded in high yield the ionic complex [Li(thf)4]+{[(η5-C5Me4SiMe3)YCl2]4(µ4-Cl)}–(1). The molecule of 1 consists of the tetranuclear anion {[(η5-C5Me4SiMe3)YCl2]4(µ4-Cl)}–compensated with [Li(thf)4]+in the solid state. Reactions of compound 1 with selected lithium and potassium cyclopentadienides resulted in the formation of yttrocene chloride complexes [(η5-C5Me4SiMe3)Y(L)(µ-Cl)2M(thf)2] [M = Li, L = η5-C5H5(2); M = Li, L = η5-C5Me5(3); M = Li, L = η5-C5Me4SiMe2H (4); M = K, L = η5-C5Me4CH2Ph (5)]. Yttrocene chloride complexes 2–5 underwent methylation reactions to give yttrocene methyl complexes [(η5-C5Me4SiMe3)Y(L)(µ-Me)2Li(thf)2] [L = η5-C5H5(6); L = η5-C5Me5(7); L = η5-C5Me4SiMe2H (8); L = η5-C5Me4CH2Ph (9)]. The products of all these reactions were characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy, and 2–5 were further studied by ESI mass spectrometry. The molecular structures of 1 and 4 were determined by single-crystal XRD. The methyl-bridged complexes 6–9 were tested as homogeneous catalysts for ethylene polymerization in the absence of cocatalysts.
