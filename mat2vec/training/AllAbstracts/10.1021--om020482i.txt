The reaction of TiCl4 with (chlorodimethylsilyl)(trimethylsilyl)cyclopentadiene results in the chemoselective elimination of Me3SiCl and cleanly affords ((chlorodimethylsilyl)cyclopentadienyl)titanium trichloride (2). Likewise, the reaction of TiCl4 with (chlorodimethylsilyl)(trimethylsilyl)tetramethylcyclopentadiene (6) also results in the chemoselective elimination of Me3SiCl and cleanly affords ((chlorodimethylsilyl)tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)titanium trichloride (7). This observation is in sharp contrast to the reaction of 6 with ZrCl4, which results in the chemoselective elimination of Me3SiCl but affords a mixture of half-sandwich and zirconocene complexes. Support of complex 2 or 7 on (aminomethyl)polystyrene (AMPS, 1% cross-linking, 1.3 wt % N, 0.928 mmol of N/g of support), where the mole ratio of amine content of the support to precursor catalysts was selected to be 3:1, leads to the assembly of the constrained-geometry catalyst (CGCs) 8 or 9, respectively. From the 29Si NMR, the presence of a single silicon species was observed in complex 9, which has been attributed to the CGC form. However, for 8 two silicon resonances were observed, one of which has been attributed to the CGC form and the other to a titanium amide moiety. The Ti:Si:Cl ratio for both 8 and 9 was found to be 1:1:4 through elemental analyses. Complexes 8 and 9, in conjunction with MAO as the cocatalyst, were tested for ethylene homopolymerization and ethylene/1-octene copolymerization. The thermal properties and the molecular weights of the resulting polymers were determined. The observation of ethylene-co-1-octene provides independent evidence for the formation of supported CGC from the synthetic protocol.
