This paper describes how benzene derivatives were formed with high selectivity in one - pot from three different alkynes in excellent yields. Firstly, a novel method for pair - selective coupling of an alkyne with ethylene forming zirconacyclopentenes was developed; then, highly selective cross - coupling of two different alkynes forming zirconacyclopentadienes was achieved; finally, transmetallation of Zr - C bonds to Cu - C bonds in the presence of a third alkyne led to the formation of benzene derivatives of three different alkynes. New evidences were obtained for understanding the reaction mechanism.
