Hydrogenation of C=C bonds in styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) block copolymers in the presence of CpTiCl2(OC6H 4Y-p)/BuLi and CpTiCl2(OC6H4Y-p)/ Et3Al catalytic systems (Cp = cyclopentadienyl, Bu = butyl, Et = ethyl; Y = Cl, H, OCH3) was investigated. All of the catalytic systems were active in these reactions. Their activity depended on the kind of the metal alkyl, the copolymer composition, reaction time, temperature and hydrogen pressure.Itwas established that access of catalytic species to the C=C bonds in the isoprene blocks is the most important factor in the hydrogenation efficiency. The smallest steric hindrances occur when phenoxy ligands in the catalytic systems are unsubstituted (Y = H) and styrene-isoprene diblocks (SI) are present in the SIS copolymer. Thus, the catalytic systems CpTiCl 2(OC6H4Cl)/BuLi were the most active in KratonÂ® D-1161 copolymers hydrogenation.
