The series of half-titanocene 2-(1-(arylimino)ethyl)quinolin-8-olate dichlorides, Cp′TiCl2L (Cp′ = η5-C 5H5 or η5-C5Me5, L = 2-(1-(2,6-R1-4-R2-phenylimino)ethyl)quinolin-8-olate), was synthesized via the stoichiometric reaction of Cp′TiCl3 with the corresponding potassium salt, viz. 2-(1-(2,6-R1-4-R 2-phenylimino)ethyl)quinolin-8-olate. All compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The molecular structures of complexes C2 and C4 were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. When activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO), all half-titanocene pre-catalysts exhibited high activities for ethylene polymerization and co-polymerization with α-olefins or norbornene. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
