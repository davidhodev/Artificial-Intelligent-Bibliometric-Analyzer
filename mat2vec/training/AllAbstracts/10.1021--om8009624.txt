Reaction of the menthyl-substituted metallocene dichlorides (η5-menthyl-C5H4)2MCl 2 (M = Ti (1-Ti), Zr (1-Zr)) with magnesium in the presence of Me3SiC2SiMe3 in THF gives the chiral group 4 metallocene alkyne complexes of titanium and zirconium (η5- menthyl-C5H4)2M(Me3SiC 2SiMe3) (M = Ti (2-Ti), Zr (2-Zr)). Both complexes show a similar complexation behavior and reactivity to their achiral metallocene congeners. For example, the reaction with ethylene was studied; whereas the zirconium complex 2-Zr yields the zirconacyclopentane 3 in a well-defined reaction, the titanium analogue 2-Ti produces only an as yet unseparable mixture of different compounds. 2-Ti, 2-Zr, and 3 were characterized by X-ray crystal structure analysis. © 2009 American Chemical Society.
