A series of novel zirconium complexes (R2Cp[2-R 1-6-(2-CH3OC6H4N=CH)C 6H3O]ZrCl2 (1, R1 = H, R2 = H, 2: R1 = CH3, R2 = H;4, R1 = H. Bu, R2 = H; 4, R1 = H, R2 = CH3; 5, R1 = H, R2 = n-Bu)} bearing mono-Cp and tridentate Schiff base [ONO] ligands are prepared by the reaction of corresponding lithium salt of Schiff base ligands with R2CpZrCl3-DME. All complexes were well characterized by 1H NMR, MS, IR and elemental analysis. The molecular structure of complex 1 was further confirmed by X-ray diffraction study, where the bond angle of Cl-Zr-Cl is extremely wide [151.71(3)°]. A nine-membered zirconoxacycle complex Cp(O-2-C6H4N=CHC 6H4-2-O)ZrCl2 (6) can be obtained by an intramolecular elimination of CH3Cl from complex 1 or by the reaction of CpZrCl3 · DME with dilithium salt of ligand. When activated by excess methylaluminoxane (MAO), complexes 1-6 exhibit high catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization. The influence of polymerization temperature on the activities of ethylene polymerization is investigated, and these complexes show high thermal stability. Complex 6 is also active for the copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene with low 1-hexene incorporation ability (1.10%). Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
