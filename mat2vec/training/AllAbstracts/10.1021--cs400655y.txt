Fluorinated activating supports (AS) for metallocene complexes were prepared via treatment of silica with AlEt3 or AlEt2F followed by pyrolysis and combustion steps, and a subsequent fluorination step when AlEt3 was used. This new family of activators appears to be universal for metallocene complexes leading to catalysts displaying high activities in ethylene polymerization without the addition of MAO. A productivity of 3200 g gAS-1 was obtained in 1 h with the catalyst rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2/AS8/Al(iBu) 3 at 80 C under 10 bar of ethylene. An isotactic polypropylene with a melting transition at 145 C was prepared using rac-Me2Si(2-Me- benz(e)Ind)2ZrCl2 activated by AS9 and Al(iBu) 3. The spherical particle morphology of polyolefins was particularly adapted to slurry processes employed in industry. Â© 2013 American Chemical Society.
