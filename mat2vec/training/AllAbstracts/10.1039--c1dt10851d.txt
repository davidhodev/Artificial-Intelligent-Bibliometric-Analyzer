Half-sandwich titanium salicylbenzoxazole complexes CpTiLCl <inf>2</inf>2a-2c [L = R-2-(benzo[d]xazol-2-yl)phenol (R = H (2a), R = 6-CH <inf>3</inf> (2b), R = 4-CH<inf>3</inf>-6-<sup>t</sup>Bu (2c)] and salicylbenzothiazole complexes CpTiLCl<inf>2</inf>2d-2g [L = R-2-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)phenol (R = H (2d), R = 6-CH<inf>3</inf> (2e), R = 6-<sup>t</sup>Bu (2f), R = 4-Cl (2g)] were synthesized by the reaction of CpTiCl<inf>3</inf> with the sodium salts of their corresponding precursors. Complexes 2a-2g were fully characterized by <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra and elemental analyses. The molecular structures of 2a and 2b were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction methods. When activated by excess methylaluminoxane (MAO) these half-sandwich titanium complexes showed moderate to high activities for ethylene polymerization and produced high molecular weight polyethylenes. The half-sandwich titanium salicylbenzoxazole complexes (2a-2c) exhibited higher activities, of up to 1.23 × 10<sup>6</sup> g PE mol Ti<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> for the 2b/MAO system, than those of their analogues, half-sandwich titanium salicylbenzothiazole complexes (2d-2g). © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.
