Titanium-containing carbosilane dendrimers of type nG-Si[(CH 2)3[{C6H4 - y(OMe) y}O]Ti(C5H5)Cl2]x, in which phenoxy group is anchored to the dendritic skeleton in para position through eugenol or 2-allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol precursors, were used in ethylene polymerization. Fresh toluene solutions of these dendrimers in conjunction with MAO behaved as moderate active systems. However, their aged toluene solutions, when they were activated with MAO became highly active catalysts as result of dendrimer aggregation processes. However, when the peripheral unit are replaced by [Ti(C5Me5)Cl2] or [M(C5H 5)2Cl] groups or 2-allyl-6-methylphenol are incorporated to the peryphery of a carbosilane dendrimer no aggregation was observed upon aging.
