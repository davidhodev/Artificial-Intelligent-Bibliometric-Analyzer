ZnO nanoparticle was used for preparing supported catalyst, which was applied in copolymerization of ethylene and 1-octene to obtain LLDPE/ZnO nanocomposite. There were two different impregnation methods (in situ and ex situ) in preparing the nano-ZnO supported catalyst. The investigation to compare both methods was conducted by employing various 1-octene initial concentrations in copolymerization. It was found that a heterogeneous catalytic system comprised a supported catalyst, prepared by in situ impregnation, provided higher catalytic activities and 1-octene incorporations compared to those of ex situ impregnation under similar condition perhaps due to closer similarity to a homogeneous system. For the ex situ impregnation, it was found that when zirconocene was directly impregnated onto the support, the catalytic activity decreased. This was due to zirconocene close vicinity to the supports and even deep into the support structure proved by XPS and TGA measurements. Therefore, it was more inaccessible to monomer attack and reducing the catalytic activity. The separate study on each catalytic system relating to the comonomer effect was also conducted by applying initial comonomer concentrations varied between 0 and 18 mmol. The increase in catalytic activity with increasing comonomer concentration can be considered as a positive comonomer effect, and the opposite was true for a negative comonomer effect. It was found that both positive and negative comonomer effects occurred in in situ impregnation and ex situ impregnation systems with Zn/(Al ? Zr) support, whereas only positive comonomer effect was found in an ex situ impregnation system with Zn/Al support. This suggested that the comonomer effect was varied according to the nature of each system. The polymer properties, such as relative crystallinity and thermal properties were also investigated and found to alter with 1-octene concentration. Â© Iran Polymer and Petrochemical Institute 2011.
