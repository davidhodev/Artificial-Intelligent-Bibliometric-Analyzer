Donor substituted carbon- and silicon-bridged zirconocene dichlorides of the type [η5-C13H8-CMe2-η5 -C5H3(CH2CH2NR2)]ZrCl2 (R=Me (2a), Et (2b), iPr (2c)) and [η5-C13H8-SiMe2-η5-C5H3(CH2CH2NR2) ]ZrCl2 (R=Me (4a), Et, (4b), iPr (4c)) have been prepared. Activation of 2a-c and 4a-c with excess methylalumoxane results in the formation of catalytically active species for the polymerization of ethylene and propylene. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.
