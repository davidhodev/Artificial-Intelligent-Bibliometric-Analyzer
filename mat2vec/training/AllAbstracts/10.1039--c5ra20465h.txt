© 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.We report the synthesis of two zirconocenes, dimethylsilylbis(hexamethylindenyl) zirconium dichloride, rac-(SBI∗)ZrCl2, and nbutyldimethylsilyl(hexamethylindenyl) zirconium trichloride, [(Ind∗SiMe2nBu)Zr(μ-Cl)Cl2]2. The complexes were characterised by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, and the bonding was evaluated using density functional theory. rac-(SBI∗)ZrCl2 demonstrated a very high activity for solution phase polymerisation of ethylene (ca. 22 500 kgPE-1 molZr-1 h-1 bar-1). Both rac-(SBI∗)ZrCl2 and rac-(EBI∗)ZrCl2 (EBI∗ = ethylenebis(hexamethylindenyl)) have been supported on MAO modified silica and AMOST layered double hydroxides (AMO-LDHs), and evaluated as catalysts in the slurry-phase polymerisation of ethylene. The highest catalytic polymerisation activities for rac-(SBI∗)ZrCl2 and rac-(EBI∗)ZrCl2 on the layered double hydroxides were 9657 and 4325 kgPE-1 molZr-1 h-1 bar-1 respectively, for MAO modified Mg2Al-SO4 LDH. However, rac-(EBI∗)ZrCl2 was a three times more active catalyst than rac-(SBI∗)ZrCl2 when supported on silica.
