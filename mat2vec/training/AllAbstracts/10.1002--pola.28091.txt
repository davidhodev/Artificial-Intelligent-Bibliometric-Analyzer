© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.An efficient introduction of aromatic vinyl group into syndiotactic polystyrene has been achieved by incorporation of 3,3′-divinylbiphenyl, p-divinylbenzene (DVB) in syndiospecific styrene polymerization using aryloxo-modified half-titanocenes, Cp′TiCl2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H3) (Cp′ = tBuC5H4, 1,2,4-Me3C5H2), in the presence of MAO. The resultant polymers possessed high molecular weights with uniform molecular weight distributions, and the DVB contents could be varied by the initial feed molar ratios (6-23 mol %) without decrease in the Mn values. The syndiotactic stereo-regularity and presence of the vinyl groups were confirmed by NMR spectra.
