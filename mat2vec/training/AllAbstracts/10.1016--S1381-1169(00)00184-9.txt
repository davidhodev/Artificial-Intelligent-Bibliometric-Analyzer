Eight zirconocene dichloride complexes are described that contain an alkyl or silylalkyl substituent with a fluorenyl end group on the cyclopentadienyl ring. Also, a bridged cyclopentadienyl indenyl metallocene complex with a fluorenyl terminated alkyl substituent is reported. These complexes were activated with methyl aluminoxane (MAO) and used for catalytic ethylene polymerization. Â© 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.
