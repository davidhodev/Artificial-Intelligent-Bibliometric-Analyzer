A series of nickel complexes with β-ketoiminato ligands based on pyrazolone derivative were synthesized and characterized, which are highly active catalyst precursors for norbornene polymerization under mild reaction conditions through a vinyl-type polymerization mechanism. The catalytic activity could be up to 3.38 × 107 g polymer/mol Ni h. The molecular weight distributions of the polynorbornenes (Mw/M n = 2.05-2.56) indicate the presence of a single active species in the polymerization process. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
