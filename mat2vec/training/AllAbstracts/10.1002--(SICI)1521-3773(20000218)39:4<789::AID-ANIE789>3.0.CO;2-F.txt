The systematic regulation of the molecular weight distribution in the MAO-activated polymerization of ethylene has been realized by using amino- functionalized ansa-zirconocene dichlorides as precatalysts (one of the active species is shown). The formation of high- and low-molecular-weight polyethylene with a unimodal distribution as well as the formation of polyethylene with a bimodal distribution is possible by varying the polymerization temperature.
