In this study, the use of different additives including antioxidants for the in-reactor stabilization of polyethylene has been investigated in order to provide an energy saving system. Particular attention was dedicated to the efficiency of antioxidant influencing the catalysts activity and properties of polymers. The effect of the addition of Irganox 1330 and Irgafos 168 antioxidants and zinc stearate on the activities of metallocene, post-metallocene, and their supported hybrid were studied. In addition, the effect of different additives on the thermal characteristics of the synthesized polymers and oxidative induction time (OIT) was evaluated. Our polymerization results exhibited that the factors such as chemical structure of antioxidant and its steric hindrance, type of catalysts, and their hybrid could affect the catalyst performance and OIT contents. The use of antioxidants mixture and hybrid of catalysts is a way that can increase oxidation resistance of polymers considerably. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.
