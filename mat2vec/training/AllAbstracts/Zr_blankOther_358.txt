Ethylene polymerization and ethylene/α-olefin copolymerization were conducted using diphenylmethylidene(cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride (Ph2C(Cp)(Flu)ZrCl2) as a catalyst activated with dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (Me2PhNH · B(C6F5)4)/triisobutylaluminium (i-Bu3Al) at high temperature and different ethylene pressure. This catalyst produces high molecular weight polyethylene with high activity. The molecular weight of the copolymers hardly decreases with increasing amount of comonomer in the feed. This is attributed to the control β-H transfer from the propagating chain containing primary inserted comonomer. The occurrence of inner trisubstituted double bonds was confirmed. These bonds are probably formed by dehydrogenation reactions after β-H transfer from the propagating chain followed by ethylene insertion. Therefore, this reaction might play an important role in the production of high molecular weight ethylene/1-hexene copolymers at high temperature. At high ethylene pressure, isomerization reactions from inserted ethylene or primary inserted α-olefin as terminal units, which were observed under low ethylene pressure, can be controlled at low level. © Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1999.
