Propylene was copolymerized with 1,4-divinylbenzene (1,4-DVB) using rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2ZrCl2 and MAO in the presence of hydrogen. 1H NMR spectra of the obtained copolymer confirmed the successful incorporation of 1,4-DVB. 13C NMR analysis revealed a unique copolymer structure with the incorporated 1,4-DVB units predominantly forming 1,4-substituted phenyl repeating units in the polymer main chain. A plausible mechanism involving spontaneous insertion of terminal styryl into Zr-H species was proposed to rationalize the unique incorporation of 1,4-DVB. Â© 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.
