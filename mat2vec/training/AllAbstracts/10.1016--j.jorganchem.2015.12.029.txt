All rights reserved.A series of new half-sandwich pentamethylcyclopentadienyl titanium (IV) aryl(pyridyl)amide complexes, Cp∗TiCl2[N(Ar)(2-Py)] [Ar = 2,6-iPr2Ph (1), 2,6-Et2Ph (2), 2,6-Me2Ph (3), 4-MePh (4)], have been synthesized from the reactions of Cp∗TiCl3 with the lithium salts of the corresponding aryl(pyridyl)amido ligands in toluene. A byproduct with two aryl(pyridyl)amido ligands, Cp∗TiCl[N(4-MePh)(2-Py)]2 (5) was also obtained from the synthetic reaction of complex 4 in a small amount. The new titanium complexes 1-4 were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR and elemental analyses. The molecular structures of complexes 1, 2, 4 and 5 were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. X-ray crystallographic analysis on complexes 1, 2, 4 demonstrates that these complexes possess a relatively crowded hepta-coordinating environment surrounding the central titanium atom. Upon activation with AliBu3 and Ph3CB(C6F5)4, complexes 1-4 exhibited moderate to high catalytic activity for ethylene and propylene polymerization, producing high molecular weight linear polyethylene and atactic polypropylene. It was found that complex 1 shows the highest catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization while complex 4 shows the highest catalytic activity for propylene polymerization among these complexes under similar conditions.
