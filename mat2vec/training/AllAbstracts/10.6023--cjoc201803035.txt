Â© 2018 Chinese Chemical Society & SIOC, CAS. Mono-and bisdiphenyl substituted heteroarylphosphines R-PPh 2 [R=2-pyridyl (3a), 2-thienyl (3b) and 2-furyl (3c)] and Ph 2 P-R'-PPh 2 [R'=2,6-pyridyl (6a), 2,5-thienyl (6b) and 2,5-furyl (6c)] were synthesized. After Staudinger reaction with Me 3 SiN 3 , those heteroarylphosphines were converted into the heteroarylphosphinimine ligands, R-PPh 2 (NSiMe 3 ) and (Me 3 SiN)Ph 2 P-R"-PPh 2 (NSiMe 3 ). The subsequently dehalosilylation reaction with CpTiCl 3 afforded the corresponding Ti heteroarylphosphinimine halfmetallocenes as olefin polymerization catalysts. The structures of all the complexes were determined by means of 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and 31 P NMR spectroscopic methods and further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. When activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO) at a ratio of Al/Ti=600 and under 0.5 MPa of ethylene, these bimetallic Ti phosphinimine complexes displayed a higher catalytic activity compared to the monometallic analogues, but resulted in polymers with bimodal molecular weight distributions. Unexpectedly, 6b produced ultrahigh M w polyethylene at lower polymerization temperature.
