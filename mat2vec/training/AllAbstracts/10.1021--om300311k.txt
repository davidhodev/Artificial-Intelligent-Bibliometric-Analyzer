A general and effective method for the racemoselective synthesis of bis-indenyl-type ansa-zirconocenes was proposed and successfully applied for the synthesis of several C 2-symmetric ansa-zirconocenes based on 2-methyl-4-aryltetrahydro-s-indacene. This new racemoselective method relies on ZrCl 3NH-tert-Bu as a key reagent. The formation of racemic products was confirmed by NMR studies and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The novel complexes are potent catalysts for isotactic propylene polymerization and ethylene-propylene copolymerization. Â© 2012 American Chemical Society.
