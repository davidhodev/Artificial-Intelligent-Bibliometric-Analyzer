The copolymerization of ethylene with propylene in the liquid propylene initiated by ansa-metallocenes of the C 1 symmetry, rac-[1-(9-η5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1- η5-indenyl)ethane]zirconium dichloride and rac-[1-(9- η5-fluorenyl)-2-(5,6-cyclopenta-2-methyl-1-η5- indenyl)ethane]hafnium dichloride, activated by methylaluminoxane has been studied. Triisobutylaluminum has been used as a cocatalyst. The propylene-ethylene copolymers thus prepared contain 5-60 mol % ethylene units. The reactivity ratios have been measured. In the case of the zirconocene-based catalyst, the molecular mass of the copolymers decreases with an increase in the content of ethylene units. The reverse situation is observed in the case of the hafnocene-based catalytic system. The copolymers are characterized by the low T g values (down to -45°C). Incorporation of a small amount of ethylene units (5 mol %) results in a rise in the elastomeric behavior of the polymers. © Nauka/Interperiodica 2007.
