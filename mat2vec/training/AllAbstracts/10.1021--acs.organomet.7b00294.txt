© 2017 American Chemical Society. A series of phosphine-sulfonate ligands bearing various side-arm substituents were designed and prepared. The corresponding Pd(II) complexes [κ2-(P,O)-2-(PPhAr)-1-benzenesulfonato]Pd(Me)(dmso) (Pd1, Ar = o-MeO-C6H4; Pd2, Ar = o-PhO-C6H4; Pd3, Ar = o-(2,6-Me2-C6H3)O-C6H4; Pd4, Ar = o-PhSO2-C6H4) and Ni(II) complexes [κ2-(P,O)-2-(PPhAr)-1-benzenesulfonato]NiPh(PPh3) (Ni1, Ar = o-MeO-C6H4; Ni2, Ar = o-PhO-C6H4; Ni3, Ar = o-(2,6-Me2-C6H3)O-C6H4; Ni4, Ar = o-PhSO2-C6H4) were prepared and applied in ethylene polymerization and ethylene-polar monomer copolymerization. Catalysts Pd2, Pd3, Ni2, and Ni3 are moderately active in ethylene polymerization (activity up to 8.7 × 105 g mol-1 h-1), generating polyethylene with high molecular weights (Mn up to 105100) and high melting temperatures (Tm up to 131.6 °C). The two palladium catalysts can also initiate efficient copolymerization of ethylene with methyl acrylate, allyl cyanide, and allyl acetate. Most importantly, high copolymer molecular weights (Mn between 21600 and 82500) and high polar monomer incorporation ratios (between 6.1% and 15.2%) could be achieved simultaneously in this system. This side-arm strategy is highly effective in modulating the properties of the phosphine-sulfonate palladium and nickel catalysts.
