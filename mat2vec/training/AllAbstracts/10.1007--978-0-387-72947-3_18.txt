Spontaneously formed fibers are formed from a number of metal-containing polymers when synthesized employing the interfacial polymerization system. This topic is reviewed with emphasis on Group IVB and organotin-containing polymers. Over 50 organotin polymers were surveyed for fiber formation. It is believed that fiber formation is favored when the backbone is rigid. The fibers have aspect ratios over 100. Their use as fibers in composites is encouraged. Â© 2008 Springer New York.
