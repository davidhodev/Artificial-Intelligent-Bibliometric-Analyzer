The compound [HNMe2Ph][NpB(C6F5) 3](Np=(CH3)3CCH2) reacts with dimethylzirconocenes to give active propylene polymerization catalysts which are significantly more active and give higher molecular weight polypropylene than do the catalysts obtained using B(C6F5)3; the [NpB(C6F5)3) anion is for steric reasons more weakly coordinating than is [MeB(C6F5)3].
