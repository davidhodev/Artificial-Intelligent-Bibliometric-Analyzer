Reaction of lithium(neomenthylcyclopentadienid) 3 with dimethyldichlorosilane gives dimethylbis[3-(neomenthyl)cyclopentadienyl]silane 4 regioselectively as a mixture of double bond shift isomers (57% isolated). Deprotonation with 2 equiv. of butyllithium followed by treatment with zirconiumtetrachloride furnished a mixture of the three {dimethylsilylenbis[η5-3-(neomenthyl)cyclopentadienyl]}zirconium dichloride diastereomers from which the pure meso-like isomer 6c [p-R(1'S,3'R,4'R),p-S(1'S.3'R,4'R)] was isolated by fractional crystallization. Complex 6c was characterized by an X-ray crystal structure analysis. Its Dl-Zr-D2 angle of 126.8° is very similar as observed in bis(η-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride (D1 and D2 denote the centroids of the cyclopentadienyl rings). The homogeneous 6c/methylalumoxane Ziegler-type catalyst produces polypropylene of low molecular weight ([formula omitted]η≈ 670 at ambient temperature). Related catalyst systems may find interesting applications in organic synthesis. © 1995 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung. All rights reserved.
