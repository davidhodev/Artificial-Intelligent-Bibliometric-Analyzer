A hierarchically porous π-conjugated polyHIPE was used as a heterogeneous visible light photoinitiator for the radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) under a household energy saving light bulb at room temperature. The heterogeneous nature of the porous polymer ensures easy separation and reusability. © the Partner Organisations 2014.
