A series of neutral nickel(II) complexes 1a-c bearing asymmetric bidentate β-diketiminato ligands have been investigated as catalysts for vinyl-addition polymerization of norbornene (NBE) in the presence of modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO) cocatalyst. The highest catalytic activity up to 4.51×10 4 kg PNBE/mol-Ni-h and viscosity-average molecular weight (M v ) of polymers up to 1.07×10 6 g/mol were observed under optimal conditions, and Ia-c exhibited higher catalytic activities, afforded higher molecular weight polymers than the corresponding bis(β-diketiminato)nickel(II) complexes, 2a-c. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.
