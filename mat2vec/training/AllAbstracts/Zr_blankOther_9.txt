All right reserved.In this paper, the supported metallocene catalysts were prepared, in which SiO<inf>2</inf> was used as the carrier, Cp<inf>2</inf>ZrCl<inf>2</inf> was used as the main catalyst and MAO, B(C<inf>6</inf>F<inf>5</inf>)<inf>3</inf>, [HNMe<inf>2</inf>Ph][B(C<inf>6</inf>F<inf>5</inf>)<inf>4</inf>], [Ph<inf>3</inf>C][B(C<inf>6</inf>F<inf>5</inf>)<inf>4</inf>], B(C<inf>6</inf>F<inf>5</inf>)<inf>3</inf>/TMA were used as the activators respectively. The effect of the activators on the catalytic properties in ethylene homopolymerization and ethylene/α-olefins copolymerization was investigated. From the results, it was found that when the added amount of boron was 5.1×10<sup>-4</sup> mol/g SiO<inf>2</inf>, the molar ratio of B:Zr was between 14.10~19.04, the activity of the supported metallocene catalysts reached up to 10<sup>7</sup> g/(molZr·h) which was 511~1 090 times higher than that of MAO under the same conditions. The added amount of boron was only 1/16 of MAO for the same catalytic activity of 10<sup>7</sup> g/(molZr·h). Compared with the supported catalyst with B(C<inf>6</inf>F<inf>5</inf>)<inf>3</inf> as activator, the catalytic activity of supported metallocene catalyst with [HNMe<inf>2</inf>Ph][B(C<inf>6</inf>F<inf>5</inf>)<inf>4</inf>] or [Ph<inf>3</inf>C][B(C<inf>6</inf>F<inf>5</inf>)<inf>4</inf>] as activator was higher. It was also found that [Ph<inf>3</inf>C][B(C<inf>6</inf>F<inf>5</inf>)<inf>4</inf>] system had the most narrow molecular weight distribution(MWD) and maximum 1-hexene content(2.97%). Copolymers prepared by the supported metallocene catalysts with boron activators had narrow MWD and density between 0.91~0.92 g/cm<sup>3</sup> which belonged to the scope of mLLDPE.
