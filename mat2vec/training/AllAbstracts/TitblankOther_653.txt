Reaction of methylaluminoxanes with CH3 and CD3 groups (MAO and MAOd) with the components of catalytic systems for α-olefin polymerization composed of Cp2ZrX2 [X is Cl (I) or Me (II)], (CpR)2ZrCl2 [R is i-Pr (III) or t-Bu (IV)], Me2SiCp2ZrCl2 (V), and EtInd2ZrCl2 (VI) was studied in toluene and toluene-d8. Based on the isotopic composition of produced methane, the following conclusions were made: (1) Methane was formed mainly by the reaction of Me-Zr groups with hydrogen in the Cp ring. In reactions II + MAO, α-elimination of Me groups was also observed. (2) Introduction of alkyl substituents into the Cp ring and the presence of the C2H4 bridge between indenyl ligands increase the mobility of hydrogen in aromatic rings and cause H-D exchange between CD3 and Cp groups. (3) Fast exchange of methyl groups between II and MAOd was observed. Reactions I + MAO predominantly yielded Cp2ZrMeCl. Methane is formed by the bimolecular reaction of zirconium alkyl derivatives in reactions I + MAO and II + MAO. High yields of methane that substantially exceeded the amount of the introduced Zr are indicative of restoration of Zr-Me bonds. Under experimental conditions, the binuclear cations {[Cp3Zr2Me2X]-μCp}+ were formed as intermediates that are active methane generators.
