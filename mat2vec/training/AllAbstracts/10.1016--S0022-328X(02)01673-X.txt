Dinuclear ansa zirconocene complexes containing a half-sandwich and a sandwich moiety and their ligand precursors have been synthesized and characterized. After activation with methylalumoxane (MAO), these catalysts produce polyethylenes with bimodal molecular weight distributions in homogeneous and heterogeneous media. The catalyst performances and the polymer properties were compared with mono nuclear reference catalysts. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
