Two new hetro-dinuclear metallocene catalyst systems of [(C5H5)MCl2] (C5H4)SiMe5 (C5H4)] [(C5H5)SmCl] [M=Ti(D, Zr(2)] activated by MAO were used for the polymerization of ethylene. The affections of catalyst concentration, molar ratio of [Al]/[Cat], temperature and time on polymerization were studied in detail. The results show that the catalytic activity of dinuclear catalysts is lower than the corresponding mononuclear metallocene, and the molecular weight, melt point and crystallinity of polyethylene produced are somewhat decrease.
