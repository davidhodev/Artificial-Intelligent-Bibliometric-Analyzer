Homogeneous catalyst system, Cp2MCl2/Et3Al + R3SiCl (Cp = η5 = C5H5, M = TI, ZR; R=Me, Ph), polymerizes ethylene in toluene medium. The activity of such catalyst systems are governed by the factors like nature of metallocene dichloride, chlorosilane, and polymerization parameters such as Al/M, Si/Al molar ratios and temperature. It is observed that zirconocene dichloride system shows higher polymerization efficiency as compared to titanium analogues. Furthermore, the use of trimethylchlorosilarn in combination with triethylaluminum (TEAL) as cocatalyst yields more polymer in comparison to triphenylchlorosilane and TEAI system. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
