The isolation of non‐fluxional alumoxane compounds, [(tBu)2Al{OAl(tBu)2}]2 and [(tBu)AlO]n (n = 6, 7, 8, 9), has allowed for an investigation of the mode of activity observed for alumoxanes as co‐catalysts for the zirconocene polymerization of olefins. [(tBu)2Al{OAl(tBu)2}]2, which contains two three‐coordinate aluminum centers, shows no reaction with Cp2ZrMe2, and no catalytic activity towards ethylene polymerization. In contrast, the closed cage compound [(tBu)AlO]6 reacts reversibly to give the ion pair complex, [Cp2ZrMe][(rBu)6Al6O6Me], which is active as a catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene. Polymerization is also observed for mixtures of Cp2ZrMe2 with [(tBu)AlO]n (n = 7, 9). A new concept, “latent Lewis acidity”, is proposed to account for the reactivity of the cage alumoxanes, [(tBu)AlO]n. Copyright © 1995 Hüthig & Wepf Verlag
