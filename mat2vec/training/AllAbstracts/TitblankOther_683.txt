The kinetics of polymethylalumoxane (MAO) and half titanocene complexes was investigated to understand their structures and behaviour during the syndiostatic polymerization of styrene and styrene-ethylene copolymers. Results showed that the mixtures of half titanocene complexes with other cocatalysts prepared in toluene at room temperature, were only marginally active in syndiospecific styrene polymerization at temperatures lower than 0 °C, indicating that propagation kinetic constants (Kp) and/or the concentration of the active species were very small in that condition. The fast deactivation of the systems at temperatures higher than 80 °C can be related to thermal decomposition of the active species.
