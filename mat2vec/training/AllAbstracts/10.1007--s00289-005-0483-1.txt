Propylene copolymerization with 1-hexene and 4-methyl-1-pentene in liquid propylene medium in presence of MAO-activated C2-symmetry ansa-zirconocene rac-Me2Si(4-Ph-2-MeInd)2ZrCl2 was studied. Random copolymers of propylene with 1-hexene and 4-methyl-1-pentene content up to 7mol∈% were obtained at 60 °C. General kinetic characteristics of propylene/higher α-olefin copolymerization were evaluated. The distinct feature of propylene copolymerization with 1-hexene and 4-methyl-1-pentene in liquid propylene medium - the proximity of comonomer relative reactivity ratios (r1 r21) that indicates azeotropic nature of copolymerization processes in studied conditions. Synthesized copolymers were characterized with the use of IR, 13C NMR, GPC, WAXD, DSC techniques, and uniaxial tensile testing.
