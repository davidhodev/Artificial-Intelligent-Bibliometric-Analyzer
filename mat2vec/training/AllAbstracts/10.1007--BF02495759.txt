The catalytic properties of the zirconium complex with "constrained geometry" Me2SiCp*NBu1ZrX2 (Cp* = C5Me4, X = Cl (1a), Me (1b)) and bridged bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconocene Me2SiCp2ZrX2 (X = Cl (2a), Me (2b)) during their activation with triisobutylaluminum/perfluorophenyl borates (TIBA/LB(C6F5)4, L = CPh3 (3), Me2HNPh (4)) in ethylene polymerization under a monomer pressure of 2-20 atm were studied by comparison. Both dichloride complexes exhibit moderate activity under the action of the combined TIBA/3 activating agent and give linear high-molecular-weight polyethylene (PE). The interaction of the dimethyl complexes with TIBA/3(4) afford active sites in which the growing polymeric chain is intensely transferred to the monomer, due to which low-molecular-weight PE is formed. The dichloride complexes affected by TIBA/4 also afford low-molecular-weight PE. Analysis of the structure of the polymeric products (1H NMR spectrometry, IR spectroscopy), molecular-weight parameters of the PE samples (gel permeation chromatography (GPC)), and kinetics of polymerization suggested that the active site contains AlBu13 as a heteronuclear bridged cationic complex. The influence of various basic substrates (the products of chain transfer with the terminal vinyl groups, the dimethylaniline fragment of borate 4 or other amine specially introduced into the reaction mixture) on the catalytic properties of the Zr-Al site was revealed. The polymerization rate and molecular-weight parameters of PE as functions of the reaction temperature, ethylene pressure, and modifying additives were studied.
