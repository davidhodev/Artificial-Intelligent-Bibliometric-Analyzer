Dehydrogenation chemistry with iron: The first examples of efficient iron-catalyzed dehydrocoupling/dehydrogenation of amine-boranes at ambient temperature have been reported. In the case of the primary amine-borane adduct MeNH2·BH3, both the polymer and/or N-alkyl borazine can be obtained (see scheme; 1=[{CpFe(CO)2}2]). Copyright © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
