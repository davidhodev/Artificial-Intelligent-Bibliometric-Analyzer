This chapter deals with the synthesis and assembly chemistry of the novel inorganic polymers known as polyphosphazenes. They can form the hybrid systems of organic and inorganic polymers including blends and copolymers with stepped-up excellent properties. Most of the organic polymers are not suitable for applications at extreme temperatures. They become very brittle at low temperatures while oxidative at high temperatures. Organic polymers are normally easy to burn because of their flammability. Their main limitation is that the basic petroleum feed stocks do not last forever. However, organic polymers are so diverse in terms of their structure and property that it's possible to find new types of polymeric systems with completely different properties by combining with inorganic compounds. Organic polymers could be prepared in a number of ways taking advantage of the rich functional group chemistry of organic molecules. But almost all of the inorganic polymers require more difficult and different synthetic strategies. Among inorganic polymers, the polymers based on silicon element are well known for their superior properties, rigorous monomers, and hard preparation. Phosphazenes are the intriguing substrates having chemical structures based on -P=N-repetitive units from low-molecular weight cyclic derivatives to more than 10,000 molecular weight polymers. More interesting is that the two substituent groups are attached to the phosphorus atoms, thereby producing a series of new materials that are able to cover an unbelievably large number of practical applications.
