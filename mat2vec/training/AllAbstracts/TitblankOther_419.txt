Based on the concept of enhancing the ability of forming complex of ligand, a new approach for synthesizing titanocene derivatives catalyzed by supermolecule is presented herein. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated using the reaction of forming titanocene derivatives in two phase (H2O/CHCl3) system catalyzed by water soluble β-cyclodextrin polymer (WS-β-CDP). Based on the electronic absorption and fluorescence spectra, it was found that when β-CDP is present as a microreactor in the reaction system, it selects ligand firstly in the aqueous phase to form a supramolecular complex, making ligand more active and react interfacially with titanocene dichloride in the organic phase more easily to form titanocene complex. Then, the next ligand substitutes for the titanocene complex and enter the microreactor, thus making the reaction to continue. At the same time, it was found that WS-β-CDP can enhance the stability of the species of titanocene ("Cp2Ti") and form titanocene complexes at pH = 10.60.
