Two different commercial silica materials including Sylopol 643 and Sylopol 633 were used as support materials for the preparation of heterogenous dimethylsilanediylbis[2-methyl-4-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1-indenyl] zirconium dichloride catalyst. The support materials were calcinated at two different temperatures under heating rate of 2 °C/min before treatment with methylaluminoxane (MAO). The effects of molecular hydrogen and Al/Zr ratio on polymer properties were considered. The catalyst system derived from Sylopol 643 exhibits higher catalyst activity than that of Sylopol 633. Uniform immobilization of MAO is achieved using Sylopol 643. Polymer particle growth characteristics and particle distribution depends strongly on the silica support used. Sylopol 633 produced higher fine level than Sylopol 643.
