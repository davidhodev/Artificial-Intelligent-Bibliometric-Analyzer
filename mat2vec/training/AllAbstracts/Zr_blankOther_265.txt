Rac-[isopropylidenebis(4,5-benzindenyl)] zirconium dichloride/ MAO promotes copolymerization of ethylene and styrene to form a random copolymer with a high activity. The random copolymer has head to tail St-St sequences and isotactic stereo-regularity both of the head to tail St-St and alternating Et-St sequences. This catalytic system also promotes homo-polymerization of styrene to form isotactic polystyrene. The steric interaction of the C 2 symmetric ligand framework to polymer chain ends and monomer phenyl groups may control isotactic propagation, similarly to the isotactic polymerization of propene reported, with complexes having C 2 symmetry.
