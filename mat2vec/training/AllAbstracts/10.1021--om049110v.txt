The alkylation and insertion reactions in dichloro azatantalacyclopropane complexes were analyzed. The ethylene and propene insertion reactions into the Ta-C bond of the azatantalacyclopropane system lead to dichloro azatantalacyclopropane complexes. A plausible decomposition process could consist in a Î²-hydrogen activation and a subsequent rupture of the Ta-C and N-C bonds into a concerted four-center transition state. The alkyne insertion reaction is faster and gives dichloro azatantalacyclopropane complexes which are more stable than the azatantalacyclopropane complexes due to the delocalization of the electronic density along the Ar-N-Ta-C=C bond system.
