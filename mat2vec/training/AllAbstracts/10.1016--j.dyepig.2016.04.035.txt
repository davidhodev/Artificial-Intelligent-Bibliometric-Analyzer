Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd. The AB and AB2 trans-stilbene-benzophenone dyads were synthesized through multi-step pathway. The target dyads showed remarkable absorption in visible light region. Visible light photoinitiating polymerization of methyl methacrylate by the new dyads was studied by photo-differential scanning calorimetry. The results suggested that the AB2 dyad showed more efficient photoinitiating polymerization of methyl methacrylate than the AB one under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, the new dyads yielded the greater visible light photoinitiaing polymerization effect than the intermolecular photoinitiating systems and the commercial photoinitiator titanocene respectively. The molecular weights of visible light photopolymers produced by the new dyads were determined by gel permeation chromatography. The visible light photoinitiating mechanism of the new dyads was analyzed by the static and transient absorption and emission spectra, electron spin resonance spectra and cyclic voltammograms. The thermal stabilities of the new dyads were further studied by differential scanning calorimetry and thermograving.
