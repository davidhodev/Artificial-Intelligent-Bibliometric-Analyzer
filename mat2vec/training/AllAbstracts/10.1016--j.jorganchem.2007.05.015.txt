Since the discovery of titanium- and zirconium complexes with linked cyclopentadienyl amido ligands, this new polymerization catalyst class (constrained geometry catalysts "CGCs") has attracted the interest of many research groups in industry and academia. In order to improve or modify the catalytic and polymer properties, numerous changes in the environment of the catalyst have produced a huge family of CGCs. The aim of this contribution is to provide a concise overview on synthetic entries to these structurally highly diverse catalysts - an organometallic guide to CGCs. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V.
