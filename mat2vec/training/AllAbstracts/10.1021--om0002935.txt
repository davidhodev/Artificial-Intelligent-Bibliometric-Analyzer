A series of chiral enantiopure group 4 metallocene dichlorides (CpSi(*))2MCl2 [CpSi(*) = η5-C5H4SiMe2(1R)-endo-(+)-OC10H17, M = Zr, 3; Hf, 4] and Cp(CpSi(*))MCl2 [Cp = η5-C5H5, M = Ti, 5; Zr, 6] were synthesized as precatalysts for the dehydropolymerization of PhSiH3. The time-averaged C2-asymmetric metallocene dichlorides (CpSi(*))2MCl2 (M = Zr, Hf) were prepared by the metathesis reaction of 2 equiv of (CpSi(*))Li, 2, with the appropriate metal tetrachloride MCl4·2THF. The C1-symmetric compounds Cp(CpSi(*))MCl2 (M = Ti, Zr) were synthesized by a similar metathesis reaction of (CpSi(*))Li and the precursor CpMCl3 (M = Ti, Zr·2THF). All compounds were characterized by elemental analysis and 1H, 13C{1H}, and 29Si{1H} NMR spectroscopy in addition to various 2D NMR spectroscopy techniques. A crystalline sample of 6 was studied by X-ray diffraction, which confirmed the pseudo-tetrahedral geometry of the Zr metal center and the C1 symmetry of the overall complex. A 1.0 mol% loading of the chiral precatalysts 3-6 was combined with 2.0 mol% of n-BuLi to provide an in situ catalyst for the dehydropolymerization of PhSiH3 to polyphenylsilane. The performance of each chiral catalyst was assayed with respect to polymer molecular weight properties and polymer microstructure. Substituted zirconocenes 3 and 6 were found to produce higher average molecular weight polymers (Mw = 4100) by GPC analysis. The characterization of each by 29Si{1H} NMR spectroscopy indicated that all polyphenysilanes consisted of atactic micro-structures (mm = 0.20, mr = 0.50, rr = 0.30).
