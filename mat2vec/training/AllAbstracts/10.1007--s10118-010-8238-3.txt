Neodymium chloride isopropanol complex (NdCl33iPrOH) activated by modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO) was examined in isoprene polymerization in hexane, with regards to Nd compounds, aluminum (Al) compounds, [Al]/[Nd] ratio, polymerization temperature and time. NdCl33 iPrOH exhibited high activity producing polymers featuring high cis-1,4 stereospecificity (> 96%), very high molecular weight (Mn > 1.0 × 106) and fairly narrow molecular weight distribution (MWD, Mw/Mn < 2.0) simultaneously. In comparison, neodymium isopropoxide also showed high activity providing polymers with narrow MWD (Mw/Mn = 2.07), but somewhat low cis-1,4 content (ca. 92%), while neodymium chloride had no activity under present polymerization conditions. The Al compounds affected the polymer yield in the order of Al(i- Bu)3 > MMAO > Al(i-Bu)2H. MMAO as cocatalyst afforded polyisoprene with high Mn over 1.0 × 106, whereas as stronger chain transfer agent than MMAO, Al(i-Bu)3 and Al(i-Bu)2H yielded polymers with low Mn (1.0 × 105-8.0 × 105). NdCl33 iPrOH/MMAO catalyst showed a fairly good catalytic activity even at relatively low [Al]/[Nd] ratio of 30, and the produced polymer remained high cis-1,4 content of 95.8% along with high Mn over 1.0 × 10 6 even at elevated temperatures up to 70°C. The polymerization rate is of the first order with respect to the concentration of isoprene. The mechanism of active species formation was discussed preliminarily. © 2010 Chinese Chemical Society Institute of Chemistry, CAS Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
