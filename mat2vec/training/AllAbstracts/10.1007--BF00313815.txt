Polymerization of propylene was carried out at 0 °C in the presence of methyl methacrylate(MMA) or ethyl benzoate(EB) using rac-Et(Ind)2ZrMe2 or rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrMe2 / Ph3CB(C6F5)4 as catalyst, which resulted in highly isotactic poly(propylene) with [mmmm] > 98 % , Tm = 160-161°C and very few 1,3- or 2,1 regioirregular units. With the use of an achiral zirconocene Cp2ZrMe2, a polymer with Tm =139 °C was resulted as well. Base on these experimental fact that the zirconocene can form a C1-symmetrical complex with a Lewis base.
