All right reserved.A series of polyolefin elastomers were prepared via copolymerization of ethylene with α-olefins including 1-hexene, 1-octene and 1-decene catalyzed with non-metallocene(2, 4-tBu2-6-PPh2-C6H2O)2TiCl2/MAO catalytic system. The resultant copolymers exhibit high molecular weight (Mw>4.0×105) and unimodal distribution(Mw/Mn≈2.00). The catalytic activity for the copolymerization is higher than 6830 kg/(molTi·h·MPa). The incorporation of comonomer could be adjusted between 4.0%~10.1%. The thermal and mechanical properties of the copolymers were characterized by NMR, DSC, WAXD and tensile testing. With increases of the comonomer incorporation, the melting temperature and the crystallinity gradually decrease with increase of the incorporation of α-olefin, whereas the elongation at break increases. When the monomer incorporation reaches molar fraction 4.0%, the strain-hardening phenomenon is observed without the typical strain softening, suggesting that the copolymers exhibit the mechanical properties of thermoplastic elastomers. The elastic recovery of polyolefin elastomers can easily surpass 80%.
