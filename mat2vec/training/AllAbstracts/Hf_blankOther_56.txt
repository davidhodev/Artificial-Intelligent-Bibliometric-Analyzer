Alkyl zirconocenes [Zr(η-C5H4R)2X2] (where R = CH2Ph, X = Cl 1a or Me 1b; R = CHPh2, X = Cl 2a or Me 2b; R = Si(SiMe3)3, X = Cl 4a or Me 4b) and for comparison [Zr(η-C5H5)(η-C5H4CH 2Ph)Cl2] 3a were prepared and characterised. The reactions of these compounds with the methide abstracting reagents B(C6F5)3, B(o-C6F5C6F4)3 and [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4] - were investigated by low temperature NMR spectroscopy. Compound 1b reacts with [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4] - to form the homodinuclear complex [{Zr(η-C5H4CH2Ph)2Me} 2(μ-Me)]+[B(C6F5) 4]-. The related compound [{Zr(C5H4CH2Ph)2Me} 2(μ-Me)]+[MeB(C6F5) 3]- 5a was formed from the reaction of 1b with 0.5 equivalent of B(C6F5)3. Reaction between 1b and 1 equivalent B(C6F5)3 gave [Me(η-C5H4CH2Ph) 2Zr(μ-Me)B(C6F5)3] 6a and the ion pair [Zr(η-C5H4CH2Ph)2Me][MeB(C 6F5)3] 6b which are in equilibrium with each other. A similar observation was made when 2b was used instead of 1b. The sterically more demanding 4b does not show this behaviour. The role of the ligands in ethylene polymerisation was investigated.
