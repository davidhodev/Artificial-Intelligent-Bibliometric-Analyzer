The interaction of the Group 4 metal chlorides, MCl4, where M = Ti, Zr, Hf, with two equiv. of methyllithium at -78 °C in toluene has led to the corresponding methylidene-metal complex, H2C=MCl2, possibly complexed with LiCl. That this complex was stable to at least -40 °C was demonstrated by adding chemical trapping agents at this temperature: 1) benzophenone was quantitatively converted into 1,1-diphenylethylene when M = Ti or Zr; with the Hf analogue, a 1:3 mixture of 1,1-diphenylethylene and 1,1-diphenylethanol was produced; 2) propiophenone reacted with the methylidene complex to yield 2-phenyl-1-butene, 38% (M = Ti) or 25% (M = Zr), with the majority of the propiophenone being recovered (the unreacted ketone is attributed to enolate salt formation competing with the methylidenation); 3) diphenylacetylene reacted with H2C=TiCl2 by cycloaddition in 50% yield, ultimately to give a 1:1 mixture of α-methyl-cis-stilbene and α-methyl-trans-stilbene; and finally 4) norbomene was polymerized in a ROMP process by either the methylidenetitanium or methylidene-zirconium complex, but the titanium catalyst exhibited higher activity. The stability of such methylidene complexes proved to be highly temperature- and solvent-dependent: 1) the methylidene complex in toluene was no longer detectable by chemical trapping when the reaction mixture was warmed to 0 °C or above; 2) the generation of the methylidene complex in THF was uniformly unsuccessful even at -78 °C or above. From these observations this study concludes that in toluene the free methylidene complex, H2C=MCl 2, is not present but rather the agent is still bonded to LiCl. At higher temperatures in toluene or even at -78 °C in THF, the LiCl dissociates from such complexation and the free methylidene dimerizes to [Cl2M-CH2]2, as is known in the case of Cp 2Ti=CH2. © Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
