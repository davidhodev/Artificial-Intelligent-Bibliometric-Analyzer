Highly efficient Type I photoinitiators (PI) based on the silyl radical chemistry are reviewed here for Free Radical Photopolymerization (FRP) or Free Radical Promoted Cationic Photopolymerization (FRPCP). The ability of these structures to initiate the polymerization of acrylates (FRP) or epoxy (FRPCP) monomers is presented here in detail. These compounds (10,10'-bis 10-phenyl-10H-phenoxasilin Si-1 and 9,9'-dimethyl-9,9'-bis 9H-9-silafluorene Si-2) and poly(methyl phenyl silane) Si-3 directly generate silyl radicals under light irradiation. A low oxygen inhibition in the photopolymerization is outlined. In any case, the silylium cations are the initiating species for the ring opening polymerization. A thermal redox process at RT between these organosilanes and oxidizing agents (silver salts) also generates initiating species for the cationic polymerization of epoxy monomers. The present results evidence the high potential of this new class of (photo)initiators based on organosilanes for the thermal redox or photoinitiated epoxy monomer polymerization.
