The immobilization of the dinuclear platinum(II) sulfido complex [Pt 2(μ-S)2 (PPh3)4] on solid supports has been investigated. Reaction with haloalkyl functionalized polymers [Merrifield's resin (chloromethylated polystyrene), chloropropyl silica, chloropropyl controlled pore glass, and bromopropyl polysiloxane] gives complexes immobilized through alkylation of one of the sulfide ligands, forming a μ-thiolate ligand acting as an anchor to the polymer support, akin to well-established reactions of [Pt2(μ-S)2(PPh 3)4] with molecular alkylating agents. The model complex [Pt2(μ-S)(μ-SCH2SiMe3)(PPh 3)4]PF6 was prepared as the first molecular silicon-containing derivative of [Pt2(μ-S)2(PPh 3)4] and was fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Immobilization of [Pt2(μ-S)2(PPh3) 4] by phosphine exchange reactions was also achieved using commercial polystyrene-grafted triphenylphosphine or a new immobilized phosphine [derived by sequential functionalization of Merrifield's resin with a polyether amine and then Ph2PCH2OH]. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.
