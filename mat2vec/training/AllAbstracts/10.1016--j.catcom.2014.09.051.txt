The FT-IR, TEM, XRD, XPS and ICP results indicated that salenCrIIICl was successfully supported on MPOAP. The resulted catalyst (MPOAP-salenCrIIICl) exhibited excellent catalytic performance for alternating copolymerization of cyclohexene oxide (CHO) with carbon dioxide (CO2). Moreover, the supported catalyst had an obvious effect on the microstructures of the copolymerization and the obtained polymer was found to be a linear alternating copolymerwith narrower molecular weight distribution. The TG and DTG results indicated that the product prepared by the supported catalyst possessed higher decomposition temperature.
