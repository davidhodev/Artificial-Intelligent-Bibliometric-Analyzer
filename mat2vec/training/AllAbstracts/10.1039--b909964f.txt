The use of solvents produces the largest amount of auxiliary waste in polymer science. Due to the fact that sustainable chemistry is becoming more and more important in polymer research, alternative reaction media have been investigated in order to reduce or replace the use of organic solvents. The most commonly used green solvents in polymer chemistry are water, supercritical carbon dioxide and ionic liquids. The progress of utilizing these green solvents in polymerization processes is reviewed and discussed in this critical review on the basis of results mainly published during the last five years (216 references).
