The reaction of zirconocene dichloride with acetylene dicarboxylic acid in the two-phase systems H2O/CH2Cl2 and H2O/CHCl3 gives the polymeric compounds [Cp2Zr(μ-OCOCCOCO)]n (1) and [Cp2Zr(μ-OCOCCOCO) · CHCl3]n (2) in crystalline form. X-ray structure investigations show that in both compounds the polymer chains have 21 symmetry and are packed parallel to each other in the crystals. The dicarboxylato bridges act as (2 + 1)-dentate ligands, such that each Zr atom has three ligation O atoms in addition to its Cp ligands and thus has an 18-electron configuration. © 1989.
