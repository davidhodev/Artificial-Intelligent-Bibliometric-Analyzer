The morphology of the thermoplastic polypropylene elastomer generated with unbridged bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconocene is studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and nitric acid digestion. Thermal fractionation DSC reveals the presence of many melting fractions which is likely caused by a broad distribution in crystallizable block lengths. Hard crystalline domains dispersed in a continuous amorphous matrix are clearly visible in the AFM images. Images of stretched samples show irreversible morphology changes at high elongations. High temperature nitric acid digestion study provides another estimate of the crystalline domain size in the polymers.
