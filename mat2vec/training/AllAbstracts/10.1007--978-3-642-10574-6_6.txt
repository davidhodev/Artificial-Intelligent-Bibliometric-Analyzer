© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.The application of polymers in modern technology, of concentration and isolation of metal ions from solution, water preparation, water purification, processes of removal, concentration, and separation of metal ions (including heavy), and catalysis, is determined to a great extent by the ability of metal ions to form stable contacts with functional groups of macromolecules as sorbents. They appear as a result of the creation of a system of electrovalent and coordination bonds between metal ions and certain groups of polymers, with formation of new polymer systems – macromolecular metal complexes(MMC).
