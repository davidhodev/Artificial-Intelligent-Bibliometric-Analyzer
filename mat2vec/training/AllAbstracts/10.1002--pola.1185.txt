The use of functional groups bearing silica/poly(styrene-co-4-vinylpyridine) core-shell particles as a support for a zirconocene catalyst in ethylene polymerization was studied. Several factors affecting the behavior of the supported catalyst and the properties of the resulting polymer, such as time, temperature, Al/N (molar ratio), and Al/Zr (molar ratio), were examined. The conditions of the supported catalyst preparation were more important than those of the ethylene polymerization. The state of the supported catalyst itself played a decisive role in both the catalytic behavior of the supported catalyst and the properties of polyethylene (PE). IR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to follow the formation of the supports. The formation of cationic active species is hypothesized, and the performance of the core-shell-particle-supported zirconocene catalyst is discussed as well. The bulk density of the PE formed was higher than that of the polymer obtained from homogeneous and polymer-supported Cp2ZrCl2/methylaluminoxane catalyst systems.
