We report a new method for the synthesis of block copolymers with a pentasilane core by the polymerization of alkyl methacrylate monomers using the pentasilyl dianion as an initiator. The polymerization proceeded with living features and yielded the corresponding block copolymers with controlled molecular weights. The amphiphilic block copolymer was obtained by the polymer reaction, and it formed spherelike aggregates in MeOH/H2O solution. Â© 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
