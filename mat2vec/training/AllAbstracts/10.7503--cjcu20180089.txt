All right reserved.The copolymer of norbornene with 1-octene was prepared by the catalysis of the ternary catalytic system consisted of bis(phenoxy-imine) titanium complex(Ti), triisobutyl aluminum(Al) and organoboron compound(B). The obtained copolymer showed a modest molecular weight(Mw: ca. 3.0×104-6.5×104) and broad molecular weight distribution(MWD: ca. 2.0). The influence of copolymerization conditions was explored. The optimal copolymerization conditions are as follows: n(Al)/n(Ti)=5: 1, n(B)/n(Ti)=1: 1, n(Monomer)/n(Ti)=400: 1, n(NBE)/n(OC)=5: 5, polymerized at 40℃ for 6 h and the copolymer yield reached up to 43.7%. The reactivity ratios of norbornene and 1-octene were 3.01 and 0.08, respectively, tending to form a random copolymer. The copolymer exhibited good thermal stability(Td>300 ℃) and moderate glass transition temperature(Tg=87-174℃) controlled by the content of norbornene in the backbone.
