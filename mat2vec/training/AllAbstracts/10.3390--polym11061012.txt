Â© 2019 by the authors.The stopped-flow (SF) technique has been extensively applied to study Ziegler-Natta (ZN) olefin polymerization kinetics within an extremely short period (typically < 0.2 s) for understanding the nature of the active sites as well as the polymerization mechanisms through microstructure analyses of obtained polymers. In spite of its great applicability, a small amount of polymer that is yielded in a short-time polymerization has been a major bottleneck for polymer characterizations. In order to overcome this limitation, a large-scale SF (LSF) system has been developed, which offers stable and scalable polymerization over an expanded time range from a few tens milliseconds to several seconds. The scalability of the LSF technique has been further improved by introducing a new quenching protocol. With these advantages, the LSF technique has been effectively applied to address several unknown issues in ZN catalysis, such as the role of physical and chemical transformations of a catalyst on the initial polymerization kinetics, and regiochemistry of ZN propylene polymerization. Here, we review the development of the LSF technique and recent efforts for understanding heterogeneous ZN olefin polymerization catalysis with this new system.
