Living cationic ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone (CL), δ-valerolactone (VL) and 1,3-dioxepane-2-one (6) was achieved at room temperature by using zirconocene borate complex catalysts. Respective block copolymerization of CL with VL or with cyclic carbonate 6 was also successfully performed. The mechanism of the present cationic living polymerization is discussed.
