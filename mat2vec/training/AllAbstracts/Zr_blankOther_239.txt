Polymeriztion of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) using a dual functional catalytic system containing different kinds of Metallocene /AlEt 3/B(C 6F 5) 3 as copolymerization catalysts and Ti(On-Bu) 4/AlEt 3 as the ethylene dimerization catalyst was studied. Using the single cocatalyst AlEt 3 in the catalytic system, it is easy to overcome the shortcoming of interference between two catalytic metals in a single reactor. Among the four zirconocene systems used, the most active dual functional catalytic system is [Ti(On-Bu) 4/AlEt 3/Et(Ind) 2ZrCl 2/B(C 6F 5) 3], its activity reaches 7.5 × 10 6 gPE/molZr·h. The density of obtained LLDPE is 0.89 g/cm 3 and 1-butene insertion rate 11.7 mol%.
