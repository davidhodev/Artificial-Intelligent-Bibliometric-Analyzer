The phenyl sulfide bridged Zirconocene complex [(C5H 5)Cl2ZrC5H4CH2(C 6H4-p)]2S has been synthesized by treating the dilithium salts of the phenyl sulfide bridged cyclopentadienyl ligand with two equivalents of C5H5ZrCl3(DME) and characterized by 1HMNR and elemental analysis. Homogenous ethylene polymerization by this complex has been conducted systematically in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO). The influence of the molar ratio [MAO]/[Cat], the catalyst concentration, time and temperature have been studied in detail. The highest catalytic activity of 1 is up to 13.78×105 g PE/mol·Cat·h. Higher temperature is favorable for increasing the catalytic activity for 1. High temperature gel permeation chromatography (HT-GPC) proves the production of polyethylene with a broad molecular weight distribution (MWD), which is reached 6.02.
