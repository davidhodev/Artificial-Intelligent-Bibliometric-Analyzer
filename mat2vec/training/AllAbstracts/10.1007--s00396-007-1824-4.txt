Photocatalytic activity of CdS and Cd× Zn1-×S nanoparticles in the polymerization of acrylamide and acrylic acid in aqueous solutions has been found. It has been shown that the most probable way of the photogeneration of primary radicals is the reduction of an adsorbed monomer by the conduction band electrons of the semiconductor nanoparticles, a monomer oxidation by the valence band holes and atomic hydrogen addition to a monomer being complementary photoinitiation routes. A correlation between the composition of Cd×Zn1-×S nanoparticles and their photocatalytic activity in the acrylamide polymerization has been established. It has been shown that an increase in the quantum yield of the photopolymerization in a sequence CdS < Cd×Zn1-×S < CdS× Zn1-×S < Cd0.3Zn0.7S originates from a concurrent increase of the conduction band potential of the semiconductor nanoparticles. A kinetic equation of the photocatalytic acrylamide polymerization has been derived. Quantum yields of the photoinitiation have been found to be as small as 10-4 to 10-3. © Springer-Verlag 2007.
