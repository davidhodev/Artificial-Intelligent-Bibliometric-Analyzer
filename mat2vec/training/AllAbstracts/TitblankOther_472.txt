Polybutadienes were synthesized with η 5 -pentamethycyclopentadienyltri group titanium [Cp 4 TiL 3 , L = chloride, benzyloxy, p-methoxyphenoxy] in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO). The influences of polymerization temperature [ T p], catalyst concentration [Ti] and Al MAO/Ti molar ratio on butadiene polymerization have been studied. The external addition of triisobutylaluminum (TIBA) into the catalyst system gave a great promotion on the catalytic activity and the molecular weight of polybutadienes. The results showed that the best polymerization conditions with CpTi(OBz) 3/MAO as the catalytical system were [Ti] = 1 × 10 -33 mol/L, T p = 60°C, Al MAO/Ti = 400 (mol/mol) and AL TIBA/Ti = 100. The oxidation states of active titanium centers in CpTi(OBz) 3/MAO catalytic system have been determined by the redox fitration method. It seems that the active center of Ti(III) is favourable for butadiene polymerization with higher catalytic activity.
