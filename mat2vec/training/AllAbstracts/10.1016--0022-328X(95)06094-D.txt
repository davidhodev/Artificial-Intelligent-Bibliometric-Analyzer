One unbridged and three bridged zirconocene complexes, each of them bearing a cyclopentadienyl, fluorenyl, Î±-olefin and a PMe 3 ligand have been prepared and characterized by 1 H, 13 C and 31 P NMR spectroscopy. These model compounds illustrate the mechanism of olefin coordination and insertion at the active sites of syndiospecific homogeneous catalysts for the polymerization of propylene and 1-butene.
