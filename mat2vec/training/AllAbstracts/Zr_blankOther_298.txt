A versatile zirconocene-coupling route to a family of conjugated polymers containing thiophene-1-oxide and selenophene units is presented. These polymers have lower band gaps than those associated with related thiophene structures. Conjugated polymers have a unique chemical, electronic and optical properties. Such properties are determined by the polymer structure and by the composition of the polymer backbone. The properties of interest are varied by changing the polymer structure via appropriate synthetic methods. Many of the synthetic methods that are employed are based on transition metal-mediated coupling reactions, primarily with palladium and nickel reagents.
