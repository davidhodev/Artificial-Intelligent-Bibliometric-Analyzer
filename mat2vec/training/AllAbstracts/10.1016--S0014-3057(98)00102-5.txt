The MgCl2-supported CpTiCl3 catalysts with different Ti content were prepared and used for syndiospecific polymerization of styrene. These catalysts were investigated by means of electron spinning resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. It is found that there exist two kinds of active species in this catalytic system. One is a specific active site and cannot be removed into the solution by MAO. The other one is readily removed into the solution during the interaction with MAO, and the same active site as that in the CpTiCl3-MAO homogeneous system is formed. The MgCl2 supported CpTiCl3 catalyst was also compared with the SiO2/CpTiCl3-MAO system. The data show that the CpTiCl3 supported on the MgCl2 surface is more difficult to be removed by MAO than the active site immobilized on the SiO2 surface, leading to the lower activity of MgCl2/CpTiCl3-MAO system and lower syndiotacticity of obtained polystyrene.
