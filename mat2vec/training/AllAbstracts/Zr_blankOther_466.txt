This study develops scoping estimates of the required capital investment and manufacturing costs to make a zirconocene catalyst/cocatalyst system [(F6-acen)Zr(CH2C-Me3)(NMe2Ph)][B(C6F5) 4] immobilized on a specialized silica support. The costs for this fluorine-based system are compared with corresponding estimates for two other metallocene catalysts using methylaluminoxane (MAO)-based cocatalysts. Including the weight of the support and cocatalyst, each of the production facilities for making the three zirconocene catalyst systems is sized in the range of 364 to 484 tonnes per year. The cost to make the F-based catalyst system is estimated to be $10780/kg, assuming a 20% return on capital invested. By comparison, the costs for the two MAO-based catalyst systems fall in the range of $10950/kg to $12160/kg, assuming the same return. Within the +/- 50% accuracy of these estimates, these differences are not significant. Given a catalyst productivity of 250 kg of resin per gram of zirconocene, the cost contribution in the finished ethylene-propylene copolymer resin is 4.4 cents/kg, excluding costs for selling, administration, and research.
