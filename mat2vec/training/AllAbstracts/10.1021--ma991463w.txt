The synthesis and polymerization behavior of a new C1-symmetric bridged indenyl-fluorenyl zirconocene dimethylsilylene [9-fluorenyl][(2,4,7-trimethyl)indenyl]zirconium dichloride (5) is reported. The complex when activated by MAO was found to polymerize ethylene and propylene, although the activity and stereoselectivity of 5 for propylene were found to be lower than for the previously prepared ethylene-bridged analogue 4 and several other ethylene-bridged precursors. It has been found that, depending on both the substitution patterns on the indenyl ligand and the nature of the bridge in this series of asymmetric zirconocenes, polypropylenes with varying microstructures from aspecific to highly isospecific are obtained. The propylene polymerization behavior of the new complexes has been studied in detail, and the mechanistic aspects of polymerization are discussed.
