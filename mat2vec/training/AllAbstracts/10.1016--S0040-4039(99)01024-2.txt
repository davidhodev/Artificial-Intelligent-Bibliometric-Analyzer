A new insight in the crucial role of methylalumoxane (MAO) as polymerization cocatalyst has been demonstrated by using typical carbonyl reduction and electrophilic alkylation by comparison with various MAO analogues, (Me2Al)2O, MeAl(OPr(i))2, and Me2AlOPr(i). Furthermore, the high ligand-abstraction ability of MAO for a zirconocene complex is evaluated by the allylzirconation of internal alkyne, where MAO was found to be more satisfactory as cocatalyst than (Me2Al)2O and Me3Al in terms of reactivity.
