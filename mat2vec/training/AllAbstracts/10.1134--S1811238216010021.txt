Â© 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.A method for the synthesis of nanocomposite materials based on ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene and graphite nanoplates via polymerization filling is developed. Polyethylene formed during the synthesis evenly coats individual nanoplates; as a result, there is a uniform distribution of graphite nanoplates in the polymeric matrix. It is shown that the introduction of graphite nanoplates results in significant increases of the elastic modulus and deformation heat resistance and causes a sharp decrease in the gas permeability of the material.
