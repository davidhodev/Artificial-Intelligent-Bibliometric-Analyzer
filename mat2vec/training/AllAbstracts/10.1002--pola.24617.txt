A series of trichlorotitanium complexes containing 2-(1-(arylimino)propyl) quinolin-8-olates was synthesized by stoichiometric reaction of titanium tetrachloride with the corresponding potassium 2-(1-(arylimino)propyl)quinolin- 8-olates and was fully characterized by elemental analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and by single-crystal X-ray diffraction study of representative complexes. All titanium complexes, when activated with methylaluminoxane, exhibited high catalytic activity toward ethylene polymerization [up to 1.15 × 106 g mol-1(Ti) h -1] and ethylene/α-olefin copolymerization [up to 1.54 × 106 g mol-1 (Ti) h-1]. The incorporation of comonomer was confirmed to amount up to 2.82 mol % of 1-hexene or 1.94 mol % of 1-octene, respectively. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
