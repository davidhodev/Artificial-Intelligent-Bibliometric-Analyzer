Ansa-zirconocene complexes, exemplified by Et[Ind]2ZrCl2, activated by MAO (zirconocene/MAO) exhibit high activity (A) for polymerization of propylene. Polyolefins exhibiting a range of physical and mechanical properties can be synthesized. The molecular structures have been determined by a combination of morphology, molecular and mechanical measurements. The NMR spectra is consistent with a stereochemical control model of consecutive E/E' (E,E'= enantiomorphic sites).
