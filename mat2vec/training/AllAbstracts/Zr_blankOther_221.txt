A series of new oxygen-substituted, asymmetric zirconocene dichlorides (rac-{1-[5,6-(ethylenedioxy)-2-methyl-1-η5-indenyl]-2- (9-η5-fluorenyl)ethane}zirconium dichloride (3a), rac{1-[5,6-(ethylenedioxy)-2-methyl-1-η5-indenyl]-2- (9-η5-fluorenyl)ethane}dimethylzirconium (3b) and rac-{[5,6-ethylenedioxy)-2-methyl-1-η5-indenyl] (9-η5-fluorenyl) dimethylsilane} zirconium dichloride (3c)} have been prepared and their polymerization behavior was investigated in dependence of monomer concentration, temperature and catalyst activation. The presence of oxygen substituents on the indenyl ring results in a strong increase of polymerization activities and also of polymer molecular weights with decreasing Al/Zr ratio. Significantly higher molecular masses and activities were found for the dimethyl complex 3b after activation with [(C6H5)3C+] [(C6F5)4B-] deriving from the absence of chain transfer to aluminum and higher concentration of active cata lyst species. The mechanism of stereoerror formation of the oxygen-containing C1-symmetric catalyst was investigated by deuterium labeling studies on propene monomers. The results are discussed on the basis of a reversible chain transfer to aluminum.
