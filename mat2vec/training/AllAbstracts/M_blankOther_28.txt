The steric and electronic ligand effects in the Ti-catalyzed living radical polymerization (LRP) of styrene initiated by epoxide radical ring opening (RRO) was investigated in a series of Ti(III) complexes (L nTiX m) derived in situ from Zn reduction of commercially available Ti(IV) precursors. Based on the ability to perform initiation by epoxide RRO and mediate LRP via reversible C-Ti bond formation, these catalysts ranked: L = metallocene (η 5-RCp: R = H ∼ Et ∼ 1Pr ∼ tBu > Ind Cp*) ≫O-ligands (alkoxides) ≫ bisketonates) ≫ N ligands (Tp > Pc), while X = Cl > Br ≫F ∼ Me and L nTiCl m > L n-1.TiCl m+1. The inexpensive Cp 2TiCl 2 was one of the most active species. © 2006 American Chemical Society.
