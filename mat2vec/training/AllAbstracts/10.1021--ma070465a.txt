Homopolymerization and block copolymerization of n-butyl acrylate (nBA) was catalyzed by Titanium complex/B(C6F5)3 system to produce syndiotactic and high molecular weight polymers with relatively narrow molecular weight distributions. Full conversion of monomers obtained in the temperature range of -20 to 20°C shows that polymer yield decreases significantly at 40°C and the resulting P(nBA) exhibits unimodal molecular distribution with narrow PDI values. The NMR spectra of P(nBA) shows a syndiotactic-enriched microstructure at lower stereoselectivity than that achieved for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) under same conditions. Diblock copolymerization of MMA and nBA shows a high degree of control at 20 and 80°C and forms a narrow polydispersity and an average molecular weight and monomer composition.
