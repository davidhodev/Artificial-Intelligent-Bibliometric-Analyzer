Polymerizations of ethylene and propylene were conducted with catalysts based on titanium compounds (TiCl 4 or CpTiCl 3 ) modified by trimethylsilanol (TMS). The convenient conditions of catalyst preparation and polymerization were investigated such as ageing time, Si/Ti mole ratio, catalyst concentration, type of alkylaluminum compound used as cocatalyst and Al/Ti mole ratio. The influence of these parameters on the homopolymerization of ethylene and propylene is then described in detail. The polymerization activities were found to be strongly dependent upon catalyst preparation and polymerization conditions. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses were conducted with different Al/Ti mole ratios for elucidating the influence of the Ti oxidation state on the catalyst properties. This work reports a plausible mechanism for the polymerization on the basis of these results. Â© 1994.
