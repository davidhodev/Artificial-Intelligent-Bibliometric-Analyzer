The formation of C6 side-products resulted from the incorporation of 1-butene rather than direct trimerization, something that is independent of butene concentration. Stoichiometric reactions between the tungsten mono(imido) complexes and alkylaluminum reagents are described, which are consistent with the reduction of the tungsten centre playing an important part in the initiation process. Testing discrete WV and WIV mono(imido) complexes for olefin dimerization revealed the former to be significantly more active, which offers insight into the mode of action of the commercially relevant tungsten mono(imido)-selective dimerization initiators described herein.
