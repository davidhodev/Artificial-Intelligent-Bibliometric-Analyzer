Ethylene polymerization studies have been carried out with novel precatalysts of the type: [(η5-C13 H8)-X(t-BuOC6H12)Me-(η5- C5H4)]ZrCl2 [X=C [1a], Si [2a]], [(η5-C13H8)-XMe2- (η5-(t-BuOC6H12C5 H3))] ZrCl2 [X=C [3a], Si [4a]] in the presence of excess methylalumoxane (MAO) to compare their catalytic activity and to delineate the effect of the 6-t-butoxyhexyl functionality on ethylene polymerization. The precatalysts [1a] and [2a] with the bridge functionality showed higher activity in ethylene polymerization than the corresponding complexes [3a] and [4a] which have it on the Cp ring moiety. On the other hand the silyl bridged complexes [2a] and [4a] produced a higher molecular weight polyethylene than the carbon-bridged one, regardless of the location of functional group. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.
