The alternating copolymerization of styrene (St) and ethylene (Et) with high stereo-regularity were monitored by using rac[isopropylidenebis(benzindenyl)] zirconocene catalysts under reduced temperature conditions. The 13C-NMR spectra of the polymers were measured using a spectrometer. The DSC measurement was carried out under flowing N2 at a temperature rate of 20Â°C/min. In general, significant results were obtained.
