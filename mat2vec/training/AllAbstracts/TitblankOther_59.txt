The recent progress in the transition metal complexes as catalysts for ethylene oligomerization and polymerization is summarized. The influence of reaction conditions, such as time, temperature, the pressure of ethylene, the amount and type of co-catalyst and the different substitutes of ligand of the complex on the oligomer and polymer product of the early and late transition metal (chromium, zirconium, titanium, vanadium, iron, cobalt, nickel and copper) complex catalysts is discussed. The mechanism of oligomerization and polymerization of the early and late transition metal complex catalysts are briefly described employing titanium and nickel complex catalysts as examples.
