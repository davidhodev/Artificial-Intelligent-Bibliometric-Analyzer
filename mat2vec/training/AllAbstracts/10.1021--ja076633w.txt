Exclusive repeated insertion of 1,7-octadiene (OD) has been achieved in OD polymerization using (C 5 Me 5 )TiCl 2 (O-2,6- i Pr 2 C 6 H 3 )-MAO catalyst to afford polymers containing terminal olefinic double bonds in the side chain. Copolymerization of OD with 1-octene using the same catalyst afforded high molecular weight copolymers containing terminal olefins, and quantitative introduction of hydroxyl group could be achieved upon treatment of the copolymer with 9-BBN/NaOH-H 2 O 2 (aq); ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone could be initiated in a controlled manner from the hydroxyl group after treatment with AlEt 3 .
