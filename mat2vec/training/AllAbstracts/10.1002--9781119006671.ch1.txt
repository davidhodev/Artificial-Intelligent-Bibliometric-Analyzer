Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All Rights Reserved. This chapter reviews visible light-induced radical polymerization reactions in the 380-800 nm range. It describes the role of the absorbing species (dye) and the complete multicomponent photoinitiating systems (PISs) (dye and additives). The chapter focuses on the original works of the dye-based PISs that have been proposed over the years. It also focuses on the latest developments and the actual trends of research, in particular the novel perspectives of applications under soft irradiation conditions. Near-field optical techniques (evanescent waves and field enhancement) facilitate the manufacture of nano-objects. The light is confined in a nanometric volume which enables high luminous power densities: even low reactivity PISs can work in these conditions. The dye-based radical PISs described throughout the chapter encounters a large variety of reactions in the radiation curing field, the imaging and laser imaging field or the medical and dentistry fields.
