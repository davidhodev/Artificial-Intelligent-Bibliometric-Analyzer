Investigation of the characteristics and performance in propylene polymerization of silica-immobilized methylaluminoxane (MAO), in combination with a moderately and a highly isospecific zirconocene catalyst, has revealed that a simple impregnation of silica with MAO at ambient temperature is insufficient to obtain uniform distribution of MAO throughout the support particle. Homogeneous Al distribution throughout the support, giving increased catalyst activity, was achieved by a more rigorous impregnation of silica with MAO at elevated temperatures. The highest catalyst activities were obtained by precontacting the MAO with the zirconocene to generate the activated species before immobilization on silica. Polymer particle morphology was strongly dependent on the characteristics of the silica used for catalyst immobilization. Â© 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
