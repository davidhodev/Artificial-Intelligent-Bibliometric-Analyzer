The effect of tert-butyl chloride (tBuCl) as a third catalyst component on the isoprene polymerization with neodymium isopropoxide (Nd(OiPr)3)/diisobutylaluminum hydride (Al(iBu)2H) and Nd(OiPr)3/methylaluminoxane-(MAO) catalysts was examined in heptane at a fixed [Al]/ [Nd] ratio of 30 and reaction temperatures of 30 and 60°C. The Nd(OiPr)3/Al(iBu)2H catalyst was inactive without tBuCl, i.e., at [Cl]/[Nd] = 0, while it showed the highest activity under the conditions of [Cl]/[Nd] = 3.0 and an addition order of {AI(iBu)2H + tBuCl} + Nd(OiPr)3 to yield polyisoprene with relatively low molecular weight (M̄n ca, 5 × 104), broad MWD (M̄w/M̄n ca. 5.4), and high cis-1,4 content (ca. 96%) at 30°C. On the other hand, the Nd(OiPr)3/ MAO catalyst was effective at [Cl]/[Nd] = 0, and the most active at [Cl]/[Nd] = 1.0-1.5 with an addition order of {Nd(OiPr)3 + MAO} + tBuCl to afford polymer with high molecular weight (M̄n ca. 8 × 105), fairly narrow MWD (M̄w/ M̄n ca. 1.6) and high cis- 1,4 content (ca. 94%) at 30°C. Thus, the novel Nd(OiPr)3/MAO/tBuCl system features high activity, high molecular weight, narrow MWD, and high cis-1,4 stereospecificity, as compared with the conventional Nd(OiPr)3/Al(iBu)2H/tBuCl system.
