Individual synthetic routes to heterobimetallic Ti(IV)-Ag(I) acetylides of type {[Ti](μ-σ,π-CCR1)2}AgCCR2 ([Ti] = (η5-C5H4SiMe3) 2Ti: R1 = SiMe3: 6, R2 = SiMe 3; 7, R2 = Ph. R1 = tBu: 8, R 2 = SiMe3; 9, R2 = Ph. [Ti] = (η5-C5H5)2Ti): 10, R1 = tBu, R2 = SiMe3) including (i) the reaction of {[Ti](μ-σ, π-CCR1)2}AgNO3 ([Ti] = (η5-C5H4SiMe3)2Ti): 1, R1 = SiMe3; 2, R1 = tBu. [Ti] = (η5-C5H5)2Ti: 3, R1 = tBu) with LiCCR2 (4, R2 = SiMe3; 5, R2 = Ph) and (ii) treatment of [Ti](CCSiMe3)2 ([Ti] = (η5-C5H4SiMe3) 2Ti) (11) with [AgCCR2] (12, R2 = SiMe 3; 13, R2 = Ph) are described. The reactions of 1-3 with 4 or 5 appeared to be sensitive towards stoichiometry because an excess of 4 or 5 resulted in the formation of [(Ag(CCR2)2)Li(OEt 2)]n (14) and [Ti](CCR1)2. Coordination polymer 14 is also accessible, when, for example, [AgCCSiMe 3] (12) is treated with 1 eq. of LiCCSiMe3 (4) in diethyl ether. The titanium(IV)-silver(I) acetylides 6-10 are stable in the dark and at low temperature, while on exposure to light and on heating they decompose to give R2CC-CCR2 together with [Ti](CCR1) 2 and elemental silver. Complexes 6-10 contain a mono-nuclear AgCCR2 entity stabilized by the chelate-bonded organometallic π-tweezer molecule [Ti](CCSiMe3)2, which was evinced by structure determination of 7 in the solid state. In 14 linear [Me 3SiCC-Ag-CCSiMe3]- units are connected by [Li(OEt2)]+ building blocks forming a coordination polymer. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
