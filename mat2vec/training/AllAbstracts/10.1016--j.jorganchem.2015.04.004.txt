Â© 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.A series of oxovanadium (IV, V) complexes stabilized by [OON]2- type ligand - 7- (hexafluoro-2-hydroxypropane-2-yl)-8-hydroxyquinoline (2), have been synthesized in high yields; the structures were confirmed by NMR, EPR, and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, X-ray diffraction and elemental analysis. Depending on reaction conditions di-, tetra- or hexanuclear complexes 3-5 were obtained. It was demonstrated that in the presence of Et2AlCl/CCl3CO2Et, vanadium (V) complexes catalyzed polymerization of ethylene with activities up to 1000 kg of PE (mol of V)-1 h-1 atm-1.
