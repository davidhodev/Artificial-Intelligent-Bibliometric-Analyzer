Calculating the kinetic energy of each phase by sequence, the results show that three advantage reactions in each phase are norbornene initiation, ethylene rein-sertion, ethylene hydride transfer. They would form a circulation system, so that the copolymerization only produces the short chain product, resulting in non-product copolymerization.
