The chiral Zn(II)-Na(I) coordination polymer with formula [NaZn(acac)2(AcO)(EtOH)] (1) has been synthesized, and characterized by 1H NMR and FT-IR spectra, elemental, X-ray, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). X-ray crystallographic study revealed that 1 crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric space groups P212121 and exhibits a one-dimensional polymer chain. Linear optical properties were investigated by UV/Vis spectrophotometer techniques. Kurtz-Perry powder second-harmonic-generation (SHG) test confirms the non-linear optical (NLO) property of the grown crystal. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
