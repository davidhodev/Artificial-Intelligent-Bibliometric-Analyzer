(Butadiene)zirconocene adds to B(C6F5)3 to form the metallacyclic metal- locene-boron betaine system 1, which contains a C-F → Zr interaction. Addition of tert-butylisocyanide or tert-butylcyanide leads to cleavage of the zirconium - fluorine linkage and formation of the adducts 4 and 7, respectively. With additional tert-butylisocyanide, 4 reacts further to yield the corresponding η2-imino- acyl betaines 5 and 6 (2 stereoisomers), whereas 7 inserts additional tert-butylcyanide into the Zr-C bond to give a chiral metallacyclic N-zirconaketimine complex that is probably stabilized by an internal borate → Zr interaction. Ethene and propene insertion reactions into the Zr-C bond of 1 follow a similar course: the mono-insertion products 9 and 10, respectively, generated in situ and characterized by NMR spectroscopy at - 35 °C in [D8]toluene solution, are chiral and are also stabilized by internal borate → Zr co-ordination. Complexes 9 and 10 are likely to be intermediates in the formation of active homogeneous Ziegler polymerization catalysts. © VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, 1996.
