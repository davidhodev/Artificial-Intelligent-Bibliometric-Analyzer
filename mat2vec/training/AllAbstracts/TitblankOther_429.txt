About 50 % of all plastics are produced by catalytic processes. Organometallic compounds such a lithiumbutyl, titanium iodides are used for the polymerisation of 1,3-butadiene and styrene. Great industrial importance has the production of polyethylene and polypropylene by Phillipps- and Ziegler-Natta catalysis. Beside these classical catalysts, catalysts such as metallocenes, half-sandwich, nickel, palladium, and iron complexes have been synthesized - that give tailored polymers of totally different structures and allow to control the polymer tacticity, molar mass and molar mass distribution more efficient. New kinds of copolymers and elastomers can be synthesized. It has become possible to polymerize cyclic olefins with different zirconocenes or nickel and palladium catalysts without any ring opening reaction.
