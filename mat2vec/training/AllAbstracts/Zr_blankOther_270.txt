The polymethylene-bridged dinuclear half-titanocenes [(CH2)n(C5H4)2][TiCl 3]2 (n=5(10), 7(11), 9(12)) have been synthesized by treating the distannylated derivatives of the ligands with two equivalents of TiCl4 in toluene. All complexes are characterized by IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectrometry. In order to examine the catalytic properties of the dinuclear complexes styrene polymerization has been conducted in the presence of MMAO. From the polymerization experiments it was found that (i) all the prepared complexes 10-12 produced syndiotactic polystyrenes, (ii) the complex 12 holding the longest bridging ligand exhibited the highest activity but produced a polymer having the smallest molecular weight among the polymethylene-bridged dinuclear half-titanocenes. This behavior was attributed to the influence of electron-donating caused by the polymethylene bridge between two active centers as well as the effect of steric congestion around metal center caused by the proximal distance between two active sites.
