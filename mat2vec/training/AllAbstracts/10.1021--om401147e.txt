The alkyne complexes [(PNP)Ti(η2-HC≡CH)(CH 2tBu)] (2) and [(PNP)Ti(η2-HC≡CMe) (CH2tBu)] (3) have been prepared by treatment of [(PNP)Ti=CHtBu(OTf)] (1) with the Grignard reagents H 2C=CHMgCl and MeHC=CHMgBr, respectively. Complex 3 can be also prepared using the Grignard H2C=C(Me)MgBr and 1. The 2-butyne complex [(PNP)Ti(η2-MeC≡CMe)(CH2tBu)] (4) can be similarly prepared from 1 and MeHC=C(Me)MgBr. Complexes 2 and 3 have been characterized with a battery of multidimensional and multinuclear ( 1H, 13C, and 31P) NMR spectroscopic experiments, including selectively 31P decoupled 1H{ 31P}, 1H-31P HMBC, 1H-31P HOESY, and 31P EXSY. Variable-temperature 1H and 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy reveals that the acetylene ligand in 2 exhibits a rotational barrier of 11 kcal mol-1, and such a process has been corroborated by theoretical studies. Formation of the titanium alkyne ligand in complexes 2 and 3 proceeds via the vinyl intermediate [(PNP)Ti=CHtBu(CH=CHR)] followed by a concerted, metal-mediated β-hydrogen abstraction step that has been computed to have a barrier of 20-22 kcal mol-1. The geometry and rotational mechanism of the alkyne ligand in 2 are presented and compared with those of the ethylene derivative [(PNP)Ti(η2-H2C=CH2)(CH2 tBu)] (5), which does not display rotation of the bound ethylene under the same conditions. © 2014 American Chemical Society.
