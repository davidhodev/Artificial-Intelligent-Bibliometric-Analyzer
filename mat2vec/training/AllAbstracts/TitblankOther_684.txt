Catalytic systems based on zirconocenes can produce polymers with an overall amount of regioirregular placements as high as 2-3%. The higher regiospecifities of titanocene based, with respect to zirconocene based, catalytic systems has been accounted for by the large contributions of the non-bonded interactions, in favor of the monomer coordination suitable for the primary insertion when shorter Mt-C distances are involved.
