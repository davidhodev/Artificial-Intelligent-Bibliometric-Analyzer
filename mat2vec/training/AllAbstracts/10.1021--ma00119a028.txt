The olefin polymerization catalyst based on CpaTi13CH3Cl/MAO has been studied. Reaction equilibria and polymerization of 13C-enriched ethylene were followed by 13C NMR spectroscopy, and the catalytic activity was determined. Evidence has been obtained that MAO alkylates the transition metal and produces stable cationlike species Cp2TiMe+Cl·[Al(Me)O]n- (3). Complex 3 has been shown to be active for olefin polymerization. Two types of ion pairs have been detected for the low Al/Mt ratios. We assume that they are more or less tight ion pairs. It has also been possible to relate polymerization activity to the composition of the catalyst mixture. Temperature (-78 ÷ -20 °C), Al/Mt mole ratios (10 ÷ 40), and catalyst dilution have been shown to influence the concentration of active species such as 3 and thus to affect polymerization activity. Dilution decreases the formation of nonactive species such as Cp2Ti(Me)-OAl(Me)-MAO (4). © 1995, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
