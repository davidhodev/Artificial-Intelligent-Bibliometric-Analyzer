The influence of different activation parameters, such as aging time and nature of coactivator (MAO vs boraluminoxane), has been investigated. It was found that the activation efficiency of {Cp/Flu}-Type precatalysts by MAO is similar (1-12% at 30 °C) to that of the {SBI}-Type precatalysts (4-18%). Moreover, the propagation rates for the {Cp/Flu}-based systems appeared to be superior to those obtained with the {SBI}-Type congeners. Deactivation processes, arising from monomer 2,1-misinsertions and resulting in dormant M-sec-Alkyl species, were demonstrated to occur for both types of catalytic systems. While the {SBI}-Type systems are capable to undergo further regular 1,2-insertions of 1-hexene into the M-sec-Alkyl (or undergo regeneration of an active species through β-H elimination), the {Cp/Flu}-Type congeners are apparently reluctant to further enchainement; this is proposed to account for the observed overall lower productivity of the latter {Cp/Flu}-Type systems. Dormant M-sec-Alkyl species with the {Cp/Flu} ancillaries can be efficiently reactivated by introduction of small molecules (H2 or ethylene).
