Synthesis of rac-[((1,2,3,4-tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene-1,4-diyl)germylene)bis(1-η5-indenyl)]dichlorozirconium (1) was achieved with substantial suppression of the undesired meso diastereomer as predicted by MM2 force field calculations. The corresponding zirconocenium ion of 1 polymerizes propylene with high catalytic activity and stereospecificity to very high molecular weight. The characteristics of this catalysis are essentially independent of polymerization temperature over a broad temperature range. © 1994, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
