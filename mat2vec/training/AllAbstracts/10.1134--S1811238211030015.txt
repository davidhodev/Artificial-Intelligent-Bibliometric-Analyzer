The major achievements in the field of controlled atom-transfer radical polymerization, the most promising method of living radical polymerization, are analyzed. The relationship between the structure of a regulating agent and its activity under the conditions of controlled radical polymerization, including the efficiency of metal-complex catalysts for the targeted synthesis of macromolecules with predetermined molecular-mass characteristics, chain structure, and properties, is examined. Main trends in the development of this area of polymer chemistry are highlighted. Â© Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2011.
