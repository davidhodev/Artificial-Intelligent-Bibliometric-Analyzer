Bimetallic zirconocene complexes were synthesized by olefin metathesis reaction of alkene-substituted zirconocenes. Hydrogenation of a double bond of the bridging chain gives a saturated and flexible bridging chain. The bimetallic catalyst with a short bridging chain shows a higher catalytic activity for ethylene and propylene polymerization than that with a long bridging chain. The bimetallic catalyst with saturated bridging chain has an increased activity, compared to the catalyst with unsaturated bridging chain. Steric hindrance at R2 position on the cyclopentadienyl ligand decreases a catalytic activity. The steric hindrance at R1 position weekly affects the catalytic activity.
