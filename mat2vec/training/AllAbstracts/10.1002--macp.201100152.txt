Branched α-olefin 4-methyl-1-pentene (4MP) is polymerized with a cationic α-diimine palladium catalyst. The influences of polymerization parameters including reaction temperature and monomer concentration on polymer architecture are evaluated in detail. Increasing temperature and lowering monomer concentration can lead to the formation of more complex branched polyolefin because of chain walking. At 0°C, complex branched polyolefins are generated from quasi-living polymerization of 4MP with α-diimine palladium catalyst. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
