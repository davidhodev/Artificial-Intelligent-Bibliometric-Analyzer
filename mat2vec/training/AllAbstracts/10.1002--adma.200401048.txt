A non-volatile polymer-memory device, based on a copolymer containing the carbozole and Eu-complex groups in a simple MIM architecture, was demonstrated. The proposed device exhibited two distinctive bistable conductivity states that could be achieved by applying voltage pulses of different polarities. The device also exhibited a high ON/OFF current ratio, fast response time, and acceptable retention ability under ambient conditions. It was found that the devices remained in the ON state for several months without any degradation.
