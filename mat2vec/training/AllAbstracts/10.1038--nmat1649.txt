A living polymerization that involved photoexcited metal-containing ferrocenophane monomers was studied. The monomers used in the study are silicon-bridged ferrocenophanes, which are ferrocene derivatives where a single silicon atom bridges the two cyclopentadienyl ligands. Under photo-irradiation polymerization was found to be proceeding to a near-quantitative conversion, and the resulting polymer has a molecular weight determined by the polydispersity index. The polymerization is highly reproducible provided that the reaction temperature is controlled. The experiments conducted using optical filters verified that photo-irradiation of the reaction mixture at wavelengths corresponding to the lowest energy absorption is necessary for polymerization in the presence of Na(C2H5) initiator.
