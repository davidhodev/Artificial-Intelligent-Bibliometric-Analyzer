After MgCl 2 was dissolved in ethanol with the ratio of 1: 20 in mole at 120&degC, the solution was cooled to 70°C and transferred to the cooling liquid consisting of n-hexane (30 mL) and wax (0. 3 g) at O°. Precipitate was produced. Filtrated and washed with n-hexane,the residue was dried by vacuum at 50° ,and MgCl 2-CH 3CH 2OH particles were obtained. The size of the particles determined by TEM was at the range from 30 nm to 100 nm. The nano-sized particles of MgCl 2-CH 3CH 2OH could become nano wires by self-assembly technology at room temperature. WAXD results showed that the crystallinity of the obtained nano-sized MgCl 2CH 3CH 2OH particles became poor, just a broad and weak signal at 20θ = 32° ∼ 35° was observed, while MgCl 2 showed four sharp signals at 20θ = 15°, 30°, 35° and 50°. The obtained particles were useful as support for preparing nano-sized Ziegler-Natta catalysts. It was confirmed that the prepared catalysts may efficiently polymerize ethylene to form polymer particles with 200 ∼ 300 nm or 2 ∼ 4 μ,m in diameter, respectively.
