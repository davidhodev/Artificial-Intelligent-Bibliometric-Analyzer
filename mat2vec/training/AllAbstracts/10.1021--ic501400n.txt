© 2014 American Chemical Society.Reaction of the quintuply bonded chromium(I) dimer [ApCrCrAp] (Ap = sterically demanding 2-aminopyridinate) with pyrazine yields a chromium(II) complex with a η4:η4 face-on coordinated pyrazine dianion. Reaction with 4,4′-bipyridine, on the other hand, completely cleaves the metal-metal bond, leading to a chromium(II)-based molecular square. XRD and magnetic measurements show ligand radical anions and a ferrimagnetic alignment of alternating metal and ligand magnetic moments. Controlled polymerization of the molecular square with pyrazine yields a porous coordination polymer featuring both reduced and nonreduced linkers.
