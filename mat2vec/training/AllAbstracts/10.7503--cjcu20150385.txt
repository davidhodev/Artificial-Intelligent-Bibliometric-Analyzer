All right reserved.A novel N, N-bidentate dendritic bridging pyridine-imine ligand and its nickel complex were prepared and characterized by elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The dendritic nickel complex was used as a precatalyst in the oligomerization of ethylene with the co-catalyst ethyl dichloroaluminum (EtAlCl2), as well as a precursor in the oligomerization of 1-pentene. The effects of the reaction time, reaction pressure and the molar ratio of Al/Ni on the catalytic activities and the distribution of the product in the oligomerization were investigated. The dendritic nickel complex revealed the selectivity of higher olefins (C10-C14) reached up to 93% and the catalytic activity was 0.99×106 g/(mol Ni·h) at the reaction time of 60 min, ethylene pressure of 0.5 MPa and the molar ratio of Al/Ni of 150 in the oligometization of ethylene. At the reaction time of 60 min and the molar ratio of Al/Ni of 300, the catalyst also had excellent catalytic performance in the oligomerization of 1-pentene. The selectivity of C20 reached to 70.5% and the catalytic activity was 2.47×105 g/(mol Ni·h). The dendritic nickel complex exhibited good catalytic activities and selectivities for higher carbon number olefins in ethylene oligomerization and 1-pentene oligomerization.
