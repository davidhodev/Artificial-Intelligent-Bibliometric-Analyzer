It is generally accepted that controlled polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) with transition metal complexes is difficult, due to side reactions is related to a high Lewis acidity of the central metal between VCM and active sites. To suppress such reactions, electron donative ligand is favor to control polymerization of VCM. We reported that Cp*Ti(OPh)3 complex in combination with MAO achieve control of main chain structure of the polymer. Polymerization of VCM with titanocene/MAO catalysts was not investigated in detail. However, the polymerization proceeded easily to give high molecular weight polymers. The molecular weight of PVC obtained from polymerization with 2/MAO catalyst increased with an increase of polymer yield, but don't give a straight line pass through the origin. The side reactions may compete with propagation reaction in the polymerization. We also examined the stereoregularity of polymer.
