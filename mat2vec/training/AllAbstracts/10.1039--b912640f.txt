Chiral metallocene cations, discrete main group anions, dually active ion pairs and nucleophile/electrophile pairs have been utilized to transform the polymerization of polar vinyl monomers from one type to another. These discrete or hybrid catalysts have enabled the development of five types of such polymerizations, including stereospecific and living coordination polymerization, asymmetric coordination polymerization, single-site anionic polymerization, bimolecular polymer-transfer polymerization, and diastereospecific ion-pairing polymerization.
