The polymerization of norbornene in the presence of different bis(salicylaldiminate)copper(II) complexes and methylalumoxane has been investigated. In all cases a high molecular weight vinyl-type polymer was obtained. The presence of electron-withdrawing nitro groups on the chelate ligand markedly increased the activity of the catalyst. The influence on the catalytic performances and polymer characteristics as a function of reaction parameters, such as temperature, duration, and content of free trimethyl aluminum in the commercial MAO, was studied.
