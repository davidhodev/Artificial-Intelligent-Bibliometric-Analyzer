Group 4 bis(phenoxyimine) and related complexes are highly active olefin polymerization catalysts of the post-metallocene family. When activated with methylalumoxane, titanium complexes bearing o-fluoroaryl substituents can conduct living polymerization of ethylene and propylene. In spite of more than 10-year history of such catalysts, the origin of living behavior of such catalysts remains open to questions. This work presents the state of the art of the discussion on the living nature of single-site post-metallocene titanium based catalysts bearing o-fluoroaryl substituents. Recent experimental and theoretical results are discussed. Â© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.
