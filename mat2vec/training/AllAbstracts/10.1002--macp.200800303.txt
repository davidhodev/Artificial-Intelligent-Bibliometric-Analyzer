The cleavage of different photoinitiators (PIs) of polymerization is investigated by the ESR spin trapping using two different spin traps (STs): 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) and phenyl N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN). The hyperfine splitting constants for the different adducts are measured and provide a new set of data. These results show a difference of selectivity between the two (STs) and outline their complementarities. © 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.
