Four new mixed-ring zirconium complexes, [CH2 = CH(CH 2)n-C5H4](RC5H4)ZrCl 2 [n = 1, R = CH3OCH2CH2(3); n =2, R = CH3OCH2CH2 (4); n = 2, R = Me3Si (5); n =2, R = allyl (6)], have been prepared by the reaction of CH2 = CH(CH2)nC5H4ZrCl 3Â· DME[n = 1 (1); n = 2 (2)] with RC5H 4Li. When activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO), the catalytic activities of the above complexes in ethylene polymerization were tested. Complexes 5 and 6 show high activities similar to Cp2ZrCl 2. Introduction of methoxyethyl group into Cp-ligand dramatically decreases the catalytic activities of complexes 3 and 4, which can be overcome by increasing the amount of MAO. For complex 5, the dependence of activity and molecular weight (Mn) on the Al/Zr ratio, the polymerization time (tp), polymerization temperature (TP) and the polymerization solvent volume (V) was investigated.
