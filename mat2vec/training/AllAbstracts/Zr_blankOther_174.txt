The copolymerization of ethylene and styrene was carried out using N catalyst activated with AlEt3 and Et2AlOAlEt2 at the present of DDS. The optimum copolymerization conditions of Al/Ti was investigated. The copolymerization products were fractionated by successive solvents extraction with boiling butanone and THF. The experimental results indicate the copolymerization products include polystyrene, ethylene-styrene copolymer, and polyethylene. The ethylene-styrene copolymers were characterized by 13C-NMR, DSC and GPC. It is found that cocatalyst not only affects copolymerization activity of N-catalyst, but also influences the ratio of different fractions in coplymerization products, especially the styrene incorporation, the melting point and the glass transition temperature of ethylene-styrene copolymer,.
