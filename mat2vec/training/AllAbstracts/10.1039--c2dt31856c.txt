A general and efficient approach toward new zirconium and hafnium complexes based on 2-aryl-8-arylaminoquinoline ligands was developed. These precursors, when activated with MAO/borate cocatalyst and supported on silica, result in active olefin polymerization catalysts. The ethylene copolymers produced under industrially relevant conditions show very high molecular weights and unique microstructures defined by the multisite nature of the catalyst. A site-diversification mechanism is proposed to explain the presence of at least five individual sites, as deduced from 3D-TREF analysis of ethylene-butene copolymers.
