A new monomer, 1,8-diaminocarbazole (DACz), has been synthesized as a missing link between two classes of electropolymerizable compounds - aromatic amines and carbazoles to combine some attractive features of both. Electropolymerization of DACz on Pt substrate carried out by cyclic voltammetry from acetonitrile and aqueous (neutral and acidic) solutions leads to formation of compact and very well adherent conducting films, electroactive in both media. In aqueous solutions poly(1,8-diaminocarbazole) (PDACz) exhibits a linear dependence of redox potential on pH. Morphology of the polymer films was studied by AFM using a tapping mode. Ability of amino groups of PDACz for post-functionalization was studied by covalent bonding of tyrosinase. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
