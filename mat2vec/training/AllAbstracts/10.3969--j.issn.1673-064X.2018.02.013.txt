The progress in the research of late-transition metal catalysts for the polymerization of methyl methacrylate was reviewed, mainly including the metal complex catalysts of nickel system, copper system, iron system and cobalt system. Their catalytic activity of various kinds of catalysts, the relative molecular mass and microstructure of the prepared poly-methyl methacrylates and the distribution of the relative molecular mass are compared. It was proposed that the introduction of electron-withdrawing group to the structure of catalysts is necessary to improving their catalytic activity, and the further research of the structure of catalysts to effectively control the microstructure of Poly (methyl methacrylate) is one of the future research directions for the polymerization of methyl methacrylate.
