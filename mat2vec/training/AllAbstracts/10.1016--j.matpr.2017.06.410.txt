Metallocene catalyst system refers to the combination of bis(cyclopentadienyl)metal complexes of Group 4 (IVB) or cyclopentadienyl-substituted derivatives, and a co-catalyst, typically methylalumoxane (MAO). In propene polymerization, Metallocene catalysts have in general demonstrated high productivity, narrow molecular weight distribution (MWD), greater efficiency in using co-monomer to reduce the density, capability of producing polypropene with varying molecular weights and controlled stereoregularity. In this work the performance of rac-Me2Si(Benz[e]Indenyl)2ZrCI2/MAO catalyst system for polymerization of propene is studied. A mathematical model is developed for Zirconocene catalyzed propene polymerization. The model is simulated using Differential Evolution optimization algorithm in MATLAB 7.10.0 (R2010a) and verified with the experimental data. Model predictions are in good agreement with experimental results. Further, the effects of monomer concentration and concentration of catalyst on the rate of polymerization and polypropene properties are analyzed.
