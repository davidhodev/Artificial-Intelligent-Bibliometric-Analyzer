The first condensation of this kind polymer containing the niobocene moiety was synthesized employing the classical interfacial polycondensation procedure in 47% yield and with a high chain length of about 7,000. Vibrational spectroscopy shows bands from both reactants and the presence of bands assigned to the formation of the Nb-N and Nb-0 bond. Proton NMR shows bands from both the niobocene and acyclovir moieties with the expected shifts. MALDI MS results are consistent with the presence of niobocene and acyclovir with high mass ion fragments to two hundred units. Chain session to create the ion fragment clusters occurs at heteroatoms. The stability of the polymer in solution was studied for a month where the chain length decreased to 300. The molecular weight half life is relatively short, about 5 days, indicating that only freshly prepared samples should be used in biological testing. As the polymer is synthesized, fibers are spontaneously formed. The fibers have aspect ratios of 200 to 1,000. Â© MD Publications Pvt. Ltd.
