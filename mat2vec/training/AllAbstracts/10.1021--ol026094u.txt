(Matrix Presented) Copolymerization of bis(4-vinylbenzylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride and styrene in a test tube, followed by extraction of the bulk polymer and slicing into "disks" 1 mm thick and 5 mm in diameter, gives a supported zirconocene species that exhibits both stoichiometric and catalytic chemical activity. The disks catalyze reaction of trimethylaluminum and phenylacetylene to give Î±-methylstyrene with modest turnover numbers and are active over at least six recyclings.
