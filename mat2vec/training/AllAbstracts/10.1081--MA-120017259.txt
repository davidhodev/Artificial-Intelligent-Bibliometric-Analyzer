Copolymerization of ethylene and propylene was carried out in the presence of racethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride (Et[Ind]2ZrCl2) with SiO2 as the support for the catalyst. The effect of trimethylaluminum (TMA) and methylaluminoxane (MAO) was investigated using two methods of providing a supported system. The resultant data were analyzed in detail.
