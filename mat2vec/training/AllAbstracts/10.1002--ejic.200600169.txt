A series of two types of organotin complexes, namely [(R 3Sn)4(dmsa)] (R = Ph 1, PhCH2 2, CH3 3, nBu 4; H4dmsa = meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid) and [(R 2Sn)2(dmsa)(Y)]·L (R = Ph, Y = 2H2O, L = H2O, Et2O 5; R = PhCH2 6; R = CH3 7, R = nBu 8; R = nBu, Y = 0.5MeOH 9) have been synthesized. All complexes were characterized by elemental analysis and FT-IR and NMR (1H, 13C and 119Sn) spectroscopy. Among them, the strucrtures of complexes 1, 3, 5, and 9 were also determined by X-ray crystallography. The structural analyses show that complexes 1 and 3 are tetranuclear triorganotin monomers, complex 5 is a dinuclear diphenyltin monomer, and complex 9 is a 3D di-n-butyltin coordination polymer with a metal-organic framework structure. The supramolecular structure analyses reveal that the type of organic substituent attached to the tin atoms can apparently affect the supramolecular assembly: when the substituents attached to the tin atom are aromatic groups (1 and 5) the supramolecular structures are dominated by intermolecular π-π (C-H⋯π) weak interactions, whereas when the substituents attached to the tin atom are alkyl groups (3 and 9) the supramolecular structures are dominated by intermolecular Sn←X (X = S, O) coordination interactions. © Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
