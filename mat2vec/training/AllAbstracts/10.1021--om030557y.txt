The sequential reaction of 9-fluorenyllithium and CpNa with ( iPr) 2NBCl 2 followed by the sequential treatment with LDA and ZrCl 4 afforded [(η 5-C 13H 8)BN( i-Pr) 2(η 5-C 5H 5H 4)ZrCl 2 (2e). The structure of 2e was determined by X-ray diffraction, which shows that the molecule has C s symmetry. On activation by excess methylaluminoxane (MAO) 2e was converted to an active catalyst for polymerization of ethylene and propylene. The polypropylene is syndiotactic (81% rr triads).
