The regio‐ and stereo‐selectivity of metallocene/methylaluminoxane catalysts was shown to be significantly and rapidly enhanced by substitution of the indenyl ligands and by heterogenization of the zirconocenes. By oligomerization of 1‐butene with optically active metallocenes, it could be shown that there is a small influence from the growing polymer chain on the isotacticity, the overriding factor in every case being the existence of a chiral active centre. Each insertion step increased the stereospecificity, until the maximum value was achieved. Copyright © 1995 Hüthig & Wepf Verlag
