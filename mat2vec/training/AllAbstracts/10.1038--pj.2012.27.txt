Pd complexes with diimine ligands promoted the controlled cyclopolymerization of 1,6-dienes and 1,6,11-trienes to afford polymers containing 1,2-trans-cyclopentane groups with well-regulated stereochemistry. The polymerization proceeded with quantitative cyclization of the monomer, even under bulk conditions or in copolymerization reactions with ethylene and α-olefins. The polymerization of monomers with oligomethylene spacers yielded polymers with five-membered rings that are accurately distributed along the polymer chain. 4-Alkylcyclopentenes and alkenylcyclohexanes were also polymerized by Pd-diimine complexes to afford polymers with 1,3-trans- cyclopentane groups and 1,4-trans-cyclohexane groups, respectively. Pd complexes with a C 2 symmetrical structure promoted the isospecific polymerization of 4-alkylcyclopentenes, and the resultant isotactic polymers showed liquid crystalline properties. The mechanism of the polymerization reaction has been revealed. © 2012 The Society of Polymer Science, Japan (SPSJ) All rights reserved.
