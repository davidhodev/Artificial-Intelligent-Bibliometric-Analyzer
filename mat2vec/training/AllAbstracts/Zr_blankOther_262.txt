The catalytic properties of the complexes (RCp)2ZrCl2 (R = H, Me, Pri, Bun, Bui, Me3Si, cyclo-C6H11), and Me2SiCp*NButZrCl2 (Cp* = C5(CH3)4) combined with the AlBui3-CPh3B(C6F5)4 cocatalyst in ethylene polymerization were studied. The specific activity of the substituted bis-cyclopentadienyl complexes decreases in the sequence: Me > Pri > Bun > Bui > Me3Si > cyclo-C6H11, which corresponds to the activity sequence for these complexes activated by polymethylaluminoxane (MAO) but is 4-20 times lower in absolute value. Comparison of the polyethylene samples obtained in the presence of the same complexes with MAO and AlBui3-CPh3B(C6F5)4 cocatalysts showed that polyethylene with much higher molecular mass, melting point, and crystallinity is formed in the presence of the ternary catalytic systems, and this indicates a different nature of the active sites of the catalytic systems. The effective activation energy of polymerization (∼3.6 kcal mol-1), first order with respect to monomer and ∼0.4 order with respect to organoaluminum component, was found for the (PriCp)2ZrCl2-AlBui3-CPh3B(C6F5)4 catalytic system. It was proposed on the basis of the kinetic data that AliBu3 enters into the composition of the active site to form a bridged heteronuclear cationic complex.
