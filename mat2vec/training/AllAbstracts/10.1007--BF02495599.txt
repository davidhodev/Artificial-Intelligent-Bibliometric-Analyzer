Comparative analysis of catalytic activity of substituted bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichlorides with the general formula (R n Cp) 2 ZrCl 2 (Cp 2 ZrCl 2 , (MeCp) 2 ZrCl 2 , (Pr i Cp) 2 ZrCl 2 , (Pr i 2 Cp) 2 ZrCl 2 , (Bu n Cp) 2 ZrCl 2 , (Bu i Cp) 2 ZrCl 2 , (Bu t Cp) 2 ZrCl 2 , Cp* 2 ZrCl 2 (Cp* = Me 5 C 5 ), (Me 3 SiCp) 2 ZrCl 2 , (cyclo-C 6 H 11 Cp) 2 ZrCl 2 , and [(cyclo-C 6 H 11 ) 2 Cp] 2 ZrCl 2 ) in ethene polymerization using polymethylalumoxane as the cocatalyst was performed. The molecular mass characteristics of the polyethylene samples obtained were determined. A linear correlation of the specific activity of the catalysts and the turnover number with the electronic and steric characteristics of substituents at the Cp ring of the complexes was established for the first time. Analysis of the polymerization kinetics and the obtained correlation between the specific activity of the complexes and molecular mass characteristics of the polyethylene samples suggest that alkyl substituents participate in reactions responsible for the restriction of the polymer chain growth and regeneration of the active center. These interactions most likely involve associates of AlMe 3 with polymethylalumoxane molecules.
