The effect of ternary initiating systems benzoyl peroxide-ferrocene-3,6- bis(o-carboxybenzoyl)-N-isopropylcarbazole and benzoyl peroxide-di- η5-indenylzirconium dichloride-3,6-bis(o-carboxybenzoyl)-N- isopropylcarbazole on the radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate and on the heat resistance and microstructure of the resulting polymers was examined. © 2006 Nauka/Interperiodica.
