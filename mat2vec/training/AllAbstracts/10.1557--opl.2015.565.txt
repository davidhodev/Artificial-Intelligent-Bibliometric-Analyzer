Â© 2015 Materials Research Society. II-conjugated porous polymers with hierarchical pore structures were synthesized via high internal phase emulsion polymerization (polyHIPE) technique. The polymers could be used as heterogeneous photocatalysts for highly selective oxidation of organic sulfides into sulfoxides and the free radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) under visible light irradiation.
