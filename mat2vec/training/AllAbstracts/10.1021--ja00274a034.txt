Two new compounds, 2 and 3, were observed by NMR spectroscopy in PhSiH3 undergoing dehydrogenative polymerization under the catalytic influence of Cp2Ti(CH3)2. With use of slightly different reaction conditions, these two compounds were synthesized in good yields and their structures established by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Compound 2 is a dimer of Cp2TiSiH2Ph in which dimerization occurs through a pair of Ti-H-Si bridges. Compound 3 has the structure [Cp2Ti(/u-H)(ju-HSiHPh)TiCp2]. Under ambient conditions 2 spontaneously decomposes into 3 with production of poly(phenylsilane). 3 is transformed into 2 in the presence of excess PhSiH3. Some chemistry and ESR spectroscopic properties of these two unusual compounds are described, and their possible involvement in the polymerization reaction is discussed.
