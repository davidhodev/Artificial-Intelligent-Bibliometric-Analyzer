By operating at atmospheric CO2 pressure at ambient temperature, excellent results were achieved using Ti(O2CNEt2)4, Al(O2CNR2)3 (R = Et, iPr), Cu(O2CNEt2)2 and Sn(O2CNEt2)4, in combination with NBu4X (X = Br or Cl) as a co-catalyst. The reactions of MCl2(O2CNEt2)2 (M = Ti, Zr) with amorphous silica were straightforward through partial release of both chlorido and carbamato ligands, and readily afforded solid materials which were characterized by ICP-OES and EDS analyses, coupled to SEM. These heterogeneous catalytic systems revealed less efficient than the homogeneous counterparts.
