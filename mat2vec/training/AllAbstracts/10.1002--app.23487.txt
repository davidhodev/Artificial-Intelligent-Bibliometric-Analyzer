Syndiotactic polystyrene (s-PS) was prepared using monotitanocene catalyst of cyclopentadienyl titanium trichloride (CpTiCl3) activated by methylaluminoxane (MAO). Solution polymerization was carried out in toluene using different polymerization conditions. Syndiotacticity index (SI) between 68 and 91.6% was obtained. Increasing Al/Ti molar ratio shows an increase in both conversion percentage and SI. The conversion increased linearly with increasing Al/Ti molar ratio in the range studied. The conversion reached to an optimum value of about 65% at styrene/Al molar ratio of 2.83, while no regular behavior of SI was observed with changing the ratio. Effect of temperature of the range 50-80°C on polymerization was studied. The most favorable temperature for the polymerization regarding activity is 70°C; however SI decreased with temperature up to 80°C. H2 value to 140 mL/100 mL solvent increased the productivity of the catalyst, however further increase of H 2 reduced the activity of the catalyst. Polymerization time of 15 to 125 min shows a decrease in activity. The decrease was sharper for about 30 min of polymerization than longer time. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
