Half-sandwich titanocenes, e. g. (ind)TiRCl2(R-Cl, OMe, OEt; ind - indenyl group) and β-diketonate titanium complexes, e. g. (dbm)3TiL (L-Cl, OPh, OPhMe; dbm - dibenzoylmethane group) were investigated for syndiotactic polymerization of styrene. The optimum molar ratios of Al to Ti of β-diketonate titanium complexes were different from those of mono-indenyl titanium complexes. The polymerization activity of (ind) TiRCl2 was higher than that of (dbm)3TiL at their own optimum n(Al)/ n(Ti). Compared with (ind) TiRCl2, the thermostability of (dbm)3 TiL was higher. The polymerization activity of (dbm)3Ti(OPh) was 6.5× 105 g/(mol·h) at 363 K, while that of (ind)Ti(OMe)Cl2 was only 4.9×105 g/(mol ·h) at the same temperature. After 2 h of polymerization, the reaction activity of the nontitanocene was remained at 6×105 g/(mol·h), while that of the half-sandwich titanocene was only 0.71 × 105 g/(mol·h). It is indicated that the life-time of (dbm)3TiL was much longer than that of (ind)TiRCl2. The melting temperatures (Tm) and the syndiotacticity of polystyrene by β-diketonate titanium complexes were higher than those of the polymer by mono-indenyl titanium complexes as well.
