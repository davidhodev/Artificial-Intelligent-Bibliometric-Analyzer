A series of dinuclear half-sandwich titanium complexes with aryloxy substituent at titanium[(Î·5-cyclopentadienyl) (aryloxy) TiCl 2]2 [(CH2)n](n=3, n=6, n=9) have been successfully synthesized and their styrene polymerization properties have been investigated. All complexes are characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, elemental analysis, and mass spectrometry. In order to examine the catalytic properties of the dinuclear complexes styrene polymerization has been conducted in the presence of MMAO. It was found that (i) all the prepared complexes were very effective catalyst for the production of SPS (syndiotactic polystyrene), (ii) the complex with the longest bridge between the two active sites exhibited greatest catalytic activity among the three catalysts, but produced SPS with the smallest molecular weight, (iii) the activities of dinuclear half-titanocens with aryloxy substitution at titanium metal were greater than those of the chloride substituted compounds. These results indicate that not only the nature of the bridge between the two active sites but also the property of substituents at the metal exert a significant influence on the polymerization behaviors of the dinuclear half-titanocene.
