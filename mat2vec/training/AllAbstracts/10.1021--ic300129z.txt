The reaction of the cycloheptatrienylzirconium half-sandwich complex [(ν 7-C 7H 7)ZrCl(tmeda)] (1) (tmeda = N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine) with Li(Im DippN), generated from bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin-2-imine (Im DippNH) with methyllithium, yields the imidazolin-2-iminato complex [(ν 7-C 7H 7)Zr(Im DippN)(tmeda)] (2). The corresponding tmeda-free complex [(ν 7-C 7H 7)Zr(Im DippN)] (5) can be synthesized via the 1,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)allyl complex [(ν 7-C 7H 7)Zr{ν 3-C 3H 3(TMS) 2}(THF)] (3; TMS = SiMe 3), which undergoes an acid-base reaction with Im DippNH to form 5 and 1,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)propene. 5 exhibits an unusual one-legged piano stool ("pogo stick") geometry with a particularly short Zr-N bond of 1.997(2) Å. Addition of 2,6-dimethylphenyl or tert-butyl isocyanide affords the complexes [(ν 7-C 7H 7)Zr(Im DippN)(CNR)] (R = o-Xy, 6; R = t-Bu, 7), while the reaction with 2,6-dimethylphenyl isocyanate results in a [2 + 2] cycloaddition to form the ureato(1-) complex [(ν 7-C 7H 7)Zr{Im DippN(C=O)N-o-Xy}] (8). 5 can also act as an initiator for the ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone. These reactivity patterns together with density functional theory calculations reveal a marked similarity of the bonding in imidazolin-2-iminato and conventional imido transition-metal complexes. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
