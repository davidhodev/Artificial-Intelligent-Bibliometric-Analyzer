New metallocene catalysts applied to propylene polymerization expand the range of properties of polypropylene (PP), resulting in semi-crystalline materials having crystallinities below 60% up to X-ray amorphous highly elastic ones. To date the origin of the unique elastic mechanical behavior of such low crystalline PP is not completely understood. Therefore, the microscopic orientation of those PPs due to uniaxial stretching was investigated using wide-(WAXS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The aim of this study was to correlate these orientations or changes in the developed fiber textures with the macroscopic stress-strain behavior. This includes efforts to come closer to the main question of the nature of the physical cross-links in these not chemical cross-linked homopolymers, which is the reason for the high elastic behavior. Therefore, high molecular weight metallocene PPs showing different crystallinities (0-36%) were stretched to several elongations and the structural changes during the deformation were recorded by X-ray scattering. Stress-strain measurements show the great potential of these PPs as a thermoplastic rubber material. For quantitative analysis and discussion of the polymer chain orientations, the orientation functions were calculated. Correlations between the orientation functions and the stress-strain curves allow an interpretation of the macroscopic behavior on a microscopic scale. A higher cross-linking density in elongated samples indicates that the network, which is responsible for the elasticity, mainly built up by strain-induced morphology changes and chain orientations.
