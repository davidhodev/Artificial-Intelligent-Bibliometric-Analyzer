The behavior of (C2B9H11)M(NEt2)2(NHEt2) [M = Ti (1), Zr (2)] mono-dicarbollide complexes in olefin and styrene polymerisation has been investigated. Compounds 1 and 2, when activated by MAO (Al/M = 100 to 1000), polymerise ethylene with good activity. Surprisingly, 2 can also be activated with small amounts of triisobutylaluminum (TIBA, Al/Zr = 3 to 40). The ethylene polymerisation activity of the 2/TIBA catalyst (50°C, 5 atm, toluene-chlorobenzene) is greater than that reported for the CpZrX3/MAO catalysts but lower by about one or two orders of magnitude than zirconocene-MAO systems (e.g. Cp2ZrCl2/MAO, rac-(ethylene-bis-l-idenyl)ZrCl2/MAO). The GPC (gel permeation chromatography) curve of the polyethylene sample obtained with 2/TIBA catalyst (50°C, 5 atm, toluene-chlorobenzene) is bimodal indicating that at least two species are active in this system and one is more active than the other. The 2/MAO system (50°C, 5 atm, toluene-chlorobenzene) slowly polymerises propylene to atactic polymer. Under the same experimental conditions 1-pentene does not polymerise at all. Compounds 1 and 2, activated with MAO, produce syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS) with very low activity. Attempts to copolymerise styrene with ethylene by the 1/MAO and 2/MAO systems afforded a mixture of the two homopolymers.
