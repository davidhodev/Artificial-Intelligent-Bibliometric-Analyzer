Biodegradable polymers, such as polylactic acid (PLLA), poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polyethylene glycol (PEG), etc. with different ratios were intermittent electrospun to obtain nanofibers. The morphologies, structures, and properties of those nanofibers were characterized by SEM, XRD, FT-IR, etc. The degradation behavior of nanofibers was investigated in different solution. By analyzing the use of different degradation behaviors, the carrier for different types of DDS was preliminarily discussed for choosing suitable controllable-degradation carrier for different drugs to construct drug composite nanofibers.
