The activity of a MgCl2(THF)2/MAO/Cp2ZrCl2/MAO catalyst was studied in copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene in relation to Al:Zr mole ratio (1500-7000 at 50째C), experimental temperature (20-70째C), and time (20-90 min at 50째C; 10-55 min at 65째C). As the temperature and the Al:Zr ratio were increased, the activity of the catalyst rose. At the same time, the degree of incorporation of 1-hexene into the polymer chain increased and the M, melting point and crystallinity of the copolymer decreased. The catalyst was stable throughout the copolymerization. The process rate and copolymer properties were not affected by copolymerization time.
