A series of 1- and 2-aryl substituted indenyl titanium trichlorides (ArIndTiCl3, Ar = Ph, α-Naph, β-Naph) were synthesized and tested as catalyst precursors for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene with methylaluminoxane (MAO) as a cocatalyst. The polymerization characteristics at varying Al:Ti ratios and the kinetic behavior of these systems were investigated at 30 and 50 °C. The optimal Al:Ti ratio for these compounds lies in the range of 750-1500 at 30 °C, while the optimum shifts to higher values of about 2000-5000 at 50 °C. The activity of the investigated catalysts decreases in the order 2-PhInd > Ind > Cp > 1-(β-Naph)Ind >1-PhInd > 2-(β-Naph)Ind > 2-(α-Naph)Ind > 1-(α-Naph)Ind with an activity up to 6700 kg sPS/[(mol Ti) · h] for 2-PhIndTiCl3/MAO as the most active catalyst. Compared with CpTiCl3/MAO, the indenyl substituted compounds show, as catalysts, increased long-term stability, which was determined by variation of the polymerization time. Especially 2-PhIndTiCl3, 1-(β-Naph) IndTiCl3 and 2-(β-Naph)IndTiCl3 show a good performance. Syndiotactic polystyrenes with extremely high molar masses up to 1.3 × 106 g/mol can be obtained by the catalytic system 2-(β-Naph)IndTiCl3/MAO.
