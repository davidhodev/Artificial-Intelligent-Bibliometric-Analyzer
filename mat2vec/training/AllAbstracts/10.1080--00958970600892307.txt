A copper complex with β-ketoamine ligand based on a pyrazolone derivative was synthesized by condensing pyrazolone with 3-methylaniline and then reacting the produced β-ketoamine with copper halide. The solid-state structure of the complex was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The bis(β-ketoamine) copper complex shows moderate activity to catalyze the vinyl polymerization of norbornene with activation of methylaluminoxane under mild reaction conditions. The activity of the catalyst for norbornene polymerization is as high as 2.88 × 104 g polymer/mol Cu h. The polymer yield and catalytic activity can be controlled over a wide range by the variation of reaction parameters. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.
