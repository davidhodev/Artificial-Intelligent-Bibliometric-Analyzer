Ethylene, propylene and 1-butene polymerization kinetics have been investigated in the presence of 16 zirconocene and ethylalumoxane derivatives with various molecular masses and a molar ratio of Al/Zr = 23-26. It was found that zirconocene activity in combination with ethylalumoxanes with molecular weight MW = 880 (an oligomer with -[OAl(C2H5)]- unit number equal to 10) increases in series: Cp(Acac)2ZrCl < (Fulv)2Cp,Zr,Cl2 < Cp,ZrMe2 < (Fulv)2Cp2Zr2(O)Cl2 < (Ind)2ZrCl2 < (t-Bu2Cp)2ZrCl2 < Cp2ZrCl2 < (t-BuCp)2ZrCl2 < (MeCp)2ZrCl2 < (i-PrCp)2ZrCl2, where Fulv - fulvalene. With methylalumoxane (MW = 1930, (-[OAl(CH3)]- unit number 31) the following series of zirconocene activity was established: (MeCp)2ZrCl2 < (EtCp)2ZrCl2 < (PrCp)2ZrCl2 < (BuCp2ZrCl2 < (i-PrCp)2ZrCl2 < (Cyclo- HexCp)2ZrCl2.
