The bridging of C2-symmetric 8,10-dimethyltricyclo[5.2.2.02,6]-2,5-undecadiene (DMeB-COCpH) by silicon, methylene, and ethylene was investigated. The dimethylsilyl-bridged bis(BCOCp) ligand was accessible but could not be converted to its titanium, zirconium, or niobium chloride complexes. 8,10-Dimethyl-4-(1-methylethylidene)tricyclo[5.2.2.0 2,6]-2,5-undecadiene (DMeBCOCp-dimethylfulvene) was formed, but did not react with cyclopentadienyl anions. A regioisomeric mixture of 1,2-bis[(1R,7R,8R,10R)-8,10-dimethyltricyclo-[5.2.2.0 2,6]-2,5-undecadienyl]ethane [en(DMeBCOCpH)] ligands could be formed and metalated to form (+)-[ethylene-1,2-bis[η 5-(1R,7R,8R,10R)-8,10-dimethyltricyclo[5.2.2.0 2,6]-2,5-undecadien-4-yl]]titanium dichloride [(+)-β,β-en(DMeBCOCp)2TiCl2, (+)-11] along with its α,α- and α,β-bridged regioisomeric titanocene dichlorides. (+)-11 is unique in that it is a chiral ethylene-bridged ansa-metallocene which contains only homotopic cyclopentadienyl faces. (+)-11 was characterized by X-ray crystallography and was applied as a catalyst for the enantioselective isomerization of alkenes. (+)-11 was less active and less enantioselective than a known chiral ansa-bis(indenyl)titanium catalyst for the enantioselective alkene isomerization.
