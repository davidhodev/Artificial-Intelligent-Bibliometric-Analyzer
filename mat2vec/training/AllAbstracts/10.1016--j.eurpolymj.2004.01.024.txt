The syndiotactic polymerization of styrene with exo-[(η5- isodiCp)TiCl3] 1/methylalumoxane (MAO; isodiCp=isodicyclopentadienyl) was studied as well as the ethylene/styrene copolymerization with exo-[{η5:η1(N)-isodiCp(SiMe2Nt-Bu)} TiCl2] 2/MAO. These two catalytic systems are stable during polymerization. The half-sandwich titanocene 1 exhibits good syndiospecificity and average activity. The bridged half-sandwich amino complex 2 was found to incorporate styrene into polymer chains at 70 °C. Activity results decrease with increasing styrene concentrations. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
