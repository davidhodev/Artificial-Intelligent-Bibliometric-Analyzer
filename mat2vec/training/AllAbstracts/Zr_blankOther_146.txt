Bimetallic Zr complexes are synthesized by olefin metathesis reaction of vinyl group of monometallic complexes. The Si bridged zirconocene {η5-C5Me4-SiMe2- η5-C5H3CH2CH=CH 2}ZrCl2 is transformed by metathesis reaction to the novel bimetallic complex with ansa-structure. Ethylene and propylene polymerization was conducted by bimetallic complexes. The activity of the bimetallic complex depends on the steric hindrance of the ligand. The bimetallic complex with ansa-structure gave isotactic polypropylene with a similar high selectivity to that of the monometallic analog. Bimetallic complexes catalyzed cyclopolymerization of 1,5-hexadiene to give poly(methylene-1,3-cyclopentane). © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
