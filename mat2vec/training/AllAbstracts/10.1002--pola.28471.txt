© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. We report the synthesis of the novel half-titanocene alkoxide complex bischloro-η5-cyclopentadienyl(bicyclo[2.2.1]-hept-5-en-2-oxy) titanium (IV), [CpTiCl2(O-NBE)]. This complex was employed for the synthesis of chiral poly(l-lactide-b-hexyl isocyanate) diblock copolymer bearing a norbornene end group with sequential addition of monomers. The poly(hexyl isocyanate) block is chiral due to the last l-lactide unit of the poly(l-lactide) block. This macromonomer was polymerized towards a chiral polymer brush structure with polynorbornene backbone and chiral poly(l-lactide-b-hexyl isocyanate) side chains using Grubbs first-generation catalyst. The polymers were characterized using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and their thermal properties were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
