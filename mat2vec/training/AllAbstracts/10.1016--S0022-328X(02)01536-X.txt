Ansa-zirconocene complex with an allyl substituted silane bridge synthesized and characterized. The molecular structure of 1a has been determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The polymer immobilized metallocene catalyst 1b is prepared by the co-polymerization of 1a with styrene in the presence of radical initiator. The result of ethylene polymerization showed that the polymer immobilized metallocene catalyst kept high activity for ethylene polymerization and was a potential supported catalyst for olefin polymerization.
