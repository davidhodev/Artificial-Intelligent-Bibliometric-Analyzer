Â© 2016 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering The transesterification reactions to diphenyl carbonate (DPC) from dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and phenol are the key steps to the green production of polycarbonate polymers (PC). The transesterification equilibrium constants were determined under temperatures from 453.2 to 493.2 K, and the reaction kinetics catalyzed by single tetrabutyl titanate, dibutyltin oxide, and their combinations was measured. By taking into account the effect of catalyst, the simplified kinetic model was developed involving the transesterification of DMC and methyl phenyl carbonate (MPC) with phenol, the disproportionation of MPC, and the formation of byproduct anisole. The kinetic model fitted experiments well under various temperatures and had an excellent predictive ability on the effect of catalyst concentrations. The reverse reaction of MPC transesterification with phenol, as well as that of the disproportionation of MPC, was found to be independent of temperatures within the investigated conditions. The thermodynamic information and kinetic model reported here will provide valuable insight into the understanding of the transesterification process from DMC to DPC.
