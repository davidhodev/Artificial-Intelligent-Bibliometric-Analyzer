An overview on the applications of metallocene based molecules such as ferrocenyl phosphines, Ti, Zr and Hf complexes of cyclopentadienes and carboranes in homogeneous catalysis are discussed.The industrial applications of organometallic sandwich compounds include carbon-carbon and carbon-hetero atom coupling, chiral catalysis and olefin polymerization reactions.
