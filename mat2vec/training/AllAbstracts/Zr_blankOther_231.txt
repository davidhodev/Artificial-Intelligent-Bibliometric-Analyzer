A new cyclopentadiene derivative 1,2-diphenyl-4-propyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene(1) was synthesized by reaction of 3,4-diphenyl-2-cyclopentenone with n-propyl lithium. 1 was treated with n-butyl lithium and then reacted with ZrCl4 in toluene to give sterically bulky unbridged zirconocene dichloride (1,2-Ph2-4-PrCp)2ZrCl2(2). 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopic analyses reveal its C2Ï…- symmetric conformation in solution. Upon activation with methylaluminoxane(MAO), 2 effectively polymerizes ethylene and produces high molecular weight polyethylenes with high melting transition temperatures at low Al/Zr ratios. At ambient conditions, 2/MAO system shows high catalytic activity in propylene polymerization and produces oily oligomers.
