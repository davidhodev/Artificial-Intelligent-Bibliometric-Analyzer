Propylene homopolymerization was carried out with Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 immobilized on commercial MAO-modified silica by the in situ supporting technique. Adsorption isotherm determination for this metallocene on silica indicated that the saturation level is reached at 2.0 wt.% Zr/SMAO. Catalyst systems were shown to be active in the absence of external MAO, being activated by common alkylaluminum cocatalysts, namely triethylaluminum (TEA), isoprenylaluminum (IPRA) and triisobutylaluminum (TIBA). The effect of the nature and concentration of cocatalyst on catalyst activity and on polypropylene (PP) properties was evaluated. Best catalyst activity was observed in low concentration of IPRA (1.4kg PP/g cat h). The resulting polymers were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM).
