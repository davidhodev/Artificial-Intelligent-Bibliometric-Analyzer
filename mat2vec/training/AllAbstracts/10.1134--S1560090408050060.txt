The free-radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate initiated by the three-component system ferrocene-zirconocene dichloride-benzoyl peroxide has been studied. The kinetic features of the process, the interaction between components of the initiation system, and the molecular characteristics of the polymers have been investigated. In the case of the three-component initiation system, the content of syndiotactic fragments grows and the thermal stability of the polymers is improved compared to the products of polymerization carried out in the presence of solely a peroxide initiator.
