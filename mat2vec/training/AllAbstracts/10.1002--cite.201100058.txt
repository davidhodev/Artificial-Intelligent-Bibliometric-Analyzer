Ionic liquids are discussed as new solvents for synthesis and modification of polymers. Polymerizations occuring by radical, ionic, complex coordinative or enzymatic mechanism, ring opening polymerizations, group transfer polymerizations, and polycondensations have been successfully carried out in ionic liquids. Polymer analogous reactions using either natural or synthetic polymers dissolved in ionic liquids result in modification of the polymer structure, and therefore, in variation of the polymer properties. Ionic liquids bearing polymerizable functional groups are interesting monomers for manufacturing of new polymer materials. Potential application fields include batteries, materials for separation processes in analytical chemistry up to coatings with antimicrobial effects. Copyright Â© 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
