Hydrophosphonylation reactions have emerged as efficient processes for the functionalization of alkenes or alkynes. Synthesis of alkylphosphonates was achieved by an original double radical transfer mediated by titanocene and propylene oxide. By the same way, nitriles which are considered as inert functions in radical process lead to aminobisphosphonates.
