Treatment of [RE(CH2SiMe3)3(thf)2] with 1 equivalent of 3-(tBuN= CH)C8H5NH (L1) in THF gives the dinuclear rare-earth metal alkyl complexes trans-[(μ-η2:η1:η1-3-{tBuNCH- (CH2SiMe3)}Ind)RE(thf)(CH2SiMe3)]2 (Ind=indolyl, RE=Y, Dy, or Yb) in good yields. In the process, the indole unit of L1 is deprotonated by the metal alkyl species and the imino C=N group is transferred to the amido group by alkyl CH2SiMe3insertion, affording a new dianionic ligand that bridges two metal alkyl units in μ-η2:η1:η1 bonding modes, forming the dinuclear rare-earth metal alkyl complexes. When L1 is reduced to 3-(tBuNHCH2)C8H5NH (L2), the reaction of [Yb(CH2SiMe3)3(thf)2] with 1 equivalent of L2 in THF, interestingly, generated the trans-[(μ-η2:η1:η1-3-{tBuNCH2}Ind)- Yb(thf)(CH2SiMe3)]2 (major) and cis-[(μ-η2:η1:η1-3-{tBuNCH2} Ind)Yb(thf)(CH2SiMe3)]2 (minor) complexes. The catalytic activities of these dinuclear rare-earth metal alkyl complexes for isoprene polymerization were investigated; the yttrium and dysprosium complexes exhibited high catalytic activities and high regio- and stereoselectivities for isoprene 1,4-cispolymerization.
