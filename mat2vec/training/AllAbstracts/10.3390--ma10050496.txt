Â© 2017 by the authors.Ziegler-Natta polymerization catalysts were characterized by a complex of surface- and bulk-sensitive methods (DRIFTS, XPS, ESR, and XAS = XANES + EXAFS). A diffuse-reflectance Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy (DRIFTS) study showed the presence of strong Lewis acid sites in different concentrations and absence of strong basic sites in the polymerization catalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron-spin resonance (ESR), and (X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analysis revealed the presence of Ti4+, Ti3+, Ti2+, and Ti1+ species in the surface layers and in the bulk of catalysts. The samples under study differ drastically in terms of the number of ESR-visible paramagnetic sites. The EXAFS study shows the presence of a Cl atom as a nearest neighbor of the absorbing Ti atom.
