The corresponding discrete homodinuclear zirconium and hafnium bis(dichloro ansa-metallocene) complexes, Ph[{-CR(3,6-tBu2 Flu)(Cp)}MCl2]2 (p-, R = Me (3a-Zr2, 3a-Hf2), R = H (3b-Zr2); m-, R = Me (3c-Zr2), were prepared by salt metathesis reactions. An attempt to generate in situ a heterodinuclear complex 3a-Zr-Hf was also undertaken. For the first time, Atmospheric Pressure PhotoIonization (APPI) mass-spectrometric data were obtained for all dinuclear compounds and found to be in excellent agreement with the simulated ones. Preliminary studies on the catalytic performances of these dinuclear complexes, upon activation with MAO, in ethylene homopolymerization and ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization revealed a few differences as compared to those of the monometallic analogues. In particular, slightly lower molecular weights and a greater formation of short methyl and ethyl branches were obtained with the dinuclear systems.
