An overview of the methodologies to elucidate the microstructure of copolymers of ethylene and cyclic olefins through 13C Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis is given. 13C NMR spectra of these copolymers are quite complex because of the presence of stereogenic carbons in the monomer unit and of the fact that chemical shifts of these copolymers do not obey straightforward additive rules. We illustrate how it is possible to assign 13C NMR spectra of cyclic olefin-based copolymers by selecting the proper tools, which include synthesis of copolymers with different comonomer content and by catalysts with different symmetries, the use of one- or two-dimensional NMR techniques. The consideration of conformational characteristics of copolymer chain, as well as the exploitation of all the peak areas of the spectra by accounting for the stoichoimetric requirements of the copolymer chain and the best fitting of a set of linear equation was obtained. The examples presented include the assignments of the complex spectra of poly(ethylene-co-norbornene (E-co-N), poly(propylene-co-norbornene (P-co-N) copolymers, poly(ethylene-co-4-Me-cyclohexane)s, poly(ethylene-co-1-Me-cyclopentane)s, and poly(E-ter-N-ter-1,4-hexadiene) and the elucidation of their microstructures.
