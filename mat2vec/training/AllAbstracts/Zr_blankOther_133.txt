We investigated copolymerization of propylene and allylmercaptan as a commercially available sulfur containing monomer. After protection of mercapto group with alkylaluminum, the copolymerization was conducted by isotactic ansa-zirconocene/methylaluminoxane catalysts. Polypropylene containing sulfur was obtained with triisobutylaluminum-protected allylmercaptan monomer, while the no polymer was obtained with trimethylaluminum-protected allylmercaptan. Structure of the products was investigated by NMR and GPC, and it was revealed that end sulfurizated polymer was mainly produced.
