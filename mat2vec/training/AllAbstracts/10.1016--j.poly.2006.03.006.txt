New titanium complexes, 1,2-diphenyl-4-R-cyclopentadienyl titanium trichloride (R = Me (4), n-Bu (5), Ph (6)) have been synthesized. The crystal structure of complex 4 has been determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. All the titanium complexes were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. In the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO), these complexes show high catalytic activity and syndiospecificity for the polymerization of styrene. The catalytic activity of the three complexes increases in the order of 6 < 5 < 4. Â© 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
