We have investigated polymerization of vinyl chloride (VC) with half-titanocene catalysts. However, the polymerization of VC with typical titanocene catalysts such as Cp2TiCl2/MAO has not been succeeded. Thus, we investigated the polymerization of VC with Cp 2Ti(OPh)2/MAO catalyst instead of Cp2TiCl 2/MAO catalyst. The Cp2Ti(OPh)2MAO catalyst gave a high molecular weight PVC in a good yield. We also examined the control of main chain structure and molecular weight of polymer.
