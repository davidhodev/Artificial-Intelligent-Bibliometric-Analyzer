Statistical models can be used in conjunction with NMR spectroscopy to study polymer microstructure and polymerization mechanisms. Thus, Bernoullian, Markovian, and enantiomorphic-site models are well known. Many additional models have been formulated over the years for additional situations. Typically spectral interpretation and data treatment can be done through either "analytical" or "simulation" approaches. These can be combined into "integrated" approaches for specific situations. An alternative (and more general) approach considers the kinetics of the polymerization process and carries out predictions of polymer microstructures and NMR spectra. These various methodologies are briefly reviewed here. Also reviewed is a recent effort in the simulation category involving a user-friendly Excel program ("Polytact") that can simulate the tacticities of a large number of statistical models, particularly those that pertain to polyolefins made with single-site catalysts.
