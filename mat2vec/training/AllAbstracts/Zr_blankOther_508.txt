We have reported previously that the rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)methylzirconium ″cation″ (1), which was produced from the reaction of rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)dimethylzirconium and triphenylcarbenium (trityl) tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate, was exceedingly active and stereoselective in propylene polymerization, and that its catalytic activity and stereospecificity increases with a decrease of Tp. However, in the aluminum-free catalyst, a certain amount of 1 is consumed in the nonproductive function of scavenging inpurities. We report here an alternate and efficient method to produce alkylzirconocene-type ″cations″ polymerization catalysts.
