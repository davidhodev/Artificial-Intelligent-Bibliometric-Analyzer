Four ethylene bis-indenyl ligands containing tethers of various lengths were successfully immobilized on the surface of functionalized silica gel. The strategy of immobilization was based on catalytic thiol-ene coupling of terminal alkene groups in the tethers with surface thiol groups. Obtained materials have high BET surface area and pore volume. The method developed can be used for immobilization of catalytically active bis-indenyl metallocene complexes, thus preventing their dimerization and deactivation. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
