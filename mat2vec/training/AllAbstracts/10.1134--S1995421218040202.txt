Â© 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. Abstract: Reaction mixtures have been proposed as a basis of adhesive composition for gluing items made of poly(methyl methacrylate) or polystyrene. This composition consists of respective monomers and macroinitiators formed during radically initiated polymerization in the presence of metallocenes. An evaluation of the macroinitiators activity was carried out in postpolymerization of styrene and methyl methacrylate processes (the poly(methyl methacrylate) and polystyrene macroinitiators were considered, they were obtained in two different ways: the first one is during the polymerization with benzoyl peroxide or azobisisobutyronitrile and ferrocene or titanocene dichloride, and the second one is macroinitiators obtained in situ under the influence of UV radiation and in the presence of ferrocene or titanocene dichloride). The optimal methods of preparation and recipe of adhesive compositions were determined from the point of view of the fastest curing rate.
