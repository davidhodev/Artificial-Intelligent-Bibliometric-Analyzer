This work is aimed at controlling not only the reactivity of the metal catalysts for α-olefin polymerization but also the molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, polymer microstructure and monomer content of the copolymers. Among the catalyst precursor categories, non-bridged half-metallocene complexes supported by a variety of chelating ligands are attractive catalyst motifs for ethylene homopolymerization, ethylene/α-olefin copolymerization and stereoselective polymerization of α-olefins. These motifs are attractive in terms of their rather simple synthetic protocols and the wide range of potential architectural designs of the attached ligands. This review article summarizes recent developments regarding non-bridged half-metallocene complexes of group 4-6 metals with anionic chelating ligands. In contrast to the conventional metallocene initiators Cp 2 MX 2 (Cp=η 5 -C 5 H 5), half-metallocene complexes of the type CpM(L^L)X 2 (L^L=chelating ligands) offer the advantage of catalyst modification. Steric and/or electronic modification of the coordination environment can be achieved by changing one cyclopentadienyl ligand of a metallocene complex to another ligand, such as three-, four-, five-, six- or seven-membered chelates having bidentate or tridentate coordinations and being monoanionic, dianionic or trianionic. Half-metallocene complexes with a four-membered chelating ring are focused on due to their unique dynamic behaviors of metal-centered racemization and chain transfer. The structural uniqueness of the metal complexes, the effects of the chelate ring sizes on their productivity and the activation processes of the metal complexes with cocatalysts are highlighted.
