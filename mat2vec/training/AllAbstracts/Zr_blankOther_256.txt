A MgCl2(THF)2 support modified by organoaluminum chloride or MAO enabled us to obtain specially active zirconocene catalyst systems for ethylene polymerization. The zirconocene system on the bimetallic support was found to be the more active than that on the monometallic support. Two kinds of catalytic active sites were found to exist in the supported zirconocene catalyst: unstable active sites that become deactivated during the polymerization of ethylene, and very stable catalytic centers created in the olefin environment. The kinetic investigations on the ethylene polymerization allowed to suggest the reason underlying the creation of the stable active sites.
