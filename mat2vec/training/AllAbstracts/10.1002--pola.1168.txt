Ethylene polymerizations with catalytic systems Me2SiCp*NtBuZrX2 (1) [Cp* = C5(CH3)4;X = Cl (1Cl), Me (1Me)], triisobutylaluminum (TIBA), perfluorophenylborate CatB(C6F5)4 [Cat = CPh3 (3), Me2NHPh (4)], or Me2SiCp2ZrX2 [X = Cl (2Cl), Me (2Me)]/TIBA/3 (4) were performed within a wide range of ethylene pressures of different Al/Zr ratios, and Zr/B = 1. Catalytic systems 1Cl(2Cl)/TIBA/3 led to the formation of very high linear molecular weight polyethylene (PE) of Mη ∼;2,000,000 with low activity. The replacement of both chlorine ligands in the precatalyst for the methyl ones led to the formation of active species producing low molecular weight PE with high activity. Chain transfer to ethylene was shown to be the main reaction controlling PE chain propagation: kp/ktr ∼20-30 for 1Me/TIBA/3 and kp/ktr ∼350-500 for 2Me/TIBA/3. It was suggested that TIBA was present in the active center first in the form of a neutral heterobimetallic Zr-Al bridged complex followed by the formation of a partially polarized Zr-Al(Cl)R2 (R = iBu) or an unreactive Zr-AlR3 cationic complex by abstraction of the alkyl ligand under the action of borate. It was concluded that AlR3 from the latter cationic complex may be easily reversibly replaced under the specific coordination of ethylene or accumulated α-olefin, giving rise to highly labile and sterically accessible cationic species. Experiments on ethylene polymerization with the catalytic systems 1Cl(1Me)/TIBA/3/Ph2NH, 1Cl(1Me)/TIBA/4, 2Cl(2Me)/TIBA/3/Ph2NH, and 2Cl(2Me)/TIBA/4 were performed to confirm the suggestion. Catalytic systems derived from dichloride complexes in the presence of a σ-donor substrate also produced low molecular weight PEs with molecular weight characteristics similar to those of products obtained with the dimethylated precatalysts. The specific feature of active species derived from 2Me complexes to isomerize coordinated α-olefin into trans-vinylene polymer chains was also revealed. The catalytic behavior of the ternary catalytic system based on 2Me relative to 2Me or 2Cl precatalysts activated with polymethylaluminoxane at different Al/Zr ratios was compared.
