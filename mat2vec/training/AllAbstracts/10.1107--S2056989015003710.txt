Alkyl zirconocene cations have been of considerable interest as reactive species in many polymerization processes. In the crystal structure of the title compound, [Zr(C<inf>12</inf>H<inf>19</inf>)(C<inf>5</inf>H<inf>5</inf>)<inf>2</inf>](C<inf>36</inf>HB<inf>2</inf>F<inf>30</inf>O), the [Zr(C<inf>5</inf>H<inf>5</inf>)<inf>2</inf>((t-Bu)-C=C(H) - C<inf>2</inf>(t-Bu))]<sup>+</sup> cation displays a buta-1-en-3-yne ligand side-on coordinated to a typical bent zirconocene [centroid(cp)-Zr - centroid(cp) = 131.4(3)°, Zr - C(buta-1-en-3-yne) = 2.255 (3), 2.597 (3) and 2.452 (2) Å]. In the [HO(B(C<inf>6</inf>F<inf>5</inf>)<inf>3</inf>)<inf>2</inf>]<sup>-</sup> anion, intramolecular O - H⋯F hydrogen bonds are observed. One tert-butyl group in the complex cation is disordered over two sets of sites with occupancies 0.701(4):0.299(4).
