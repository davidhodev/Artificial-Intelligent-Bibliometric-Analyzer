The dual-site zirconocene dichlorides rac-and meso-SiMe2(3- benzylindenyl)(indenyl)ZrCl2 have been synthesized and used, after a methylaluminoxane activation, in propene polymerization. These diastereomers produce isotactic polypropenes with similar microstructures and molar masses under equivalent polymerization conditions.
