In a search for the hitherto elusive catalyst resting state(s) of zirconocene-based olefin polymerization catalysts, a combination of UV/Vis and NMR spectrometric methods reveals that polymer-carrying cationic Zr allyl complexes make up about 90-% of the total catalyst concentration. Other catalyst species that take part in the polymerization process have to be generated from this allyl pool into which they appear to relapse rather frequently. A combination of UV/Vis and NMR spectrometric methods reveals that polymer-carrying cationic Zr allyl complexes derived by β-hydride and subsequent proton abstraction from a Zr polymeryl cation make up about 90-% of the catalyst content when 1-hexene is polymerized with a cationic ansa-zirconocene catalyst at 25-°C. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
