KGaA, WeinheimThe main aim of this work is to obtain heterogeneous, zirconocene aluminohydride/methylaluminoxane (MAO) polymerization catalysts, without using inorganic carriers like silica. The syntheses of zirconocenium ion-based clathrates, formed from aluminohydride zirconocene complexes activated with MAO, are reported here. Several different approaches were examined for the synthesis of these clathrate compositions; in one approach the catalyst (nBuCp2ZrH3AlH2/MAO) was first prepared in toluene solution, and the clathrate phase then generated by addition of silicone oil. An alternate approach involved reaction of silicone oil or another clathrate-forming additive (e.g. KCl) with MAO to form a solidified clathrate, and then introducing the zirconocene aluminohydride complex (nBuCp2ZrH3AlH2). The clathrate catalysts were probed in the polymerization of ethylene in hydrocarbon slurry, without using additional co-catalyst (MAO), or at very low concentrations of modified MAO (MMAO 7, 13 wt-% in iso-octane). The catalytic activities of the solid clathrate catalysts were compared as well as the morphology and properties of the polyethylene synthesized in slurry.
