The asymmetric ansa-ligand precursors (C5Me4H)SiMe2(C5H4R) (R = H (1), Me (2), SiMe3 (3), <Pr (4)) and their lithium derivatives [Me2Si(C5Me4)(C5H3R)]Li2 (R = H (5), Me (6), SiMe3 . , (7), 'Pr (8)) have been prepared. The cmsa-niobocene imido complexes [Me2Si(?/5-C5Me4)(?;5.C5H3R)]Nb(=N'Bu)Cl (R = H (9), Me (10), SiMe3 (11), 'Pr (12)) were synthesized by the reaction of Nb(=N'Bu)Cl3(py)2 with [Me2Si(C5Me4)(C5H3R)]Li2 in THF. The tmsa-zirconocene complexes [Me2SiO;5-C5Me4)0/5-C5H3R)]ZrCl2 (R = H (13), Me (14), SiMe3 (15), 'Pr (16)) were prepared by the reaction of ZrCLj and the corresponding lithiated cmsa-derivative. The molecular structures of 10,12,13, and 14 were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Preliminary results for the catalytic activity of 13-16 in the polymerization of ethylene are reported. Â© 2001 American Chemical Society.
