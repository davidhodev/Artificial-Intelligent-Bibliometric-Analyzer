Copolymerization of ethylene with 4-penten-1-ol (4P1O) is conducted by using a half-titanocene catalyst. The incorporation of 4P1O is high as approximately 10 mol%. The assignments of the 13C NMR spectrum and the analysis of the sequence distribution show the existence of not only the alternative structure but also the repeated 4P1O units. The product of the reactive ratios is calculated as ca. 2. A copolymer of ethylene with a short-chain polar monomer, 4-pentene-1-ol is successfully synthesized with the incorporation of 10.5 mol% by using a half-metallocene catalyst. 13C NMR spectroscopy analysis shows the existence of not only the alternative structure but also the repeated 4P1O units.
