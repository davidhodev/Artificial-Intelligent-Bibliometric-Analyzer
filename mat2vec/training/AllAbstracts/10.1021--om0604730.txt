Ethylene polymerization using catalysts derived from activation of zirconocene aluminohydride complexes with either methyl aluminoxane or B(C 6F 5) 3 is reported. Variable-temperature NMR spectra of mixtures of Cp* 2ZrH 3AlH 2 or Cp′ 2ZrH 3AlH 2 and excess B(C 6F 5) 3 reveal the formation of di- or polynuclear metallocenium ion-pairs featuring terminal or both terminal and bridging borohydride counteranions HB(C 6F 5) 3 arising from hydride abstraction. At higher T, ion-pairs featuring the terminal HB(C 6F 5) 3 counterion decompose, and the AlH 3 that is liberated degrades B(C 6F 5) 3 to furnish mixtures of (C 6F 5) nAlH 3-n and, in the case of Cp* 2ZrH 3AlH 2, a new ion-pair partnered with the diborohydride counteranion [Cp* 2ZrH][(μ-H) 2B(C 6F 5) 2]. The latter compound was independently prepared from Cp* 2-ZrH 2 and HB(C 6F 5) 2 and is active in ethylene polymerization; however it is 1000 times less active than the catalyst formed from Cp* 2ZrH 3AlH 2 and B(C 6F 5) 3 and so cannot account for the multisite behavior of the latter combination. There is evidence of chemical exchange between "free" or terminal HB(C 6F 5) 3 and excess B(C 6F 5) 3 in these mixtures, and on the basis of model studies with [ nBu 4N][HB(C 6F 5) 3] and B(C 6F 5) 3, this involves reversible formation of [ nBu 4N][(C 6F 5) 3B)(μ-H)B(C 6F 5) 3], which can be detected by 19F NMR spectroscopy in solution at low T. © 2006 American Chemical Society.
