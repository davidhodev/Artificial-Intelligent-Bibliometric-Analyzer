A series of titanocene and zirconocene dichlorides was synthesized bearing ligands that contain a (chiral) ether group linked by an ethylene spacer group to the cyclopentadienyl ring. Surprisingly, the chiral zirconocenes (η5-C5H4CH2CH2OR)2ZrCl2 with R=isobornyl and menthyl do not show Ziegler-Natta activity. This is probably caused by attack of the cocatalyst (MeAlO)n on the side chains, causing immobilization of the catalyst. Intramolecular coordination of the side chains is provoked by converting the dichlorides to the more Lewis-acidic mono and bis triflate complexes. The coordination of the ether chain depends on the size of the terminal group in the chain. In the achiral derivative (η5-C5H4CH2CH2OMe)2Zr(O3SCF3)2 there is a rapid equilibrium between species with one and two intramolecularly-coordinated ether side chains. The monotriflate complex (η5-C5H4CH2CH2Oisobor nyl)2ZrCl(O3SCF3) decomposes rapidly, because ether coordination results in facile C-O bond cleavage and liberation of camphene. Accordingly, the bistriflate (η5-C5H4CH2CH2Oisobor nyl)2Zr(O3SCF3)2 could not be synthesized. The chiral triflate complexes (η5-C5H4CH2CH2OR)2Zr(O3SCF3)2 with R=menthyl and fenchyl are active Diels-Alder catalysts, although no optical induction was observed, probably because the chiral ether handles are not sufficiently coordinated during catalysis.
