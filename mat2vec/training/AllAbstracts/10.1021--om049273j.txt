A series of chiral ansa zirconocene compounds that feature (i) [Me 2Si] and [Me 4Si 2] bridges and (ii) two tert-butyl substituents on each cyclopentadienyl ring, namely, rac- [Me 2Si(CpBu 2 t) 2]-ZrCl 2, rac-[Me 2Si(CpBu 2 t) 2]Zr(Ph)Cl, rac-[Me 2Si(CpBu 2 t) 2]ZrMe 2, rac-[Me 2Si(CpBu 2 t) 2],Zr(CO) 2 rac-[Me 4Si 2(CpBu 2 2) 2]ZrCl 2, and rac-[Me 4Si 2(CpBu 2 t) 2]Zr(CO) 2, has been synthesized. In each case, the complex exists as the racemo isomer due to inter-ring steric interactions between the Bu t substituents proximal to the ansa bridge that destabilize the meso isomer. rac-[Me 4Si 2-(CpBu 2 t) 2ZrCl 2 is the first structurally characterized ansa zirconocene complex with a [Me 4-Si 2] bridge that adopts a racemo geometry. IR spectroscopic studies on the dicarbonyl complexes (Cp 1,3-Bu 2 t) 2Zr(CO) 2 rac-[Me 2Si(CpBu 2 t) 2]Zr(CO) 2, and rac-[Me 4Si 2(CpBu 2 t) 2]Zr(CO) 2 demonstrate that the [Me 2Si] and [Me 4Si 2] ansa bridges have opposite electronic influences in this system, with the [Me 2Si] bridge exerting an electron-withdrawing effect and the [Me 4-Si 2] bridge exerting an electron-donating effect. The [Me 2Si] and [Me 4Si 2] bridges also exert a different influence with respect to olefin polymerization, with {rac-[Me 2Si(CpBu 2 t) 2]ZrCl 2/MAO} being a more active catalyst system for polymerization of ethylene than is either {(Cp 1,3-Bu 2 t) 2ZrCl 2/MAO} or {rac-[Me 4Si 2(CpBu 2 t) 2]ZrCl 2/MAO}.
