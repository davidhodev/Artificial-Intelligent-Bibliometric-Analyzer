Bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanacyclobutanes 1 and 3 have been prepared from the reaction of norbornene (bicyclo-[2.2.1]hept-2-ene) with precursors of” Cp2Ti=CH2” and “Cp2Ti=CHC(CH3)2CHCH2”, respectively. On thermolysis, both 1 and 3 produce products consistent with the intermediacy of a-substituted titanocene carbene compounds. Thermolysis at 65 °C in the presence of excess norbornene affords ring-opened polynorbornene with a cis to trans ratio of 38:62. The polymerizations are highly efficient in catalyst and yield polymers of controlled molecular weight. Polymer prepared from 3 shows polydispersities as low as 1.08 based on gel permeation chromatography vs. polystyrene standards. The molecular weight distributions of polymers obtained with 1 are always broader than those obtained with 3. The kinetics of both polymerizations are zero order in monomer with ΔG‡338= 24 kcal/mol, ΔH‡ = 27 kcal/mol, and ΔS‡ = 9 eu. Polymerization with 1 shows an induction period corresponding to a first-order decay of 1 with t1/2 = 80 min at 65 °C, whereas the polymerization with 3 is linear throughout. Simultaneous incorporation of norbornene-d2into the polymer by all active sites confirms that this system is best described as a living polymer. The polymerization mechanism is discussed as an olefin metathesis with rate-limiting cleavage of trisubstituted titanacyclobutanes affording high-energy carbene intermediates. © 1986, American Chemical Society.
