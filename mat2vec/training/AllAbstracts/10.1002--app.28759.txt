The polymerization of norbornene (NBE) was investigated in the presence of two novel pyrazolylimine nickel complexes [2-(C3HN2Me 2-3,5){C(Ph)=[4-R2C6H2(Ri) 2-2,6]}NiBr2 (complex 1, R1 = iPr and R2 = H; complex 2, R1 = H and R2 = NO 2)] activated by methylaluminoxane. The two catalytic systems showed high activity [up to 1.27 × 106 g of polynorbornene (PNBE)/(mol of Ni h)] for NBE polymerization and provided PNBEs with high molecular weights (weight-average molecular weight ≤ 17.46 × 105 g/mol) and narrow molecular weight distributions (ca. 2). The electron withdrawing of the nitro group in complex 2 could not enhance the catalytic activity for NBE polymerization; however, the molecular weights of the polymers were increased. The catalytic activity, molecular weight, and molecular weight distribution were influenced by the polymerization conditions, such as the polymerization temperature and Al/Ni molar ratios. The obtained PNBEs were characterized by means of 1H-NMR and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. The analysis results for PNBEs indicated that the NBE polymerization was a vinyl-type polymerization rather than a ring-opening metathesis polymerization. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
