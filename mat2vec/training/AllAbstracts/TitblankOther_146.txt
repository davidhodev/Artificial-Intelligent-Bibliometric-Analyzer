Â© 2011, Societa Chimica Italiana.The main synthetic strategies for the synthesis of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) are reviewed together with the main functionalization reactions of EDOT described to date. The different synthetic strategies employed for the functionalization of EDOT have been divided into two main types, namely: (i) modifications in the ethylene bridge of EDOT and (ii) basic reactions in the ethylene bridge of EDOT. Therefore the main emphasis is placed upon the use of chemical synthesis for the development of EDOT derivatives and not in their properties and applications which have been already revised in different reviews and monographies which are referenced along the review.
