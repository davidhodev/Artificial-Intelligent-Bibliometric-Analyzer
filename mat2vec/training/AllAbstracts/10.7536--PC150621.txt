The micro- and nano-reactor could provide a nano-sized reaction environment, so that reaction occurred in that environment is influenced by nano-confined space. Finally the resulting product with special structure is obtained. There are also many micro- and nano-reactor carriers with confined space for olefin polymerization. The carriers play a double role in the polymerization not only being the catalyst's carrier but also providing a confined geometry in which the polymerization reaction can occur. With the effect of nano scale the process of olefin polymerization changes, so that some polyolefin products with special structure and properties (such as high melting point, high molecular weight, and fibrous) will be obtained. In this paper, we mainly focus on recent research on olefin polymerization in confined space, and classify them according to different types of polymer structure, and then the influence of confined space on the morphology of the polyolefin product, the polymerization kinetic and activity, the primary structure of the product, the secondary structure of the product, the condensed matter structure and the property of the product are relatively introduced. Finally, the researches on olefin polymerization in confined space are also prospected.
