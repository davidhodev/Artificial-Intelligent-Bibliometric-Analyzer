The new polymer presents a p-doping process with anion exchange and its electrochemical reduction with cation exchange during potential cycling. Stored specific charges of 38 mAh g -1 for the polymer reduction and 13 mAh g -1 for its oxidation make the material very promising for fast charge/discharge batteries or specialised supercapacitors in which the material is also required as the anode.
