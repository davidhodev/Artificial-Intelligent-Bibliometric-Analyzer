The copolymerization of styrene with ethylene was promoted by CpTiCl 3/BDGE/Zn/MAO catalyst system combining free radical polymerization with coordination polymerization via sequential monomer addition strategy in one-pot. The effect of polymerization conditions such as temperature, time, ethylene pressure, and Al/Ti molar ratio on the polymerization performance was investigated. The hydroxy-functionalized aPS-b-random copolymer-b-PE triblock copolymer was obtained by solvent extraction and determined by GPC, DSC, WAXD, and 13C-NMR. The DSC result indicated that the aPS-b-random copolymer-b-PE had a Tg at 87°C and a Tm at 119°C which attributed to the Tg of aPS segment and the Tm of PE segment, respectively. The microstructure of the hydroxy-functionalized aPS-b-random copolymer-b-PE was further confirmed by WAXD, 13C-NMR, and 1H-NMR analysis; and these results demonstrated that the obtained block copolymer consisted of aPS segment, S-E random copolymer segment, and crystalline PE segment. The connection polymerization of the hydroxy-functionalized aPS with random copolymer-b-PE was revealed by GPC results. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
