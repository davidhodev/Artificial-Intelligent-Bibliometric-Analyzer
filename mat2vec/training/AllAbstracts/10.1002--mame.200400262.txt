Nano-polyethylene fibers and floccules were prepared under atmospheric pressure via ethylene extrusion polymerization in suit, using the SBA-15-supported Cp2ZrCl2 catalytic system. The major morphology units in the samples were fibers and floccules. The diameter of the single nano-fibers was 120-200 nm. The single nano-fibers could aggregate to form fiber aggregates and bundles. The number of PE floccules increased with extension of polymerization time, while the melting point of PE with nano-fibers was little higher than that of common polyethylene.
