The kinetics of propylene polymerization initiated by ansa-metallocene diamide compound rac-(EBI)Hf(NMe2)2 (EBI = C2H4-(indenyl)2, rac-1) were investigated. The rac-1 compound could be directly utilized for catalyst formations without converting to a dihalide or dialkyl complex in the presence or absence of methylaluminoxane (MAO). The MAO-free system rac-1/AlR3/[Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] (2) is much more effective than the rac-1/MAO catalyst. The activity of the rac-1/Al(iBu)3/2 system is much higher than that of the rac-(EBI)HfCl2/MAO or rac-(EBI)ZrCl2/MAO catalyst, and almost same as that of the rac-(EBI)Zr(NMe2)2/Al(iBu)3/2 catalyst under similar conditions. The alkylation of rac-1 to rac-(EBI)HfR2 by using AiR3 needs more time than the corresponding zirconocene analogue. The activity increases by a factor of 7 by increasing the aging time from 1 min to more than 4 h. The activity of the rac-1/AlR3/2 catalyst is very sensitive to the type and concentration of AlR3, and decreases in the order: Al(iBu)2H>Al(iBu)3>AlEt3>AlMe3. The catalyst keeps high activity in a narrow range of the [Al]/[Hf] ratio. In addition, the activity is influenced by the concentration of 2, and as a result, the maximum activity is observed when 2/rac-1 = 0.7. The activity of the rac-1/AlR3/2 catalyst is also sensitive to the polymerization temperature. The activation energies for the initiation and overall reactions are calculated as 7.61 and 7.14 kcal/mol, respectively. The properties of polymer such as isotacticity (as [mmmm]), molecular weight (MW), molecular weight distribution (MWD), melting temperature (Tm), and crystallinity are similar level with those obtained with the rac-(EBI)HfCl2/MAO system. The MW and isotacticity of the polymer produced by MAO-free system decreases monotonically as Tp increases, and MWD becomes narrow from 2.90 to 2.10 when Tp increases from 30 to 90 Â°C because of the compositional homogeneity of the polymer produced at high Tp, which is demonstrated by fractionation of the polymer. Both MW and [mmmm] values of polymers decrease as aging time and anion concentration increase.
