Vinyl functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-vinyl) are synthesized and used as monomers to prepare poly(ethylene-co-norbornene)-grafted carbon nanotube composites by in situ polymerization with [Ti(· 5-C 5Me 5)(N=C tBu 2)Cl 2] activated with methylalumoxane (MAO). The glass transition temperatures (T g) of grafted MWCNT composites are more than 30 °C higher than those of copolymers. This difference is rationalized by the immobilization of the copolymer chain to the MWCNT surface by a covalent bond. The Young's modulus is shown to increase by more than 200% compared to poly(ethylene-co-norbornene) by incorporating 3.4 wt% functionalized MWCNT. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
