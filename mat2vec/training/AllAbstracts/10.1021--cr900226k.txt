A study on electrochemistry of conducting polymers (CP), their persistent models and new concepts was reported. A central point of electrochemical research is the analysis of the doping process, which corresponds to redox reactions in the polymer matrix. Starting with the electrochemical formation mechanism of CPs, it has been clarified that oligomerization occurs in solution in front of the electrode and is preferably based on succeeding dimerization steps of ionic (radicalic) species. Deposition of the oligomers involves nucleation, growth, and solid state coupling processes. The results of the oligomer approach prove that the redox charging of conjugated systems is due to potential-dependent successive redox steps, which may overlap, causing a faradaic plateau current. Conceivable applications such as electrocatalysis, electronic devices, solar cells, or electrochromic windows are just a few challenges which have motivated researchers to refine strategies in preparing materials with tailor-made properties.
