The rare-earth metal complexes bearing NSN-bidentate β- diimidosulfonate ligands (RNSNdipp)Ln(CH2SiMe 3)2(THF)n (R = Ph, Ln = Lu (1a), n = 1, Y (1b), n = 2, Sc (1c), n = 1; R = PhNMe2, Ln = Lu (1d), n = 1) were synthesized by treatment of the ion-pairs [Ln(CH2SiMe 3)2(THF)x][BPh4] with equimolar amount of the ligand lithium salts (RNSNdipp)Li(THF)2 (NSNdipp = S(NC6H4iPr 2-2,6)2). Addition reaction between lutetium tris(alkyl)s, Ln(Z)3(THF)n and NSNdipp gave the corresponding dialkyl complexes (ZNSNdipp)Lu(Z)2(THF) n (Z = CH2SiMe3, n = 1 (1e); Z = o-CH 2C6H4NMe2, n = 0 (1f)). Deprotonation of β-imidophosphonamido ligands H-NPNdipp and H-NPNEt (NPNdipp = Ph2P(NC6H 3iPr2-2,6)2, NPNEt = PPh2(NC6H3iPr2-2,6) (NC6H4-Et-2)) with Lu(CH2SiMe3) 3(THF)2 yielded the corresponding dialkyl complexes (NPNdipp)Lu(CH2SiMe3)2(THF) (2) and (NPNEt)Lu(CH2SiMe3)2(THF) (3). All the complexes had been structurally well-defined, and 1a, 1b, 1e, 2, and 3 were further characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis where the almost planar NSN rare-earth metal unit is Cs (or pseudo Cs) symmetry with the two alkyl groups arranging on both sides and a coordinated THF against it. Upon activation with [PhMe2NH][B(C6F5) 4] and AliBu3, all these complexes exhibited high 3,4-regioselectivity (ranging from 91% to >99%) for the polymerization of isoprene. Moreover, the excellent isospecific selectivity up to mmmm > 99% have been achieved with complexes 1 depending on the electronics of the sulfur substituents to give crystalline polyisoprene with the highest Tm (170 °C) reported to date. The NPN-bidentate β-imidophosphonamide ligated rare-earth metal complexes provide both high syndio- and iso- 3,4-selectivities (3,4 > 99%, rr = 66%, mmmm = 96%) depending on the frameworks, steric environment and geometry of the ligands. The regio- and stereo- selective mechanisms proceeded in these systems were explicated by DFT simulation. © 2014 American Chemical Society.
