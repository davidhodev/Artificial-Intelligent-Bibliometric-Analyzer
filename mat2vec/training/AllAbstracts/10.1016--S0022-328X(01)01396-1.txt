The ansa-metallocene complexes C 5 H 4 )(η 5 -C 5 H 3 R)ZrC l 2 [R = Me (4), t-Bu (5)] were prepared by the reaction of the corresponding ligands with n-BuLi and MCl 4 ·2THF, respectively. The molecular structures of 1 and 2 have been determined by the X-ray diffraction method. Complexes 2-5 in combination with MAO were studied as catalysts for ethylene polymerization and all the germyl-bridged zirconocene catalysts show high activities at relative high temperatures. This indicates that the germyl-bridged zirconocene systems show thermally stable catalyst systems for polymerization of ethylene. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
