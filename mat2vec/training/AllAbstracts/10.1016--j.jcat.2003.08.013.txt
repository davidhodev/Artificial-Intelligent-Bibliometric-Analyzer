Zirconocene catalyst was heterogenized inside an organosilane-modified montmorillonite (MMT) pretreated by calcination and acidization, for supported catalyst systems with well-spaced α-olefin polymerization active centers. The varied pretreatment and modification conditions of montmorillonite are efficient for supported zirconocene catalysts in control of polyethylene microstructures, in particular, molecular weight distribution. In contrast to other supported catalyst systems, Cp2ZrCl2/modified montmorillonite(MMT-7)-supported catalysts with a distinct interlayer structure catalyzed ethylene homopolymerization and copolymerization with 1-octene activated by methylaluminoxane (MAO), resulting in polymers with a bimodal molecular weight distribution (MWD). © 2003 Elsevier Inc.
