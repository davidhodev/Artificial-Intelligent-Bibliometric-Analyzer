Polymerization of Me3SiSiHMe2, Me2HSiSiHMe2 and MeH2SiSiH2Me takes place readily in the presence of Cp2MR2 catalyst (CP = C5H5; M = Ti, Zr; R = Me, nBu) in the absence of a solvent ("polymerization in bulk") to give a mixture containing trisilanes, tetrasilanes, pentasilanes, higher oligosilanes and polysilanes. Depending on the reaction conditions different proportions of linear oligo- and poly-silanes are obtained. MeH2SiSiH2Me also yields branched oligo- and poly-silanes. Polymerization of MeH2siSiH2Me "in bulk" in the presence of a catalytic amount of Cp2MR2 (CP = C5H5; M = Ti, Zr; R = Me, nBu) leads to a new type of polysilane polymer, poly(methylsilane), (MeSiHx)n, which is thought to be the first organosilicon "living polymer". MeH2SiSiH2Me is also polymerized in inert solvents in the presence of Cp2MR2 (CP = C5H5; M = Ti, Zr; R = Me, nBu, Ph) catalysts. Â© 1991.
