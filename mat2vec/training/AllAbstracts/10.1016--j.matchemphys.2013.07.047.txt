Silver doped hydroxyapatite (HAP) [Ca9.95Ag 0.05(PO4)6(OH)2] composite coatings with natural polymer organosolv lignin (Lig) were produced by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) on titanium. Coatings were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The corrosion stability of electrodeposited coatings was evaluated in vitro in Kokubo's simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37 C using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Antimicrobial properties are directly proportional to the rate of silver ions release from the coatings, determined from inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP-AES). The obtained results are in good agreement with viability of pathogenic bacteria strain Staphylococcus aureus TL in suspension, which had completely disappeared after 24 h. Composite Ag/HAP/Lig coatings were confirmed as non-toxic for healthy immunocompetent peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
