All rights reserved.N,O-Chelated complexes of early transition metals have emerged as modular, tunable and rapidly assembled compounds for catalytic polymerization and hydrofunctionalization reactions. This simple ligand set can be installed onto reactive yttrium, titanium, zirconium and tantalum metal centers using protonolysis, or in some cases, salt metathesis reactions. The coordination chemistry of this asymmetric ligand set is ideally suited for catalysis in that these tight bite angle ligands are prone to accessing variable coordination modes and have fluxional behavior in solution phase. Consequently, advances in catalytic ring-opening polymerization, hydroamination, and hydroaminoalkylation have been realized.
