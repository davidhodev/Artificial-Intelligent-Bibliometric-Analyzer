ansa-Zirconocenes, Me 2 X(Cp)(3-TolInd)ZrCl 2 [X = C (7), Si (8); Cp = η 5 -C 5 H 5 ; Tol = p-C 6 H 4 CH 3 ] and Me 2 Si(Cp)(2-TolInd)ZrCl 2 (9), have been prepared by the reactions of ZrCl 4 with the corresponding dilithiated ligands in diethyl ether at - 78°C. The molecular structure of complex 9 has been determined by a single crystal X-ray diffraction study. Propylene polymerization has been studied for complexes 7, 8 and 9 in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO). Complex 9 reveals the highest catalytic activity of 1570kg PP/(mol Zrh atm) and the highest molecular weight of 1.2 × 10 6 among the three catalysts. Complex 9 produces atactic polypropylene (PP), whereas 7 and 8 afford PP with a weak syndiotacticity at low temperature.
