Control of butadiene insertion mode in the copolymerization of propylene with 1,3-butadiene has not been reported except our previous reports 1.2) . We reported that dialkylaluminum hydride decreased mole fraction of 1,4-inserted butadiene units by the hydroalumination of the 1,4-inserted butadiene units in main chain 3) . Introduction of hydroxy group to the main chain of the copolymer has been investigated using oxidative treatment of the Al-carbon bond. Hydroxy groups were successfully incorporated into the copolymer. The detail structure of the copolymer will be discussed, 1) T. Ishihara, T.
