Reactions with an aliphatic dicarboxylate (oxalate) as well as an aromatic dicarboxylate (terepthalate) in combination with an N,N′ donor ligand (trans-4,4′-azobispyridine) results two new coordination polymer of divalent manganese, namely {[Mn(azbpy)(H2O)4]·(bdc) ·(H2O)2}n, (1) and {[Mn(ox)(H 2O)2]·(azbpy)·(H2O) 2}n,(2). Both the coordination polymers have one dimensional structure and extended to two-dimension by means of H-bonding. Interestingly, in solid state structure, the hydrogen bonding interaction recognizes the dicarboxylate (bdc) in case of 1 and N donor ligands (azbpy) in 2. The variation in the use of dicarboxylates, creates here a huge variation in the co-ordination modes of the metal ion as well as in the supramolecular structure within the crystal of 1 and 2. The contribution of various types of non-covalent forces are quantitatively explained in the light of Hrishfield surface analysis, which justifies the role of hydrogen bonding in the recognition of the above organic linkers. A DFT calculation of NBO also gives a quantitative understanding of the formation of the solid state structure by H-bonding. A thermogravimetric analysis, solid state fluorescence spectra and EPR spectroscopic study of the complexes have also performed which also nicely corroborated their crystal structures. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
