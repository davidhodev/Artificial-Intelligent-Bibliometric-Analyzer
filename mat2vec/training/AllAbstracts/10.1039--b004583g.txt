The ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) transitions of racemic siloxy substituted ethylene bridged bis(indenyl)-type zirconocenes were studied using UV/VIS spectroscopy in combination with ab initio Hartree-Fock and hybrid density functional B3LYP methods. Clear correlations between the experimental LMCT absorption energies and theoretical HOMO-LUMO energy gaps were observed. The LMCT absorption energies were analysed as a function of the ligand structure. Hydrogenation of the indenyl ring and position of the siloxy substituent have strong influences on HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, and consequently on the observed absorption energies.
