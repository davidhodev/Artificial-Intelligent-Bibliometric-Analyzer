It has been synthesized two dinuclear metallocene complexes [(C5H5)MtCl2] [(C5H4)CMe2 (C9H6)] [(C5H5)SmCl][Mt=Zr(5), Ti(7)], which were used for ethylene polymerization with MAO as cocatalyst. Detailed study on the effect of polymerization caused by catalyst concentration, molar ratio of [Al]/[Cat], temperature and time shows that the catalytic activity of complex 7 is higher than that of the corresponding mononuclear metallocene of Cp2 TiQ2, while the catalytic activity of complex 5 is lower than that of the corresponding mononuclear met allocene of Cp2ZrCl2; The molecular weight of polyethylene produced by above two catalyst systems is somewhat decreased, and the molecular weight distribution becomes broader. With prolongation of time, the molecular weight of polyethylene obtained by complex 7 decreases, while the molecular weight of polyethylene obtained by complex 5 increases.
