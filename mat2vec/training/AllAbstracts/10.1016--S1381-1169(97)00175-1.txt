Ethene/1-octene and ethene/1-butene copolymerization using various methylaluminoxane-activated metallocene catalysts, e.g. silylene-bridged substituted bisindenyl zirconocene systems and halfsandwich titanocene, was performed at 40Â°C in toluene. The influence of the ligand substitution on comonomer incorporation, catalyst activity, molar mass, molar mass distribution, degree of polymerization and copolymerization parameters was investigated in ethene/1-octene copolymerization at constant comonomer ratio and in ethene/l-butene copolymerization as a function of varying ethene/1-butene feed mass ratios. In ethene/1-octene copolymerization the highest comonomer incorporation was achieved with MAO-activated Me2Si(Me4Cp)(N-tert-butyl)TiCl2 catalyst. Best performance in terms of comohomer incorporation combined with high catalyst activity and molar mass was found for silylene-bridged bisindenylzirconocenes, where 2-methyl substitution promoted high degree of polymerization and benzannelation accounted for improved catalyst activity, comohomer incorporation and randomness of comonomer incorporation. In ethene/1-butene copolymerization at high 1-butene feed content silylene-bridged substituted bisindenyl systems showed polymerization characteristics similar to that of ethene/1-octene copolymerization. The influence of 2-methyl substitution on activity and comohomer incorporation was significant only at low 1-butene feed content. Storage tooduli and glass transition temperature of the poly(ethene-co-l-butene) copolymers decreased with increasing 1-butene content.
