An early transition metal metallocene compound, Cp2TiCl 2, has been used as a catalyst in aqueous emulsion polymerization of methylmethacrylate to high molecular weight polymer with an anionic surfactant, sodium n-dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as emulsifier. The added surfactant has been found to play the dual role of stabilizer of the cation as well as an emulsifying agent for the monomer. Reactions with cationic (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) emulsifiers were not successful under the conditions examined. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
