Infrared and Raman Spectroscopies complement one another, both giving structural information associated with vibrational modes. As a general rule, mode assignments from small molecules can be used as guides in making IR and Raman band assignments. The infrared and Raman spectra of titanocene dichloride and squaric acid have been reported as well as other characterization data. It was our intention to employ IR and Raman data in describing the structure of the condensation product of titanocene dichloride and squaric acid to evaluate the influence on the two moieties of being in a polymer chain. Following is a brief description of the interpretation of the IR and Raman spectra of the product in the mid-IR region.
