Copolymerizations of ethylene with endo-dicyclopentadiene (DCP) were performed by using Cp2ZrCl2 (Cp = Cyclopentadienyl), Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 (Ind = Indenyl), and Ph2C(Cp)(FIu)ZrCl2 (Flu = Fluorenyl) combined with MAO as cocatalyst. Among these three metallocenes, Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 showed the highest catalyst performance for the copolymerization. From 1H-NMR analysis, it was found that DCP was copolymerized through enchainment of norbornene rings. The copolymer was then epoxidated by reacting with m-chloroperbenzoic acid. 13C-NMR spectrum of the resulting copolymer indicated the quantitative conversion of olefinic to epoxy groups.
