Different polyaromatic structures (truxene derivatives and tris(aza)pentacene) are presented as new metal-free organic photocatalysts (OPC) to promote free radical polymerization FRP and ring-opening polymerization (ROP) under halogen lamp, household LED bulb, and laser diode (405 nm). These OPCs exhibit interesting light absorption properties and lead, through an oxidative catalytic cycle, to the formation of radicals and ions that can initiate both free radical polymerization FRP and ring-opening polymerization ROP. Interestingly, excellent polymerization profiles are obtained even upon visible light exposure. Using these very soft irradiation conditions, acrylate/epoxide blends are also easily polymerized under air and lead to the formation of interpenetrated polymer networks IPN exhibiting no phase separation.
