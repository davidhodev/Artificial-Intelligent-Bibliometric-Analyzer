The preparation and crystal structure of the first group 4 ansa-metallocene with an oxygen atom directly bonded to the 2-position of an η5-indenyl moiety, rac-[ethylenebis(2-(tert-butyldimethylsiloxy)indenyl)]zirconium dichloride (3), is reported. In combination with methylaluminoxane (MAO), complex 3 polymerizes propylene to highly isotactic crystalline polypropylene (Tm = 148°C; Mw = 19 000; Mw/Mn = 2.4). Under similar conditions, the propylene polymerization activity of 3/MAO exceeds that of the conventional ansa-metallocene catalyst system (dimethylsilyl)bis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride (4)/MAO by a factor of 2 (5300 vs 2300 kg of PP/mol of Zr/h; Tp = 20°C; P(C3H6) = 2.0 bar; [Al]:[Zr] = 3 000:1). Complex 3 crystallizes in the unusual indenyl-backward conformation. The molecular structure is consistent with the expected C2 symmetry.
