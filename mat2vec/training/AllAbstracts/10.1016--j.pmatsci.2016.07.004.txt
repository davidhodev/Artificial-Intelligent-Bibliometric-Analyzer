Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd During the past few years, polysiloxanes have been extensively researched on optimizing the physical and electronic properties of organic polymer semiconductors. Polysiloxanes display their advantages including good solubility in common organic solvents, good film-forming ability, fair adhesion to various substrates and excellent resistance to thermal, chemical and irradiation degradations. In this review, we focus on the fundamental design and synthesis strategies of bonding polysiloxanes with organoelectronic groups. The characterization of polysiloxanes will be briefly introduced. Specifically, we summarize the recent advances of the utilization of polysiloxanes as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), solar cells, electrical memories and liquid crystalline materials. Finally, several perspectives related to polysiloxanes materials for organoelectronic applications are proposed based on the reported progress and our own opinion.
