A series of amino-pyrrolide ligands (1-4a) and their derivatives aminothiophene ligand (5a), amino-indole ligand (6a) were prepared. Chromium catalysts, which were generated in situ by mixing the ligands with CrCl 3(thf)3 in toluene, were tested for ethylene polymerization. The preliminary screening results revealed that the tridentate amino-pyrrolide ligands containing soft pendant donor, 3a, 4a/CrCl 3(thf)3 systems displayed high catalytic activities towards ethylene polymerization in the presence of modified methyaluminoxane. The electronic and steric factors attached to the ligand backbone significantly affected both the catalyst activity and the polymer molecular weight. Complex 4b was obtained by the reaction of CrCl3(thf)3 with one equivalent of the lithium salts of 4a, which was the most efficient ligand among the tested ones. The effect of polymerization parameters such as cocatalyst concentration, ethylene pressure, reaction temperature, and time on polymerization behavior were investigated in detail. The resulting polymer obtained by 4b display wax-like and possess linear structure, low molecular weight, and unimodal distribution. Â© 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
