Â© Scrivener Publishing LLC. All rights reserved. Thermoplastics are polymers that can be melt processed by a variety of methods including extrusion and molding. The commodity thermoplastics with the largest sales volume include the polyolefins, polystyrene and poly(vinyl chloride). Metallocene catalysts are the latest accession to the olefin polymerization catalyst category. Upon activation by methylaluminoxane (MAO), these catalysts allow the synthesis of commodity thermoplastics, especially poly(a-olefins), with a highly-defined microstructure, tacticity, and stereoregularity at high activities. A broad spectrum of properties and applications of the polyolefins can be attained with metallocenes due to their single-type sites. New copolymers, long-chain branched polymers, and polyolefin nanocomposites are now being manufactured by these highly active catalysts. This chapter weighs discrete catalysts for stereo-specific polymerization, with an emphasis on technologically important processes. The development of the metallocene catalysts from their discovery to their present state-of-the-art is portrayed. Further, the chapter covers the synthesis, properties and applications of commodity thermoplastics using these novel catalyst systems.
