In this work we report the polymerization behaviour of natural clays (montmorillonites, MMT) as activating supports. These materials have been modified by treatment with different aluminium compounds in order to obtain enriched aluminium clays and to modify the global Brönsted/Lewis acidity. As a consequence, the intrinsic structural properties of the starting materials have been changed. These changes were studied and these new materials used for ethylene polymerization using a zirconocene complex as catalyst. All the systems were shown to be active in ethylene polymerization. The catalyst activity and the dependence on acid strength and textural properties have been also studied. The behaviour of an artificial silica (SBA 15) modified with an aluminium compound to obtain a silicoaluminate has been studied, but no ethylene polymerization activity has been found yet.© 2010 by the authors.
