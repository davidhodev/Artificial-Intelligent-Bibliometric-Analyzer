Metallocene complexes Cp2TiCl2, Cp 2ZrCl2, Cp2Zr(NnBu2) 2, Cp2Ti(η 1-OC(O)C6H 5)2 and Cp2Zr(η 1-OC(O)C 6H5)2 were supported on MgCl 2/SiCl4-n (n-C6H13O)n carrier and used for ethylene polymerization. The supported complexes result in highly active catalysts when treated with different aluminum alkyl-based co-catalysts. These catalysts are able of tuning the final properties of the produced polyethylenes. Mixed composites of metallocenes and conventional Ziegler-Natta catalysts supported on the same carrier were also studied. A supported zirconocene Cp2Zr(η 1-OC(O)C 6H5)2 on MgCl2/SiCl4-n (n-C6H13O)n resulted in a highly active catalyst that eject control on the molecular weight, crystallinity and morphology of the resultant polyethylene. © 2007 VSP.
