The discovery or, in a certain extent, rediscovery of polymers possessing high electronic conductivity launched a new field of research about 30 years ago. Electrochemistry has played a significant role in the preparation and characterization of these novel materials, which has served as a basis for many advanced applications in different areas spanning from the energy technologies to the health care. In this paper is intended to give a short summary of the history of this field, and based on the achievements until now-knowing the present limitations and opportunities-the tasks for the future are also discussed. In such a recapitulation, it is appropriate to mention the researchers who substantially contributed to the development of our present knowledge on conducting polymers during the past decades.
