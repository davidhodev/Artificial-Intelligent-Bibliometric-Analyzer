Multinuclear NMR spectroscopic studies of polymerization-active species generated by activation of o-F-substituted and nonsubstituted bis(enolatoimine) titanium complexes with MAO evidence a noncovalent interaction of the o-F moieties with the metal center, which is likely to facilitate living ethylene polymerization via suppression of chain transfer and of β-hydrogen transfer processes. © 2010 American Chemical Society.
