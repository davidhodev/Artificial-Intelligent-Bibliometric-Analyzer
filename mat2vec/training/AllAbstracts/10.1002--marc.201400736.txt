KGaA, Weinheim.Propylene polymerization is carried out with a C 2-symmetric metallocene catalyst of rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2/MAO at 40 C in the presence of a cyclo-triene of trans,trans,cis-1,5,9-cyclododecatriene ((E,E,Z)-CDT). Comonomer incorporations are rather low (<0.10 mol%). However, it is shown for the first time that the comonomer causes a noticeable increase in polypropylene isotacticity (>7% in [mmmm]). (E,E,Z)-CDT is speculated to coordinate to the metal center forming comonomer-complexed active sites in charge of the entire polymerization reaction with decreased activity however increased propylene enantiomorphic selectivity. A first example of copolymerization increasing the polypropylene isotacticity is reported. Trans,trans,cis-1,5,9-cyclododecatriene is found to enhance the catalyst's stereo-selectivity when copolymerized with propylene by a rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2/MAO catalyst system, possibly by coordinating to the metal center forming a comonomer-complexed active site controlling the whole course of polymerization.
