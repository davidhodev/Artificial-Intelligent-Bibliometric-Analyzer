Zirconocene complexes carrying substituents at various positions of their ring‐bridged ligand frameworks were studied as catalysts for methylalumoxane‐activated propene polymerization. Effects of different substitution patterns on catalyst activities and on chain lengths and stereo‐ and regio‐regularities of the polymers produced are correlated with geometrical features of the complexes, e.g. with parameters describing their structural rigidity or the aperture and obliquity of their coordination gaps.
