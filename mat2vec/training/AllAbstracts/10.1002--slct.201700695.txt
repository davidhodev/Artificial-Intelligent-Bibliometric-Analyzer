Â© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim New bulky diphosphino-ferrocene 4 and diphosphino-zirconocene 8, modified with a number of tert-butyl groups, were synthesized and characterized by single crystal X-Ray and/or NMR analyses. Complex [NiCl2(4)] was prepared and its molecular structure was established by a single crystal X-Ray analysis. Buried percent volume (% VBur) of novel bulky diphosphino-ferrocene 4 was calculated to be greater than that of dppf. Because of this [NiCl2(4)] catalyst demonstrated 2.5 times higher activity compared to [NiCl2(dppf)] in the model ethylene polymerization reaction.
