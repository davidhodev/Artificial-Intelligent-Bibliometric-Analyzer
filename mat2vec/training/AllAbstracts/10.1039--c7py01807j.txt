Various half-titanocenes containing monodentate anionic nitrogen ligands, CpTiCl 2 [3-C 6 H 5 (CH 2 N)(CH 2 O)CN] (T1), CpTiCl 2 [(C 6 H 5 O)(N i Pr 2 )CN] (T2), CpTiCl 2 [1,3-(4-MeC 6 H 4 )(CH 2 N) 2 CN] (T3), CpTiCl 2 [1,3-(2,4,6-Me 3 C 6 H 2 )(CH 2 N) 2 CN] (T4), CpTiCl 2 [1,3-(2,6- i Pr 2 C 6 H 3 )(CH 2 N) 2 CN] (T5) and CpTiCl[1,3-(2,6- i Pr 2 C 6 H 3 )(CH 2 N) 2 CN][CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 CH(C 2 H 5 )COO] (T6), were synthesized and characterized. The molecular structures of T1, T2 and T5 were determined by X-ray crystallography. All the above half-titanocenes were employed as precatalysts for ethylene/propylene copolymerization after activation by methylaluminoxane (MAO) or modified MAO (MMAO). The catalytic activity and propylene incorporation into copolymers increased in the order of T1 < T2 < T3 < T4 < T5, which is attributed to the electron donating nature of the ligands. The half-titanocene containing the 2-ethylhexanoate ligand (T6) has good solubility in hexanes. An ethylene-propylene copolymer with high molecular weight (M w = 530 kg mol -1 ) could be obtained by the T6/MMAO catalytic system. The ethylene/propylene copolymerization catalyzed by the T6/TIBA/MMAO catalytic system was more controllable than that by the T5/MAO catalytic system. Importantly, both the T5/MAO and T6/TIBA/MMAO catalytic systems displayed a high catalytic activity of 2.4 × 10 6 and 2.2 × 10 6 g polymer per mol of Ti per h, respectively, even at a low Al/Ti molar ratio (Al/Ti = 300). All the values of r E × r P (r E : reactivity ratio for ethylene; r P : reactivity ratio for propylene) were around 0.9 in the copolymerization catalyzed by T2, T4, T5 and T6, indicating that nearly random ethylene-propylene copolymers could be prepared. Compared to the T5/MAO catalytic system, ethylene-propylene copolymers with higher molecular weight (M w = 381 kg mol -1 ) and higher propylene incorporation (43.6 mol%) could be produced by using the T6/TIBA/MMAO (TIBA/Ti = 50) system with a similar catalytic activity.
