The present article reviews the recent progress of half-metallocene with donor ligand(s) as catalyst for olefίn polymerization. Half-metallocene with donor ligand(s) is an important type of catalyst for olefin polymerization, and attracts more and more attentions. As a novel type of polymerization catalyst, the complex with clear structure could be synthesized in simple procedure. Using as catalyst for olefin polymerization, high activity is available, and affording polymer with high molecular weight. For olefin copolymerization, excellent copolymerization ability could be observed, and some of the obtained copolymers could not be produced by Ziegler-Natta catalyst and traditional metallocene catalyst systems. Polymerization behavior and polymer structure could be adjusted through balancing the structures of cyclopentadienyl ligand and donor ligand. The homo- and co-polymerization of ethylene and α-olefin, copolymerization of ethylene and cyclic olefin, and styrene polymerization are involved.
