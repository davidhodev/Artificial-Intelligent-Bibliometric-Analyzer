A variety of chiral and achiral zirconocene complexes were investigated for the stereoselective dehydrogenative coupling of phenylsilane. Polymerization of PhSiH3 with rac-(EBI)ZrCl2/2BuLi or Cp2Zr(H)CI yields a stereoregular polymer by 29Si NMR spectroscopy. These results suggest that the stereogenic centers of the growing polymer chain may play a role in the stereo chemistry of phenylsilane polymerization. A syndiotactic microstructure for the polyphenylsiianes is tentatively as signed on the basis of comparisons of their 29Si NMR chemical shifts with those of known stereoregular cyclic oligomers.
