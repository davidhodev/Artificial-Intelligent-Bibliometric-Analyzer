The widespread and enduring commercial success of olens derives from a combination of favorable properties: they are inexpensive, highly processible, durable, and biocompatible. Polyolens have even been described as “green polymers,” based on their low density and high recyclability, as well as their chemical simplicity (halogen-free).1.
