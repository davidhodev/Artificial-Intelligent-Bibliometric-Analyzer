Organic electrochromic materials have gained constantly increasing interest over the years with respect to their inorganic counterpart due to essentially two distinctive characteristics: their processability through solution based low cost processes and their wide colour palette. Such characteristic features enabled their application in displays, smart windows, electronic paper and ophthalmic lenses. Alongside the established concept of donor-acceptor polymers, side chain functionalized multichromophoric polymers are gaining attention as a highly performing and synthetically feasible alternative, particularly relevant to applications requiring a complete colourlessness in one of the accessible redox states of the material. The primary aim of the present article is to review all the results involving the tuning of the native electrochromic properties of simple conjugated polymers through the introduction of a discrete electrochromic molecule as a side chain substituent.
