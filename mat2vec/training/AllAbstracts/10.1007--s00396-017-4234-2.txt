© 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.A new titanium(IV) complex [TiLCl2] {LH2 = 2-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-benzylamino)-4-methysulfanyl-butyric acid} having S-, N-, and O-bearing phenoxy-amine backbones has been synthesized and investigated for its efficient role in aqueous emulsion polymerization of polar olefins, methylacrylate and methylmethacrylate at ambient temperature. The catalyst microstructure has been supported by elemental analysis, 1H and 13C NMR, IR, and UV–visible spectroscopy. The catalyst is easy to synthesize and found to be moderately stable in water. Upon activation with BPh4 −, the activity of the complex as single-site catalytic species has been found to be high (in the order of 104 g mol−1 h−1) producing syndiotactic rich high molecular weight polymers with low molecular weight distribution (PDI values in the range of 1.2–1.4). Structure and molecular properties of the synthesized polymers were determined by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, gel permeation chromatography, and DSC analysis. DSC analysis reveals that the polymer product obtained is semi-crystalline with sharp melting temperature at 286.9 °C (Tm). Kinetic parameters such as rate constant and activation energy of polymethylmethacrylate have also been studied, and the value of Eapp has been found to be 58.842 kJ mol−1 only. The lower value can be interpreted as a consequence of a high catalytic activity of the complex. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
