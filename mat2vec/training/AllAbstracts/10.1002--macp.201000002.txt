New initiating systems for the thermal cationic polymerization of epoxides and vinyl ether derivatives are proposed. They are based on a silane/silver salt interaction, which ensures a good to excellent polymerization at room temperature. Moreover, the polymerization is much more efficient under air. The effects of the silane, silver salt, and monomer structures are investigated. Interestingly, silver nanoparticles Ag(0) are formed in situ. A coherent picture of the involved chemical mechanisms is presented. Â© 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
