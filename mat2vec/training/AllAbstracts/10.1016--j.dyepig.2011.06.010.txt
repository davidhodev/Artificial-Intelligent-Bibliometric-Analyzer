New symmetrical bicationic polymethine dyes were synthesized and their spectroscopic and electrochemical properties were described. The bichromophoric dyes (benzothiazole, benzoxazole, indolinium derivatives) were investigated as sensitizers in the free radical photopolymerization initiated by their borate salts. The obtained kinetic results shown that bicationic polymethine dyes as the organoborate salts are much efficient photoinitiating systems of acrylate monomers polymerization than monocationic parent dyes. The rate of polymerization depends on ΔGET of electron transfer from borate anion to the excited singlet state of bicationic polymethine dye. The relationship between the rate of polymerization and the free energy of electron transfer process shows the dependence predicted by the classical theory of electron transfer. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
