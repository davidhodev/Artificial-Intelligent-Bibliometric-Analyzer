A series of group 4 metal complexes were synthesized by an equimolar reaction of M(CH2Ph)4 with (E)-2, 4-di-tert-butyl-6-[(phenylimino)methyl]phenol bearing donor functionality. This process involved toluene elimination followed by an intramolecular migration reaction of one benzyl group from metal to the imino carbon, which was supported by the isolation and structural characterization of the intermediate. These new complexes were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analyses and X-ray analyses. The titanium complexes showed a very high activity in both ethylene polymerization and ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization upon activation with modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), whereas the corresponding zirconium and hafnium complexes were almost inactive under the same reaction conditions.
