New photoinitiating systems based on a polyoxometalate (POM) are proposed: phosphomolybdic acid in combination with silane, germane, or iodonium salt can be used to generate silyl, germyl, or phenyl radicals as well as silylium cations. The photochemical mechanisms are studied by steady-state photolysis and electron spin resonance. The phosphomolybdic acid/silane/iodonium salt system can initiate either the radical photopolymerization of acrylates or the cationic photopolymerization of epoxides. The synthesis of interpenetrated polymer networks can also be carried out. The mechanical properties of the synthesized polymers are affected by the presence of POM in the matrix, as shown by their dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
