In this paper, polymer sulfanilic acid (PABSA)/AuNPs/glassy carbon electrode (GCE), polymer acid chrome blue K (PACBK)/AuNPs/GCE and polymer aspartic acid (PASP)/PtNPs/GCE were fabricated for the identification of the wine age of rice wines with pattern recognitions. The sensitivity of those modified electrodes was exhibited by cyclic voltammetry, and the parameters of electrochemical behaviors was optimized and confirmed gradually. The original responses were recorded by chronoamperometry with multi-frequency rectangle pulse voltammetry and multi-frequency staircase pulse voltammetry, and the feature data correlated with the wine age were extracted from original responses by ‘area method’. Based on the feature data, principal component analysis (PCA, unsupervised method), locality preserving projections (LPP, semi-supervised method) and differential financial analysis (DFA, supervised method) were applied for the classification of rice wine samples with different marked age, and DFA exhibited the most clear result; least squares support vector machines (LSSVM) and library for support vector machines (LIBSVM) were applied for the prediction of the wine ages, and LIBSVM worked better than LSSVM, the correlations based on the training and testing dataset were R2 = 0.9999 and R2 = 0.9998, respectively. In conclusion, the CPs/NMNPs/GCEs with pattern recognitions were powerful tools to identify the marked ages of rice wines.
