A comprehensive account of the synthesis, properties, and evaluation of a wide range of ethylene homopolymerization catalysts derived from imido titanium compounds supported by the triazacyclic ligands Me3[9]aneN 3 and R3[6]aneN3 is described (Me 3[9]aneN2 -1,4,7-trimethyltriazacyclononane; R 3[6]aneN3 = 1,3,5-trimethyl- or 1,3,5-tris(n-dodecyl) triazacyclohexane). Conventional preparative-scale reactions afforded the triazacycle-supported imido titanium compounds Ti(NR)(Me3[9]aneN 3)Cl2 (R = tBu (1), 2,6-C6H 3Me2, 2,6-C6H3iPr 2, Ph, C6F5, or CH2Ph (6)). Solid phase-supported analogues of 1 and 6 (linked by either the macrocycle or imido ligand to a 1% cross-linked polystyrene support) and representative Me 3[6]aneN3 solution phase systems Ti(NR)(R 3[6]aneN3)Cl2 (R = Me or n-dodecyl) were also synthesized. At ambient temperature, solution phase Me3[9]aneN 3 catalyst systems were more active for ethylene polymerization (methyl aluminoxane (MAO) cocatalyst) than their solid phase-supported or Me3[6]aneN3 analogues. A library of 41 other triazacyclononane-supported catalysts was prepared by the semiautomated, sequential treatment of Ti(NMe2)2Cl2 with RNH2 and Me3[9]aneN3. The ethylene polymerization capabilities of 46 compounds of the type Ti(NR)(Me 3[9]aneN3)Cl2 were evaluated at 100°C (MAO cocatalyst) and compared in representative cases to the corresponding productivities at ambient temperature. Whereas either bulky N-alkyl or N-aryl imido substituents in the compounds Ti(NR)(Me3[9]aneN 3)Cl2 were sufficient to give highly active catalysts at ambient temperature, only those with bulky N-alkyl groups excelled at 100°C. Polymer end group analysis indicated that polymeryl chain transfer to both AlMe3 and ethylene monomer is an active mechanism in these systems. The use of MAO pretreated with BHT-H (BHT-H = 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol) led to higher productivites, increased polymer molecular weights, and more polymer chain unsaturations, but productivity decreased when a large excess of BHT-H was used. The reactions of the well-defined alkyl species Ti(N tBu)(Me3[9]aneN3)Me2, [Ti(N tBu)(Me3[9]aneN3)-Cu-Me)2AlMe 2]+, and [Ti(NtBu)(Me3[9]aneN 3)Me]+ with BHT-H were examined, and the aryloxide compound [Ti(NtBu)(Me3[9]aneN3)(BHT)][BAr 4F] was isolated (ArF = C6F 5). The X-ray structures of Ti(NR)(Me3[9]aneN 3)Cl2 (R = tBu, 2,6-C6H 3Me2, 2,6-C6H3Pr2, Ph, C6F5) and Ti(NR)(Me3[6]aneN3)Cl 2 (R = 2,6-C6H3iPr2, Ph, C6F5) are reported. The perfluorophenyl imido titanium compounds both exhibit well-defined supramolecular structures based on C⋯F intermolecular interactions. © 2006 American Chemical Society.
