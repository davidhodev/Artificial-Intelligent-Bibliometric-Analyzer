Five azo-functionalized coordination polymers (CPs), namely, [Zn(azbpy)(NO 2 -bdc)·H 2 O] n (1), [Zn(azbpy)(NO 2 -bdc)] n ·3H 2 O (2), {[Cd(azbpy)(NO 2 -bdc)·H 2 O]·2H 2 O} n (3), {[Mn(azbpy) 2 (NO 2 -bdc)] 2 } n (4), and {[Co(azbpy)(NO 2 -bdc)(H 2 O) 2 ][Co(azbpy) 0.5 (NO 2 -bdc)(H 2 O) 3 ]} n (5) have been synthesized using different transition metal salts with 5-nitro-1,3-benzenedicarboxylate (NO 2 -bdc 2- ) and 4,4′-azobispyridine (azbpy) ligand using a slow diffusion technique at room temperature. The complexes 1-5 were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy (IR), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In the solid state, compound 1 shows a wavy one-dimensional (1D) ladder; constructed through the N,N′-donor azbpy and NO 2 -bdc 2- ligands with the metal centers, whereas compound 2 exhibits a bilayer two-dimensional (2D) sheet containing a wavy 1D ladder of metal-carboxylate, and compound 3 shows a stairlike wavy 2D sheet. Compound 4 exhibits a novel 2-fold interdigitated 2D sheet of two similar layers containing pendent azbpy ligands, whereas compound 5 displays a polythreaded 2D structure with an intercalated 1D chain into the pore. The solid state luminescence properties of 1-3 along with free N,N′-donor azbpy ligand have been performed at room temperature, where all the complexes 1-3 show azbpy ligand based luminescence property. The gas and solvent vapor adsorption study have been performed for compounds 2-4, and the dehydrated frameworks of compounds 2-4 exhibit selective CO 2 adsorption at 195 K over N 2 (at both 77 and 195 K) due to the strong interactions between polar pore walls of dehydrated frameworks with the CO 2 molecule having quadruple moment.
