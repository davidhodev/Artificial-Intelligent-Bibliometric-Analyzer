A new organic-inorganic hybrid ligand H2C(C5Me 4H)(C2B10H11) (2) has been prepared. A selective deboration reaction with piperidine in ethanol resulted in the isolation of [Me3NH][H2C(C5Me 4H)(C2B9H11)] (3). An amine-elimination reaction of 3 with [Zr(NMe2)4] produced a neutral metal-amide complex [η5:η5-H 2C(C5Me4)(C2B9H 10)]Zr(NMe2)(NHMe2) (4). The double-ring-opening reaction of 4 with tetrahydrofuran (THF) afforded [η5:η5-H2C(C5Me 4)(C2B9H10)]Zr (OCH 2CH2CH2CH2)2N(CH 3)2 (5). Treatment of the trianionic salt of 3 with [MCl4(thf)2] gave complexes [{η5: η5-H2C(C5Me4)(C 2B9H10)}M(Iμ-Cl)2][Li(thf) 2] (M=Zr (6), Hf (7)). Reaction of 6 with LiCH2TMS generated the ionic species [{η5:η5-H 2C(C5Me4)(C2B9H 10)}Zr(CH2TMS)2][Li(thf)3] (9). Interaction of complex 6 with KCH2(NMe2)-o-C 6H4 led to the formation of the neutral metal alkyl complex [η5:η5-H2C(C5Me 4)(C2B9H10)]Zr[σ:σ- CH2(NMe2)-o-C6H4] (10). All complexes have been fully characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and elemental analyses. Some were further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analyses. Metall-o-Mix: A series of mixed-metallocene Group 4 metal chloride/amide/oxide/alkyl complexes bearing a CH2-bridged ligand [H2C(C5Me4)(C2B9H 10)]3- have been prepared and structurally characterized. Their catalytic activity towards ethylene polymerization was examined. Copyright © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
