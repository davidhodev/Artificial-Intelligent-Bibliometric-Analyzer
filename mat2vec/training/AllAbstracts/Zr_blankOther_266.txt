The oligomerization of ethylene catalyzed by Cp2ZrL2 (L = Cl, Me, OC6H4-p-Me)/EAO (ethylaluminoxane) afforded not only common chain oligomers but also methylenecyclopentane. It is the first example of oligomerization and simultaneous cyclization of ethylene to a cyclic oligomer. The selectivity of methylenecyclopentane, affected by the structure and the concentration of precatalysts, solvents, aging and reaction temperature and some other factors, came up to 37% when a third-component C5H5N was added to the Cp2ZrCl2/EAO system under optimal conditions.
