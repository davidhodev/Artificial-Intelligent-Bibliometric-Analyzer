Zirconocene complexes carrying sterically bulky tri-substituted cyclopentadienyl ligands, (Î·5-4-R-1,2-Ph2C5H2)2ZrCl2 [R = phenyl (3), cyclohexyl (4)], were synthesized by the reaction of ZrCl4 with lithio salt of 1,2,4-triphenylcyclopentadiene (1) or 4-cyclohexyl-1,2-diphenylcyclopentadiene (2), respectively. The single-crystal X-ray structure analysis reveals that both complexes crystallize in C2-symmetric conformation in solid state. When activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO), complexes 3 and 4 polymerize ethylene with moderate activities to produce ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylenes with high melting transition temperatures at low Al/Zr ratios. Under ambient conditions, both systems of 3-MAO and 4-MAO show relatively high activities in propylene oligomerization. The molecular weight of the polypropylene produced from the 3-MAO system is lower than that from the 4-MAO system. In comparison with 4, complex 3 is more active in both ethylene and propylene polymerization. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.
