The synthesis and characterization of various symmetric dinuclear metallocene complexes is described. After activation with different cocatalysts, such as methylalumoxane (MAO), [CPh3]+ [B(C 6F5)4 ]- or B(C6F 5)3, the resulting catalysts are used for the homogeneous polymerization of propylene. The performance of the various catalysts and the extent of stereoselectivity of the polymerization is dependent on the nature of the corresponding cocatalyst. Â© 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.
