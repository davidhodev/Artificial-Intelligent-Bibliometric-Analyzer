Â© 2017 by the authors. A series of constrained geometry O-functionalized cyclopentadienylchromium complexes (1-6) and a S-functionalized cyclopentadienylchromium complex (7) were first synthesized, characterized, and tested as catalyst precursors for the olefin polymerization. In the presence of MAO, the complexes exhibited high catalytic activity for the polymerization of ethylene. It is shown that ligand variations can have a substantial effect on catalyst activity and stability. The effect of Al/Cr ratio on catalytic activity was also studied.
