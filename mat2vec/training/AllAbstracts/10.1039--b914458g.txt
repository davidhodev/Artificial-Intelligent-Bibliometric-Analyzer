Reaction of the amido-bridged zirconium complex (CpSiMe 2NSiMe2Cp)ZrCH3 (1) (Cp = C5H 4) with half an equivalent of B(C6F5) 3 or Ph3CB(C6F5)4 afforded the binuclear zirconium complexes [(CpSiMe2NSiMe 2Cp)Zr)2(μ-CH3)][RB(C6F 5)3] (2a, R = CH3, 2b, R = C6F 5) with a methyl group as the bridge between the two zirconium atoms. In the presence of one equivalent of B(C6F5)3 or Ph3C(C6F5)4, 1 was transformed to the zwitterionic complexes [(CpSiMe2NSiMe2Cp)Zr] [RB(C6F5)3] (3a, R = CH3, 3b, R = C6F5) which are free of a metal-bound σ-alkyl ligand. 2b is stable with Me3Al while 3b combined with Me 3Al to form a hetero-binuclear complex [(CpSiMe2NSiMe 2Cp)Zr(μ-CH3)]Al(CH3)2][B(C 6F5)4] (4) as shown by NMR spectroscopy at room temperature. Treatment of 2a or 3a with an excess of Me3Al led to (CpSiMe2NSiMe2Cp)Zr(C6F5) (5) through a group exchange process. 2b, 3a and 5 have been characterized by X-ray diffraction studies. 2a, 2b, 3a and 3b were highly active catalysts for ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with 1-octene in the presence of trialkylaluminium, but the binuclear zirconium complexes (2a and 2b) showed higher activities than their mononuclear counterparts 3a and 3b. Polymerization activities varied with the trialkylaluminiums and increased with the trialkylaluminium concentration applied in the system. The product existed mainly in the form of Al(PE)3 with polymeric chains, and its molecular weight and distribution were greatly influenced by the type and amount of trialkylaluminium applied in the catalytic system. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
