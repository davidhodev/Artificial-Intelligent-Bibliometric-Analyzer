The monomeric (DPPDT) and polymeric (PDQT) diketopyrrolopyrrole-thiophene derivatives combined with an iodonium salt or an amine (and optionally an additive) are used as photoinitiating systems to initiate the cationic polymerization of epoxides or divinyl ethers, radical polymerization of acrylates and thiol-ene polymerization under different irradiation sources (i.e. very soft halogen lamp, laser diodes at 473 nm, 532 nm and 808 nm). The DPPDT based systems are very efficient upon the green light exposure. Remarkably, these systems are characterized by a higher efficiency than references based on camphorquinone, a well known photosensitizer for visible light. The photochemical mechanisms are studied by steady state photolysis, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, laser flash photolysis and electron spin resonance spin trapping techniques.
