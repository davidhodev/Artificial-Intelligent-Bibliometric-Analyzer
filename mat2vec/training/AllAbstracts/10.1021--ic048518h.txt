One new conjugated symmetric fulvene ligand L1 and two new unsymmetric fulvene ligands L2 and L3 were synthesized. Five new supramolecular complexes, namely Ag2(L1)3(SO3CF3)3 (1) (1, monoclinic, P21lc; a = 12.702(3) Å, b = 26.118(7) Å, c = 13.998(4) Å, β = 96.063(4)°, Z= 4), [Ag(L1)]ClO 4 (2) (monoclinic, C2/c; a = 17.363(2) Å, b = 13.2794(18) Å, c= 13.4884(18) Å, β = 100.292(2)°, Z = 8), [Ag(L1)(C6H6)SbF6]·0.5C 6H6·H2O (3) (monoclinic, P2 1/c; a = 6.8839(11) Å, b = 20.242(3) Å, c = 18.934(3) Å, β = 91.994(3)°, Z = 4), Ag(L2)(SO3CF3) (4) (triclinic, P1; a = 8.629(3) Å, b = 10.915(3) Å, c = 11.178(3) Å, α = 100.978(4)°, β = 91.994(3)°, γ = 105.652(4)°, Z = 2), and Ag(L3)(H2O)(SO3CF 3) (5) (triclinic, P1; a = 8.914(5) Å, b = 10.809(6) Å, c = 11.283(6) Å, α = 69.255(8)°, β = 87.163(9)°, γ = 84.993(8)°, Z = 2) were obtained through self-assembly based on these three new fulvene ligands in a benzene/toluene mixed-solvent system. Compounds 1-5 have been fully characterized by infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The results indicate that the coordination chemistry of new fulvene ligands is versatile. They can adopt either cis- or trans-conformation to bind soft acid Ag(I) ion through not only the terminal -CN and furan functional groups but also the fulvene carbon atoms into organometallic coordination polymers or discrete complexes. In addition, the luminescent properties of L1-L3 and their Ag(I) complexes were investigated preliminarily in EtOH and solid state. © 2005 American Chemical Society.
