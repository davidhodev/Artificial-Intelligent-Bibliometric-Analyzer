Structurally well-defined end functionalized isotactic polypropylene (iPP) is prepared by conducting a selective chain transfer reaction during the isospecific polymerization of propylene in the presence of norbornadiene (NBD) and hydrogen using rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2 ZrCl 2/MAO as the catalyst. The production of NBD-capped iPP involves a unique consecutive chain transfer reaction, first to NBD and then to hydrogen, for situating the incorporated NBD at the iPP chain end. The NBD end group of NBD-capped iPP can be converted into other reactive functional group through functional group transformation reactions. The resulting functional group end-capped iPP can be used for the construction of stereoregular block copolymers (e.g., iPP-b-PMMA and iPP-b-PS) through postpolymeriztion reactions.
