A series of dinuclear half-titanocenes with polymethylene and xylene as a bridge between two cyclopentadienyls have been synthesized and polymerization behavior of these complexes has been exploited. It was found that the activity of the dinuclear half-titanocene showed a clear tendency according to the bridge length, bridge structure, and substituent group at titanium metal. The presence of not only long methylene units but also xylene unit between two active sites contributed significantly to increase the activity of dinuclear half-titanocenes. Aryloxy substitution at titanium caused to facilitate the polymerization activity. On the other hand arylamine substitution at titanium exhibited a positive impact on thermal stability of the catalyst. It has been found that presence of xylene bridge is clearly effective to produce syndiotactic polystyrene (SPS) with high crystallinity but low molecular weight. All the results indicate the implication that not only the electronic factor but also the steric factor caused by the bridge nature of the dinuclear half-titanocene exerts considerably an influence on the polymerization behavior of the catalysts.
