Several titanium isopropoxide complexes [N,N′-bis(2-oxo-3-R 1-5-R2-phenylmethyl)-N,N′-bis(methylene-p-R 3-C6H4)-ethylenediamine]Ti(O iPr)2 [R1 = t-Bu, R2 = Me, R 3 = H (1b); R1 = R2 = t-Bu, R3 = H, (2b); R1 = R2 = Cl, R3 = H, (3b), R1 = t-Bu, R2 = Me, R3 = Cl (4b); R1 = R 2 = t-Bu, R3 = Cl, (5b); R1 = R2 = R3 = Cl, (6b)] supported over sterically demanding aryloxy based [N2O2]H2 ligands have been designed as precatalysts for the ethylene polymerization. Specifically, the 1b-6b complexes, when treated with methylaluminoxane (MAO) under 88 ± 0.5 psi of ethylene at 30 °C for 3 h, produced polyethylene polymers of high molecular weight (Mw = ca. 7.2-8.3 × 105 g mol-1) having broad molecular weight distribution (PDI = ca. 13.1-14.6). The 1b-6b complexes were conveniently synthesized from the direct reaction of the [N 2O2]H2 ligands, 1a-6a, with Ti(O iPr)4 in 69-86% yield. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010.
