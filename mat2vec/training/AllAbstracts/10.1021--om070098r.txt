The synthesis and characterization of new halo-silyl-substituted titanium(IV) derivatives [TiCl3(η5-C5H 4SiCl3)] (9), [TiCl3(η5-C 5H4SiMe2F)] (10), [TiCl3(η 5-C5H4SiMeF2)] (11), [TiCl 3(η5-C5H4SiF3)] (12), and [TiF3(η5-C5H4SiMe 2F)] (13) are reported. The reaction of lithiated trimethylsilylcyclopentadienide with Me2SiCl2, MeSiCl 3, or SiCl4 gave chlorosilyl(trimethylsilyl) cyclopentadienes that were fluorinated with Me3SnF to yield fluorosilyl derivatives C5H4(SiMe2F)SiMe 3 (4), C5H4(SiMeF2)SiMe3 (5), and C5H4-(SiF3)SiMe3 (6), respectively. Addition of disilylated compounds 4-6 to a solution of TiCl 4 gave the respective half-sandwich titanium complexes 10-12, which could be alternatively prepared by selective fluorination of the corresponding chlorosilyl-substituted cyclopentadienyltitanium(IV) trichlorides with Me 3SnF. Completely fluorinated [TiF3(C5H 4SiMe2F)] (13) was prepared from [TiCl3(C 5H4SiMe2Cl)] (7) and 4 equiv of Me 3SnF. The molecular structures of the pentameric 13 and the monomeric 10 were determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. The 47,49Ti NMR and UV-vis spectroscopy showed the electron-releasing nature of the SiMe 2Cl, SiMe2F, SiMeCl2, and SiMeF2 substituents, whereas SiCl3 and SiF3 groups had electron-withdrawing properties. The catalytic behavior of these half-sandwich titanium compounds in styrene polymerization was studied in the presence of excess methylaluminoxane. © 2007 American Chemical Society.
