The 4-fulvenyl[2.2]paracyclophane (1) was transformed, by treatment with lithium aluminium hydride and methyllithium in tetrahydrofuran, to the corresponding cyclopentadienyl anions 6 and 8, respectively. The iron complex 7 was prepared from 6, while 8 was converted into the metal complexes 9 (Fe complex), 10 (Ti), 11 (Zr), 12 (Ti), and 13 (Zr). All new metallocene complexes were characterized by their spectroscopic data. In addition, a single crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis was performed for complex 11. The metallacyclic zirconocene complex 15 was synthesized by the reaction of the dichloride derivative 13 with two equivalents of n-butyllithium. After activation of complexes 10-13 and 15 with methylalumoxane (MAO) they were used for the catalytic polymerization of ethene and propene.
