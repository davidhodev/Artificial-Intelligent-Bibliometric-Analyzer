One-pot reaction of LnCl3 with 1 equivalent of C 5Me4SiMe2NC4H8Li followed by addition of 2 equivalents of allylmagnesium chloride C3H 5MgCl or LiN(SiHMe2)2 in THF at room temperature afforded the half-sandwich rare-earth-metal bis(η3- allyl) complexes (C5Me4SiMe2NC 4H8)Ln(η3-C3H5) 2 (Ln = Sc (1), Y (2), Lu (3)) and the half-sandwich rare-earth-metal bis(silylamide) complexes (C5Me4SiMe2NC 4H8)Ln[N(SiHMe2)2]2 (Ln = Sc (4), Y (5), Lu (6)), respectively. All these complexes were well-characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The binary catalyst systems 1-3/[Ph 3C][B(C6F5)4] and the ternary catalyst systems 1-6/[Ph3C][B(C6F5) 4]/AliBu3 in toluene at room temperature showed activity toward the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.
