Schiff base was prepared via condensation of ethanedihydrazide with 2-hydroxy benzaldehyde and further this monomeric Schiff base polymerize with formaldehyde and barbituric acid and form polymeric Schiff base (PLSB) ligand. The ligand and its polymer metal complexes were characterized by using elemental analysis, IR, UV-VIS, 1HNMR, magnetic susceptibility and thermogravimetric studies. On basis of elemental analysis and spectral studies, six coordinated geometry was assigned for Mn(II), Co(II) and Ni(II) complexes and four coordinated for Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes. PLSB act as a tetradentate and coordinate through the azomethine nitrogen and phenolic oxygen. The thermal behavior of these polymer metal complexes showed that the hydrated complexes losses water molecules of hydration in the first step followed immediately by decomposition of the anions and ligand molecules in the subsequent steps. The (PLSB) ligands and its polymer metal complexes were screened against bacterial species Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and fungal species Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, A. niger. The activity data show that the metal complexes were more potent than the parent Schiff bases. Â© 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
