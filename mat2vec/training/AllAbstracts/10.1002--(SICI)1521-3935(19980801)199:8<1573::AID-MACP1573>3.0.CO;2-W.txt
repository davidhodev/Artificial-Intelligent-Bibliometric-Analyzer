Four non-bridged dimethylzirconocene complexes, i.e., bis(η5-cyclopentadienyl)dimethylzirconium (1), (η5-cyclopentadienyl) (η5-fluorenyl)dimethylzirconium (2), bis(η5-indenyl)dimethylzirconium (3) and (η5-cyclopentadienyl)(η 5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)dimethylzirconium (4) were synthesized and used as a catalyst for the methyl methacrylate polymerization combined with triphenylmethyl tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate in the presence of ZnEt2 or Al(i-Bu)3. The catalyst activity strongly depends on the zirconocene compound and decreases in the order 2 > 1 > 3 ≫ 4. The polymerization proceeds in a living manner when 1 and 2 are used combined with ZnEt2. On the other hand, stereoregularities of the resulting polymers are independent of the zirconocene compound, and syndiotactic-rich polymers are formed by a chain-end controlled mechanism.
