The present study focused on the application of mixed TiO 2-SiO2-supported methylaluminoxane (MAO) with a zirconocene catalyst on the linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) production. At low concentrations of TiO2 present in the mixed supports, it revealed that TiO2 was decorated on the SiO2 surface and acted as a spacer to anchor MAO to the SiO2 surface resulting in less steric hindrance and less interaction. As a result, catalytic activities via ethylene/1-olefin copolymerization apparently increased with the presence of TiO2. Besides increased activities, the presence of TiO2 in the mixed supports can result in a slightly lower molecular weight (MW) of polymers, suggesting a higher chain transfer rate.
