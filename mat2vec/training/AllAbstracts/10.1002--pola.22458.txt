Norbornene polymerization using the commercially available and inexpensive catalyst system, cyclopentadienylzirconium trichloride (CpZrCl3) and isobutyl-modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), were carried out over a wide range of polymerization temperatures and monomer concentrations. For the CpZrCl 3 catalyst system activated by aluminoxane with a 40 mol % methyl group and a 60 mol % isobutyl group (MMAO40/60), the polymerization temperature and monomer concentration significantly affected the molecular weight (M n) of the obtained polymer and the catalytic activity. With an increase in the polymerization temperature from 0 to 27 °C, the catalytic activity and Mn increased, but these values dramatically decreased with the increasing polymerization temperature from 27 to 70 °C, meaning that the most suitable temperature was 27 °C The CpZrCl 3ZMMAO40/60 ([AlMZr] = 1000) catalyst system with the [NB] of 2.76 mol L-1 at 27 °C showed the highest activity of 145 kg molzr -1 h-1 and molecular weight of 211,000 g mol-1. The polymerization using the CpZrCl3/MMAPO 40/60 catalyst system proceeds through the vinyl addition mechanism to produce atactic polynorbornene, which was soluble in chloroform, toluene, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene, but insoluble in methanol. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
