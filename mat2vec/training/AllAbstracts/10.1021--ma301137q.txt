We report a method for the synthesis of multisegmented polycarbonate graft copolymers. Using a β-diiminate zinc catalyst with a norbornene carboxylate initiator, we achieved living block copolymerizations of functionalized cyclohexene oxides and CO 2, yielding norbornenyl-terminated macromonomers with variable block sequences. Subsequent ring-opening metathesis polymerization of the norbornenyl-terminated macromonomers produced segmented graft copolymers. This method provides a facile route to core-shell structures with readily controllable molecular parameters. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
