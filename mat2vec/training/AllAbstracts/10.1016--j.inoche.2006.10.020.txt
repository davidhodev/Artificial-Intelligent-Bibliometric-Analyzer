A series of polymer-supported unbridged metallocene dichloride catalysts, Cp″CpMCl2 (where Cp″ = C5Me4H and M = Ti or Zr) have been prepared. These catalysts have been characterised in detail and have shown promising activity in ethylene polymerisation under extremely mild conditions. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
