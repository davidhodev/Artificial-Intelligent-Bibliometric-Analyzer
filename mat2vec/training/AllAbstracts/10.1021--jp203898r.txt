Ultrathin films of poly[N-(2-cyanoethyl)pyrrole] and poly(N-methylpyrrole) and their composites with Au nanoparticles were used for the electrochemical detection of small concentrations (10 mM-100 μM) of dopamine, a neurotransmitter related with neurological disorders. Results indicated that Au nanoparticles improve the sensing abilities of the two polymers, even though they are not essential to obtain effective and fast responses toward the presence of dopamine. Furthermore, although both polymers have been found to be highly sensitive to low concentrations of dopamine, the response of poly[N-(2-cyanoethyl)pyrrole] is better and more effective than the response of poly(N-methylpyrrole). Experimental results were corroborated with quantum mechanical calculations on model systems, which also indicated that the interaction of oxidized dopamine with poly[N-(2-cyanoethyl)pyrrole] is stronger than that with poly(N-methylpyrrole). This behavior has been attributed to two different factors: (i) the flexibility of the cyanoethyl groups, which allows maximize the number of attractive van der Waals interactions, and (ii) the dipole of the cyano group, which interacts favorably with the dipole of the C=O bonds of oxidized dopamine. Finally, theoretical results were used to propose an atomistic model that explains the interaction behavior between the oxidized dopamine and the conducting polymers. © 2011 American Chemical Society.
