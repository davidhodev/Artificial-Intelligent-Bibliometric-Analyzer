A new dialkylzirconocene type of complex, (1,2-ph2-4-MeCp)2ZrMe2(2), was synthesized by reaction of (1,2-Ph2-4-MeCp)2ZrCl2(1) and with 2 equivalent of methyl lithium at -78Â°C. Complex 2 was characterized by elemental analysis, 1H NMR and 13C NMR. The structure of complex 2 was determined by single crystal X-ray structural analysis. Upon activation with Al(iBu)3/Ph3C+ B(C6F5)4 -, complex 2 showed a high catalytic activity for the ethylene polymerization reaction at lower n(Al)/n(Zr) ratios and high molecular weight polyethylene samples with high melting transition temperatures were produced. The polyethylene samples were characterized by molecular weight determination, DSC and XRD analysis.
