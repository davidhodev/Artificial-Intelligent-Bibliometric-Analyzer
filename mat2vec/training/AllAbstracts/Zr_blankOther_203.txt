The kinetics of propylene polymerization initiated by the homogeneous catalytic system (2-p-TolInd)2Zr(CH3)2-Al(i-Bu) 3 was studied. It was shown that the initiation of polymerization takes place in the coordination sphere of two active sites differing in deactivation reactions and containing fragments with different stereospecificity. It was proposed that active sites, clusters composed of four zirconocenes, coordinate four C3H6 molecules each and the latter concertedly transform into the starting polymer chain. The reversible deactivation of active sites proceeds with the participation of the monomer. A change in the electric conductivity of the catalytic system in the course of polymerization was measured, and a mechanism including repeated transitions of a growing chain to different sites was advanced.
