A series of salicylaldimine-based neutral Ni(II) complexes (3a-j) [ArN = CH(C6H4O)]Ni(PPh3)Ph [3a, Ar = C 6H5; 3b, Ar = C6H4F(o); 3c, Ar = C6H4F(m); 3d, Ar = C6H4F(p); 3e, Ar = C6H3F2(2,4); 3f, Ar = C6H 3F2(2,5); 3g, Ar = C6H3F 2(2,6); 3h, Ar = C6H3F2(3,5); 3i, Ar = C6H2F3(3,4,5); 3j, Ar = C6F 5] have been synthesized in good yield, and the structures of complexes 3a and 3i have been confirmed by X-ray crystaliographic analysis. Using modified methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst, these neutral Ni(II) complexes exhibited high catalytic activities for the vinylic polymerization of norbornene. It was observed that the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the fluorinated salicylaldiminato ligand was able to significantly increase the catalyst activity for vinylic polymerization of norbornenes. In addition, catalyst activity, polymer yield and polymer molecular weight can also be controlled over a wide range by the variation of reaction parameters such as AI: Ni ratio, norbornene: catalyst ratio, monomer concentration, polymerization temperature and time.
