The supported ionic liquid (SIL) strategy was used for the first time to metallocene and post-metallocene heterogeneous catalysts for olefin polymerization. The metal complexes: Cp2TiCl2, Cp 2ZrCl2, FI-Ti, and Sal-Ti were immobilized in the 1-(3-triethoxysilyl)propyl-3-methylimidazolium alkylchloroaluminate ionic liquid, anchored on the surface of the mesoporous amorphous silica. The SIL systems were characterized by FTIR, 29Si NMR, N2 adsorption, EA, AAS, TG, and SEM techniques. The developed supported catalytic systems were found to be active in the ethylene polymerization and produce the polyethylene of various properties. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
