Clear structure‐activity relationships were observed in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene with the novel, easily preparable catalysts 1 and 2: In the presence of methylaluminoxane, 1 polymerizes propylene with high activity to a polypropylene having a high average molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution; 2 is inactive in this reaction, but nevertheless polymerizes ethylene. The angle subtended by the indenyl ligand system appears to be decisive. (Figure Presented.) Copyright © 1989 by VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Germany
