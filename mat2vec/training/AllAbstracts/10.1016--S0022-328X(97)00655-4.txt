Zirconocene compounds having ether bonds at the substituent of cyclopentadienyl ligand, [η5-C5H4(CH2) nOCH2CH2OCH2CH3] 2ZrCl2 (n=2, 4, 6, 8) and [η5-C5H4CH2CH 2OCH2CH3]2ZrCl2, were prepared and tested for ethylene polymerization catalysts with methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst. The presence of oxygen atom close to the metal center drastically reduced the polymerization activity. It increased as the distance between zirconium and oxygen atom increased and showed a maximum when n was 6.
