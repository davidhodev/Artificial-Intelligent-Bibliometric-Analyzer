A highly reactive catalyst system, which induces the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene with high activity, has been found by the combination of cyclo-pentadienyl (Cp) complexes of group IIA or group IIIA elements with titanium alkoxides. The 1H NMR monitoring of these reactions reveals the occurrence of a novel Cp-transfer reaction that leads to the generation of Cp-containing titanium complexes as catalysts for promoting the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene. Detailed in situ 1H NMR studies reveal that the rate of the Cp-transfer reaction is highly dependent on the steric bulkiness of the titanium alkoxide complexes, the structures of the Cp complexes of group IIA or group IIIA elements, and the polymerization temperature. Styrene polymerization studies also reveal that a more effective Cp-transfer reaction can typically lead to the generation of a more highly reactive catalyst for sPS polymerization. This study provides a convenient method for the in situ generation of variable structures of Cp/titanium alkoxide complexes, which are difficult to synthesize by other methods. Most importantly, the mixture of a catalyst precursor can be directly used as an sPS polymerization catalyst without isolation and purification of Cp/titanium complexes.
