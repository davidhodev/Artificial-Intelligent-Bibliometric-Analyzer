Complex [Ti(κ 2-N,O-{2,6-F 2C 6H 3N=C(Me)C(H) =C(CF 3) O}) 2Cl 2] (1) was evaluated as catalyst for living copolymerization of ethylene (E) with norbornene (N) upon activation with dried methylaluminoxane (d-MAO) at temperatures between 25 and 90 °C. Copolymerization performed at different [N]/[E] feed ratios afforded stereoirregular alternating high molar mass P(E-co-N) with narrow molar mass distribution. The living nature of E-co-N copolymerization by 1/d-MAO was demonstrated by kinetics at 50 °C. This catalyst system was used for the synthesis of block copolymers such as polyethylene (PE)-block-P(E-co-N) with a crystalline PE block and an amorphous P(E-co-N) block as well as P(E-co-N) 1-block-P(E-co-N) 2, having different norbornene contents in the segments and thus having different T g values. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
