Recent successful examples for synthesis of new polyolefins containing polar functionatities by transition metal complex catalysis have been reviewed. The contents are consisted of the following sections: 1) background, 2) radical copolymerization, 3) direct alkane activation/ functionalization (post functionalization of polyolefins), 4) controlled incorporation of reactive functionalities (and the subsequent introduction of polar funtionalities under mild conditions) by coordination polymerization. In particular, we wish to introduce our recent approach for synthesis of polyolefins containing polar functionalities via copolymerization of ethylene with nonconjugated diene using nonbridged half-titanocenes.
