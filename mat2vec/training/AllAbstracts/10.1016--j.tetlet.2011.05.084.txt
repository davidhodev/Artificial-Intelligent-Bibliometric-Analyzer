Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments generate a demand of specific organometallic materials, especially titanium-doped porous polymers obtained from specific Ti-containing monomers. Two new polymerizable titanium(IV) complexes were synthesized. Their free radical co-polymerization affords several titanium-containing polymers, which were dried under supercritical conditions to afford organic aerogels. The chemical compositions of these materials were investigated by NMR, IR, and elemental analysis while their structure was characterized by MEB-EDS and by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm measurements.
