Reactions of alkyllithium compounds RLi (R = Me, Et, i-Pr, Np) with B(C6F5)3 result in the formation of the alkylborate salts Li[RB(C6F5)3]. Metathesis reactions of these with Ph3-CCl and chloride salts of (Ph 3P)2N+, PMePh3+, and HNMe2Ph+ proceed with varying degrees of success, as shown by NMR spectroscopy and electrospray mass spectrometry, and the compounds [PPN][EtB(C6F5)3], [PMePh3] [NpB(C6F5)3]3, and [HNMe 2Ph][NpB(C6F5)3] have been characterized crystallographically. All three anions assume the expected pseudotetrahedral structures with normal B - aryl bond lengths and R-B-aryl and aryl - B - aryl bond angles. The compound [HNMe2Ph] [NpB(C 6F5)3] reacts with Cp2ZrMe 2, (Indenyl)2ZrMe2, and SBIZrMe2 to give propylene polymerization catalysts that are significantly more active and give higher molecular weight polypropylene than do the catalysts obtained using B(C6F5)3. Thus the [NpB(C6F 5]- anion is for steric reasons more weakly coordinating than is [MeB(C6F5)3]-. Â© 2005 American Chemical Society.
