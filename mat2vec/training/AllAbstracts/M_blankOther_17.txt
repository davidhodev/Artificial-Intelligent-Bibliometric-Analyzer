Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) films were potentiostatically and potentiodynamically prepared on Pt electrodes from acetonitrile monomer solutions containing TBAPF6 or FcPF6 (or both). The polymer modified electrodes obtained with different growth charges were characterized electrochemically by cyclic voltammetry in a monomer free solution. The results point to the effective immobilization of the ferrocenium ion inside the PEDOT matrix by entrapment during the polymer synthesis in potentiostatic mode. It is discussed the influence of the presence of the organometallic cation in the polymerization solution in the growth process and the efectiveness of the incorporation of the metallocene is analysed on the basis of the electrochemical data collected for the films redox conversion.
