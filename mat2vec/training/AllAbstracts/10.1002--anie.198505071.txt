A novel, soluble Ziegler‐Natta catalyst enables the preparation of isotactic polypropylene, which exhibits a higher degree of isotacticity than polymers that can be produced industrially with heterogeneous catalysts. Furthermore, isotactic polybutene can also be obtained with such a catalyst. The chiral, rigid zirconocene derivative 1 and methylalumoxane 2 are used for the catalysis. The polymerization activity is remarkably high. (Formula Presented.) Copyright © 1985 by VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Germany
