The mesoporous catalyst activities of supported molybdenum oxide for diphenyl carbonate (DPC) synthesis in liquid-phase transesterification of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and phenol were investigated. The yields of DPC and methyl phenyl carbonate (MPC) were greatly improved when MoO3 was supported on SiMCM-41 to act as catalyst. MoO3/SiMCM-41 catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Characterized results revealed that the high activity sites of MoO3/SiMCM-41 were isolated MoO42- tetrahedral species and polymerized octahedral molybdenum oxide species. MPC formation increased with reaction time up to 4 h and then decreased thereafter, and maximum MPC yield achieved 39.6%. The decrease of MPC yield after 4 h might be ascribed to MPC disproportionation into DPC and reversible transesterification reaction.
