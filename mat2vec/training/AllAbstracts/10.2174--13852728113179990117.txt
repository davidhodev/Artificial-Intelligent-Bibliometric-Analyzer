The concept for preparing functional, high molecular weight poly(olefin)s via tandem ring-opening metathesis / vinyl insertion polymerization is reviewed. It is based on a reversible α-H-addition/ α-H-elimination process occurring in tailor-made catalysts. Copolymerization of ethylene with cyclic olefins with these catalysts yields poly(olefin)s with double bonds in the main chain. These can then be converted into various functional groups. First accomplishments are reported. Particular attention is devoted to the current status of this approach, its limitations and to approaches to overcome these. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.
