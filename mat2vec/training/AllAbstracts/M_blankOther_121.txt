The kinetics of propene polymerization in the liquid monomer medium and the properties of the resulting iso-PP were studied in relation to the interannular bridge nature, (CH2)2Ind2ZrCl2 (I), (CH3)2SiInd2ZrCl2 (II), (CH3)2CInd2ZrCl2 (III), and asymmetric (CH3)(cyclo-C3H5)CInd2ZrCl 2 (IV), in MAO-activated 1,1â€²-bridged bisindenyl zirconocene dichlorides. Data are also given for the non-bridged (2-Ph-C9H6)2ZrCl2 (V) system used under similar conditions. The systems based on zirconocene III are most active and that based on II is most stable. The replacement of one methyl group in the (CH3)2C< bridge by a cyclopropyl group (compounds III and IV) results in the depressed initial activity and in the greater deactivation of the system during the process of polymerization. The stereoblock polymer was formed with the catalyst system based on metallocene V, used under similar experimental conditions.
