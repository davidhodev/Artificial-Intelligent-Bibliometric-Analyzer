Silsesquioxane tethered fluorene ligands [R7Si8O12X]-9-Flu(H) (R = c-C6H11, X =-(1) R = c-C5H9, X = CH2 (2), (CH2)3 (3), C6H4CH2 (4)), (c-C5H9)7Si8O12CH2-9-Flu(9-EMe3) (E = Si (5a), Sn (5b)) and zirconium dichlorides Cp′[(c-C5H9)7Si8O12CH2-9-Flu]ZrCl2 (6b, Cp′ = 1,3-C5H3(SiMe3)2), Cp*[(c-C5H9)7Si8O12-X-9-Flu]ZrCl2 (X = CH2 (6a), (CH2)3 (7), C6H4CH2 (8)) and [(c-C5H9)7Si8O12CH2-9-Flu]2ZrCl2 (9) have been applied as models for silica-tethered ancillary ligands and silica tethered-zirconocenes. Immobilization of zirconocenes containing a pendant anchorable functionality, Cp′[Me2(EtO)SiCH2Flu]ZrCl2 (10) and Cp[C5Me4SiMe2OEt]ZrCl2 (11) was considerably hampered by competitive Zr–Cl and Si–OEt bond splitting. When activated with MAO (methylalumoxane), 6–9 yield active ethylene polymerization systems. © 2003 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
