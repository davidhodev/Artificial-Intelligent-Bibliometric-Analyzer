Two novel ZrIV- and HfIV-based bisamido complexes bearing the 6-[2-(diethylboryl)phenyl]pyrid-2-yl motif, that is, [ZrCl 2{Me2Si(DbppN)2}(thf)] (9) and [HfCl 2{Me2Si(DbppN)2}(thf)2] (10) (DbppN=6-[2-(diethylboryl)phenyl]pyridine-2-amido) have been prepared. Their reactivities have been compared with that of a model precatalyst that does not bear the aminoborane motif. Upon activation with methylalumoxane, precatalysts 9 and 10 are active in the homopolymerization of ethylene (E) yielding high-density polyethylene (HDPE). In the copolymerization of E with cyclopentene (CPE), for example by the action of 9, the presence of CPE resulted in a dramatic increase in the polymerization activity of E, while CPE incorporation remained close to or at zero. In the vinyl-insertion copolymerization of norborn-2-ene (NBE) with E by the action of 9, statistical cyclic olefin copolymers of these two monomers were obtained. At higher NBE concentrations, however, 9 gave rise to reversible ring-opening metathesis (ROMP)/vinyl- insertion polymerization (VIP) of NBE with E, resulting in the formation of multi-block copolymers of the general formula poly(NBE)ROMP-co- poly(NBE)VIP-co-poly(E). This particular feature of precatalyst 9, that is, the ability to induce a reversible α-H elimination/α-H addition reaction, is attributed to the unique role of the 6-[2-(diethylboryl) phenyl]pyrid-2-yl ligand. Accordingly, a model precatalyst lacking this ligand does not have the ability to induce α-H elimination/α-H addition reactions. The different 11B NMR shifts of various diethylborylphenylpyrid-2-ylamines and -amides permit a ranking of the strengths of the B-N bonds in these compounds. This strength of the B-N bond is correlated with the propensity of 9/MAO to produce poly(NBE)ROMP-co- poly(NBE)VIP-co-poly(E) at different temperatures. © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
