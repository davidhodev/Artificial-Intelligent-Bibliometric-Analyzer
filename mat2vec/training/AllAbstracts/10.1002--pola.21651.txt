Copolymerizations of norbornene with styrene were carried out with a catalytic system of anilido-imino nickel complex (ArN=CHC6H 4NAr)NiBr (Ar = 2,6-dimethylphenyl) and methylaluminoxane in toluene. The influence of the comonomer feed content and polymerization temperature on the conversion and composition of the copolymers with (ArN=CHC6H 4NAr)NiBr/methylaluminoxane was investigated. An increase in the initial styrene feed content led to an increase in the incorporated styrene content of the resulting copolymer. The determination of the reactivity ratios showed a much high reactivity for norbornene (reactivity ratio for styrene = 0.26, reactivity ratio for norbornene = 20.78), which was consistent with a coordination mechanism. NMR analysis of the end groups further confirmed that the chain was initiated through a styrene secondary insertion or a norbornene insertion into Ni - H and terminated through β-H. elimination from an inserted styrene unit. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
