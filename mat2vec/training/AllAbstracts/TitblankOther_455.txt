The effect of titanocene dichloride on the kinetics of methyl methacrylate radical polymerization initiated by benzoyl peroxide and AIBN was studied. It was shown that the initial polymerization rate increased and the molecular mass characteristics of the polymer produced significantly changed. Kinetic parameters were determined; titanocene dichloride was found to affect the process in all steps following the scheme of complex-radical polymerization.
