A procedure for supporting syndiospecific zirconocene on SiO 2 opens up a way of retaining the syndiospecificity of metallocene catalyst. The effects of supporting temperature, time and initial concentration of metallocene on the supported amount of metallocene were investigated. Using these supported catalysts for propylene polymerization, it is possible to reduce the consumption of cocatalyst MAO (methylaluminoxane) and produce syndiotactic polypropylene in high syndiotacticity. If partial MAO was replaced by triisobutylaluminium, it would be shown that the catalytic activity of these catalysts increases greatly.
