Treatment of the η 9 ,η 5 -bis(indenyl)zirconium sandwich complex, (η 9 -C 9 H 5 -1,3-(SiMe 3 ) 2 )(η 5 -C 9 H 5 -1,3- (SiMe 3 ) 2 )Zr, with dialkyl ethers such as diethyl ether, CH 3 OR (R = Et, n Bu, t Bu), n Bu 2 O, or i Pr 2 O resulted in facile C-O bond scission furnishing an η 5 ,η 5 -bis(indenyl)zirconium alkoxy hydride complex and free olefin. In cases where ethylene is formed, trapping by the zirconocene sandwich yields a rare example of a crystallographically characterized, base-free η 5 , η 5 -bis(indenyl)zirconium ethylene complex. Observation of normal, primary kinetic isotope effects in combination with rate studies and the stability of various model compounds support a mechanism involving rate-determining C-H activation to yield an η 5 ,η 5 - bis(indenyl)-zirconium alkyl hydride intermediate followed by rapid β-alkoxide elimination. For isolable η 6 ,η 5 - bis(indenyl)-zirconium THF compounds, thermolysis at 85 °C also resulted in C-O bond cleavage to yield the corresponding zirconacycle. Both mechanistic and computational studies again support a pathway involving haptotropic rearrangement to η 5 ,η 5 -bis(indenyl)zirconium intermediates that promote rate-determining C-H activation and ultimately C-O bond scission. © 2006 American Chemical Society.
