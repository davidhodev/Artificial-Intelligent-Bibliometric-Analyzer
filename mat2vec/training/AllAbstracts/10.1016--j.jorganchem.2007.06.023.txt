A series of new hydroxyindanimine ligands [ArN{double bond, long}CC2H3(CH3)C6H2(R)OH] (Ar = 2,6-i-Pr2C6H3, R = H (HL1), R = Cl (HL2), and R = Me (HL3)) were synthesized and characterized. Reaction of hydroxyindanimine with Cu(OAc)2 · H2O results in the formation of the mononuclear bis(hydroxyindaniminato)copper(II) complexes Cu[ArN{double bond, long}CC2H3(CH3)C6H2(R)O]2 (Ar = 2,6-i-Pr2C6H3, R = H (1), R = Cl (2), and R = Me (3)). The complex 2′ was obtained from the chlorobenzene solution of the complex 2, which has the same molecule formula with the complex 2 but it is a polymorph. All copper(II) complexes were characterized by their IR and elemental analyses. In addition, X-ray structure analyses were performed for complexes 1, 2, and 2′. After being activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO), complexes 1-3 can be used as catalysts for the vinyl polymerization of norbornene with moderate catalytic activities. Catalytic activities and the molecular weight of polynorbornene have been investigated for various reaction conditions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
