Photoinitiated polymerization reactions are characterized by important advantages compared to thermal reactions. The reaction can easily be turned on or off and is intrinsically spatially controlled. Most photopolymerization reactions operate without solvent which is strongly demanded nowadays. The search for new photoinitiating systems remains important. Particularly, the design of new sources of radicals is the subject of huge research efforts. The design of new initiating radicals with different geometries and properties and/or enhanced reactivity should provide new opportunities for the development of photocurable materials. In the present paper, new photoinitiating systems generating boryl (L→BR2), silyl (R3Si) or germyl (R3Ge) radicals are reviewed. These systems based on new radical chemistries improve both free radical photopolymerization (FRP) and free radical promoted cationic photopolymerization (FRPCP). © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.
