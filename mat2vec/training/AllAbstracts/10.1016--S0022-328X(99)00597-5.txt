The P-H functionalised phosphinoalcohol 1-PH(Tipp)-2-OH-cyclo-C6H10 (Tipp=2,4,6-Pri3C6H2) reacts with [Cp2ZrMe2] with elimination of methane to give exclusively the mono-substituted product [Cp2Zr(Me)(cyclo-1-O-2-PH(Tipp)-C6H10)] (1), even at elevated temperature. 1 reacts with [Mo(CO)5(NMe3)] to give the heterodinuclear complex [Cp2Zr(Me)(cyclo-1-O-2-PH(Tipp){Mo(CO)5}-C 6H10)] (2). The borane adduct [Cp2Zr(BH4)(cyclo-1-O-2-PH(Mes)(BH3)-C 6H10)] (3, Mes=2,4,6-Me3C6H2) was obtained from [Cp2Zr(BH4)2] and 1-PH(Mes)-2-OH-cyclo-C6H10 in boiling hexane. 1-3 were characterised spectroscopically (1H, 13C, 31P, 11B (for 3), MS, and IR). A crystal structure determination of the RC,RC,RP/SC,SC,S P isomer of 1 was obtained. The complexes 1-3 were studied in the catalytic polymerisation of ethylene and propylene by activating them with methylalumoxane (MAO) as cocatalyst. Â© 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.
