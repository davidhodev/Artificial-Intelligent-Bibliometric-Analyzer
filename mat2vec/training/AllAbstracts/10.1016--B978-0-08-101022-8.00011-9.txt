Their large surface area to volume ratio facilitates a high loading efficiency, and the versatility of methods for drug attachment and/or encapsulation allows for loading with many types of drug molecules. Additionally, varying polymer type and fiber morphology and the use of additional drug-encapsulating particles allow the release profile, mechanical properties, and degradation rate to be tailored to each application. Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of these systems in antibiotic delivery, establishing hemostasis, eliciting tissue growth and remodeling, and treating various types of cancer. These results indicate promising avenues for commercialization, which have yet to be fully realized.
