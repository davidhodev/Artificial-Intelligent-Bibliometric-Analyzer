As modifications of the effective catalyst precursor [dimethylsilanediylbis(benz[e]indenyl)]-zirconium dichloride, the ansa-zirconocene complexes Me2Si(cyclopenta[c]phenanthryl)2ZrCl2, Me2Si(cyclopenta[l]phenanthryl)2ZrCl2, Me2Si(2-methylcyclopenta[l]phenanthryl)2ZrCl2, and Me2Si(2-methyltetrahydrobenz[e]indenyl)2ZrCl2 have been synthesized. When activated by methylaluminoxane (MAO), these complexes give highly active catalysts for the polymerization of propene to polymers with high isotacticities and molecular weights.
