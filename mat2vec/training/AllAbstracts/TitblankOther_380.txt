Group IVB-containing polyamine ethers were synthesized in moderate yield employing the classical interfacial polycondensation procedure. The polymers were synthesized utilizing the dichlorides of titanocene, zirconocene, and hafnocene reacted with acyclovir. The products are high polymers. Mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy were carried out on the products. MALDITOF MS ion fragments to 100,000 daltons were found. Â© Oxford & IBH Pub. Co. Pvt. Ltd.
