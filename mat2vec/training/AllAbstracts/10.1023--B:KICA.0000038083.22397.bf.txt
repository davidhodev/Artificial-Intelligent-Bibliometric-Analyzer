The surface compounds of zirconium in SiO 2/MAO/Cp 2ZrMe 2 (I) and SiO 2/Cp 2ZrMe 2 (II) catalysts were studied by the IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO at 93-293 K. It was found that the bridging and terminal complexes of CO were formed on the surface of the catalysts at 93 K; the adsorption of CO was reversible. At 293 K, CO was irreversibly inserted into the Zr-Me bond with the formation of various acyl compounds of zirconium; these compounds were characterized by absorption bands in the region 1495-1750 cm -1 in the IR spectrum. These data suggested the heterogeneity of the surface composition of zirconocene catalysts I and II. Catalyst I, which was active in ethylene polymerization, contained surface zirconium complexes that can be considered as the precursors of active centers for ethylene polymerization.
