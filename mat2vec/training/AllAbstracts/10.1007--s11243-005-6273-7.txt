A new tetraoxime ligand, (2E, 3E, 9E, 10E)-1, 4, 8, 11- tetraazacyclotetradecane-2, 3, 9, 10-tetrone tetraoxime has been prepared by the template condensation of 1,3-propanediamine and cyanogen-di-N-oxide, obtained by treating (E, E)-dichloroglyoxime in CH 2 Cl 2 with Na 2 CO 3 at -10 °C. The coordination chain polymers {[(pnngH 2 ) 2 Ni] n (5) and [(pncgH 2 ) 2 Cu] n ( 6 )} of two transition metal ions, [Ni(II) and Cu(II)] with the vic-dioxime ligand have been prepared. The oxime ligand acts as a polydentate ligand bending through nitrogen atoms in the presence of a base, as do most of the vic-dioximes. In the complexes, the chloride ions coordinate to the nickel and copper ions. The structures of these novel vic-dioxime compounds are proposed on the basis of the elemental analyses, molar conductance data, i.r., and U.v.-visible are presented. Elemental analyses indicate a ligand metal ratio of 1:1 in the coordination polymers. Conductivity measurements have shown that mono- and polynuclear complexes are non-electrolytes. In addition, anti-microbial activities of the compounds have been investigated. © Springer 2005.
