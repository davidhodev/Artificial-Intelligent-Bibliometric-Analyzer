The catalytic activity of Cp2ZrCl2 supported on three types of molecular sieves (MCM-41, VPI-5 and Y Zeolites) was evaluated in the polymerization of ethylene. The supports were dehydrated, pre-treated with methylaluminoxane (MAO), and then reacted with Cp2ZrCl2. After heterogenization of Cp2ZrCl2 on the molecular sieves, the MAO concentration could be reduced without significant effect on the catalytic activity. The polymers obtained with the heterogeneous catalysts showed higher melting points and molecular weights, as well as narrower polydispersion than those obtained with the homogeneous catalyst precursor.
