The titane-ruthenium heterobimetallic compounds (p-cymene)[(η 5 -C 5 H 5 )(μ-η 5 :η 1 -C 5 H 4 (CH 2 ) m PR 2 )TiCl 2 ]RuCl 2 4-6 have been revealed to be quite good catalysts for the addition of formic acid to 1-hexyne and phenylacetylene. These preliminary results led us to synthesize new tetrametallic complexes 10-12 via the reaction of the titanocene phosphanes 1-3 with the polymer [Ru(CO) 2 (μ-O 2 CH)] n . Their catalytic ability for the enol esters formation has been studied. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
