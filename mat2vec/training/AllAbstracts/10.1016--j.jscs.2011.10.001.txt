Â© 2011.Characterization and electosynthesis of 3-thiopheneacetonitrile (TA) on a platinum electrode have been studied. Different solvents such as Nitrobenzene (NB), 1,2-Dichloroethane (DCE), Dichloromethane (DCM) and Acetonitrile (AN) were used. Many techniques were used for the electrodeposition of films such as potentiodynamic, chronoamperometric and galvanostatic techniques. Poly 3-thiopheneacetonitrile PTA has been subjected to relaxation effect. When the polymer is left at a potential value in its insulating state for some time, the reverse peak in the voltammetric profile during the first positive run differs from the steady state wave. The effect of solvent on the relaxation of the polymer has been studied. A weak or no relaxation was found by using different solvents such as NB, DCE, and DCM.
