Four zirconium complexes with pendant aryloxy groups attached to the metallocene moiety by ethyl or hexyl spacers have been synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic methods and HR-MS or elemental analysis. The solid state structure of bis[{6-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)hexyl}cyclopentadienyl] zirconium dichloride was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The prepared complexes were tested as catalyst precursors in the polymerization of ethylene upon activation with MAO. The results showed a marked effect of the spacer length on the catalytic activity, while only a minor effect of the substitution on the aryl group, which affected its steric properties.
