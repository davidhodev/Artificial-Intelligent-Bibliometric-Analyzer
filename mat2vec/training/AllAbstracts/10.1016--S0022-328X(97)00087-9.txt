Zirconocene dichloride was reacted with either 2,6-di-tert-butyl-or 2,6-diisopropyl phenol to form bis(η5-cyclopentadienyl) zirconium(IV) monochloride complexes 1 and 2 respectively. A bisphenoxy derivative of Cp2ZrCl2, 3, was formed, when sterically less demanding 2,6-dimethyl phenol was utilized. The ability of the complexes 1, 2 and 3 in ethylene polymerization with MAO as cocatalyst was examined. Polymer analysis indicates that, regardless of which complex was used, only one kind of catalytically active metal center is formed and polymer properties resemble those obtained with the Cp2ZrCl2/MAO system. The solid state structure of bis(η5-cyclopentadienyl) zirconium(IV) 2,6-di-tert-butyl-phenoxy monochloride (1) is reported. © 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.
