Syndiotactic polystyrene (syndiotacticity > 96%) was synthesized by bulk polymerization catalyzed with highly active novel titanocene η 5- pentamethylcyclo pentadienyl - tri - 4 - methoxyphenoxy titanium(Cp* Ti(OC 6OCH 3)3) and methyl - aluminoxane(MAO) catalyst system. The catalytic activity of the styrene bulk polymerization is up to 1.43 × 10 5 g/(g · h) and the monomer conversion is 91.6% at 90 °C , both are much higher than those of polymerization in toluene solution. The effects of polymerization temperature, catalyst concentration, and molar ratio of MAO/Ti on bulk polymerization are reported. The addition of triisobutylaluminum (TIBA) to the catalytic system can promote the catalyst activity.
