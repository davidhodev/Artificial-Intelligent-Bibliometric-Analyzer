In this review the catalysts of syndiotactic polymerization of styrene were presented in details. The roles of particular components of catalytic systems and the effects of their structures on polymerization efficiency and properties of the products were taken into account. The mechanism and conditions of the polymerization considered were discussed. A lot of attention has been paid to characterization of syndiotactic polystyrene structure. Useful properties and directions of applications of the product as well as of styrene/ethylene copolymers, obtained in the presence of syndiotactic polymerization catalysts, and their blends with various other polymers were presented. The plastics obtained from discussed syndiotactic products show advantageous unique features making possible their wide industrial application.
