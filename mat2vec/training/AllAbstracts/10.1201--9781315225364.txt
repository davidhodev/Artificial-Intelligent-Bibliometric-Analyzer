Â© 2018 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.Nanostructures are objects or structures which has at least one of its dimensions within nano-scale range. Nanofibers geometrically fall into thecategory of 1D nano-scale elements. Nanofiber can be considered either as a nanomaterial in view of its diameter or as a nanostructured material when filled with nanoparticles. Nanofibers gives rise to novel functions and find its applications in various fields such as catalysis, drug delivery, filter technology, functionalization of textiles, tissue engineering, cellular matrices, ultra-strong composites, bioreactors, electronics and energy application. In this chapter, a brief introduction to the different fabrication techniques for synthesizing nanofibers; in particular electrospinning, its working principle, the polymers and solvents used for nanofiber fabrication, parameters influencing the fiber formation and the applications of electrospun nanofibers in drug delivery are reviewed and discussed.
