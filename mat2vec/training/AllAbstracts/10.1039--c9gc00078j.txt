Â© 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry. The in air catalytic hydroboration of ketones and aldehydes with pinacolborane by an iron(ii) coordination polymer (CP) is carried out under mild and solvent-free conditions. The precatalyst is highly active towards a wide range of substrates including functionalized ketones and aldehydes in the presence of KO t Bu as an activator, achieving a high turnover number (TON) of up to 9500. Excellent chemoselectivity to aldehydes over ketones was also revealed, which is in sharp contrast with the results obtained under inert atmosphere using the same catalyst system. This catalyst observed here is not only highly efficient but also recyclable for reuse for at least 5 times without losing its effectiveness.
