A kinetic study has been made of the homo- and copolymerization of ethylene with vinylcyclohexane, using catalytic systems based on methylalumoxane and bis-(tert-butylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride and bis-(trimethylsilycyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride. The effective rate constants were determined in the interval from 20-70°C for the homo- and copolymerization reactions, and the observed activation energies and the copolymerization constant were obtained. Some properties of the resultant polymers were investigated. © 1991.
