A new mechanism is proposed to explain the occurrence of primary- growing-chain-end epimerization, and the structure and frequency of olefinic end groups arising from primary Î²-hydride transfer, in low molecular weight isotactic polypropylenes produced with C2-symmetric zirconocenes. This mechanism, based on the reversible formation of a zirconocene allyl dihydrogen complex, accounts for both loss of catalyst stereospecificity and decrease of polypropylene molecular weights observed by lowering [propylene], and accommodates a number of previous and new experimental observations. Inter alia: (i) the formation of internal vinylidene unsaturations; (ii) the increase of catalyst activity induced by H2 addition; (iii) the observed deuterium scrambling in the [1-D]propylene and [2-D]propylene polymerizations recently reported by Brintzinger. This new mechanism is discussed in the light of the polymerization results from two MAO-activated catalysts: rac- C2H4(Ind)2ZrCl2 and the novel, highly regiospecific rac-Me2C(3-t-Bu- Ind)2ZrCl2.
