Metal nanoparticles (NPs) of Cu (air-stable), Ag, and Au have been prepared using an atom-economy green approach. Simple mechanical stirring of solid mixtures (no solvent) of a metal salt and ammonia borane at 60 °C resulted in the formation of metal NPs. In this reaction, ammonia borane is transformed into a BNHx polymer, which protects the NPs formed and halts their growth. This results in the formation of the BNHx polymer protected monodisperse NPs. Thus, ammonia borane used in these reactions plays a dual role (reducing agent and precursor for the stabilizing agent). © 2010 American Chemical Society.
