KGaA, Weinheim.Titanium alkoxides can catalyze efficient and selective synthesis of cyclic carbonates through CO2 insertion into epoxides when tetrabutylammonium bromide or iodide is used as a cocatalyst. Of the series of synthesized titanium alkoxides, the most active catalyst was one bearing an aliphatic bidentate alkoxide ligand, and it produced propylene carbonate under benign conditions (100 °C, 15 bar CO2, 3 h) with turnover frequencies of up to 116 h-1. The effect of reaction parameters such as pressure, temperature, and catalyst/cocatalyst molar ratio were also studied in order to optimize the catalytic system.
