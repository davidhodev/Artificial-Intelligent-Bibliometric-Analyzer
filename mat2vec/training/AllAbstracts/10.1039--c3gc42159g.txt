In the last two decades, numerous catalytic methods have become woven into the fabric of green and sustainable chemistry. In order to qualitatively evaluate and construct a tangible meaning for sustainable processes in polymer chemistry, this perspective outlines ten desirable attributes of homogeneous metal-based catalysts to prepare monomers and polymers within the context of sustainability. Catalysts were evaluated with respect to their activity, composition, and potential environmental impact. In many cases, the most pertinent catalysts tolerate a wide range of functional groups and eliminate purification or synthetic steps. Desirable catalysts also exhibit low toxicity, diminish chemical waste, and allow replacement of toxic chemicals with benign alternatives. Ideally, catalysts operate with extended lifetimes and only require minimal catalyst loadings. Â© the Partner Organisations 2014.
