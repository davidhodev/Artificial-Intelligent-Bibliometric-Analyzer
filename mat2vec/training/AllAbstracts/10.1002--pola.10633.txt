Macroporous functionalized polymer beads of poly(4-vinylpyridine-co-l,4-divinylbenzene) [P(VPy-co-DVB)] were prepared by a multistep polymerization, including a polystyrene (PS) shape template by emulsifier-free emulsion polymerization, linear PS seeds by staged template suspension polymerization, and macroporous functionalized polymer beads of P(VPy-co-DVB) by multistep seeded polymerization. The polymer beads, having a cellular texture, were made of many small, spherical particles. The bead size was 10-50 μm, and the pore size was 0.1-1.5 μm. The polymer beads were used as supports for zirconocene catalysts in ethylene polymerization. They were very different from traditional polymer supports. The polymer beads could be exfoliated to yield many spherical particles dispersed in the resulting polyethylene particles during ethylene polymerization. The influence of the polymer beads on the catalytic behavior of the supported catalyst and morphology of the resulting polyethylene was investigated. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
