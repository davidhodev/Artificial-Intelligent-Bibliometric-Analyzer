The halfsandwich complexes [(η 5-C 9H 7)TiCl 3] (3a), [(η 5-Me 3Si-1- C 9H 6)TiCl 3] (3b), [(η-Me-1-C 9H 6)TiCl 3] (3c), [(η-Me 2-4,7- C 9H 5)TiCl 3] (3d), [(η 5-Me 3Si-2-C 9H 6)TiCl 3] (3e), [(η 5-Me 2-1,3-C 9H 5)TiCl 3] (3f), [(η 5-(CH 2) 3-5,6-C 9H 5)TiCl 3] (4), and [(η 5- (CH 2) 3-1,7-C 9H 5)TiCl 3] (5) are accessible by reacting the in position 1 or 3 Me 3Si- functionalized appropriate indenes with TiCl 4. CG-TiCl 2 compounds (CG = Constraint Geometry) can be synthesized by the subsequent reaction of Br-2-C 9H 7 (6a), Br-2-Me 2-1,3-C 9H 5 (6b) and Br-2-(CH 2) 3-5,6-C 9H 5 (6c), respectively, with magnesium in presence of Me 2SiCl 2 to give the respective Me 2SiCl- functionalized indenes which further react with an excess of H 2N tBu to afford tBuHN-SiMe 2-C 9H 7 (8a), tBuHN-2-Me 2-1,3-C 9H 5 (8b) and tBuHN-2-(CH 2) 3-5,6-C 9H 5 (8c). The latter species produce on their consecutive reaction with nBuLi, [TiCl 3·3Thf] and PbCl 2 the titanium CG-complexes [(η 5-SiMe 2N tBu-2-C 9H 6)TiCl 2] (9a), [(η 5-Me 2-1,3-SiMe 2N tBu-2-C 9H 4)TiCl 2] (9b), and [(η 5- Me 2SiN tBu-2-(CH 2) 3-5,6-C 9H 4)TiCl 2] (10). The same synthesis protocol allows the preparation of [(η 5-Me 2SiN tBu-1-Me 3Si-2-C 9H 5)TiCl 2] (12) a CG complex in which the Me 2SiN tBu unit is located in position 1. The polymerization of ethene by using 3-5 and 9-12 and MAO (MAO = methylaluminoxane) as cocatalyst is described to show if a strong activity correlation between 3-5 and 9-12 exists. In order to optimize the catalytic activity of 3-5 the electronic (cyclic voltammetry, UV-Vis spectroscopy) and steric properties (Multiple Overlap Solid Angle) of these species were analyzed. Based on the obtained data, semi-empirical structure-activity models for 3-5 are proposed to obtain an optimized substituent pattern for the indenyl moiety. Substituents in position 1 or 4 of the appropriate indenyl π-perimeters show a strong bathochromic (+M) and electro-neutral to electro-negativ effect (0/-I). © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.
