Polysilanes are usually prepared by the Wurtz-type reductive coupling of dichlorosilanes with alkali metals. Controlling the microstructures of macromolecules is an important subject in polymer synthesis and a number of reports have addressed the control of the stereochemistry of polysilanes. The properties of polysilanes are extremely sensitive to the substituents, such as the heteroatoms attached to the σ-conjugated polymer backbone. In this respect, the functional modification of polysilanes is quite interesting. Substitution reactions onto polysilane chains could be a powerful method for the functional modification of polysilanes. Polysilanes have unique characteristics that mainly originate from the σ-conjugation along the main chain. Hence, there is a strong relationship between the characteristics of polysilanes and their electronic states and conformations. The chapter describes some approaches to controlling the conformation of polysilanes, including oligosilanes as a simple mode.
