The present study reports the synthesis of titanium-containing polyethers employing the interfacial polymerization technique fo the purpose of evaluating the incorporation of various `flexibilizing' units on the products flexibility and solubility. The mass spectra of the products derived from PEG and Cp2TiCl2 were investigated. Titanium-containing fragments were observed for the products. All of the Group IVB metallocene polyethers have been insoluble in all tested liquids including the products described here.
