These mortars have become of growing interest in the field of construction. They were used as superplasticizers, or water reducers, for finishing work applications and for repairs, coatings, and waterproofing. This study is about using two polymers (latex), i.e. styrene–butadiene rubber and styrene–acrylic, in order to assess their performance in replacing cement in mortars. A series of mortar mixtures, containing 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20% of solid polymer latex (by weight), were prepared and tested in the fresh and hardened states. The test parameters include the fluidity, compressive and flexural strengths, porosity accessible to water, adhesion to clay bricks, and cementitious substrates. The experimental results showed that substituting cement into modified mortars improves their fluidity and adhesion. In the case of clay substrates, a cohesive failure occurs within the substrate layer beyond 10% of substitution, while the rupture takes place at the interface for all formulations tested on cementitious substrates. It was also noted that the flexural tensile strength improved beyond 60 days. However, the compressive strength of polymer mortars decreased with the substitution rate of cement, for all maturities considered. However, for porosity accessible to water, the results follow a linear function, with an inflection at 5% of latex substitution.
