Transformation of living ring-opening metathesis polymerization into coordination polymerization by converting the titanacyclobutane group attached to a polynorbomene chain into titanocene alkoxide has been used for the synthesis of polynorbornene-poly(ethylene-co-propylene) block copolymer. Preliminary characterizations of the copolymerization products by solvent extraction and 13C NMR spectrum are reported.
