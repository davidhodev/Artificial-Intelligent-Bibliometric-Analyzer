Several examples are described where in situ generated (η2-alkyne) group 4 metallocene type substrates add to X-[M2] reagents (M2 = main group metal) to form dimetallabicyclic products Cp2M(μ-η1:η2-RCCR)(μ-X)[M 2] which contain a planar-tetracoordinate carbon center in the μ-η1:η2-hydrocarbyl bridge. Thus, (η2-cyclohexyne)(PMe3)ZrCp2 (4a) reacts in this way with excess trimethylgallium to give Cp2Zr(μ-η1:η2-C6H 8)(μ-CH3)GaMe2 (6a). Complex 6a is one of the rare examples of a gallium compound containing σ-hydrocarbyl bridges to this heavy main group metal. Complex 6a was characterized by X-ray diffraction. It crystallizes in space group P21/c with cell parameters a = 9.007 (3) Å, b = 8.195 (2) Å, c = 25.404 (4) Å, β = 91.30 (1)°, Z = 4, R = 0.056, and RW = 0.066. Complex 6a contains a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom C(2) with pertinent bond distances and angles of 2.423 (5) Å [Zr-C(2)], 2.096 (5) Å [Ga-C(2)], 1.572 (8) Å [C(2)-C(3)], 1.314 (7) Å [C(1)-C(2)], 119.5 (4)° [C(3)-C(2)-C(1)], 100.3 (3)° [C(3)-C(2)-Ga], 79.3 (1)° [Ga-C(2)-Zr], and 61.1 (3)° [C(1)-C(2)-Zr]. Both Cp rings are disordered. Zirconium and gallium seem to form a three-center two-electron bond with C(2). The planar-tetracoordinate geometry at carbon atom C(2) is probably electronically stabilized by the σ-donor properties of the attached metal centers and by a π-conjugative interaction of the C(2)-C(1)-Zr moiety normal to the σ-plane. (η2-1,2-Didehydrobenzene)(PMe3)ZrCp2 (4b) reacts analogously with trimethylgallium to give Cp2Zr(μ-η1:η2-C6H 4)(μ-CH3)GaMe2 (6b) in almost quantitative yield. Complex 6b crystallizes isomorphously to the corresponding Al compound in space group P21/n with cell parameters a = 9.126 (1) Å, b = 14.080 (2) Å, c = 14.323 (1) Å, β = 103.88 (1)°, Z = 4, R = 0.062, and RW = 0.038. It also contains a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom [C(2)]. The reaction of Ph - CΞC - GaMe2 (7) with (hydrido)zirconocene chloride produces Cp2Zr(μ-PhCCH)(μ-Cl)GaMe2 (9) which is probably also a similarly structured "anti-van't Hoff/LeBel complex". Complexes 6a and 6b react with ethylene or norbornene at room temperature with liberation of Me3Ga and formation of five-membered metallacyclic products (e.g., bis(η-cyclopentadienyl)zirconaindane is obtained from 6b and ethylene).
