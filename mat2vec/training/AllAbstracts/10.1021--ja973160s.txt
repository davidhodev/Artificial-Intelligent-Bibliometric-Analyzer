A new class of isospecific and highly regiospecific C2-symmetric ansa-zirconocenes, characterized by a bisindenyl ansa ligand with bulky substituents in the 3 position of indence and a single carbon bridge is disclosed: variation of the size of the substituent in C(3) has a strong effect on the extent of chain transfer and isospecificity in propene polymerization. In fact, while rac-[Me2C(1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 produces low molecular weight and moderately isotactic polypropene (iPP) also containing some regioirregularities (M̄(n) = 6500, mmmm ca. 81% and 2,1(tot) = 0.4% at 50°C in liquid monomer), rac-[Me2C(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 produces iPP with molecular weights between 25,000 (T(p) = 70°C) and 410,000 (T(p) = 20°C) and a fairly high isotacticity (mmmm ca. 95% at 50°C), with no detectable 2,1 units. The influence of polymerization temperature on the catalyst performance has been investigated by polymerizing liquid propene in the temperature range of 20-70°C: the experimental ΔΔE values for enantioface selectivity have been estimated for two members of the new class (rac-[Me2C(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 ΔΔE(enant) = 4.6 kcal/mol; rac-[Me2C(3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 ΔΔE(enant) = 2.6 kcal/mol). For comparison, Brintzinger's moderately isospecific, benchmark catalyst rac-[ethylene(1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 (ΔΔE(enant) = 3.3 kcal/mol), the single carbon bridged, unsubstituted rac-[Me2C(1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 (ΔΔE(enant) = 2.8 kcal/mol), and the C2-symmetric, practically aspecific, rac-[ethylene(3-methyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 (ΔΔE(enant) = 1.9 kcal/mol) are also reported. The molecular structures of rac-[Me2C(3-tert-butyl-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 and rac-[Me2C(3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-indenyl)2]ZrCl2 have been determined.
