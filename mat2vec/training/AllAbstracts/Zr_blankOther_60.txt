Four-membered silacycles are a class of important small cyclic compounds in organosilicon chemistry, which also have many applications to organic, organometallic and polymer chemistry. Silacy-clobutanes with one silicon atom in the ring can be synthesized by the Grignard reaction of Î³- halopropylsilanes, cycloaddition of Si=C bond containing species with alkenes and ring expansion of si-lacyclopropanes. Silacyclobutenes with one silicon atom in the ring can be synthesized by Si - C bond forming ring-closure mediated by organolithium or Grignard reagents, conversion of silacyclobutanes, insertion of silylene into C - H bond, cycloaddition of Si=C bond containing species with alkynes, and intramolecular cyclization of bis(alkynyl)silanes. Due to the ring strain and Lewis acid character, silacyclobutanes and silacyclobutenes can undergo ring expansion reactions to afford five- and six-membered silacycles, or ring opening to give organosilicon molecules and materials as well as fulfill organic transformations under very mild conditions.
