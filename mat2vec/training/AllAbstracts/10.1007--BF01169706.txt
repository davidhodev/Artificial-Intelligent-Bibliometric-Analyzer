Heterometallic hydride titanocene-aluminum complexes Cp2Ti(ν-H)2AlH(X) and (Cp2Ti)2AlH4X are highly efficient homogeneous catalysts for acetylene polymerization. The binuclear complex of the composition Cp2Ti(μ-H)2AlH2 at 2.2-3.2 M concentrations in ether-toluene solutions exhibits the maximum activity in this reaction. It is believed that the mechanisms of the isomerization of olefins and the polymerization of acetylene are similar and, correspondingly, the compositions and structures of the active sites in both processes are close to each other. The polyacetylene formed with hydride catalysts (mostly the cis-isomer) after doping with iodine has an electrical conductivity of 1.5-2.0 · 104 Ohm-1 cm-1. © 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.
