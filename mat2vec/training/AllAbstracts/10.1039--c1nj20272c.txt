A method for the preparation of bifunctional carbosilane dendrons has been developed and used to synthesize first- and second-generation dendrons containing [Cp 2 MCl 2 ] end-groups (M = Ti, Zr; Cp = cyclopentadienyl) and Si-Cl focal-point bonds. These dendrons have been fully characterized in solution and, in the case of the zirconium derivatives, immobilized on an amorphous silica surface and tested as ethylene polymerization catalysts. The immobilization was quantitative and quite stable under the conditions of the catalysis. Â© 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.
