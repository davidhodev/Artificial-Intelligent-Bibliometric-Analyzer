Propylene polymerizations in the presence of various monocyclopentadienyltitanium compounds and methylaluminoxanes (MAO) have been investigated. It was found that by substituting methyl group for hydrogen in the cyclopentadienyl ring, the titanocene catalyst affords a polypropylene with increasing molecular weight by one order of magnitude. Residual AIMe 3 content in MAO has an determinative effect on catalytic activity for the propylene polymerization. An excess of AlMe 3 in the catalyst system, such as 25% AlMe 3 in MAO, hinders the polymerization by reducing the Ti species to inactive lower valent states. The effects of molar ratio of MAO to Ti complex, polymerization temperature and monomer pressure on catalytic activity and molecular weight of the products are studied in detail. Thus, atactic polypropylene with the molecular weight range of 20-100 × 104, much higher than that prepared by unsubstiuted cyclopentadienyltitanium complex has been synthsized by η 5 pentamethylcyclopentadienyltitanium tribenzyloxide/MAO catalyst. The atatic polypropylenes exhibit excellent elasticity.
