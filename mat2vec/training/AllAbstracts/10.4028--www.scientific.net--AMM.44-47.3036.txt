One binuclear mono-cyclopentadinyl titanocene, CpTiCl 3(CH 2) 4CpTiCl 3, has been synthesized by a new ways and characterized by 1H-NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Its aqueous medium polymerization properties of methyl methacrylate (MMA) have been pursued with an anionic surfactant, sodiumn dodecylsulfate(SDS) in water. The obtained polymers were characterized by gel permeation chromatography(GPC). GPC results showed that the dinuclear titanium complex might provide PMMA with broad PDI(PDI=10.82). Influences of reaction parameters, such as temperature, time, MMA/Cat(molar ratio) and water amount were studied in detail. Under the conditions of the temperature was 55 °C, the reaction lasted l5h, the molar ratio of Cat to MMA was l:200, and the volume of water consumed was 40 ml, the conversion of MMA was as high as 70%. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.
