After Staudinger reaction with Me3SiN3 in toluene under reflux, compound 1a with a flexible diphenyl ether bridge was converted into the bisphosphinimine precusor, while compound 1b with a rigid xanthene bridge was transformed into the monophosphinimine one. Subsequently, the dehalosilylation with CpTiCl3 afforded the corresponding phosphinimine titanium complexes 3a and 3b, respectively. Single titanium center complex 3b further reacts with NiBr2(DME) to translate into titaniumnickel heteronuclear bimetallic complex 4b. The structures of the complexes were characterized by 1H, 13C, 31P NMR and elemental analyses. And the molecular structures of complexes 3a and 4b were further determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. When activated by the methylaluminoxane(MAO), complexes 3a and 4b displayed high catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization. The bimetallic titanium complex 3a produced a wide molecular weight distribution polyethylene product, while the titanium-nickel heteronuclear bimetallic complex 4b gave rise to the bimodal polyethylene product.
