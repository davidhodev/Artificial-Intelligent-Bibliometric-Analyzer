This article reviews our recent studies on cyclopolymerization of 1,6-heptadiene derivatives catalyzed by late transition metal complexes. Pd-diimine complexes initiate cyclopolymerization of the 1,6-heptadienes with functional groups to afford the polymers containing functionalized trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclopentane rings along the polymer chain. Copolymerization of the dienes with ethylene and a-olefins also causes quantitative cyclization of the diene during the polymer growth. 1,6-Octadiene and higher mono-terminal dienes undergo the cyclopolymerization accompanied by chain walking of the growing polymer, leading to the polymers with trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclopentane groups located regularly along the linear polymer chain. The Fe and Co complexes with a bis(imino)pyridine ligand promote the polymerization of unsubstituted 1,6-heptadiene with quantitative cyclization to yield the polymers containing five-membered rings. The Fe complex-catalyzed reaction affords the polymers composed of cis-fused five-membered rings, whereas the polymer obtained by using Co catalyst contains trans-fused rings selectively.
