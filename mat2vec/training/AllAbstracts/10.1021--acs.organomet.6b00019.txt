Consecutive protolysis of the intramolecularly bound ketimide moiety in bent metallocenes afforded pendant imine or cationic iminium moieties, respectively, attached to group 4 organometallic fragments. Selected compounds were used as precatalysts in a preliminary screening for ethylene polymerization activity.
