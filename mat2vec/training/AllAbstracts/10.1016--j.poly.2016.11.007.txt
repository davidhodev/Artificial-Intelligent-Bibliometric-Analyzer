© 2016 Elsevier LtdA series of titanium(IV) complexes (2–6) stabilized by a substituted 2-hydroxymethylphenole (1) – were synthesized and characterized by NMR- and IR-spectroscopy. Structures of complexes 5–6 were established by X-ray diffraction. Titanium atom in the dimeric complex 5 has an octahedral environment created by chlorine atoms and five oxygen atoms. In the tetrameric complex 6 coordination polyhedra of Ti(1) atom is trigonal bipyramid and in Ti(2) – tetragonal pyramid with the environment of five oxygen atoms. Each complex contains alkoxo-groups and/or a chlorine atom easily leaving during treatment with magnesium- or organoaluminum compounds. All resulting complexes are moderately or highly active in ethylene polymerization in the presence of {3Et2AlCl + Bu2Mg} binary co-catalyst. Complexes 5 and 6 are significantly superior to previously described analogs 2–4 in thermal stability and catalytic activity. Resulting polymers are linear polyethylenes of high and ultrahigh molecular weight (over 2.5 · 105 g/mole) with a broad molecular weight distribution. Polymers are suitable for the modern methods of polymer processing – the solventless solid state formation of super high-strength (breaking strength over 1.5 GPa) and high-modulus (elastic modulus over 60 GPa) oriented films and film tapes.
