The use of metallocenes in many stoichiometric and catalytic processes has been the impetus for the development of new organometallic complexes, especially those containing early transition metals. The formation of coordinative unsaturated complexes using allylic, benzamidinate and aminopyridine families is presented. The synthesis and structural parameters of the new complexes, their activation and use in the polymerization of α-olefins and dienes, in the dehydrogenative coupling of silanes and in the hydroamination reactions comprise the objectives of this review. © 2007 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
