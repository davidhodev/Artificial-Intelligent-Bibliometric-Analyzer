Mixtures of Cp*TiR3 (with Cp* = C5(CH3)5 and R = CH3, 13CH3) and equimolar amounts of B(C6F5)3 or C(C6H5)3B(C6F5) 4, active in the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene, have been investigated by means of ESR spectroscopy. At room temperature the formation of Cp*TiR+ complexes has been observed. Rapid insertion of styrene occurs in Ti-R bonds of these cationic Ti(III) complexes, strongly suggesting their role in the stereospecific polyinsertion.
