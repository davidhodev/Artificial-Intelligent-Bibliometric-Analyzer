Â© 2019 American Chemical Society.Tetramethyldisiloxa[3]metallocenophanes of the heavy group 14 elements germanium, 2a, tin, 2b, and lead, 2c, (tetrelocenophanes) have been synthesized by the reaction of dilithiated ligand, 1, with the corresponding element(II) chloride. The plumbocenophane, 2c, forms one-dimensional coordination polymers in the solid state, while the germanocenophane, 2a, and the stannocenophane, 2b, are monomeric. Furthermore, the reactivity of the stannocenophane, 2b, and the plumbocenophane, 2c, toward N-heterocyclic carbenes was explored. Although the coordination of carbene is reversible in solution at room temperature, the corresponding carbene complexes, 3a,b, could be structurally characterized, illustrating the Lewis acidity of the central atom in these metallocenophanes.
