The selective transport of various metal ions through a novel polymer inclusion membrane (PIM) doped with β-diketone derivatives (acetylacetone (1), 3-propyl-acetylacetone (2), and 3-benzyl-acetylacetone (3)) was investigated. Initial fluxes of metal ions transport across PIMs decrease in the following sequence: Zn(II) > Cu(II) > Co(II) > Ni(II). Results show that zinc(II) can be effectively separated by studied PIMs from equimolar aqueous solutions of copper, zinc, cobalt, and nickel nitrates. At pH 7.5 and after 24 hours 87–93% of Zn(II) was recovered. It was found that membranes containing 2 and 3 separate zinc better than PIM with 1. Prepared PIMs were characterized using AFM and thermal analysis techniques.
