A coordination polymer based on zinc(II) and mixed ligands [Zn(oxa)(bbi)] n (1) (oxa=oxalate anion, bbi=1,1'-(1, 4-butanediyl)bis (imidazole)), has been prepared and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The structure of polymer 1 presents an unique two-dimensional (2D) layer structure with (4,4) topology in the presence of meso-helical chains and a three-dimensional (3D) network distorted with large channels. In addition, moderate fluorescent emission in the solid state at room temperature was observed in the Zn 1-containing polymeric compound 1. And antimicrobial activity of the compound has been investigated. CCDC: 842497.
