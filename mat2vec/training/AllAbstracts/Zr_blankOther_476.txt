Living ring-opening polymerization of the cyclic carbonate 1,3-dioxepan-2-one was achieved by using the cationic zirconocene complex [Cp2ZrMe]+[B(C6F5)4] - as catalyst at room temperature. A linear relation between conversion and molecular weight of the obtained polymer was observed. Furthermore, block copolymerization of the cyclic carbonate and Îµ-caprolactone was successfully performed.
