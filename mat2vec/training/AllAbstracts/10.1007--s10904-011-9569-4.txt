Pd nanoparticle-poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)/KIT-6 (Pd-PHEMA/KIT-6) composite was fabricated through in situ polymerization method and was evaluated as a novel heterogeneous catalyst in Suzuki-Miyaura cross coupling reactions of aryl halides and phenylboronic acid in an aqueous medium. The catalyst was characterized by XRD, FT-IR, UV-Vis, TG, BET, and TEM techniques. The results revealed that the supported catalyst Pd-PHEMA/KIT-6 exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the coupling of aryl iodides, aryl bromides, and aryl chlorides. This heterogeneous catalyst could be reused at least nine times without any decrease in activity. Â© 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
