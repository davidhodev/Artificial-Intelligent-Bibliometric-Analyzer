Fluorofluorenes [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octafluoro-9-(pentafluorophenyl)-9H- fluorene (OFPF), 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octafluoro-9-(2,4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-9H- fluorene (OFTF), and 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octafluorofluorene (OFF)] react with sodium hydride or with lithium alkyls to give fluorofluorenyl anions which have been characterized in solution by 19 F NMR spectroscopy. OFPF is deprotonated by ethylenediamine, by HMPT and by 1,7-diazo-bicyclo(5,4)-undec-7- ene (DBU), as shown by 1 H and 19 F NMR spectrometry. The new compound [rac-ethylene-bis(η 5 -4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)] diallylzirconium(IV) (ZRAL), as prepared from [rac-ethylene- bis(η 5 -4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)]dichloridezirconium(IV) and allylmagnesium chloride, undergoes allyl abstraction with OFPF, CPh 3 [B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ], and B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 forming zirconium-containing cations, as established by 1 H and 19 F NMR spectrometry. Toluene/pentafluoroanisole solutions of the fluorinated anions, in combination with ZRAL, catalyze the polymerization of ethylene, with an activity comparable to that of MAO or CPh 3 [B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ], a remarkable increase of activity being observed with the ZRAL/OFPF system. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.
