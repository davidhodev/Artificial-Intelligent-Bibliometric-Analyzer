Ethylene polymerizations were performed with a catalytic system composed of titanocene(III)-Î²-diketonate complex such as [Cp2Ti(III)(1-benzoylacetonato)] or [Cp2Ti(III)(dibenzoylmethanato)] and MMAO. These catalysts are active for the polymerization of ethylene to give high-density polyethylene with high molecular weight.
