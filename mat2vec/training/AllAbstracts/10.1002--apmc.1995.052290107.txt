Ethylene/propylene copolymers (EPM) have been prepared by a liquid propylene suspension process, using homogeneous catalysts based on nonbridged zirconocenes and methylaluminoxane (MAO). When bis(η5‐cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride (Cp2ZrCl2), bis(η5‐cyclopentadienyl) dimethyl zirconium (Cp2ZrMe2) and bis(η5‐cyclopentadienyl), dibenzyl zirconium (Cp2ZrBz2) were used as catalyst components, EPM having low average molecular weight (MW) were in general obtained in low yield. On the contrary, a very large improvement of productivity and MW was observed when bis(η5‐indenyl)zirconium dichloride (Ind2ZrCl2) and bis(η5‐indenyl) dimethyl zirconium (Ind2ZrMe2) as well as bis(η5‐tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride [(IndH4)2ZrCI2] were employed in combination with MAO. In particular, this last catalytic system allowed one to obtain EPM with a narrower distribution of MW in addition to the above characteristics. Better performances, in terms of rheological and elastomeric properties, were also found for the crude and vulcanized samples prepared by (IndH4)2ZrCl2/MAO catalyst. © 1995 Hüthig & Wepf Verlag, Zug
