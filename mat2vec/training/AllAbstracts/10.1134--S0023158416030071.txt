© 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.The homopolymerization of vinyl chloride and its copolymerization with ethylene over dibutyl ether–modified SiO2-supported Ziegler–Natta catalysts based on titanium and vanadium chlorides have been studied. The supported metal complexes are sufficiently active in the polymerization of vinyl chloride. Their activity depends on the catalyst composition and conditions of formation of the catalyst on the surface of the support. The chain structure of the resulting polyvinyl chloride (PVC) has been studied by NMR spectroscopy. The thermal properties of the synthesized PVC have been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry. The PVC obtained possesses enhanced thermal stability owing to the specific features of its chain structure. Vinyl chloride polymerization over the supported metalorganic catalyst proceeds mainly via a free-radical mechanism. Process conditions have been found for conducting the copolymerization of vinyl chloride with ethylene over supported metal complexes resulting in the formation of true statistical copolymers, which is confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopy.
