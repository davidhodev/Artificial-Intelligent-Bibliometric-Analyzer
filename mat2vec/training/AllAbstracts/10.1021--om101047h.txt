Amine elimination reactions of the scandium tris(amide) complexes Sc[N(SiRMe2)3](THF)n (R = H, n = 1; R = Me, n = 0) with 1 equiv of the substituted cyclopentadienes C5Me 4R′H (R′ = Me, SiMe3) afforded the series of thermally stable half-sandwich scandium bis(amide) complexes (C 5Me5)Sc[N(SiHMe2)2]2 (1), (C5Me4SiMe3)Sc[N(SiHMe2) 2]2 (2), and (C5Me5)Sc[N(SiMe 3)2]2 (3). In the presence of Al iBu3, activated by an equimolar amount of [Ph 3C][B(C6F5)4], all these complexes showed high activity toward styrene polymerization to give high-molecular-weight polystyrene (Mn > 104) with high syndiotacticity (rrrr >99%). © 2011 American Chemical Society.
