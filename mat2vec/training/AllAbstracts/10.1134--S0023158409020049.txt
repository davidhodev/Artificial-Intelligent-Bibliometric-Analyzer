The kinetics of methyl methacrylate polymerization in the presence of benzoyl peroxide + metallocene (ferrocene, titanocene dichloride, and zirconocene dichloride) initiating systems is considered, and the effects of the nature and amount of metallocene in the system are reported. The polymerization is assumed to be a complex-radical process. The structure of the complex-radical sites of chain propagation and a scheme of their formation are deduced from quantum-chemical calculations. Â© 2009 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.
