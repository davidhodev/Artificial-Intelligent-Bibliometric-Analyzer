Propylene polymerizations were carried out by using rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 (Zirconocene catalyst) and a commercial third generation Ziegler-Natta catalyst in a semibatch reactor. From the polymerization reactions, the optimum reaction conditions and the physical properties of polymers produced from each catalyst system were investigated. The optimum reaction temperatures of rac-Et(Ind)2ZrCl2 and Ziegler-Natta catalyst were 50 °C, 40 °C, respectively. On the basis of the results for the produced polymer particle size distributions and the catalytic activities of polymerization reaction, the reaction temperature should be considered as an important factor for the successful polymerization reactions. Especially, the polymer was conglomerated in the higher reaction temperature. It was found that there was an upper limitation to co-catalyst concentration. Reaction rates and polymer yields rather decreased with increasing the concentration of co-catalyst, i.e., MAO and TEA1 affected only polymerization activities, but the PEEB in Ziegler-Natta catalyst system affected isotactic indexes of produced polymer as well as activities. Based on these observations, the production yield seems to exhibit a first order linear relationship to the partial pressure of monomer.
