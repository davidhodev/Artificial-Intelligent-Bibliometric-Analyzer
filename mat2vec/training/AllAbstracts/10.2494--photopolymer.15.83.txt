Two-photon polymerization initiated by a tri molecular initiating system composed of 7-diethylamino-3-(2â€²-benzimidazolyl)coumarin, Titanocene and N-phenylglycine was investigated. The photosensitizer has been proved to posses large two-photon absorption cross-section for 800nm femtosecond laser. The sensitizer/coinitiator system has high Photosensitivity for polymerization of photosensitive resin. This photopolymer system has been demonstrated for fabricating three-dimensional microstructure.
