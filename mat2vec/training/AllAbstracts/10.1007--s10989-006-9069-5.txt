Solid-phase synthesis has contributed to a significant portion of combinatorial libraries made to date. Among many advantages of solid-phase organic synthesis, one unique property is the pseudo-dilution effect. In reality, polymer support is a dynamic system and its structural mobility is controlled by many intrinsic and external factors such as cross-linking, load, solvent, temperature and incoming reagent concentrations. Site-site interaction can often occur and affect the direction of the intended reaction. Â© 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.
