A variety of bisalkoxo titanium dichloride THF adducts [Ti(OR)2Cl2(thf)2] {OR = adamantanoxo (9), (1R,2S,5R)-(-)-menthoxo (10), (1S-endo)-(-)-borneoxo (11)} have been prepared and characterized by spectroscopic techniques. The molecular structure of 11 has been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The parent Lewis acid bisalkoxo titanium dichloride derivatives and related alkoxo complexes [Ti(OR)2(OPri)2]2 have been tested as initiators in ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone and l-lactide. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.
