Novel highly active Î·5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyltribenzyloxy titanium catalyst activated by modified methylaluminoxane (m-MAO) was prepared for styrene syndiospecific polymerization. The influences of the contents of trimethylaluminum (TMA) in m-MAO and external addition of tri-isobutylaluminum (TIBA) on the distribution of the oxidation states of titanium were investigated in detail. The Ti (III) is in favour of styrene syndiospecific polymerization in higher catalytic activity.
