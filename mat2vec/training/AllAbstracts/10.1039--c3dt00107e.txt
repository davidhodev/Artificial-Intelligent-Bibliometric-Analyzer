The influence of methylaluminoxane (MAO) catalyst activators of different concentrations and preparative histories on the performance of 1-hexene polymerisations was investigated by kinetic methods, using rac-Me 2Si(2-Me-Benz[e]Ind)2ZrCl2 as the standard catalyst precursor. Fast sampling and analysis allow the time dependence of monomer conversion and the growth of the number-average polymer molecular weight to be determined at a sufficiently short timescale to make this a feasible method for routine catalyst evaluation. Differences in productivity, polymer molecular weight and active species count are shown to be primarily a linear function of the trimethylaluminium concentration. The results in toluene and heptane as solvents are compared; the data show that the inferior performance in heptane is due to a substantially lower active species concentration.
