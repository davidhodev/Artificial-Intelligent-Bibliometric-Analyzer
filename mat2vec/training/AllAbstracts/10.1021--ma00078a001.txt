In order to study the formation and the nature of Ti/Al adducts that play a role in the olefin polymerization activity of the group 4 metallocene-methylaluminoxane catalytic systems, the reactions of AlMe3 and/or methylaluminoxane with Cp2TiMeCl and Cp2TiMe2 have been monitored by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Temperatures between 203 and 283 K and Al/Ti ratios from 1 to 40 have been used. The change in 13C NMR signals has been found the most diagnostic. Several adducts have been observed and identified. The kind of adducts changes both with the reaction temperature and the Al/Tiratio. By comparing the MAO and AlMe3 reactions with Cp2TiMeCl it is possible to deduce that, with respect to AlMe3, MAO is a better alkylating agent and it has a greater capacity for producing and stabilizing cation-like complexes. At the Al/Ti ratio of 40 a complex that we tentatively assign as a solvent separated ion pair prevails. The fact that, after the addition of CH2Cl2 to the toluene solution, this complex is present in greater amounts is consistent with this assignment. Â© 1993, American Chemical Society.
