Through the Diels-Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene groups attached to polystyrene in the presence of zirconocene, novel polystyrene-supported metallocene catalysts were prepared. A novel method for immobilizing metallocene catalysts was investigated, and the resultant polystyrene-supported metallocene for olefin polymerization was studied. The results of olefin polymerization showed that different crosslinking degrees of support in the catalyst system had significant effects on the catalytic behavior. The influence of the [Al]/[Zr] molar ratio and the temperature on the (co)polymerization activity was studied. When 1-hexene and 1-dodecene were used for copolymerization with ethylene, an obvious positive comonomer effect was observed. Â© 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
