A new diphosphinoamine ligand [Ph2PN(p-C6H 4OMe)PPh2] was prepared through aminolysis reaction of p-methoxyaniline with Ph2PCl in the presence of NEt3. Consequently, the corresponding nickel (II) diphosphinoamine complex [(p-C 6H4OMe)N(PPh2)2NiCl2] was synthesized and characterized. The solid-state structure of the complex was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. As combined with methylaluminoxane (MAO), the complex displayed high catalytic activity for vinyl polymerization of norbornene. Copyright Â© 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
