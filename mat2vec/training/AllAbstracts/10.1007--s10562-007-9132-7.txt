The bimodal polyethylene obtained from TiO2-supported zirconocene/MAO catalyst was observed during polymerization of ethylene and ethylene/1-hexene. By means of XPS, it revealed that TiO2 consisted of Ti3+ (BE = 462.6 eV) and Ti4+ (BE = 464.9 eV). The dual catalytic sites were attributed to the presence of Ti3+ and Ti 4+ in TiO2.
