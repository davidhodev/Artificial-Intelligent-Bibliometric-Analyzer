The polymerized metallocene catalyst 4 was prepared by the co-polymerization of ansa-zirconocene complex [(CH2=CH)CH3Si(C 5H4)2]ZrCl2 (3) containing vinyl substituted silane bridge with styrene in the presence of radical initiator. Catalyst 4 was found to display high ethylene polymerization activity of 2.28 × 106 gPE/(mol·h) with a viscosity average molecular weight (Mη) value of 61.6 × 103 using methylalumoxane (MAO) as a co-catalyst. The ethylene polymerization has been investigated under different conditions.
