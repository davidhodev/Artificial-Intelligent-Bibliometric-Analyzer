Olefin polymerizations were conducted with novel multimetallic zirconocene catalyst systems: R-CpCpZrCl2 (1) (R = dimethylsilylferrocene; Cp = cyclopentadienyl) and (R-Cp)2ZrCl2 (2) in combination with methylaluminoxane or tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borates. In ethylene polymerization, the maximum catalyst activity was observed at a lower temperature (30-45Â°C) when using complex 1 or 2, compared with Cp2ZrCl2. It was also revealed that complex 1 is a more effective catalyst than Cp2ZrCl2 for copolymerization of ethylene and propene.
