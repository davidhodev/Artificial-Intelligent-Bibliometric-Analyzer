The field of metal-catalysed polymerization has since matured, in no small part owing to the development of several high-performance catalysts. Although polymerization research has in many ways been driven by catalyst development, this has often occurred as a result of trial and error discovery of a promising motif, followed by extensive tuning of the steric and electronic properties of the ligand(s) present in the lead complex. Recently, some alternative design strategies have emerged that afforded new classes of olefin polymerization catalysts. This Perspective highlights recently designed catalyst motifs and the novel reactivity patterns they enable. Special attention is given to methods specifically designed for the copolymerization of ethylene with polar-functionalized co-monomers — challenging reactions that showcase these creatively designed catalyst motifs.
