Novel chromium catalysts based on bidentate phenoxy- phosphinoyl (HO-2R 1 -4R 2 -6(Ph 2 P=O)C6H2: R1 = R2 = H, 3a; R 1 = tBu, R 2 = H, 3b; R 1 = R 2 = tBu, 3c; R 1 = R 2 = cumyl, 3d; R 1 = anthracenyl, R 2 = H, 3e) and thiophenol-phosphine (HS-2R 1 -4R 2 -6(Ph 2 P)C 6 H 2 : R1 = R2 = H, 4a; R1 = SiMe 3 , R2 = H, 4b) were prepared and characterized. Treatment with modified methyaluminoxane, these catalysts displayed moderate to high-catalytic activities for ethylene polymerization. The activities of them were higher than those of the corresponding catalysts based on bidentate phenoxy-phosphine ligands. Both the coordinated donors and the ortho-substituent of the ligands played an important role in improving catalytic activity. The effects of reaction parameters, such as cocatalyst and Al/Cr molar ratio as well as reaction temperature, on ethylene polymerization behaviors were investigated in detail for two favorable catalytic systems, 3b/CrCl 3 (thf) 3 and 4b/CrCl 3 (thf) 3 . Catalyst 4b/CrCl 3 (thf) 3 displayed higher catalytic activity and better temperature tolerance for ethylene polymerization than 3b/ CrCl 3 (thf) 3 . Â© 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
