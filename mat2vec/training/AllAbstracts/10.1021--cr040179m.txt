An overview is given of the various classes of π-conjugated oligomers and polymers incorporating P-moieties. Topics covered include (1) π-conjugated systems based on arylphosphanes, (2) heteroaryl-, ethenyl- and ethynyl-phosphanes, (3) π-conjugated systems based on phospholes, (4) π-conjugated materials in phosphorus multiple bonds and (5) fulvene-, fulvalene, and quinone-based materials. The conceptual design and specific properties that directly result from the presence of the P-atom are also illustrated whenever possible.
