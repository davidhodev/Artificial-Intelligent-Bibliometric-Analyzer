A series of heterogeneous catalysts with Cp2TiCl2 supported on palygorskite were prepared and evaluated by ethylene slurry polymerizations. The so-called direct supported catalyst, for which the pretreatment of palygorskite with MAO or Al(i-Bu)3 was not necessary, gave the highest activity among these supported catalysts and could be more robust than homogeneous Cp2TiCl2. With the direct supported catalyst, no significant activity loss was observed under low Al/Ti molar ratios (Al/Ti=300) and the decay of polymerization rate was slower when compared to the other supported catalysts. It was found that the surface Lewis acidity of palygorskite after thermal treatment played an important role in activation of metallocene compound and resulted in high catalyst activity.
