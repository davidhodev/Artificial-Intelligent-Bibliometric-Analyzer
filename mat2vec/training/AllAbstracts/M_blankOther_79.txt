Rac-H2C(3-t-Bu-1-Ind)2ZrCl2 (2) is a novel, easy to synthesize, high performance catalyst for the polymerization of isotactic propylene (i-PP). Methylalumoxane (MAO)-activated 2 produces i-PP with good activities at 60 °C in liquid monomer and AlMAO/Zr of 8000 mol/mol, melting points around 160 °C, and average viscosity molecular weights around 100,000, at Tp = 60 °C. The isotacticity of i-PP from 2/MAO is similar to those of the xylene-insoluble fractions of i-PP from heterogeneous Ti-MgCl2 catalysts. Melting points are lower than those of i-PP from Ti catalysts, but close to or higher than stereospecific zirconocene catalysts. Molecular weight distributions are narrow as typical of metallocene catalysts.
