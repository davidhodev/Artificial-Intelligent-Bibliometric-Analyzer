The ansa indenyl ligand precursors CH2CH2CH 2(C9H6R)2 (R = Me (7), Et (8), Pr (9)) have been prepared by the reaction of the corresponding lithium indene, Li(C9H6R-1) (R = Me (4), Et (5), Pr (6)), with 1,3-dibromopropane. Compounds 7-9 were converted, by the reaction with butyllithium, to the dilithium compounds, Li2{CH2CH 2CH2(C9H5R-3)2} (R = Me (10), Et (11), Pr (12)). The three carbon atom bridge ansa-bis(indenyl)zirconium complexes, [Zr{CH2CH2CH2(η5- C9H5R-3)2}Cl2] (R = Me (13), Et (14) Pr (15)) were synthesized from the reaction of 10-12 with zirconium tetrachloride. Compounds 13-15 have been tested as homogeneous catalysts in the polymerization of ethylene. The molecular structures of 14 and 15 have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
