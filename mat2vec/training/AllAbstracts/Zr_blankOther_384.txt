Two tetramethyldisiloxanediyl bridged binuclear titanocenes Cl 2CpTiCp * (CH 3) 2SiOSi(CH 3) 2Cp * TiCpCl 2(Cp * = substituted cyclopendienyl, R= H in catalyst A, R = Si(CH 3) 3 in catalyst B) have been synthesized by the reacting dilithium salts of Cp * (CH 3) 2SiOSi(CH 3) 2Cp * with CpTiCl 3 in the yields of 42% and 51% respectively. Their catalysis behavior for the polymerization of ethylene under different conditions were investigated, and compared with mononuclear metallocene, cyclopentadienyl-titanium dichloride. The result showed that these two catalysts have a middle activity for ethylene polymerization. The MWD of the polyethylene were rather wide and the highest molecular weight was as high as 5.9 Ã— 10 4g/mol. Furthermore, catalyst B exhibited unexpected temperature dependence for ethylene polymerization.
