Copolymerization of racemic α-olefins with ethylene and propylene was carried out in the presence of enantiopure C1-symmetric ansa metallocene, {1,2-(SiMe2)2(η5-C 5H-3,5-(CHMe2)2)(η5-C 5H3)}-ZrCl2 to probe the effect of the polymer chain end on enantioselection for the R- or S-α-olefin during the kinetic resolution by polymerization catalysis. Copolymerizations with ethylene revealed that the polymer chain end is an important factor in the enantioselection of the reaction and that for homopolymerization, chain end control generally works cooperatively with enantiomorphic site control. Resulcts from propyclcene copolymerizations suggested that chain end control arising from a methyl group at the β carbon along the main chain can drastically affect selectivity, but its importance as a stereo-directing element depends on the identity of the olefin. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.
