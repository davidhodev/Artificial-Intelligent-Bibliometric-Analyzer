Several kinds of MgCl2-supported half titanocene(XTiCl3; X = cyclopentadienyl, pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, indenyl, and heptamethylindenyl) catalysts were prepared and applied to propene polymerization using Al(i-Bu)3 as cocatalyst. It was confirmed from the catalyst analysis that the ligand (X) is attached to titanium even after the reaction with Al(i-Bu)3. When polymerization was conducted without any external donor, those catalysts predominantly gave atactic PP. However, addition of a suitable monofunctional Lewis base like ethylbenzoate caused to change the stereospecificity of polymer from aspecific into highly isospecific. On the other hand, the use of a bifunctional donor like di-n-butylphthalate killed the activity almost completely. The isotactic PP was found to have a microstructure similar to that obtained with metallocene catalysts. Â© 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
