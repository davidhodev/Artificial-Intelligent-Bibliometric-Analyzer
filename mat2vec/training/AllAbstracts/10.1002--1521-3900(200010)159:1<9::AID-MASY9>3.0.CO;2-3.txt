New C1-symmetric metallocenes such as [Me2C(PhCp)(Flu)ZrCl2, [Me3Pen(Flu)]ZrCl2, [PhMe3Pen(Flu)]ZrCl2 were synthesized and used for the polymerization of propene by higher polymerization temperatures. Different polypropylene micro structures were obtained. Important for industrial processes are the high molecular weights of the polymers produced by the pentalenelike catalysts, which are very stable by higher temperatures. For synthesis of syndiotactic polystyrene and new substituted half-sandwich titanocenes are used such as 1,3-Me2-CpTiCl3, Me4CpTiCl3, PhCpTiCl3, cyclohexyl-CpTiCl3. If they are fluorinated, the activity for the production of syndiotactic polystyrene can be increased 10 times. The synthesized polymer shows a high melting point of 275Â°C.
