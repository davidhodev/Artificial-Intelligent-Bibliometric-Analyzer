A new synthetic route to C-2 bridged indenyl metallocenes utilizing the anion of 1-indanone has been developed. Two new ansazirconocene complexes 1a and 1b were synthesized and examined as precursors for the polymerization of α-olefins. These metallocenes were shown to be active for the polymerization of ethylene and for the oligiomerization of propylene when activated with excess methylaluminoxane (MAO). © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
