The paper gives a review of publications on polymers with conjugated matrices (PPy, PTh, PAni, hydrocarbon or mixed chains...) which incorporate metallocene complexes (Fe, Ru, Co; Ni, Ti, Zr, Ta) with two cyclopentadienyl ligands (Cp) and their derivatives, in particular with methylated cyclopentadienyl rings (Cp*), as well as hemi-metallocene complexes (Fe, Ru, Co, Mn), as pendant groups or inside the principal chain (part B). The information on related short-chain systems, monomers and oligomers, is also included. In part A, a brief overview of various conjugated polymer materials is presented, with their classification in accordance with the conductivity mechanism (ionic, electronic or mixed conductors) or with the structural type (linear-chain organic or mixed polymers, derivatization, metallopolymers, multi-dimensional structures, alternating and block copolymers with organic or mixed units, hybrid materials with a mixture of conjugated and inert polymers, polymers inside a solid matrix, conjugated polymers with incorporated nanoelements of transition metals, carbon, semiconductors etc. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.
