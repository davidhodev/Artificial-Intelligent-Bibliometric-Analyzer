KGaA, WeinheimThe design and synthesis of transition metal complexes with high thermal stability in olefin polymerization have become more and more important in order to meet the need of industrial application. This review focuses on the transition metal complex catalyst with high thermal stability containing different structures, including the backbone of bis(imino)pyridine, α-diimine and other types of ligands. Besides the catalytic activity, the influence of reaction temperature on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the obtained polymer was also described. The plausible mechanism on the stability of catalysts at high temperature was proposed, which may give guidance to design catalyst with good thermal stability.
