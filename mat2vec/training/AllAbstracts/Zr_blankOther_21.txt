This paper reviewed the studies on five types of non-chromium catalysts for ethylene trimerisation, including zirconium, vanadium, tantalum, titanium and nickel based catalysts in the light of the variety of the metallic elements in active center of the catalysts. The structural character of these catalysts, catalytic mechanism and reaction feature of ethylene trimerization in the presence of the catalysts were introduced. The effects of ligand structure, reaction temperature, pressure, cocatalyst amount on activity and selectivity towards 1-hexene of the catalysts were compared. The titanium-based catalyst exhibits outstanding behavior among the catalysts for its excellent selectivity towards 1-hexene as well as high activity; however, a very large consumption of methylaluminoxane as its cocatalyst is considered as a shortcoming of the catalytic system.
