A number of half-zirconocene anilide complexes of the type Cp*ZrCl 2 [N(2,6-R 1 2 C 6 H 3 )R 2 ] [R 1 = i Pr (1, 3), Me (2); R 2 = Me (1, 2), Bn (3)] and Cp*ZrCl[N(2,6-Me 2 C 6 H 3 )Me] 2 (4) (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) were synthesized from the reactions of Cp*ZrCl 3 with the lithium salts of the corresponding anilide in diethyl ether at room temperature. All new zirconium complexes were characterized by 1 H and 13 C NMR and elemental analysis. Molecular structures of complexes 1, 2 and 4 were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Upon activation with Al i Bu 3 and Ph 3 CB(C 6 F 5 ) 4 , complexes 1-4 exhibit good catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization, and produce polyethylene with a moderate molecular weight. Among these zirconium complexes, complex 1 shows the highest catalytic activity while complex 4 shows the lowest catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization. Complexes 1-3 also exhibit moderate catalytic activity for copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene, and produce copolymers with relatively high molecular weight and reasonable 1-hexene incorporation. In addition, the activation procedure of these catalyst systems were studied by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Â© 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
