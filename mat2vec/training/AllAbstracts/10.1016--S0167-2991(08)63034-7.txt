1. Studies by 1H NMR on equilibria between contact ion pairs such as Cp2ZrCH3δ + …H3C-B(C6F5)3δ- and binuclear alkyl zirconocene cations of the type (Cp2ZrCH3)2(μ-CH3) + lead to the conclusion that these binuclear species must generally be considered as participants in all homogeneous Ziegler-Natta systems. 2. Different polypropene chain lengths, which are obtained from cis- and trans-1D - propene with the catalyst en(thind)2ZrCl2/MAO, show that exchange of α-H with α-D atoms affect the rate of chain growth by a large kinetic isotope effect; this supports the notion that an α-agostic interaction facilitates the olefin insertion step. 3. A strong increase in polymer chain lengths, which is caused by the presence of α-methyl groups in ansa-zirconocene catalysts, is shown, by the effects of propene pressure on MW, to be due to the suppression of the otherwise predominant direct β-H-transfer to a coordinated olefin molecule by these α-substituents. © 1994 Kodansha Ltd.
