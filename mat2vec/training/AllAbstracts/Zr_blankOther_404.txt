The organotin compound (η5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)tin tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (1) has been synthesized from a reaction between (pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)tin chloride and lithium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate. This cation proved to be an effective Ziegler-Natta α-olefin cocatalyst. Activities for ethylene polymerizations using dimethylzirconocene and 1 were 7.3 × 105 g of PE/(mol of 1·[C2H4]·h) at 20 °C and 1.2 × 106 g of PE/(mol of 1·[C2H4]·h) at 70 °C. This system was also effective for the polymerization of propylene. Activities using rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)-dimethylzirconium with the tin cation were 3.0 × 105 g of PP/(mol of 1·[C3H6]·h). Activities increased markedly when using zirconocene dichlorides/tri(i-butyl)aluminum/1. Activities for ethylene polymerization using zirconocene dichloride/tri(i-butyl)aluminum/1 at 20 °C were 7.0 × 106g of PE/(mol of 1·[C2H4]·h). Activities for the polymerization of propylene using rac-ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride/tri(i-butyl)aluminum/1 at 20 °C were 5.4 × 106 g of PP/(mol of 1·[C3H6]·h).
