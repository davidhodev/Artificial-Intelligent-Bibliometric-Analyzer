The systematic synthesis of 1,3-dialkyl-substituted 2-silylindenes and their suitability as zirconocene ligands is discussed. Unexpected reactivities rendered a number of substitution patterns unfeasible, especially for alkyl groups other than methyl in 2-(trimethylsilyl)indene derivatives, and essentially for all derivatives of 2-(dimethylsilyl)indene. The syntheses of rac/meso-bis[1-methyl-2-(trimethylsilyl)indenyljzirconium(IV) dichloride (12) and bis[1,3-dimethyl-2-(trimethylsilyl)indenyl]zirconium(IV) dichloride (13b) are de scribed. The solid-state structure of the latter displays strong deformations within the ligand framework and an unusually large C PcentroidZr-CPcentroid angle. Both, 12/MAO and 13b/MAO, displayed ethene and ethene-co-1-hexene polymerization activity. Curiously, 13b/MAO shows an extraordinary monomer selectivity, which can be rationalized by means of DFT calculations on the active site. Â© Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
