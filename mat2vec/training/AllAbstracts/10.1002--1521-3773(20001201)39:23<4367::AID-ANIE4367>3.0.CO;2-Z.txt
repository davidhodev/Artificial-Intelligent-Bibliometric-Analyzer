In a single experiment, several supported zirconocene catalysts for Î±-olefin polymerization can be evaluated by a combinatorial concept. Polyethylene particles produced by fluorescent dye tagged catalysts can be easily identified by their emission color, separated, and characterized (see fluorescence microscope image).
