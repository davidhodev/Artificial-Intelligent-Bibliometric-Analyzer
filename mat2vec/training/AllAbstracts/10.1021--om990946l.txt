Effective cocatalysts need not contain metalloid/metal-carbon bonds and the properties of the resulting metallocenium cation-anion pairs are sensitive to both the counteranion core structure and the metallocene ancillary litigation. The perfluoroaryloxide salts of the formula Ph3C+Al(OC6F5)4- and Ph3C+M(OC6F5)6- (M = Nb, Ta) were synthesized and characterized. In combination with sterically encumbered zirconocene dimethyl complexes, they yield active ethylene polymerization catalysts.
