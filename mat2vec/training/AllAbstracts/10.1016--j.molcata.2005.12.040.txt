Five new double silylene-bridged binuclear titanium complexes were synthesized by the reaction of RCpTiCl3 and Li2[μ,μ-(SiMe2)2 (C5H3)2] in toluene. They were all well characterized. These complexes activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO) are highly active catalysts (2.33 × 105 g PE/mol Cat h) for the polymerization of ethylene even at low Al/Ti (Al/Ti = 300). The molecular weight distribution of the polymer indicates broad or bimodal (MWD = 26.76) distribution. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
