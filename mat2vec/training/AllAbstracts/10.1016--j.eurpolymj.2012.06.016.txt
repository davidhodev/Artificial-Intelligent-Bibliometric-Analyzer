Two phthalocyanine end-capped copolymers with conjugated dithienylbenzothiadiazole-vinylene side chains, PHY1 and PHY2, have been synthesized according to the Stille-Coupling polymerization method. The structures, thermostability, optical and electrochemical properties of the copolymers were characterized via NMR, GPC, TGA, DSC, UV-vis, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry (CV), respectively. The two copolymers exhibit excellent film-forming ability and good thermostability in a wide temperature range. PHY1 and PHY2 end-capped with different phthalocyanines showed broad absorption bands ranging from the ultraviolet to the red/near-infrared (IR) region of the solar spectrum and deep HOMO energy levels. Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells were fabricated based on PHY1 and PHY2 with [6,6]-phenyl-C 61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC 61BM) as the electron acceptor and showed power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 1.56% and 1.26%, respectively, under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW/100 cm 2.
