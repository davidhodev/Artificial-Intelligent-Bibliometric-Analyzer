Based on dimethyl derivatives of zirconocenes with the C2 symmetry and perfluorenyl borate, catalysts immobilized on inorganic (silica gel) and organic (polysorb) supports active for the synthesis of isotactic PP were prepared. It was shown that the polymerization of propylene with immobilized catalysts in heptane proceeds at the steady-state rate in the presence of triisobutylaluminum. The polymer arises in the form of granules whose size grows with an increase in the specific yield of the polymer. The nature of the immobilized zirconocene affects the activity of the catalytic system and properties of the resulting PP. The macrotacticity index increases with an increase in the temperature of polymerization. The effective activation energies of polymerization are in the range from 39 to 48 kJ/mol.
