Stereospecific polymerization and asymmetric oligomerization of allylsilanes were investigated by using C2- and Cs-symmetric zirconocene catalysts. Isotactic and syndiotactic poly(allylsilane)s were produced with rac-ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium dichloride (1) and diphenylmethylene(η5-cyclopentadienyl)(η 5-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride (6), respectively. Bulky allylsilanes afforded optically active oligomers in the reactions using optically active ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)zirconium and -hafnium complexes.
