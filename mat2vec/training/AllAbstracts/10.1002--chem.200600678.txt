Selective catalysts can be considered as nanomachines designed to perform the synthesis of molecules with high reaction activity and high selectivity. These properties arise from a precise control of the structure of the active sites, of the three-dimensional environment and of their relationship. In both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts the active site three-dimensional environment ensemble is always a complex structure resembling the tuneable structure of enzymes, which are the most efficient catalysts optimized by nature over billions of years, To illustrate this concept the structure of a few homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for alkenes hydrogenation and for olefin polymerization are chosen and discussed as examples.
