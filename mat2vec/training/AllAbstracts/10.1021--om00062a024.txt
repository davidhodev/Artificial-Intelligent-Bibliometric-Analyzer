Poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) containing cyclopentadienyl ligands attached to the benzyl carbons was prepared by the reaction of cyclopentadienylsodium with polymer that had been brominated at the benzyl position. Cross-linking took place during the reaction through the cyclopentadiene group. The reaction of 2-norbornen-7-one with poly(2,6-diphenyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) lithiated at the 3-position gave the norbornen-7-ol derivative which was converted to the polymer-attached 7-chloronorbornene. Cyclopentadiene ligands were generated via a retro Diels-Alder reaction of the anion produced from the 7-chloronorbornene. These polymers were converted to polymer-bound cyclopentadienyldicarbonylcobalt, cyclopentadienyldicarbonylrhodium, and titanocene catalysts. The cobalt and rhodium complexes were effective hydroformylation catalysts while the immobilized titanocene hydrogenated cyclohexene 10–70 times faster than the homogeneous analogue. © 1982, American Chemical Society.
