2-[1-(2,6-Diisopropylphenylimino)ethyl]-6-[1-(pyren-1-ylimino)ethyl] pyridine (L1) and 2,6-bis[1-(pyren-1-ylimino)ethyl]pyridine (L2) were synthesized and used to prepare the corresponding Fe complexes Fe1 and Fe2 from FeCl2. All new compounds were characterized, and single-crystal XRD analysis of Fe1 was performed. The π-conjugated pyrenyl substituent enhanced the catalytic activity of the Fe complexes, which display high activity in ethylene polymerization up to 107 gPE mol Fe-1 h-1 (PE=polyethylene). These Fe complexes were easily immobilized on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) through noncovalent π-π interactions. The supported precatalysts showed better ethylene polymerization activity than their homogeneous counterparts to produce well-dispersed MWCNT/PE composite materials. Show your support for polymerization: Task-specific pyrene-tagged Fe complexes are highly active catalysts in ethylene polymerization. Their noncovalent immobilization onto the surface of multiwalled carbon nanotubes allows the design of supported catalytic systems that can be more active than the corresponding unsupported systems and/or allow a better control of the polyethylene polydispersity. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
