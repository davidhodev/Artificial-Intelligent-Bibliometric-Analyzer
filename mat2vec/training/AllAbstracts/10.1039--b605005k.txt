CpTiCl 2 (N=C t Bu 2 ) exhibits both remarkable catalytic activity and efficient norbornene (NBE) incorporation for ethylene-NBE copolymerization: the NBE incorporation by Cp′TiCl 2 (X) (X = N=C t Bu 2 , O-2,6- i Pr 2 C 6 H 3 ; Cp′ = Cp, C 5 Me 5 , indenyl) was related to the calculated coordination energy after ethylene insertion. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2006.
