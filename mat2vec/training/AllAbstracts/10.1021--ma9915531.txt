Various techniques were applied to study thermoplastic elastomeric polypropylene derived from oscillating bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconocene in order to provide information on the morphology of this stereoblock polymer. Multiple melting fractions in the differential scanning calorimetry scans of thermally fractionated samples characterized the polydispersity of the crystallizable block lengths. Crystal morphologies of these materials and their change during and after tensile extension were observed using atomic force microscopy (AFM). In addition, AFM and acid digestion studies provided estimated of the crystallizable sequence lengths in these elastomers.
