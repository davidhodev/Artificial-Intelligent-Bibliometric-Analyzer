New stereorigid bridged zirconocene having an indenyl group and a fluorenyl group as ligand was synthesized and investigated as an ethylene/1-hydroxy-10-undecene copolymerization catalyst. This catalyst using MAO as a cocatalyst promoted polymerization to produce copolymers having high molecular weight (Mw: 121000) and high polar monomer content (36.7 mol%), displaying higher polymerization activities at higher temperature.
