Â© 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry. A novel type of porous coordination polymer with titanium alkoxide linkages (Ti-PCP) was successfully constructed through reaction of a 1,3-diol-substituted shape-persistent arylene-ethynylene macrocycle with Ti(O i Pr) 4 . The polymer exhibits a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (1029 m 2 g -1 ) and good adsorption selectivity for CO 2 over N 2 . With n-Bu 4 NBr as a co-catalyst, Ti-PCP can serve as a highly efficient catalyst to convert CO 2 into cyclocarbonates through the cycloaddition reaction with epoxides under mild conditions. This framework-based heterogeneous catalyst not only has excellent catalytic activity, but also can be recycled and reused many times with easy product separation, thus showing its great potential for industrial applications as a green catalyst. With high uptake of CO 2 and catalytic ability to convert CO 2 to useful chemical compounds, this type of porous polymer with embedded catalytic centers could have important applications to solve environmental problems regarding post-combustion CO 2 capture and conversion.
