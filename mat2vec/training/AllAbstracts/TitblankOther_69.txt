Four new Cp*Ti compounds with ortho-substituted phenoxy ligands for the syndio- specific polymerization of styrene were prepared by the reaction of various kinds of ortho- substituted phenol with Cp*TiCl3 in the presence of triethylamine. Their catalytic properties for syndiospecific polymerization of styrene were investigated at different AlMAO/Ti ratio, different AlTIBA/Ti ratio and different polymerization temperature. All four compounds in the presence of cocatalyst methylaluminoxane (MAO) and triisobutylaluminum (TIBA) showed good performance at lower concentrations of titanium, MAO, and TIBA. Especially, (Cp*Ti(OPhMe) 3)/MAO system afforded syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS) with the highest activity and high molecular weight.
