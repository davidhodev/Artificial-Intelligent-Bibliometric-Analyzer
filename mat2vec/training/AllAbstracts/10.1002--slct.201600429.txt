KGaA, WeinheimDynamic and static behavior of the intramolecular π–π interactions between ethylene moieties in diethanodihydronaphthalene (1 a) and the derivatives (2 a–12 a) are elucidated by employing QTAIM-DFA (QTAIM dual functional analysis), which we proposed recently. Total electron energy densities Hb(rc) are plotted versus Hb(rc) – Vb(rc)/2 at bond critical points (BCPs) for the interactions in question in QTAIM-DFA, where Vb(rc) are potential energy densities at BCPs. After analysis of the plots, the π–π interactions in 1 a–12 a are all classified by the pure closed shell interactions and characterized to have the vdW nature with MP2/6-311G(d), except for those in 10 a–12 a, where the ethylene moieties in 1 a are replaced by benzene moieties. The character in 10 a–12 a is predicted to have the typical-HB (hydrogen bond) nature without covalency, although that in 10 a and 11 a seems close to the border area between the two. Indeed, the twisted structures were predicted for 1 a–4 a with MP2/6-311G(d), but the observed non-twisted structures of 1 a–3 a were better reproduced with MP2/6-311G(3d). The typical-HB nature without covalency was additionally predicted for the interactions between ethylene and benzene moieties in 9 a with MP2/6-311G(3d), maybe due to somewhat shorter C … C distances predicted for the interactions in question. The interaction in TS is also discussed exemplified by 10 a (C2v).
