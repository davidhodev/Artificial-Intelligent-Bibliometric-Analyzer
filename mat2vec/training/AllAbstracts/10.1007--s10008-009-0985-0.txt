We apply chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry to trace the effect of the deposition potential on morphological and redox properties of N-substituted polypyrrole films on platinum and ITO in acetonitrile solutions. The goal of these experiments is to check whether certain principle trends observed in the course of the film growth can be used to monitor the deposition process and to control the features of the fabricated polymer. We use STM for morphology characterization, and estimate the film thickness from its redox response in background solution. For titanocene-substituted pyrrole, we compare current transients data on the anodic electropolymerization and the monomer reduction, in order to estimate the mass transport contribution to the polymerization current within various time domains (0.1 ms-1,000 s). On the basis of all these observations, we conclude on the existence of four characteristic regions of deposition current transients and assign them to certain steps in the oligomers formation and the film growth. The region of the current growth is discussed as well in terms of traditional nucleation models. Â© 2009 Springer-Verlag.
