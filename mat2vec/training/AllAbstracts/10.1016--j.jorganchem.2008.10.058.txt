In situ generated cationic (η3-substituted allyl) palladium N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes are air-stable active catalysts for the olefin polymerization of (bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-yl)methyl acetate (5-norbornene-2-methyl acetate) (endo:exo = 7:3). Catalytic activities, polymer yields, molecular weights, and molecular weight distributions of polymers were investigated under various reaction conditions. The catalytic activity was highly dependent not only on the reaction condition such as a solvent or the reaction temperature but also on the structure of the catalyst that include substituents of the allyl group in the catalyst and the counter anion. As the bulkiness of the allyl group increased, the catalytic activity of the catalysts increased. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
