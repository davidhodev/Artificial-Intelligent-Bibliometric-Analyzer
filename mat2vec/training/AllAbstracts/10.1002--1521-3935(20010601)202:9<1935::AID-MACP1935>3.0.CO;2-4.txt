Ethylene and butylene-1 were homo- and copolymerized using monotitanocene catalysts composed of Î·5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl tribenzyloxytitanium [Cp*Ti(OBz)3] and two kinds of solid modified methyl-aluminoxane (mMAO) containing different amounts of residual trimethylaluminium (TMA). The mMAO1 with lower TMA content to activate Cp*Ti(OBz)3 for homo- and co- polymerization of ethylene and butylene-1 showed higher activity and more butylene-1 incorporation in their copolymers than mMAO2 with higher TMA content. Influences of copolymerization conditions including ethylene/butylene-1 ratio in the feed, polymerization temperature and Al/Ti molar ratio on activity, butylene-1 content in copolymers, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, the triad and tetrad sequence distributions and butylene-1 content in the copolymers. The monomer reactivity ratios rE and rB (E = ethylene. B = butylene-1) for ethylene/butylene-1 copolymerizations were estimated from the 13C NMR spectra. The Cp*Ti(OBz)3/mMAO catalyst gave rise to rErB lower than 1. A correlation between the reactivity ratios and mMAO composition was also made. The thermal properties of copolymers determined by DSC are mainly dependent on the butylene-1 content in the copolymers.
