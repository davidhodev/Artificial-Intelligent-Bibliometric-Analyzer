We have studied polymerization of ethylene by half titanocene complexes bearing pyridinethiolate, Cp*Ti(RPyS)Cl2 (RPyS = 2-pyridinethiolate (1), 2-quinolinethiolate (2)). These complexes showed moderate activity in the presence of MMAO as cocatalyst. The activity of complex 1 increased with increasing [A1] / [Ti] ratio, while the complex 2 showed highest activity at [Al] / [Ti] = 100. DSC analysis showed that the resultant polymer was linear. Molecular weight distribution of the polymer obtained by these complexes was significantly narrower than that obtained by non-metallocene type bis(pyridinethiolate) complex.
