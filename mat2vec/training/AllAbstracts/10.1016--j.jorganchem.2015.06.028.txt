© 2015 Elsevier B.V.Norbornene polymerization was conducted with 2-(2,6-diisopropylanilino)-1,4-naphthoquinone-ligated nickel complex (1) activated by B(C6F5)3 and dried modified methylaluminoxane (dMMAO) in toluene at 40 °C. The 1-B(C6F5)3 system showed higher activity than the 1-dMMAO system and gave higher molecular-weight polynorbornene via coordination-insertion polymerization. The solubility of the polymer obtained by 1-B(C6F5)3 was also higher than that obtained by 1-dMMAO, and dissolved in cyclohexane even at room temperature. The self-standing films of the polynorbornene obtained by the B(C6F5)3 system were prepared by the solution casting method with cyclohexane. The films thus prepared showed good transparency in the UV-visible region. The 13C NMR spectra of the polymers indicated that the microstructures of the polynorbornenes were dependent on the activator used. The heat decomposition temperature, i.e., 10% weight loss, determined by TGA was 386 °C for the polymer obtained by 1-B(C6F5)3 and 402 °C for that obtained by 1-dMMAO, respectively.
