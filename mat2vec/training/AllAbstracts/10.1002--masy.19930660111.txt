By means of a multinuclear NMR study of the complexes formed between AlCl3 and either Cp2TiCl2 or Cp2Ti(CH2SiMe3)Cl in methylene chloride solution, isomeric forms of the resulting 1:1 complexes have been detected. The influence of temperature, concentration, ratio of the titanocene chloride to aluminum chloride and nature of the solvent upon the 1H, 13C and 27Al NMR spectra has been investigated. The spectral changes caused by the foregoing factors give compelling evidence for a equilibrium in such Cp2Ti(R)Cl · AlCl3 complexes (R = Cl, CH2SiMe3) between contact ion pairs, Cp2TiR · Cl · AlCl3, and solvent‐separated ion pairs, Cp2TiR+ AlCl4−. Upon experimental variations in temperature, concentration, solvent and ratio of RnAlCl3−n to the titanium catalyst, the polymerization activity of the catalyst system towards ethylene was markedly altered. Such changes in activity support the conclusion that the most active sites for polymerization in such systems are the solvent‐separated ion pairs. Copyright © 1993 Hüthig & Wepf Verlag
