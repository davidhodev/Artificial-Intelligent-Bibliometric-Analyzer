Vinyl-type polymerization of norbornene has been carried out with half-titanocene/MAO catalysts. It was found that the Cp (cyclopentadienyl)-bearing titanocene catalysts afford the polynorbornene at much higher yield than the related Cp * (pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)-bearing one. On the other hand, substitution of - OR ligand for chlorine at the Cp-bearing compound causes remarkbaly increase in catalytic activity. The optimum temperature for the polymerization is 60Â°C. All the polynorbornenes obtained with CpTi(OCH2Ph)3/MAO catalyst are soluble in the organic solvents such as cyclohexane and monochlorobenzene. The FTIR and 13C NMR spectra indicate that the polynorbornene obtained is vinyl-type polymer and has low stereo-regularity.
