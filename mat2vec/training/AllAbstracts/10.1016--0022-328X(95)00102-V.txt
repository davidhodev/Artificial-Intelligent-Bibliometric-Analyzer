Complexes [(C5H5-nMen)2Ti(μ-H)2]2Mg (n = 3-5) separate from the (C5H5-nMen)2TiCl2-2TiCl2-Bu2Mg (Bu = butyl) systems in toluene for Mg-to-Ti molar ratios 1-4 as crystalline materials. Crystal structure of complexes (n = 5 (1): triclinic; P1 (Z = 2); a = 8.887(2) A ̊, b = 12.142(4) A ̊ and c = 18.971(6) A ̊; α = 78.96(2)°, β = 86.29(3)° and γ = 74.82(3)°) (n = 4 (2): monoclinic; C2/c (Z = 4); a = 11.331(1) A ̊, b = 13.177(2) A ̊ and c = 22.989(2) A ̊; β = 99.18(1)°) (n = 3 (3): triclinic; P1 (Z = 4); a = 12.603(3) A ̊, b = 13.629(3) A ̊ and c = 19.561(6) A ̊; α = 70.77(2)° β = 79.36(1)° and γ = 83.41(1)°) revealed a linear TiMgTi arrangement with a pseudotetrahedral coordination of hydrogen atoms around the central magnesium atom. All the compounds show nearly identical electron spin resonance triplet-state spectra at g = 1.990 with D = 0.012-0.013 cm-1 and E = 0, in accordance with a nearly constant Ti(III)Ti(III) distance of 5.54-5.72 Å. The complexes do not induce the polymerization of ethylene on the time scale of a month at room temperature. © 1995.
