Polymers having conjugated enyne moieties in the main chain (3) were prepared by the polymerization of diynes (2) using a low-valent titanocene catalyst (1) generated from Cp*2TiCl2 and i-PrMgBr. The reactivity of the enyne-containing polymers (3) was demonstrated by the thermal cross-linking reaction at 200 Â°C.
