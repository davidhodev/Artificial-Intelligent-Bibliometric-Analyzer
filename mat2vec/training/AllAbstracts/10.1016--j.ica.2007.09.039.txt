Three novel methylene bridged binuclear iron(II) complexes: {[2, 6 -R2 -C6 H3 N {double bond, long} C (CH3) C5 H3 N (CH3) C {double bond, long} N (3, 5 -R2′) C6 H2 -CH2 - (3, 5 -R2′) C6 H2 N {double bond, long} C (CH3) C5 H3 N (CH3) C {double bond, long} N (2, 6 -R2) C6 H3] [FeCl2]2(R,R′ = i-C3H7 (6); R = i-C3H7, R′ = CH3 (7); R,R′ = CH3 (8))} have been synthesized. Activated by Al(i-Bu)3, complex 6 shows very poor activity for the polymerization of ethylene at one bar ethylene pressure, whereas, 7 and 8 exhibit much higher activity than mononuclear iron catalysts {[ArN{double bond, long}C(Me)C5H3N(Me)C{double bond, long}NAr′]FeCl2 (Ar,Ar′ = 2,6-C6H3-i-Pr (9); Ar = 2,6-C6H3-i-Pr2, Ar′ = 2,6-C6H3-Me2 (10); Ar,Ar′ = 2,6-C6H3-Me2 (11))}. The molecular weight (Mw) of PE produced by 7 and 8 are in the range 13.2-46.0 × 104 and much higher than those produced by mononuclear iron catalysts 9 and 10. GPC results demonstrate that 7 and 8 yield PE with a broad/bimodal molecular weight distribution (MWD). In contrast, 9 and 10 yield PE with relatively narrow and unimodal MWD (4.26 and 3.55). Elevating the temperature and Al/Fe molar ratio will narrow the MWD of PE. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
