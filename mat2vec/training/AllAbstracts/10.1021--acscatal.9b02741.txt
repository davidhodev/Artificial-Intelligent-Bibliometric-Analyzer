In this work, to realize multisite cooperativity in a homogeneous catalysis, a series of oligomer catalysts flexibly bearing aluminum(III) porphyrin complexes in the side chains were synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The catalytic performance distinctly outperformed that of the previous molecular metal catalyst under identical conditions: (1) a 3-5-fold increase in activity was observed as approximately four to seven Al centers were anchored in one catalyst chain; (2) the required use of a cocatalyst was reduced by 50-75% (3) 99% polymer selectivity was achieved even at 90 °C; (4) the activity was maintained at a very low catalyst loading ([Al]/PO = 1/100â€»000), with the number-average molecular weight of the resulting copolymer above 200 kg/mol.
