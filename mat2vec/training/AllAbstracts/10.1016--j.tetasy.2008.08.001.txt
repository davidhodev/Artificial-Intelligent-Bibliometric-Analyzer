Several chiral BINADCo(III)X (BINAD = Bis(1,1′-2-hydroxy-2′-alkoxy-3-naphthylidene)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine, X = OAc, CF3CO2, CCl3CO2, OTs, p-NO2PhCO2) complexes were synthesized and used to catalyze the asymmetric cycloaddition of carbon dioxide with epoxides under mild condition to afford chiral cyclic carbonates. The best catalyst of (S,S,S,S)-BINADCo(III)(OAc) 9b and phenyltrimethylammonium tribromide (PTAT) can provide propylene carbonate with the highest ee being 95% at -20 °C. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
