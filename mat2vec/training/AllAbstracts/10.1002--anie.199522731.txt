Zirconocene/methylaluminoxane catalysts made‐to‐measure (with zirconocenes such as 1) facilitate statistical incorporation of bulky cycloolefins such as dimethanooctahydronapthalene into a polyethylene chain. The new cycloolefin copolymers are extremely thermally stable and show very promising properties for optoelectronic and technical applications. (Figure Presented.)
