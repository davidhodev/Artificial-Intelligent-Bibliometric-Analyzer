Copolymerizations of propylene and styrene in the presence of cyclopentadienyltitanium tribenzyloxide (CpTi(OBz)3) and different methylaluminoxanes (MAO) have been investigated. It was found that the composition and structure of the polymerization products are strongly dependent on the amount of free alkylaluminium, involving the residual trimethylaluminum (TMA) in MAO and external one. Propylene-styrene copolymer could be prepared only with the catalyst system containing less TMA. For the copolymerization catalyzed with the titanocene and MAO containing the residual TMA 12.8 mol%, monomer reactivity ratios were estimated to be rP = 4.6 and rS = 0.11. The copolymers contain certain amount of regioirregular monomer-alternating sequences.
