A series of monocyclopentadienyl titanium complexes containing a pendant amine donor on a Cp group (A = CpTiCl3, B = CpNTiCl 3, C = CpNTiCl2TEMPO, for Cp = C 5H5, CpN = C5H4CH 2CH2N(CH3)2, and TEMPO = 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine- N-oxyl) are investigated for styrene homopolymerization and ethylene-styrene (ES) copolymerization. When activated by methylaluminoxane at 70 °C, complexes with the amine group (B and C) are active for styrene homopolymerization and afford syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS). The copolymerizations of ethylene and styrene with B and C yield highmolecular weight ES copolymer, whereas complex A yields mixtures of sPS and polyethylene, revealing the critical role that the pendant amine has on the polymerization behavior of the complexes. Fractionation, NMR, and DSC analyses of the ES copolymers generated from B and C suggest that they contain sPS. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
