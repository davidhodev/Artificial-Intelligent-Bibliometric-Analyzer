A styrenic monomer containing dicylopentadienyltitanium group and 2, 6-pyridinedicarboxylate was synthesized and characterized. A stable and soluble copolymer was obtained by the solution copolymerization reaction between the titanium-containing monomer and styrene. This copolymer is soluble in THF, CH2Cl2 and toluene and exhibit a glass transition temperature of 106Â°C. This titanium-containing polystyrene could be used in the fabrication of the micro-spheres for the inertial confinement fusion(ICF) experiments.
