A new approach for facilitating microstructural controls for syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS), in which, styrene polymerization is conducted in the presence of cyclic olefins and hydrogen, is proposed. Detailed structural analyses revealed that cyclic olefins are not incorporated into the polystyrene main chain; instead, they are capable of interrupting the chain propagation processes by binding onto the active catalyst to form a cyclic-olefin-coordinated active site. Thus, in the presence of hydrogen, chain transfer by hydrogen addition occurs selectively, which leads to the generation of drastically lower molecular weight sPS with a narrower range of molecular weight distribution. Chain end structural analyses of the resulting polymers revealed that styrene polymerization under theses conditions involves a selective chain transfer pathway for providing styrene polymers with uniform chain end structures. A unique method for inducing a selective chain transfer reaction by using non-incorporated cyclic olefins to regulate the chain reaction mechanism is demonstrated. Â© 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
