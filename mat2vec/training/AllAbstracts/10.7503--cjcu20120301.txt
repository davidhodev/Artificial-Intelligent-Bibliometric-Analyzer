The synthesized novel 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic titanium complex was used as catalyst for ethylene and norbornene copolymerization. The polymerization behavior of synthesized titanium complex was typically studied by varying various parameters, types of cocatalyst, concentration of norbornene, Al/Ti molar ratio, polymerization temperature and pressure. The resulting copolymers were characterized by 13C NMR, DSC and GPC. It was found that when methylaluminoxane(MAO) was used as cocatalyst, the catalytic activity was higher than that of triethyl aluminum(TEA) as cocatalyst under the same condition, and the copolymerization reaction mechanism was addition polymerization. In addition, the GPC curves of the copolymers showed a unimodal with a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn â‰ˆ 3). The incorporation ratio of the norbornene linear increased with the increase of norbornene feed ratio, while the melting point of the resulting copolymer was decreased with the norbornene feed ratio.
