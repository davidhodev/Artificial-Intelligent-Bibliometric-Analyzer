Â© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim1-Aryl-2-(triisopropylsilyl)ethane-1,2-diones (SEDs) are proposed here as a new class of visible Type I photoinitiators (PIs) for free radical polymerization under air upon exposure to blue (@455 nm) and green (@520 nm) LEDs. Remarkably, these new systems present good polymerization performances and excellent bleaching properties compared to camphorquinone-based systems, and transparent polymers are obtained upon visible light irradiation. Real-time Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is used to monitor the polymerization profiles. Molecular orbital calculations are also carried out for a better understanding of the structure/reactivity relationship of the photoinitiators.
