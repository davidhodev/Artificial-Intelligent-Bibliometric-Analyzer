All rights reserved.In hopes of extending the existing knowledge on the chemistry of phospholyl and boratabenzene complexes of zirconium, which have shown potential notably as polymerization catalysts, this study aims at exploring the synthesis of mono boratabenzene and mono phospholyl zirconium complexes and at studying their reactivity towards the formation of mixed (boratabenzene)(phospholyl)zirconium complexes. Several derivatives of (η5-phospholyl)Zr(NMe2)xCl3-x and (η6-boratabenzene-NMe2)Zr(NMe2)xCl3-x were synthesized and used as precursors for the formation of mixed (boratabenzene)(phospholyl)zirconium complexes.
