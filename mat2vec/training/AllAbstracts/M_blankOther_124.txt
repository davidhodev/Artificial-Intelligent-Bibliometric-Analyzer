A novel magnesium chloride supported titanocene catalyst was synthesized using a soluble tetrahydrofuran complex of magnesium chloride. The suported catalyst polymerized ethylene with high activities in presence of methylaluminoxane. The significant feature of the supported metallocene catalyst is that it shows high polymerization activity at low Al/Ti ratio and at higher temperatures compared to soluble catalyst. The role of support in stabilizing the active species on the metallocene is discussed.
