The synthesis of Group IV metal complexes that contain a tetradentate dianionic [OSSO]-carborane ligand [(HOC6H2tBu 2-4,6)2(CH2)2S2C 2(B10H10)] (1 a) is described. Reactions of TiCl4 and Ti(OiPr)4 with the [OSSO]-type ligand 1 a afford six-coordinated titanium complex [Ti(OC6H2tBu 2-4,6)2(CH2)2S2C 2(B10H10)Cl2] (2 a) and four-coordinated titanium complex [Ti(OC6H2tBu 2-4,6)2(CH2)2S2C 2(B10H10)(OiPr)2] (2 b), respectively. ZrCl4 and HfCl4 were treated with 1 a to give six-coordinated zirconium complex [Zr(OC6H2tBu 2-4,6)2(CH2)2S2C 2(B10H10)Cl2(thf)2] (2 c) and six-coordinated hafnium complex [Hf(OC6H2tBu 2-4,6)2(CH2)2S2C 2(B10H10)Cl2] (2 d). All the complexes were fully characterized by IR, NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. In addition, X-ray structure analyses were performed on complexes 2 a and 2 b and reveal the expected different coordination geometry due to steric hindrance effects. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy was performed on complexes 2 c and 2 d to describe the coordination chemistry of this ligand around Zr and Hf. Six-coordinated titanium complex 2 a showed good activity toward ethylene polymerization as well as toward copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO) as cocatalyst (up to 1060 kg [mol (Ti)]-1 h-1 in the case of 10 atm of ethylene pressure).
