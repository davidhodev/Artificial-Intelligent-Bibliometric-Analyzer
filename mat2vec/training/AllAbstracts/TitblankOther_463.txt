A trivalent half-titanocene complex [Me2(3-'Bu-2-MeO-5-MeC6H2) Si(CpMe4)]TiCl3 (5b) were synthesized and used as olefin polymerization catalysts. In ethylene and 1-hexene copolymerization, both Ti(III) and Ti(IV) complex catalysts showed good activity and good comonomer reactivity. A big difference in the polymerization behavior between these catalysts was due to a difference of stability of active species. Although the rate of polymerization with Ti(IV) catalyst quickly decreases. Ti(III) catalyst showed a constant activity during polymerization. Ti(III) catalyst also gave high molecular weight polypropylene, polybutadiene, and poly(ethylene-co-5-hexen-1-01).
