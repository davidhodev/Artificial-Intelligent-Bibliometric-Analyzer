The bis(imino)quaterpyridine, 6,6‴-{(2,4,6-i-Pr 3 C 6 H 2 )NCMe} 2 -2,2′:6′,2″: 6″,2‴-C 20 H 12 N 4 (L tripp ), can be prepared in good yield by the condensation reaction of 6,6‴-bis(acetyl)quaterpyridine with 2,4,6-triisopropylaniline; the 2,6-diisopropylphenyl derivative 6,6‴-{(2,6-i-Pr 2 C 6 H 3 )NCMe} 2 -2,2′:6′,2″: 6″,2‴-C 20 H 12 N 4 (L dipp ) is also reported. Reactions of L tripp with 2.5 equivalents of MX 2 (MX 2 = CoCl 2 , CoBr 2 , (DME) 2 NiCl 2 and FeCl 2 ) in n-butanol at 100°C overnight results in self-assembly to form the paramagnetic salts [(L tripp )M 2 X 3 ] 2 [MX 4 ] [M = Co, X = Cl (1a); M = Co, X = Br (1b); M = Ni, X = Cl (2); M = Fe X = Cl (3)] in moderate yield. The molecular structures of the acetonitrile/water adducts 1a(NCMe) 2 , 1b(NCMe)(OH 2 ) and 2(NCMe) 4 reveal that L tripp acts as a bis(tridentate) ligand that can support a range of structural motifs for the cationic units including [(L tripp ) CoCl(μ-Cl)CoCl(NCMe)] + , [(L tripp )CoBr 2 CoBr(OH 2 )(NCMe)] + , [(L tripp ) CoBr(μ-Br)CoBr)] + and [(L tripp )NiCl(NCMe)(μ-Cl) NiCl(NCMe)] + . On activation with MAO (methylaluminoxane), 1-3 show modest activities for ethylene oligomerisation (1a/MAO ∼1b/MAO > 2/MAO) or are inactive (3/MAO). Notably, the two cobalt systems (1a/MAO, 1b/MAO) afford highly linear α-olefins while the nickel system (2/MAO) yields methyl-branched waxes composed of mostly internal unsaturation along with lower levels of α-olefins. In addition to 1a(NCMe) 2 , 1b(NCMe) 2 (OH 2 ) and 2(NCMe) 3 , a single crystal X-ray determination has been performed on the structurally related salt [(L tripp )Ni 2 Br 3 (OH 2 ) 2 ][Br] (4). © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
