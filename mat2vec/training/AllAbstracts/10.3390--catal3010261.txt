A series of novel half-titanocene complexes CpTiCl2[S-2-R-6-(PPh2)C6H3] (Cp = C5H5, 2a, R = H; 2b, R = Ph; 2c, R = SiMe3) have been synthesized by treating CpTiCl3 with the sodium of the ligands, 2-R-6-(PPh2)C6H3SNa, which were prepared by the corresponding ligands and NaH. These complexes have been characterized by 1H, 13C and 31P NMR as well as elemental analyses. Structures for 2a-b were further confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Complexes 2a-b adopt five-coordinate, distorted square-pyramid geometry around the titanium center, in which the equatorial positions are occupied by sulfur and phosphorus atoms of the chelating phosphine-thiophenolate and two chlorine atoms, and the cyclopentadienyl ring is coordinated on the axial position. The complexes 2a-c were investigated as the catalysts for ethylene polymerization and copolymerization of ethylene with norbornene in the presence of MMAO or Ph3CB(C6F5)4/iBu3Al as the cocatalyst. All complexes exhibited low to moderate activities towards homopolymerization of ethylene. However, they displayed moderate to high activities towards copolymerization of ethylene with norbornene.
