Two commercial nanoclays were used here as catalytic fillers for production of polyethylene (PE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) nanocomposites via in situ polymerization with zirconocene/MAO catalyst. It was found that both types of nanoclays designated as clay A and clay B can improve thermal stability to the host polymers as observed from a thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The distribution of the clays inside the polymer matrices appeared good due to the in situ polymerization system into which the clays were introduced during the polymer forming reaction. Upon investigating the clays by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), it was observed that the crucial differences between the two clays are the crystallite sizes (A < B) and the amounts of amine group (A < B). The higher amount of amine group in clay B was supposed to be a major reason for the lower catalytic activity of the polymerization systems compared to clay A resulting from its deactivating effect on zirconocene catalyst. However, for both clays, increasing their contents in the polymerization systems reduced the catalytic activity due to the higher steric hindrance occurring. Â© 2013 Pimpatima Panupakorn et al.
