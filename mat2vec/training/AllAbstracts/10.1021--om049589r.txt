Summary: In reactions of the zirconocene 2-vinylpyridine complex Cp 2Zr(2-vipy) (1) with iBu2AlH and iBu2AlF the isostructural complexes [Cp 2Zr(μ-η1:η2-2-CH2CH- C5H4N)-(μ-W][iBu2Al] (3) and [Cp2Zr(μ-η1:η2-2-CH 2CH-C5H4N)(μ-F)][iBu 2Al] (5) were formed. These complexes can serve as models for the transfer of fluorine from zirconium to aluminum (Zr-F with Al-H to Zr-H and Al-F) found in the reaction of rac-(ebthi)ZrF2 with iBu2AlH to form the dimeric complex [rac-(ebthi)ZrH(μ- H)]2 (6). The compounds are important in obtaining an understanding of the activation of zirconocene fluoro complexes by 'BusAl and of the role of iBu2AlH in activation processes for the catalytic polymerization of olefins.
