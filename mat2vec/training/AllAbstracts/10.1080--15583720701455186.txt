This review summarizes the developments in the area of ROMP-based polymer carriers as well as side-chain and main-chain polymer therapeutics during the period of 1993-2007. The promising emergence of ROMP-derived amphiphilic block copolymers containing therapeutic agents, their assembly into polymer nanoparticles, together with their modification for the targeting group attachment is outlined. Recent application of ROMP-based side-chain polymer therapeutics as multivalent scaffolds and the synthesis of DIVEMA-type main-chain polymers from ROMP-active monomers are also discussed. Finally, an outlook on the opportunities and the future directions in the use of ROMP towards the development of the next generation of polymer therapeutics is provided.
