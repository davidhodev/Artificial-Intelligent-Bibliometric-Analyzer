The synthesis and characterization of two new silicon-carbon bridged ansa-bis(fluorenyl) and ansa-bis(octahydrofluorenyl) zirconocene complexes, (Flu-CH2-SiMe2-Flu)ZrCl2 (3) and (FluH8-CH2-SiMe2-FluH8)ZrCl2 (4) is reported. Complex 3, in combination with methylaluminoxane (MAO), forms an active catalyst system for homogeneous polymerization of ethylene. The molecular structure of 4 reveals a large Centroid-Zr-Centroid angle (131.9°) and an unusually small Cl-Zr-Cl angle (93.2°). The Zr-C bond distances range from 2.48 to 2.64 Å. © 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.
