The olefin polymerization catalytic system iPr(CpFluo)ZrCl 2 /MAO was investigated by UV/ visible absorption spectroscopy in solvents of various polarity at 20°C. It was shown that the UV/visible main absorption band of the zirconocene, which can be related to the Ligand to Metal Charge Transfer bands (LMCT), varies greatly upon incremental addition of MAO or AlMe 3 . For low [AlMe 3 ]/[Zr] or [MAO]/[Zr] ratios (Al:Zr < 20), a hypsochromic shift of the initial iPr(CpFluo)ZrCl 2 absorption band, corresponding to the monomethylation of the metallocene dichloride, is observed. On the contrary, for higher Al/Zr ratios (with MAO uniquely), a bathochromic shift of the metallocene absorption band proceeding in two distinct steps is observed. These two steps are interpreted by the successive formation of associated (or complexed) and dissociated active zirconocenium species. The changes in the absorption spectra of iPr(CpFluo)ZrCl 2 / MAO are correlated with the initial activity observed for hex-1-ene polymerization in the various solvents examined. In the same way, the catalytic activity loss with polymerization time observed at elevated Al/Zr ratios (>1000) with this system is attributed to a reduction of active species concentration, as indicated by the intensity decrease of their UV/visible absorption band. This reveals the low stability of active species formed from iPr(CpFluo)ZrCl 2 compared to those from rac-Et(Ind) 2 ZrCl 2 . © Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1999.
