The opposing effects of activation enthalpy and entropy most likely cause the transition from isotactic via atactic to syndiotactic polypropylene in polymerizations with the soluble metallocene catalyst 1 (X  Ph) and methylalumoxane when the reaction temperature is increased from −50 to +10°C. This proves how important temperature considerations are for structure–reactivity discussions. (Figure Presented.) Copyright © 1992 by VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Germany
