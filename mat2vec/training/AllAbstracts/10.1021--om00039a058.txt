Anions of the type [(C2B9H11)2M]-(M = Fe, Co, Ni) are suitable for use as “noncoordinating” anions with [Cp2ZrMe]+ cations.Catalysts generated from Cp2ZrMe2 and[PhNMe2H] [(C2B9H11)2M] are active for the polymerization and copolymerization of ethylene and α-olefins. Spectroscopic examination of the cobalt complex Indicates that the anion is weakly coordinated to the metal at room temperature. At low temperatures, however, the aniline-coordinated adduct [Cp2ZrMe(NMe2Ph)][(C2B9H11)2M] is present. These catalysts are active in toluene or hexane for the polymerization of ethylene and the copolymerization of ethylene and 1-butene. © 1992, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.
