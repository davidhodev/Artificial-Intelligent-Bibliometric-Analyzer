Three silyl-substituted titanium trichloride complexes [CpSi(CH 3)2X]TiCl3 [X=Cl(1), Me(2), PhOMe(3)] were tested as catalyst precursors for the syndiospecific polymerization of styrene. The catalytic activity increased in the order 123. The highest activity was 2.42×107 g s-PS/mol Timol Sh using complex 1/MAO catalytic system at molar ratio of Al/Ti=2000. The effects of variation on polymerization temperature and Al/Ti ratio on the polymerization of styrene were also studied. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
