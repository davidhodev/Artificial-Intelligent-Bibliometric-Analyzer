Polymerization properties of six dinuclear constrained geometry catalysts (DCGC) were investigated. The different length bridges of three catalysts were para-phenyl (Catalyst 1), para-xylyl (Catalyst 2), and para-diethylene phenyl (Catalyst 6). The other three DCGC have the same para-xylyl bridge with the different substituents at the phenyl ring of the bridge. The selected substituents were isopropyl (Catalyst 3), n-hexyl (Cataylst 4), and n-octyl (Catalyst 5). It was found that the longer catalyst not only exhibited a greater activity but also prepared a higher molecular weight copolymer. The catalyst 3 having a bulky isopropyl substituent revealed the lower activity but formed the highest molecular weight polymer comparing with the other alkyl substituted DCGCs. These results were able to be understood on the basis of the electronic and steric characteristics of the bridge. This study confirms that the control of the bridge structure of DCGC may contribute to control the microstructure of polymers.
