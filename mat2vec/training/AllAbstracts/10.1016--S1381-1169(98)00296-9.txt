The ring-opening metathesis polymerization of dicyclopentadiene with dimethyltitanocene and in situ prepared substituted dimethyltitanocenes was studied. The results showed that at low concentration dimethyltitanocene catalyzed the polymerization of dicyclopentadiene to give linear polymer at 70-90Â°C and that the introduction of oxygen-containing substituents on cyclopentadienyl rings decreased catalytic activity due to a steric effect.
