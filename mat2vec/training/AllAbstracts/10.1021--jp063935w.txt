Poly(N-vinylcarbazole) films can be deposited at the three-phase boundary when the organic phase contains only monomer, N-vinylcarbazole, while the aqueous phase contains supporting electrolyte. A cylindrical platinum microelectrode is immersed into the two-liquid system in such a way that a part of it is located in one liquid and the other part resides in the second liquid. The thickness of the reaction layer, or the width of the microelectrode zone where the polymer grows, depends on the kind of ions present in the aqueous phase and the time of the experiment. The structure of the deposited polymer may be very different and depends on the distance from the three-phase boundary and the type of the anion present in the aqueous phase. The key parameters here are the local electrode potential and the local concentration of the anions. The list of obtained polymer structures includes, among others, arrays of perfectly arranged deep oval channels and groups of microcrystals. The porosity of the polymer deposits increases with the distance from the aqueous phase. Â© 2006 American Chemical Society.
