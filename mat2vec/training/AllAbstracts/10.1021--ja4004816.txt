Dinickel bisphenoxyiminato complexes based on highly substituted p- and m-terphenyl backbones were synthesized, and the corresponding atropisomers were isolated. In the presence of a phosphine scavenger, Ni(COD)2, the phosphine-ligated syn-dinickel complexes copolymerized α-olefins and ethylene in the presence of amines to afford 0.2-1.3% α-olefin incorporation and copolymerized amino olefins and ethylene with a similar range of incorporation (0.1-0.8%). The present rigid catalysts provide a bimetallic strategy for insertion polymerization of polar monomers without masking of the heteroatom group. The effects of the catalyst structure on the reactivity were studied by comparisons of the syn and anti atropisomers and the p- and m-terphenyl systems. © 2013 American Chemical Society.
