A protocol is described in which zirconocene-catalyzed alkene polymerization reactions are terminated by bromine to give polymers containing brominated end groups, Br-polymeryl. Using NMR spectroscopy, the Br-polymeryl groups can be identified as primary or secondary, thus providing information concerning the nature of the Zr-polymeryl linkage(s), and (via integrations) quantified, thus giving information about the relative concentration(s) of the Zr-polymeryl linkage(s). The procedure can in principle give very useful information concerning the nature and concentrations of Zr-polymeryl groups in existence during polymerization processes and is tested through ethylene polymerization by the Cp2ZrMe2/B(C6F 5)3 catalyst system and propylene polymerization by the Cp2ZrMe2/B(C6F5)3, (indenyl)2-ZrMe2/B(C6F5) 3, and rac-{C2H4(1-indenyl)2} ZrMe2/B(C6F5)3 catalyst systems. To this point the resulting data concerning Zr-polymeryl concentrations are generally consistent with data in the literature but are rather more easily obtained. Â© 2005 American Chemical Society.
