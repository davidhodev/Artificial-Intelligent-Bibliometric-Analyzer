The copolymerization of styrene and 1-hexene with the TiCl 4-Al(C6H13)3 • Mg(C 6H13)2 catalytic system has been investigated. The microstructure of polymer chains, molecular-mass characteristics, and thermophysical properties of the resulting copolymers have been studied. These copolymers contain 15 to 65 mol % styrene and mostly consist of isotactic polystyrene and poly(1-hexene) blocks. © Nauka/Interperiodica 2007.
