The syndiotactic and atactic poly (2-N-carbazoylmethyl)styrenes were obtained by a half-titanocene catalyst and a radical initiator for the investigation of photophysical properties, especially excimer formation. The atactic polymer exhibited only monomer emission, but the syndiotactic polymer showed both excimer emission and monomer emission resulting from the partial overlapping arrangement of carbazole pendants. The emission band of syndiotactic polymer was considerably dependent on solution concentration and temperature, however atactic polymer was independent because the excimer formation of syndiotactic helical conformation was more favorable than that of the random coil conformation of atactic polymer.
