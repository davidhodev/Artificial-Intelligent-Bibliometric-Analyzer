The primary silane p-TolSiH3 (p-Tol = p-CH3C6H5) can be polymerized to poly(p-tolylsilane) with 1.0 mol% of both the chiral and achiral zirconocenes Cp2ZrCl2, Cp(CpSi*)ZrCl2, and (CpSi*)2ZrCl2 (Cp = C5H5, CpSi* = C5H4Si(CH3)2-(1R)-endo-(+)-OC10H17) in combination with 2.0 mol% of n-BuLi. Generally, higher molecular weight linear polymers were obtained when using the substituted zirconocenes in comparison to the parent zirconocene, which in turn produced larger quantities of low-molecular-weight cyclic products. Each polysilane sample was analyzed by 29Si{1H} DEPT and 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy. Deconvolution of selected regions of the 29Si{1H} DEPT and the 1H NMR spectra for higher molecular weight linear polymers indicated that these catenates were predominantly atactic, on the basis of a triad level Bernoullian statistical model. The data suggested that, in this case, chiral substitution of the zirconocene rings had no effect on the stereogrowth of the polysilane chain.
