The immobilization of catalytic groups onto a dendrimer either at the core or periphery might give rise to the catalytic properties of catalyst, such as the stability, selectivity, reactivity, etc. These advantageous properties can be defined as a positive dendritic effect. As a novel support, dendrimer is utilized in many catalytic reactions, olefin polymerization being one of them because of the positive dendritic effect and the combination of the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. The appearance of positive dendritic effect in olefin polymerization from the recent literature will be reviewed. The elements contributing to the positive dendritic effect will be discussed, as well as prospects for further work in this field.
