From the reaction of [PtCl2(N-CMe)2] with FcC-N (1) (Fc = Fe(η5-C5H4)(η5-C 5H5)) complex [PtCl2(FcC-N)(N-CMe)] (2) was obtained, which on subsequent treatment with 1 gave trans-[PtCl 2(N-CFc)2] (trans-3). The latter complex and the appropriate cis isomer (cis-3) were also accessible when [PtCl2] or [PtCl2(N-CMe)2] is reacted with a 2.6-fold excess of 1. Appropriate treatment of [PtCl2(N-CMe)2] with two equivalents of 1-acetyl-1'-cyanoferrocene (4) produced trans-[PtCl 2(Fe(η5-C5H4CN)( η5-C5H4C(O)Me))2] (trans-5). Coordination polymer [PtCl2(Fe(η5-C5H 4CN)2)]n (7) was obtained by combining [PtCl2(N-CPh)2] with [Fe(η5-C 5H4CN)2] (6). However, when 7 was reacted with PPh3 for deaggregation, [PtCl2(PPh3) 2] was formed. Addition of FcC-CLi (8-Li) to trans-3 gave pentametallic trans-[Pt(C-CFc)2(NH-CnBuFc)2] (10) via trans-[Pt(C-CFc)2(N-CFc)2] (9). When trans-3 is reacted with two equivalents of nBuLi in the absence of FcC-CH (8), trans-[PtCl2(NH-CnBuFc)2] (11) was obtained, which decomposed to FcC(-NH)nBu (12), giving FcC(O)nBu (13). Electrochemical measurements of the nitrile platinum complexes show no redox separation for the oxidation of the Fc and Fe(η5-C 5H4)2 moieties. Compared with the noncoordinated ferrocenecarbonitriles, a shift to higher potentials is observed. In contrast, for 10 four well-separated redox events (-185, -90, +460, +545 mV) were found, which could be assigned to the oxidation of the Fc units. UV-vis/NIR spectroscopy allowed to determine an IVCT absorption (νmax = 6495 cm-1, εmax = 270 L·mol-1·cm-1, Δν1/2 = 2270 cm-1) for 10+, classifying this mixed-valent species as a weakly coupled class II system according to Robin and Day, while no IVCT transitions were observed for 10n+ (n = 2, 3). The structures of trans-3, cis-3, 10, and FcC(O)tBu (15) in the solid state were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Although the bond distances and angles of trans-3 and cis-3 are similar, the cis isomer crystallizes as a dimer possessing Pt-Pt distances within the sum of the van der Waals radii. © 2014 American Chemical Society.
