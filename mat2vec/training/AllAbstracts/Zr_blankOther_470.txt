Copolymerization of ethylene / propylene and ethylene / 1-butene with two Zirconocene / methylaluminoxane (MAO) catalyst systems were investigated. The influences of Et bridge between two Indenyl groups on the catalyst performances and the properties of copolymer obtained had been discussed. It was found that the activity of bridged Et (Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst was higher than that of nonbridged (Ind)2ZrCl2 catalyst. The copolymers (E / P and E / 1 - B) produced with Et (Ind)2ZrCl2 had higher comonomer content, lower molecular weight, density and melting point compared with those produced with (Ind)2ZrG2.
