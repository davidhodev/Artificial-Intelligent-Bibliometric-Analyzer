The interaction of (η5-C5H5)2ZrX2 (X = Me, Cl) with Al (tBu)3 and alumoxanes [ (tBu)2Al{μ-OAl (Bu)2}]2 and [ (tBu)Al (μ3-O)]n (n = 6, 7, 9) has been investigated. The Lewis acid—base complexes (η5-C5H5)2Zr (X) (μ-X)-Al (tBu)3 [X = Me (1), Cl (2)] have been isolated and characterized by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy. The molecular structure of compound 2 has been obtained by X-ray crystallography, indicating the presence of a Zr (μ-Cl)Al moiety. The Zr (μ-Cl)Al interaction in compound 2 is compared to the Al—Cl bond in [PPN][AlCl- (tBu)3] (4). [ (tBu)2Al{μ-OAl (tBu)2}]2, which contains two three-coordinate (unsaturated) aluminum centers, shows no reaction with (η5-C5H5)2ZrMe2and no catalytic activity toward ethylene polymerization. In contrast, the closed cage compound [ (tBu)Al (μ3-O)]6reacts reversibly to give the ion pair complex [ (η5-C5H5)2ZrMe][ (tBu)6Al6 (O)6Me] (7). The temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant Keq has been determined and, hence, the enthalpy and entropy for the formation of complex 7 [ΔH = -50 (1) kJ mol-1, ΔS = -156 (5) J mol-1 K-1]. Complex 7 is active as a catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene. Polymerization is also observed for mixtures of (η5-C5H5)2ZrMe2with [ (tBu)Al (μ3-O)]n (n = 7, 9) despite the lack of observable complex formation. A solution structure of 7 is proposed upon the basis of NMR spectroscopy and a comparison with [ (Et2O)Li]2[ (tBu)6Al6 (O)6Me2] (8), formed from the reaction of f (tBu)Al (μ3-O)]6with MeLi in Et2O. Upon the basis of NMR spectroscopy, compound 8 exists as either the anti (8a) or syn (8b) isomer as a result of endo or exo methylation of the aluminum centers. The lithium atoms in compound 8 are formally two-coordinate; however, close tert-butyl C—H•••Li contacts suggest the presence of agostic stabilization. These results are discussed with respect to the commercial (η5-C5H5)2ZrMe2- methylalumoxane (MAO) polyolefin catalyst system, and the new concept of “latent Lewis acidity” (ΓAL-O)is proposed to account for the reactivity of the cage hexamer [ (tBu)Al (μ3-O)]6.
