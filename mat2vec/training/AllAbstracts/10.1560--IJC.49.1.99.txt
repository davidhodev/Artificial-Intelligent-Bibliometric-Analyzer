This overview covers the most relevant results obtained by our group in the last few years concerning the synthesis and catalytic applications of metal complexes anchored to the surface of carbosilane dendrimers functionalized with iminopyridine ligands. Nickel dibromide complexes activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO) have been studied for the polymerization of ethylene, whereas cationic palladium(II) derivatives have been applied to the copolymerization of carbon monoxide and tert-butylstyrene. In addition, palladium dendrimers have been tested in the Heck reaction between methyl acrylate and iodotoluene. Correlations between the catalyst activities or reaction products (product distributions, polymer molecular weights, etc.) and the dendrimer generation are discussed and tentative explanations for these correlations provided.
