The complex Ti(Ph2PNpy)(NEt2)2 (2) was prepared by the reaction between 2 equiv of the neutral ligand Pt 2PNHpy (1) and 1 equiv of the homoleptic titanium tetrakis(diethylamine). Complex 2 exhibits two dynamic processes as a function of the temperature. An equilibrium among the diphenylphosphino moieties and a strong agostic interaction between the titanium atom and one of the hydrogens of each of the methylene groups of the diethylamido ligand. The strength of the chelating ligand was studied by its reaction with ethylamine, producing the imido complex 3, showing that during the transformation 2 → 3 the pyridine rings of the ligand are able to dissociate and recoordinate with different stereochemistries. In the polymerization of propylene by complex 2 activated by MAO, elastomeric polymers are obtained. The elastomeric polymers are a result of monomer insertions into two enantiomerically close configuration complexes, as is encountered in cationic nonbridged metallocenes. © 2005 American Chemical Society.
