A series of phenyl-substituted cyclopentadienyl zirconocenes have been prepared by the reaction of the corresponding ligand with n-BuLi and ZrCl4 in toluene, which were characterized by 1H NMR, MS spectra and elemental analysis. Ethylene polymerizations with these complexes in combination with MAO were studied. It is found that the catalytic activity and the molecular weight of polyethylene with one phenyl substituted zirconocene increase with the enhancement of polymerization temperature.
