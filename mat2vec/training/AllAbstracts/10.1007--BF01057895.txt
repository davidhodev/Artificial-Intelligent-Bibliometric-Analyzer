A new class of polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane (POSS) copolymers has been developed by incorporating into a polymer backbone the POSS disilanol macromer, (c-C6H11)8Si8O11(OH)2, along with a variety of inorganic comonomers. These new inorganic cluster-based copolymers were synthesized using a condensation polymerization approach, with formation of metal oxygen bonds and climination of HCl (as HNEt3 Cl) or CH4 driving the reaction. The polymers thus formed are isolated as amorphous powders but do not display any observable glass transition; they decompose without melting at over 400 C under nitrogen. Especially interesting is the formation of a zirconocene-bridged copolymer which is stable to both air and methanol. Â© 1995 Plenum Publishing Corporation.
