This contribution describes the implementation of the binuclear organotitanium "constrained geometry catalysts" (CGCs), (μ-CH 2CH2-3,3′){(η5-indenyl)[1-Me 2Si(tBuN)](TiMe2)}2[EBICGC(TiMe 2)2; Ti2] and (μ-CH2-3,3′) {(η5-indenyl)[1-Me2Si(tBuN)](TiMe 2)}2[MBICGC(TiMe2)2; C1-Ti 2], in combination with the bifunctional bisborane activator 1,4-(C6F5)2BC6F4B(C 6F5)2 (BN2) in ethylene + olefin copolymerization processes. Specifically examined are the classically poorly responsive 1,1-disubstituted comonomers, methylenecyclopentane (C), methylenecyclohexane (D), 1,1,2-trisubstituted 2-methyl-2-butene (E), and isobutene (F). For the first three comonomers, this represents the first report of their incorporation into a polyethylene backbone via a coordination polymerization process. C and D are incorporated via a ring-unopened pathway, and E is incorporated via a novel pathway involving 2-methyl-1 -butene enchainment in the copolymer backbone. In ethylene copolymerization, Ti 2 + BN2 enchains ∼2.5 times more C, ∼2.5 times more D, and ∼2.3 times more E than the mononuclear catalyst analogue [1-Me2Si(3-ethylindenyl)-(tBuN)]TiMe2 (Ti 1) + B(C6F5)3 (BN) under identical polymerization conditions. Polar solvents are found to weaken the catalyst-cocatalyst ion pairing, thus influencing the comonomer enchainment selectivity. © 2005 American Chemical Society.
