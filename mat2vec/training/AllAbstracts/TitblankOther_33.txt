Â©, 2015, Science Press. All right reserved.The Ti incorporated periodic mesoporous organosilicas with benzene or ethane bridging groups in the mesoporous wall were assembled by using mixed tetrabutyl titanate as the titanium sources and tetraethyl orthosilicate as the inorganic silica sources and 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene or 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane as the organic silicon source and triblock copolymer as the structure-directing agent in acidic media through the hydrothermal method. The benzene-bridged mesoporous organosilicas and the ethane-bridged mesoporous organosilicas were signed as Ti-SBA-15-ben and Ti-SBA-15-et, respectively. Meanwhile, the hydrogen peroxide was added to adjust the hydrolysis rate of tetrabutyl titanate and got the sample Ti-SBA-15-ben-H and Ti-SBA-15-et-H. Samples were characterized by N<inf>2</inf> adsorption / desorption, FT-IR, ICP, TG-DSC, UV-Vis and TEM. Results showed that the benzene-bridged mesoporous organosilicas adding hydrogen peroxide during the synthesis process can maintain the best mesoporous structure and the highest activity of four levels of titanium in the mesoporous wall. The periodic mesoporous organosilicas were evaluated in the cyclohexene oxidation with TBHP (tert-butyl hydroperoxide) as oxidant agent. The reaction results were as follows: Ti-SBA-15-ben-H showed the highest catalytic activity and its catalytic reaction is given priority to double bond oxidation products, the cyclohexene conversion and the epoxy cyclohexane selectivity were 26.9% and 32.8%, respectively. Oxidation of cyclohexene catalyzed by Ti-SBA-15-et gave priority to allyl oxidation products such as 2-cyclohexene-1-ketone, the cyclohexene conversion was 8.5% and the 2-cyclohexene-1-ketone selectivity was 41.2%.
