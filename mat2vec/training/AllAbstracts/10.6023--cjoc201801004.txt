Â© 2018 Chinese Chemical Society & SIOC, CAS.Tritertbutylphosphinimine phenoxy titanium complexes (t-Bu3)PNTi(OAr)Cl2 [Ar=C6H5(4a), 2,6-Me2C6H3 (4b), 2,6-i-Pr2C6H3 (4c) and 2,6-t-Bu2C6H3 (4d)] were synthesized via the reaction of corresponding substituted phenol lithium salts with tritertbutylphosphinimine trichloride titanium (3). The compounds were characterized by means of 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 31P NMR spectroscopic and elemental analyses, and the molecular structures of 3, 4b and 4d were further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. When activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO), 4a~4d displayed not only high catalytic activities, but also increasing performances on ethylene polymerization with increasing the sterical hindrance of substituents. Furthermore, 4c depicted a good thermal stability, with which the polyethylene products of different molecular weights and molecular weight distributions can be obtained by tuning the polymerization conditions.
