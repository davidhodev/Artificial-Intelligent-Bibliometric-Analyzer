Copolymers of styrene and a styrene derivative having a Cs symmetrical ligand moiety were synthesized and used as the carrier for the synthesis of supported-type zirconocene catalysts. Propene polymerization was conducted using the resulting catalyst together with methylalumoxane (MAO), which gave syndiotactic polypropene. The productivity of the polymer-supported catalyst (4010 kg PP (mol Zr)-1 for 24 h) was, however, very low compared to that of the corresponding homogeneous catalyst (9130 kg PP (mol Zr)-1 for 20 min).
