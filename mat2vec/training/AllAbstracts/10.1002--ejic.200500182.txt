The Si-Ph bond of PhSi[(CH2)3SiMe2Bz] 3 (5) is cleaved with triflic acid to give TfOSi[(CH 2)3SiMe2Bz]3, which, in turn, reacts with triethylammonium chloride or potassium cyclopentadienide to give, respectively, ClSi[(CH2)3SiMe2Bz]3 (8) and (C5H5)Si[(CH2)3SiMe 2Bz]3 (10). This strategy can be applied to the post-growth incorporation of nucleophiles to the focal point of carbosilane dendritic wedges. In this way, cyclopentadiene-functionalized dendritic wedges of second and third generation C5H5-Gn-[(CH 2)3SiMe2Bz]x (n = 2, x = 9, 11; n = 3, x = 27, 12) have been obtained starting from Ph-Gn-[(CH2) 3-SiMe2Bz]x (6, 7). The metallocenes [{(BzMe2SiCH2CH2CH2) 3-SiC5H4}2MCl2] (M = Ti, 14; Zr, 15) have also been obtained from 10 and their catalytic behavior in ethylene and propylene polymerization, using MAO as a cocatalyst, has been studied and compared to that of related non-dendritic complexes.
