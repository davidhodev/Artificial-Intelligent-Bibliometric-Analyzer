A series of (η5-C5H4R)2ZrCl2 (R = H, Me, Et, iPr, tBu, SiMe3, Me2Ph,) complexes have been used in combination with ethylalumoxane to copolymerise ethene with α-olefins (C5C14) under constant conditions (P = 9-12 bar; T = 50-80°C). Activity decreased substantially for olefin > C8. Variations of the 1-hexene concentration ((CpEt)2ZrCl2 as catalyst) revealed rate enhancement at a 1-hexene/ethylene ratio of 1.0. Copolymer incorporation was low (< 6%) as detected by melting points and 13C NMR spectroscopy. A statistically designed approach (23 factorial) was used to investigate the influence of P,T and [1-hexene] on copolymer formation with (CpR)2ZrCl2 (R = H, tBu). Complex interaction between the variables was detected but the results (R = tBu) were dominated by [1-hexene]. © 1995.
