In the present paper we report the Ziegler-Natta ethene polymerization behavior of a series of [1]borazirconocenophanes in comparison with industrially employed catalysts. The influence of the substitution pattern on steric and electronic parameters was estimated by X-ray diffraction analyses and by 91Zr NMR spectroscopy, respectively. Incorporation of a boranediyl-moiety increases the catalytic activity by up to 3.25 times compared to the parent, non-bridged zirconocenedichloride. The stability of the species after activation was studied, by aging and by interrupting the polymerization for several hours. [1]Borazirconocenophanes proved to form a stable species after activation with MAO, which is even after 20 h still highly active. Â© 2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.
