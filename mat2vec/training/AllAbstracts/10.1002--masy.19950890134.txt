Ab‐initio Molecular Dynamics simulations on ethylene insertion in a bridged di(cyclopentadienyl) methylzirconocene have revealed that the entire reaction path starting from the π‐coordinated ethylene‐zirconocene complex up to and including propyl formation takes place in about 150 femtoseconds, which is unexpectedly fast, and suggesting the absence of any significant barrier of activation. Starting from a reactant structure without α‐H agostic interaction, at T=400 K such an interaction evolves during the course of the insertion reaction and before the propyl is formed. The product state exhibits γ‐H agostic interaction. Copyright © 1995 Hüthig & Wepf Verlag
