A mer configuration of the three fluoride ligands is adopted in their solid-state structures, which is mirrored in solution, as shown by mutual two-bond F-F coupling in their 19F{1H} NMR spectra. For purposes of comparison, the chloride counterparts of 2a and 3a, [{2-(C6H4-2′-O),6-(CM=N(2,6-i-Pr2C6H3)C5H3N}TiCl3] (2b) and [{2-(3-C12H8-2-O)-6-(CM=N(2,6-i-Pr2C6H3))C5H3N}TiCl3] (3b), are also reported. On treatment with excess MAO, 1 is scarcely active in ethylene polymerization, 2a is more active, and the most sterically protected system, 3a, represents the most active nonmetallocene metal-fluoride precatalyst reported to date (340 g mmol-1 h-1 bar-1) and produces ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Similar structure-activity correlations are displayed for chloride-containing 2b and 3b, but, in general, they are significantly more active than their fluoride counterparts, with 3b being the most productive of the series (990 g mmol-1 h-1 bar-1). Using fluoride rather than chloride in the precatalyst has a marked effect on not only the molecular weight but also the molecular weight distribution, with broad dispersities being a feature of the polymers obtained from 2a and 3a, whereas those for chloride-containing 2b and 3b are appreciably narrower. Single-crystal X-ray structures are reported for 1, 2a, 2b, and 3a.
