Two diphenyl ether bridged dinuclear titanocenes, (C5H 5TiCl2)2{[(RC5H3)CH 2](p-C6H4)O(C6H4-p) [CH2(C5H3R)] [R = H(5), Me(6)] have been synthesized and characterized by 1H-NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. In the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO), 5 and 6 are efficient catalysts for ethylene polymerization. The influences of the polymerization conditions such as [MAO]/[Cat] molar ratio, catalyst concentration, polymerization temperature and time have been studied in detail. Compounds 5 and 6 produce 105 g polyethylene (PE)/ (mol Ti h), which is in the same range as that produced by the binuclear titanocenes {(C5H 5TiCl2)2[(C5H4CH 2) (p-C6 H4)(C6H4-p) (CH2C5H4)]} (7) and (C5H 5TiCl2)2(C5H4CH 2 CH2OCH2 CH2C5H 4) (8). However, the molecular weight of PE is somewhat higher than that of PE using 7 and 8. The high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) results show that the molecular weight distributions of PE produced by 5 and 6 (MWD = 6.17 and 7.56) were obviously broader than those of PE produced by 7 (MWD = 4.28) and 8 (MWD = 5.90). The melting points of the PE produced by 5 and 6 are higher than 132°C, indicating a highly linear and highly crystalline PE. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
