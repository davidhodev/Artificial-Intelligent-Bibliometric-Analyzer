A new zirconocene ansa-Me2Si-(2Me-4-p-Tol-cyclopenta[b]indol-3- yl)2ZrCl2 complex (I), in which the Cp ligand is fused with the indole ring, has been synthesized and studied by X-ray diffraction anal- ysis. Light brown crystals are triclinic, space group P1 ; M = 734.92, a = 9.252(2) Å, b = 12.914(3) Å, c = 15.619(3) Å, α = 111.83(3)°, β = 81.03(3)°, γ = 117.77(3)°, V = 1569(3) Å3, Z = 2, ρcalc = 1.525 g/cm3. The structural parameters of complex I are compared with the known bis-indenyl zirconium complexes: rac-Me2Si(Ind)2ZrCl2 (II) and rac-Me 2Si(2Me-2Ph-1-Ind)2ZrCl2 (III) and analogous substituted rac-Me2Si(2,5-Me2-3Ph-6-Cp[b]Tp) 2ZrCl2 (IV) and rac-Me2Si(2,5-Me 2-1Ph-4-Cp[b]Py)2ZrCl2 (V). Complex I alkylated by the Grignard reagent (MgMe2) in the presence of the Al-iso-Bu3 cocatalyst is an effi- cient catalyst for the polymerization of propylene into isotactic polypropylene. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2012.
