On addition of catalytical amounts of transition metal complexes to polymer 6 dehydrogenation occurs and a further crosslinked carbosilane (8) is obtained by formation of new silicon-silicon bonds. Pyrolysis of carbosilane 8 produces a black ceramic material, containing β-SiC together with carbon. The ceramic yield after pyrolysis of 8 is approximately four times the yield obtained when 6 is employed as the starting material. From polymeric 8 preceramic fibers are accessible, subsequent pyrolysis yields ceramic fibers. Moreover, the carbosilane 8 can be utilized as a binder for ceramic powders.
