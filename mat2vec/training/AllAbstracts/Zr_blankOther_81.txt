Copolymerizations of ethylene/1-hexene were conducted using different zirconocene/AIR3/B(C6F5)3 catalytic systems at 50 Â°C. When AIEt3 was used as alkylate agent, very low copolymerization activity was observed with both bridged catalyst Et[Ind] 2ZrCl2 and unbridged zirconocene Cp2ZrCl2 in-situ activated with B(C6F5)3. In appropriate Al/Zr mole ratio using Al(i-Bu)3, the catalytic activities of both zirconocene catalytic systems were similar to those of sophisticated zirconocene/methylaluminoxane(MAO) catalytic system. The catalytic activities, comonomer incorporation and molecular weight of the copolymer synthesized with Et[Ind]2ZrCl2/Al(i-Bu)3/B(C6F 5)3 were higher than those obtained with Cp 2ZrCl2/Al(/-Bu)3/B(C6F 5)3. The effect of the concentration of 1-hexene on catalytic activity, copolymer molecular weight, and comonomer incorporation was investigated. The complicated "co-monomer effect", together with an increase in comonomer incorporation, a decrease in the copolymer molecular weight, was found when the comonomer concentration was increased.
