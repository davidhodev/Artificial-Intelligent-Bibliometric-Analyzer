A novel high-quality polyphenanthrene (PPH) film with electrical conductivity of 10-1 S cm-1 was synthesized electrochemically by direct anodic oxidation of phenanthrene in boron trifluoride diethyl etherate containing 10% concentrated sulfuric acid (v/v). The oxidation onset potential of phenanthrene in this medium was measured to be only 0.91 V versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE), which was lower than that determined in acetonitrile +0.1 mol L-1 BU4NBF4 (1.56 V versus SCE). As-formed PPH films from this medium showed good electrochemical behavior and stability. De-doped PPH films were thoroughly soluble in dimethylsulfoxide or CHCl3. The structure and morphology of the polymer were investigated using UV-visible and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. FTIR and 1H NMR spectra showed that the PPH was grown via the coupling of the monomer mainly at the C4, C5, C9 and C10 positions. Fluorescence spectral studies indicated that PPH was a blue-green light emitter. Â© 2007 Society of Chemical Industry.
