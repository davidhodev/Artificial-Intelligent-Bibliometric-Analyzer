The syndiospecific polymerization of styrene is studied in the presence of titanium complexes with dialkanolamines-bistitanocanes and titanocane-activated by individual MAO or the combined cocatalyst MAO/TIBA. It is shown that these catalysts are more active and stereospecific after their activation with the combined cocatalyst ([TIBA] : [MAO] ≤ 0.13) than that in the case of the activation with MAO: The activities of the catalysts are ≤18 and 9 kg PS/(mol Ti h), and the syndiotacticities of PS are ≤76 and 60%, respectively. Polymers synthesized in the presence of bistitanocanes are characterized by Mn ≤ 4.5 × 104 and Tm ≤ 268°C and a narrow molecular-mass distribution (≤2.5). © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2010.
