© 2016 Elsevier B.V. Theoretical study on the propylene polymerization using ansa-dimethylsilylene(fluorenyl)(amido)dimethyltitanium complexes were performed and related to the experimental results. The calculated activation energies for coordination-insertion of propylene via four different conformations after the first monomer insertion showed that propylene coordinates to the titanium center avoiding the steric repulsion of polymer chain, which was placed toward the amido group. The bulkiness of the amido groups was closely related to the frequency of the chain-migration without monomer insertion, probably because the bulky amido group would force the fluorenyl ligand to coordinate to the titanium center in η1-manner. These theoretical results well explained the experimental ones.
