Two kinds of core-shell polymers (PMMA/PS and PS/PMMA) were prepared separately by semi-continuous seeded emulsion polymerization. PMMA/PS was prepared by polymerization of styrene in the presence of poly(methyle methacrylate) (PMMA). PS/PMMA was prepared by polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) in the presence of polystyrene (PS). Supercritical CO2 was chosen as the solvent and the Cp2TiCl2catalyst was supported into core-shell polymers through the supercritical fluid impregnation. The supported catalysts were characterized through their behaviors during ethylene slurry polymerization. It was found that, when the PMMA/PS-Cp2TiCl2 catalyst was used, the ethylene polymerization rate has a long induce time (about 9 minutes), while when PS/PMMA-Cp2TiCl2 catalyst was used, the kinetic behavior of ethylene polymerization is similar to that of the homogeneous polymerization catalyzed by Cp2TiCl2. The reason for that is the existence of the chemical bond between Cp2TiCl2 and the ester of PMMA, which makes the active material of the catalyst supports mainly on the PMMA section of the core-shell polymers.
