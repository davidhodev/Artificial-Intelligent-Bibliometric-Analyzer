The zirconocene complexes [Zr(η 5 -C 5 H 5 ){η 5 -C 5 H 4 -(CMe 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH=CH 2 )}Cl 2 ] (4) and [Zr{η 5 -C 5 H 4 (CMe 2 -CH 2 CH 2 CH=CH 2 )} 2 Cl 2 ] (5) were synthesised from the reaction of the lithium derivative [Li{C 5 H 4 (CMe 2 CH 2 -CH 2 CH=CH 2 )}] (1) with [Zr(η 5 -C 5 H 5 )Cl 3 ] or ZrCl 4 , respectively. The ansa-zirconocene complex [Zr{Me 2 Si(η 5 -C 5 Me 4 )-(η 5 -C 5 H 3 {CMe 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH=CH 2 })}Cl 2 ] (6) was obtained from the reaction of the lithium precursor [Li 2 {Me 2 Si(η 5 -C 5 Me 4 )(η 5 -C 5 H 3 {CMe 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH=CH 2 })}] (3) with zirconium tetrachloride. Catalytic hydrogenation of 4-6 gave the zirconocene complexes [Zr(η 5 -C 5 H 5 ) {η 5 -C 5 H 4 (CMe 2 CH 2 -CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 )}Cl 2 ] (7), [Zr(η 5 -C 5 H 4 (CMe 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 -CH 3 )} 2 Cl 2 ] (8) and [Zr{Me 2 Si(η 5 -C 5 Me 4 )(η 5 -C 5 H 3 {CMe2CH2-CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 })}Cl 2 ] (9), respectively. Hydroboration of 4-6 with 9-BBN (9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) yielded [Zr(η 5 -C 5 H 5 ){η 5 -C 5 H 4 (CMe 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 BC 8 H 14 )}Cl 2 ] (10), [Zr{η 5 -C 5 H 4 (CMe 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 BC 8 H 14 )} 2 Cl 2 ] (11) and [Zr{Me 2 Si(η 5 -C 5 Me 4 )(η 5 -C 5 H 3 {CMe 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 BC 8 -H 14 })}Cl 2 ] (12), respectively, and the catalytic hydrosilylation of 4-6 with SiHMe 2 Cl gave [Zr(η 5 -C 5 H 5 ){η 5 -C 5 H 4 (CMe 2 -CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 SiMe 2 Cl)}Cl 2 ] (13), [Zr{η 5 -C 5 H 4 (CMe 2 -CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 SiMe 2 Cl)} 2 Cl 2 ] (14) and [Zr{Me 2 Si(η 5 - C 5 Me 4 )(η 5 -C 5 H 3 {CMe 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 SiMe 2 Cl})}Cl 2 ] (15), respectively. The dinuclear complex [Cl 2 Zr{Me 2 Si(η 5 -C 5 -Me 4 )(η 5 -C 5 H 3 {CMe 2 (CH 2 ) 4 SiMe 2 OSiMe 2 (CH 2 ) 4 Me 2 C} η 5 -C 5 -H 3 )(η 5 -C 5 Me 4 )SiMe 2 }ZrCl 2 ] (16) was obtained upon controlled hydrolysis of 15. The zirconocene compounds were tested as catalysts in the polymerisation of ethylene and propylene. Isotactic polypropylene with [mmmrn] pentads of the order of 75 % were obtained with the ansa-zirconocene catalysts, whereas the unbridged metallocene catalysts produced atactic polypropylene. The molecular structures of 4 and 5 were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. © Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 2007.
