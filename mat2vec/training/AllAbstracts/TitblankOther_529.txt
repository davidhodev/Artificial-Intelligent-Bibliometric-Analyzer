Three new titanocene catalysts η5 - cyclopentadienyltri ( tetrahydro - furfuryloxyl ) titanium, η5 - cyclopentadienyl trifurfuryloxyl titanium, η5 - cyclopentadienyl tribenzyloxyl - titanium were synthesized and characterized by elementary analysis, FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MS methods. The syndiotactic polymerization of styrene with these three titanocene catalysts were investigated.
