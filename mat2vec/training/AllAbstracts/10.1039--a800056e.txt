The fascinating story of the discovery of the metallocene-methylaluminoxane catalysts for olefin polymerization is reviewed from its conception up until the first commercial production of polymers. A great number of different titanocenes and zirconocenes have been synthesized that give tailored polymers of totally different structures, and allows control of polymer tacticity, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution to be more efficient. New kinds of copolymers and elastomers can be synthesized.
