Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.An aluminabenzene-alkylzirconium complex having a half-zirconocene structure was synthesized. X-ray crystallographic analysis of this complex revealed a zwitterionic structure consisting of cationic alkylzirconium chloride and four-coordinated aluminate. In the presence of a catalytic amount of this complex, ethylene polymerization could proceed without any additives to form ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
