Organometallic compounds Cp2TiCl2, (EtC 5H4)2NbCl2, and (Pr iC5H4)2WCl2 were assessed as additives that control polymer chain growth in the polymerization of methyl methacrylate. In the presence of compounds mentioned in amounts comparable with that of the initiator, a uniform process with no gel-effect occured and respective linear increase in the molecular weight of the polymer up to high degrees of the monomer conversion was observed.
