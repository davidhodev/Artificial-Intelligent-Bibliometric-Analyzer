Metal-mediated (meth)acrylate polymerizations provide a good example of the versatility and importance of transition metal catalysis in polymer design. This chapter surveys several of these processes with respect to "living" behavior, experimental condition and monomer restrictions, and types of polymer architectures available. In addition to anionic methods, Group Transfer Polymerization (GTP) with silyl enolates or zirconocenes, organolanthanide-and aluminum porphyrin-initiated polymerization, and Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP) are discussed.
