The titanium complex (C5H4-allyl)TiCl3] (2) undergoes olefin metathesis coupling when treated with 3 mol % of [Cl 2(L1)(L2)Ru=CHPh] (L1 = L 2 = PCy3, 4a; L1 = PCy3, L 2 = (H2IMes), 4b) to yield the dimetallic complex [Cl 3Ti(C5H4)-CH2CH=CHCH 2-(C5H4)TiCl3] (5). The allyl-substituted titanocene complex [Cp(C5H 4-allyl)TiCl2] (3) analogously yields the dimetallic system 6 when treated with 4. The ansa-zirconocene complex [Me 2Si(C5H4)(C5H 3-allyl)ZrCl2] (7) cleanly yields the analogous dimetallic coupling product 8 (> 95% isomerically pure), when treated with catalytic amounts of 4b in toluene. Complex 8 gives an active homogeneous ethene or propene polymerization catalyst, especially at elevated temperatures, when treated with excess methylalumoxane.
