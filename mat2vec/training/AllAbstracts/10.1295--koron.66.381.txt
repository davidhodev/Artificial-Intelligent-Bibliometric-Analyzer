We have synthesized polyethylene and polypropylene copolymers having cyclopentane units in the main chain by copolymerization of ethylene and propylene, respectively, with cyclopentene (CPE) or 1,5-hexadiene (HD) using metallocene catalyst. Among the obtained copolymers, poly (ethylene-co-HD), which has 1,3-cyclopentane units in the main chain, shows isomorphism with a transition of the crystalline structure from orthorhombic to hexagonal. We used this finding for the molecular design of a liquid crystalline polyolefin. A liquid crystalline phase was discovered in poly(methylene-1,3-cyclopentane) (PMCP), which was obtained by cyclization polymerization of HD using zirconocene catalysts. PMCPs clearly showed a birefringent texture which indicates a nematic liquid crystalline phase. A high cyclization selectivity of inserted HD units, a high trans-content of the 1,3-cyclopentane unit, and a low molecular weight without crosslinking were necessary to induce the liquid crystalline phase.
