Stereodefined butadienyl phosphines and related derivatives were readily prepared in high yields with perfect regioselectivity via the zirconocene-mediated pair-selective coupling of alkynylphosphines with ethylene or alkynylphosphines with normal alkynes. Interesting and synthetically useful iodination reactions were found when the in situ generated α- phosphinozirconacyclopentenes or α-phosphinozirconacyclopentadienes were treated with I2. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
