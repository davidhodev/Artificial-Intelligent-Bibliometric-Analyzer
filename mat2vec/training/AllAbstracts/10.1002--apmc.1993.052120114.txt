Soluble metallocene catalysts can be easily metered into high pressure polymerization reactors. The performance of a homogeneous zirconocene catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene under high pressures was tested at 1500 bar and temperatures between 80 and 260°C in the presence of methyl aluminoxane as cocatalyst. Besides the productivity of the catalyst and the overall rate of polymerization, the most important properties of the prepared polymers were determined. The results were compared with those found earlier with a heterogeneous titanium catalyst supported on magnesium dichloride. © 1993 Hüthig & Wepf Verlag, Basel
