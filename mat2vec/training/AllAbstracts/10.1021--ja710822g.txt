Cs-Ligated ansa-zirconocene bis- and mono(ester enolate) complexes incorporating the diphenylmethylidene-(cyclopentadienyl)(9-fluorenyl) ligand, upon activation with appropriate activators, are highly active catalysts for the syndiospecific polymerization of MMA at ambient temperature, leading to the production of PMMA with high syndiotacticity (rrrr = 94%) and glass transition temperature (Tg = 139 °C).
