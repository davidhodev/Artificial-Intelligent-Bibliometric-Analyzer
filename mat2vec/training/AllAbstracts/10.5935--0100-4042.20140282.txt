All rights reseved.Taking into account the relevance of polyethylene for modern society and the role of catalysts for the production of this material, in the present work, we carried out a review of the main catalytic systems used in industry and academia. Most systems consist of coordination compounds, whose structural versatility allows the tuning of the characteristics of polyethylene for different applications. The structural aspects and chemical reactivity of such systems are discussed based on the existing literature and experimental data.
