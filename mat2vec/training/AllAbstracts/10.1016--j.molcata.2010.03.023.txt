Various candidate active centers and mechanisms of ruthenium-based olefin polymerization have been investigated by means of DFT. The calculations strongly suggest that the olefin polymerization activity observed for the (bis(oxazoline)pyridine)RuCl2(ethylene)/MAO system is not due to a mononuclear ruthenium center bearing an intact bis(oxazoline)pyridine ligand.
