The initial active site concentrations, [C*]0, have been determined with CH3OT radiolabeling for the Cp2ZrCl2/MAO and CpZrCl3/MAO catalysts (Cp = η5 : cyclopentadienyl, MAO = methyl aluminoxane). Almost all the Zr are found to be catalytically active in 70°C ethylene polymerizations; [C*]0 = [Zr] and [C*]0 = 0.8[Zr] at Al/Zr ratios of 104 and 103, respectively. Lowering the temperature to 50°C and Al/Zr to 5.5 × 102 reduces [C*]0 to 0.2[Zr]. The rate constant of propagation at 70°C was calculated to be 1.6 × 103(M s)−1 for both catalysts at Al/Zr = 1.1 × 104; the values are decreased fivefold and tenfold, respectively, for the CpZrCl3 and Cp2ZrCl2 systems. The usage of 14CO to determine the propagating Zr–P species was investigated. With regard to the time of reaction of 14CO with the polymerization mixture, the initial phase is attributed to reversible CO complexation and reversible migratory insertion. The second slower phase may be due to the formation of enediolate. During the course of a batch polymerization the 14C radioactivity incorporated is small compared to the number of active sites found by CH3OT determination; it is only ca. 10% of [C*]0 at maximum rate of polymerization. Therefore, 14CO radiolabeling cannot be used to count C*. Copyright © 1989 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
