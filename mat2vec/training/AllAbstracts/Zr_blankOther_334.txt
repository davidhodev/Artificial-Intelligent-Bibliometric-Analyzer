Catalytic Pauson-Khand reaction products with norbornadiene could be effectively transformed to trisubstituted cyclopentadienes, which have been used to synthesize a series of unbridged bis(1-R′-2-R-3-R′-trisubstituted cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichlorides 3 (R = R′ = Ph), 4(R = Ph, R′ = Me), 21(R = n-Bu, R′ = Me), 22(R = t-Bu, R′ = Me), 23(R = (CH2)4OMe), R′ = Me), and 24(R = n-Bu, R′ = Ph). The crystal structure of 24 was determined by X-ray crystallography. These zirconium complexes in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO) show activities for the polymerization of ethylene. The activities are in the following order: 21 > 4 > 22 ∼ 23 ∼ Cp2ZrCl2 > 3 ∼ 24. The activity of 21 is four times higher than that of Cp2ZrCl2 under similar conditions. © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.
