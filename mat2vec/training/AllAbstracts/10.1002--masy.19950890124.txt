Structure‐performance relationships in the propene polymerization behaviour of a number of silicon bridged bisindenyl zirconocenes show a rational pattern. Prognosis of the polymerization behaviour of different type structures, however, often fails, which is demonstrated by three examples of new zirconocenes. These include two bisindenyl complexes with two‐membered silicon bridges and one isospecific bridged fluorenyl cyclopentadienyl species. It is thus demonstrated that the scope of a “rational catalyst design” in the field of metallocene catalysts is still limited. Copyright © 1995 Hüthig & Wepf Verlag
