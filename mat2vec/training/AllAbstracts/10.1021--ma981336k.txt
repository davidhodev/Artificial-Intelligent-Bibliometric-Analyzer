The solid-state structure and physical behavior of an elastomeric polypropylene (PP1) synthesized with unbridged 2-phenylindene zirconocene catalyst were examined using solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, wide-angle X-ray powder diffraction, and birefringence measurements of relaxation behavior. Extraction of these elastomeric polypropylenes with boiling ether and heptane yielded three fractions of different molecular weight and tacticity. The ether-soluble fraction is the lowest in isotactic pentad content and exhibits no detectable crystallinity. For the other fractions and the parent homopolymer, the degrees of crystallinity estimated from DSC and WAXD results are similar. The amount of the immobile phase determined by solid-state NMR, however, appears much higher than the degree of crystallinity. An increase in temperature from 20 to 80°C results in a loss in the relative fraction of mobile and immobile phase as measured by solid-state NMR and a corresponding loss in the percent crystallinity as measured by DSC. The relaxation of polymer samples subjected to step shear as a function of increasing temperature was investigated using polarized optical birefringence measurements. These studies revealed that the elastic network remains stable up to temperatures of 80°C. Blends of atactic and isotactic polypropylene with similar average isotactic pentad contents as PP1 and its heptane-insoluble fraction were examined in comparison. Despite their similar taciticities and degrees of crystallinity, the blends show no evidence of a network structure after being subjected to a step shear but instead relax back to an isotropic orientation.
