The ligand effects of homogeneous Ti-based catalysts for the copolymerization of styrene ([M1]) with 4-[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]styrene (TBDMSS; [M2]) were investigated by the UV/visible spectroscopic analysis. Concerning the higher yields from the copolymerization of styrene with TBDMSS, the half-sandwich type of titanocene having π-ligands compared to titanium (IV) butoxide (Ti(OBu)4) having σ-ligands was a more effective catalysts. The silyloxy group exhibiting a negative σ value in the Hammett σ-ρ relationship reduced the activities of titanocenes. The stronger electron-donating substituent on the π-ligand leading to the increase in the catalytic activity in syndiospecific polymerization of styrene contributed to the decrease of the reactivity of the `cationlike' metal center due to both electronic and steric effects. The reactivity ratios, r1 and r2, in the η5-indenyl trichlorotitanium ((Ind)TiCl3)-catalyzed copolymerization of styrene with TBDMSS in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO) ([Al]/[Ti] = 2000) were 0.997 and 7.27 from the evaluation of Finmann and Ross, respectively. The r1r2 product value (7.25) indicates that a block type of copolymer may be produced in a relatively high feed range of TBDMSS to styrene.
