The exfoliation and dispersion of nanoclay particles (0.5 & 2% by weight) in a polymer matrix is analyzed using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and TEM, after a low temperature air plasma etch. The plasma etch preferentially removes the polymer to expose the nanoparticles. SEM analysis illustrate the results of the etching in the top and 45Â° surfaces of nanoclay filled polymer. The 1-28 clay was dispersed in monomeric dicyclopentadine (DCPD) using sonication (3h) and high shear mixing, followed by curing via ring-opening polymerization catalyzed by a Grubbs-type ruthenium catalyst.
