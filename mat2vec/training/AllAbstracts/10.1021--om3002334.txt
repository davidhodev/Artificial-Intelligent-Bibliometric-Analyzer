The observation of weak intramolecular C-H•••F-C interactions in group 4 (σ-aryl)-chelating complexes using NMR spectroscopic and neutron diffraction studies was recently reported. In this work, a new titanium(IV) catalyst precursor supported by a tridentate pyridine-2-phenolate-6-(σ-aryl) ligand, featuring a metal center surrounded by multiple CF 3 substituents, has been synthesized. The nature of intramolecular interactions in the bis(benzyl) complex in solution was probed using multinuclear NMR spectroscopic experiments (including [ 1H, 19F]-HMQC and -HMBC), which reveal scalar coupling across C-H•••F-C interactions between methylene hydrogens and the proximal CF 3 group on the σ-aryl (but not the phenolate) moiety. High activities are observed for ethylene polymerization at different temperatures, which exceed those for the tBu-phenolate congener. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
