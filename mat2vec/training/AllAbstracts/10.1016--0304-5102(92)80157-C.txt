Cyclopolymerization of nonconjugated dienes provides a route to a number of stereochemically complex poly(methylene-1,3-cycloalkanes). The stereochemistry of these polymers derives from both tacticity and cis/trans stereochemistry of the carbocyclic rings. A unique feature of isotactic polymers with a predominance of trans rings is that they contain no mirror elements of symmetry and are thus chiral by virtue of their main-chain stereochemistry. The enantioselective cyclopolymerization of 1,5-hexadiene in the presence of optically active precursors such as (-)-(R)-ethylene-bis(tetrahydroindenyl) zirconium (R)-binaphtholate ([α]435 = -1431°) and a methylaluminoxane (MAO) co-catalyst yields optically active poly(methylene-1,3-cyclopentane) (PMCP) with a molar optical rotation [Φ]28405 of +50.1° (c = 7.8, CHCl3). Since the enantioface selectivity of the chiral zirconocene catalyst with propene is known, the absolute stereochemistry of the polymer can be tentatively assigned if an analogous enantioface selectivity with 1,5-hexadiene is assumed. The enantioselective cyclopolymerization of symmetrical dienes requires both a high enantioface selectivity for olefin insertion and a high diastereoselectivity for olefin cyclization in order to obtain a chiral macromolecular architecture. © 1992.
