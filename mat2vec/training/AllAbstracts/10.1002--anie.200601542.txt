(Chemical Equation Presented) A larger oligomer: Although transition-metal-mediated reactions of alkynes to give dimers, trimers, tetramers, and polymers are well-known, reactions of alkynes to give well-defined oligomers of medium molecular weight (e.g. pentamers, hexamers) are very scarce. The selective hexamerization of HC≡CPh in the reaction with [OsCl(PCP)(PPh3)] (PCP = 2,6-(Ph2PCH2) 2C6H3; see scheme) is a rare example thereof. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.
