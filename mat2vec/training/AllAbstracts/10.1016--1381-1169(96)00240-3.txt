Upon irradiation of a C2-symmetric rac-isomer of an ansa-zirconocene dichloride, an interconversion into the C(s)-symmetric meso-form is observed until a photostationary state between the two diastereomers is reached. The final rac/meso-proportion and the interconversion rate depend on the structure of the different metallocenes. Results of Î±-olefin polymerization catalyzed by [Me2Si(2-Me-4,6-(i)Pr2 Ind)2]ZrCl2 rac and meso, respectively, and methylalumoxane (MAO) as cocatalyst are reported. In propene polymerization the rac-diastereomer shows the higher activity whereas in pentene, hexene, and octene polymerization the meso-isomer is significantly more active. For all polymers a lower molecular weight is found using the meso-diastereomer as catalyst.
