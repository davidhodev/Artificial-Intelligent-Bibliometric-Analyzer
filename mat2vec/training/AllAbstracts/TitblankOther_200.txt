Half-titanocene catalysts (Cp* TiCl 3 ,Cp* Ti(0Bz) 3) supported on MgCl 2/AlEt, (OEt) 3-n were used for ethylene polymerization with a cocatalyst of common inexpensive AlEt 2 Cl. The polymerization conditions such as the cocatalyst, Al/Ti ratio and temperature had significant effects on catalytic activity and properties of the resultant polyethylene. Results showed that the two supported catalysts exhibited high activity in the presence of AlEt 2 Cl with 10 5 g PE/(mol Ti·h) magnitude of order, and the viscometric molecular weight of the obtained polyethylene was higher than 10 5 .In addition, the prepared polyethylene was essentially linear polyethylene according to 13C-NMR and DSC analyses. Compared with the corresponding homogeneous catalyst system, the kinetic curves of polymerization were quite steady during the reaction process. It is recommended that the surface morphology and the internal porous structure of the supported catalyst were beneficial for the dispersion of active species, resulting in the increase of the activity, and the active species anchored on confined space of MgCl 2/AlEt n (OEt) 3-n pores could inhibit the occurrence of β-H elimination reaction.
