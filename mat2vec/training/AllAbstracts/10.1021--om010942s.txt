A remarkably stable diborate anion as the metallocene polymerization catalysts was investigated. The multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonding was obtained in the molecular structure of the amidodiborate anion. In regard with it, the treatment of zirconocene dimethyls that resulted in the obtaining of highly active alkene polymerization catalysts was reported.
