The alkyl hydrido bis(pyrazolyl)borate reagent Tl(MeHB(3-mesitylpyrazolyl) 2) (Tl(MeBpMs), 1) has been prepared and used to generate group 4 metal MeBpMs complexes. The reaction of 1 with ZrCl 4 affords (MeBpMs*)2ZrCl2 (2, MeBpMs* = MeHB(3-mesitylpyrazolyl)(5-mesitylpyrazolyl) -). The reaction of 1 with M(CH2Ph)4 yields (MeBpMs)M(CH2Ph)3 (M = Zr (3), Hf (4)), bibenzyl, and Tl0, via initial MeBpMs/benzyl exchange to produce 3 or 4 and Tl(CH2Ph), followed by thermal decomposition of Tl(CH2Ph). The reaction of 3 with [Ph3C][B(C 6F5)4] proceeds by one-electron oxidation of a zirconium benzyl bond to yield [(MeBpMs)Zr(CH2Ph) 2][B(C6F5)4] (5) and a series of organic products derived from coupling and H atom transfer reactions of trityl and benzyl radicals. The reaction of 4 with [Ph3C][B(C 6F5)4] yields [(MeBpMs)Hf(CH 2Ph)2][B(C6F5)4] (6) along with Ph3CCH2Ph (86%) as the major organic product. The high yield of Ph3CCH2Ph in this reaction suggests that electrophilic benzyl abstraction competes with oxidative M-CH2Ph bond cleavage in this case. The reaction of 3 or 4 with 1 equiv of [H(OEt 2)2][B(C6F5)4] affords [(MeBpMs)M(CH2Ph)2(OEt2)][B(C 6F5)4] (M = Zr (7), Hf (8)). Zirconium complexes 3, 5, and 7 exhibit a stronger tendency for η2-benzyl bonding than hafnium analogues 4, 6, and 8. The cationic species 5 and 6 polymerize ethylene. © 2010 American Chemical Society.
