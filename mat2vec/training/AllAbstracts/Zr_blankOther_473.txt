An investigation has been undertaken by use of ESCA in the characterization of the central metal(Zr) of dichlorozirconocene/methylaluminoxane homogeneous olefin polymerization catalyst. The change of electron density shown by a shift in ESCA signals (181.8 182.7eV) indicates that the catalytic species are "cation-like". Within the range of detecting sensitivity of ESCA spectrometer, only a part of the new catalytic derivative was formed. The influence of complexion time and Al : Zr ratio on the formation of the catalytic zirconocene cation has also been investigated.
