The chemistry of lanthanide chalcogenolate complexes has expanded dramatically in the recent years. This review summarized the syntheses and crystal structures of the lanthanide chalcogenolate complexes and their applications in organic chemistry. Four methods for the synthesis of lanthanide chalcogenolate complexes were outlined: protonolysis, metathesis, oxidation-reduction, and insertion reaction. The lanthanide chalcogenolate complexes were classified according to the ancillary ligands coordinated to lanthanide atoms and the number of lanthanide atoms, and some specific structures were briefly described. The reactivity and catalytical property of some lanthanide chalcogenolate complexes in organic and polymer synthesis along with their luminescent properties are highlighted. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V.
