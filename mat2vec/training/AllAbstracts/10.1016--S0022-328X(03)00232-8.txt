Using 13C- and 1H-NMR spectroscopy, titanium(IV) species formed in the catalytic systems Cp*TiMe3/MAO and Cp*TiCl3/MAO (Cp*=C5 (CH3)5) in toluene and chlorobenzene were studied within the temperature range 253-293 K and at Al/Ti ratios 30-300. It was shown that upon activation of Cp*TiMe3 with methylaluminoxane (MAO) mainly the 'cation-like' intermediate Cp*Me2Ti+←Me --Al≡(MAO) (2) is formed. Three types of titanium(IV) complexes were identified in Cp*TiCl3/MAO catalytic system. They are methylated complexes Cp*TiMeCl2 and Cp*TiMe 2Cl, and the 'cation-like' intermediate 2. Complex 2 dominates in Cp*TiCl3/MAO system in conditions approaching to those of practical polymerization (Al/Ti ratios more than 200). According to the EPR measurements, the portion of EPR active Ti(III) species in the Cp*TiCl 3/MAO system is smaller than 1% at Al/Ti=35, and is about 10% at Al/Ti=700. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.
