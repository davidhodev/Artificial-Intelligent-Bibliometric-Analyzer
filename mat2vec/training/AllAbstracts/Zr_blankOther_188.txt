Polyethylene/montmorillonite (MMT) nanocomposites were prepared via in situ intercalative polymerization. Poly (styrene-co-acrylonitrile) functionalized montmorillonite was first obtained by emulsion polymerization. The functionalized MMT was treated by MAO before being contacted by a zirconocene catalyst. The nanocomposites were prepared by addition and polymerization of ethylene. The exfoliation of the layered silicates in the PE/MMT composites was confirmed by XRD and TEM observation. The higher storage modulus of the PE/MMT nanocomposites and different tan d in comparison with pure PE were revealed by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA).
