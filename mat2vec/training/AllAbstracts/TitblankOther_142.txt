© 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.The catalytic activities of orthometallated ruthenium complex, anchored to macroporous polystyrene beads through the binding of phenylpyridine moiety to the polymer backbone, P-[Ru(phpy)(CO)2Cl]2 (Hphpy = phenylpyridine), has been studied towards the carbonylation reaction of nitroaromatics under various reaction conditions. N, N′-diphenylurea is the main product in presence of acidic co-catalyst while methyl-Nphenyl carbamate is formed predominantly when basic co-catalyst and methanol was present in the reaction medium. Comparative studies have been done with the corresponding homogeneous ones. The polymer anchored catalyst is found to be superior to its homogeneous counterpart in activity, stability and product selectivity. The catalyst can be recycled several times without significant loss of its catalytic activity. A tentative reaction mechanism has been proposed for the carbonylation process on the basis of kinetic studies and the isolation of reactive intermediates.
