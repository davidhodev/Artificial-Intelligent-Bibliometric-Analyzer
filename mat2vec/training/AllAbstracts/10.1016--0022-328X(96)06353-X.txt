The complex Cp2ZrMe(C6H4C≡CSiMe3) (4) has been synthesized by reaction of Cp2ZrMeCl and LiC6H4C≡CSiMe3 (generated in situ from reaction of nBuLi with BrC6H4C≡CSiMe3 at -95°C). Thermolysis of 4 in THF afforded an unsaturated, organometallic polymer [Cp2Zr(C6H3C=CSiMe3)]n (7) in ca. 80% yield (Mw/Mn=4000/2000). Polymer 7 was investigated as a synthon for other unsaturated polymers. It reacts with hydrochloric acid to form a new phenylene-1,1-vinylene polymer [-C(=CHSiMe3)-1,4-C6H4-]n (8), and with sulfur dichloride to give poly(1-trimethylsilyl-2-benzo[b]thiophene) (9). Thermolysis of two similar compounds, Cp2ZrMe(C6H4C≡CCH3) (5) and Cp2ZrMe(C6H4C6H4C≡CSiMe3) (6), did not give polymers.
