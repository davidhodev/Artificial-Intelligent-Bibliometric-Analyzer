A kinetics study of β-methyl elimination reactions of the compounds Cp2ZrNp(μ-Me)B-(C6F5)3 (in various solvents) and Cp*2ZrNp(μ-Me)B(C6F 5)3 (in CD2Cl2) shows that the reactions are accelerated by polar solvents and by steric crowding in the Cp* system, results consistent with previous findings and conclusions that the methyl migrations are accompanied in a concerted process by borate anion departure from the inner coordination sphere of the metal ion. Surprisingly, however, the isobutyl compound Cp*2Zr(i-Bu)(μ-Me)B(C 6F5)3, which is expected to undergo /?-methyl elimination by analogy with an extensive literature on chain transfer processes during propylene polymerization, undergoes very rapid β-hydrogen elimination only. © 2005 American Chemical Society.
