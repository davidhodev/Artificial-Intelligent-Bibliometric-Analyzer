In this work, the reversible chain transfer to Al in ethene polymerization catalyzed by Cp*2ZrCl2/ MAO was studied via comparison of the polymerization in the presence and absence of trimethyl-aluminum (TMA) contained in commercial MAO. It was found that the weight distributions of the products were narrower, in the presence of TMA, at low Al/Zr ratios taken in these experiments. PDIs of about 1.3 or lower were attainable at temperatures up to 70 °C. We propose that a fast to moderate reversible chain transfer between Cp*2ZrR+ and TMA (similar to a catalyzed chain growth mechanism) is the origin of the low polydispersity. Simulation of the polymerization with the proposed mechanism confirmed this hypothesis; the qualitative results are consistent with the experimental trends. © 2009 American Chemical Society.
