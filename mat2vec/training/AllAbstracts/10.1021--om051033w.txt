We present a DFT study of the monometallic group transfer polymerization (GTP) of methyl acrylate (MA) catalyzed by Sm-based and Zr-based metallocenes. The processes examined are the generation of the catalytically active species, the subsequent C-C coupling reaction, and the ring opening of a metallacyclic stable intermediate, resting state of the polymerization process, obtained from the C-C coupling. The mechanism for a neutral zirconocene, a cationic zirconocene, and a neutral samarocene are compared. The isoelectronic neutral samarocene and cationic zirconocene systems share many features, which explains their similar behavior in both the C-C coupling (no energy barrier on the potential energy surface) and the MA-assisted opening of the metallacycle. An analysis of the factors driving polymer stereoregularity in the processes catalyzed by the neutral samarocene and the cationic zirconocene has led to identifying a relationship between stereoregularity and the relative disposition of the acrylate and enolate ligands, as well as the direction of the incoming MA molecule in the opening of the metallacycle resting state. On the basis of these discoveries a kinetic model has been developed, which has proved successful in qualitatively predicting stereoregularity. Â© 2006 American Chemical Society.
