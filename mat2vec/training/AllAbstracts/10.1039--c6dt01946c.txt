Hydrosilane-B(C6F5)3 adducts were found to activate zirconocene dihalides and generate ternary catalytic systems possessing moderate to high activity in ethylene polymerization to high density polyethylene (HDPE). The activation efficacy of the adducts increased with increasing hydride donor ability and decreased with steric crowding of the particular hydrosilane used. NMR investigation of the HSiEt3/B(C6F5)3/Cp∗2ZrF2 system (Cp∗ = η5-C5Me5) revealed the formation of a stable intermediate [Cp∗2ZrF(FSiEt3-κF)]+[HB(C6F5)3]-, whereas a crucial role of the [HB(C6F5)3]- anion as a hydride donor for generation of an active cationic zirconium hydride center was elucidated.
