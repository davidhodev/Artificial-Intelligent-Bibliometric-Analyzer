The Cp 2TiCl-catalyzed SET reduction of aliphatic, α,β-conjugated, and aromatic aldehydes generates reactive α-titanoxy radicals which add readily to styrene and initiate a radical polymerization. The linear dependence of molecular weight on conversion in conjunction with the relatively narrow molecular weight distributions and linear kinetics support the living character of the process which is mediated by the reversible termination of the growing chains with Cp 2TiCl. Investigations of the reaction variables reveal a living polymerization in all cases, but with progressively narrower molecular weight distributions (M w/M n ∼ 1.2) and larger initiator efficiencies (0.7-0.9) with increasing the Cp 2TiCl 2/aldehyde, aldehyde/styrene, and Zn/Cp 2TiCl 2ratios at 70-90 °C for a wide variety of aldehyde structures. Aldehydes are thus introduced as a new class of initiators for living radical polymerizations and may also provide novel avenues for the synthesis of block and graft copolymers. © 2006 American Chemical Society.
