When polymerization of propene was conducted using the C2-symmetrical zirconocenes racEt(2,4,7-Me3Ind)2ZrCl2 (I) and rac-Me2Si(2-Me-4-Ph-Ind)2ZrCl2 (II) combined with Ph3CB(C6F5)4, the isotacticity ([mmmm]) and the melting point (Tm) of the produced polymer markedly increased, along with a decrease of the polymerization temperature from 30 to -78°C. Thus, isotactic polypropene (iPP) with Tm = 168.9°C was obtained from the polymerization with catalyst I at -78°C, whereas the [mmmm] and Tm of iPP were almost unchanged in the same temperature range when the C1-symmetrical zirconocene iPr(3-tBuCp)(3-tBuInd)ZrCl2 (III or III′) was employed.
