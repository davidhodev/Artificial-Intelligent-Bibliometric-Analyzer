The copolymerization of ethylene and N-(vinylphenyl)carbazole (VPC) was carried out with constrained geometry catalysts (CGC) and isopropylidene-bridged zirconocene catalyst. The copolymerization of ethylene and styrene was successfully achieved with half-sandwiched titanocene catalysts which include bridged cyclopentadienyl and amino ligands. It was observed that the copolymer exhibited semicrystalline/rubbery, amorphous rubbery and amorphous/glassy features with increasing styrene content. The results show that the electronic interaction between VPC and the active species affected the reactivity of VPC rather than the steric factor of the active species.
