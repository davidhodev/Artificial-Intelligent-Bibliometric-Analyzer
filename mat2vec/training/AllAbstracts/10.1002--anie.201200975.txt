To protect and serve: The efficiency of TypeI radical photoinitiators for acrylate polymerization is greatly increased by the presence of NHC-boranes. Conversion of the initially photogenerated radicals, R . (see scheme), into strongly nucleophilic NHC-boryl radicals, through hydrogen-atom transfer, gives a better matched radical for subsequent reaction with monomer, ensuring better initiation.
