Propene was polymerized with ethylene bis(-1-indenyl)-dichlorozirconium (Et(Ind)2ZrCl2) and methylalumoxane (MAO) at 70°C. The polymer was fractionated by solvent extraction; there was no hexane insoluble material. The pentane insoluble, hexane soluble (C5iC6s) fraction contains 67% mmmm pentads. It has x-ray crystallinity of 59% comprised of 93% γ-phase, and no NMR detectable misinsertions. However, 1,3-insertion was found in the more soluble fractions. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.
