Recent successful examples for synthesis of new polyolefins containing polar functionalities by adopting the approaches by (a) direct copolymerization of olefin with polar monomer using living radical or coordination insertion methods, (b) direct alkane C-H activation/functionalization (post functionalization of polyolefins), and by (c) controlled incorporation of reactive functionalities (and the subsequent introduction of polar funtionalities under mild conditions) by coordination polymerization in the presence of transition metal complex catalysts have been described. In particular, our recent efforts for precise synthesis of polyolefins containing polar functionalities by (i) efficient incorporation of reactive functionality by copolymerization of ethylene with nonconjugated diene using nonbridged half-titanocene catalysts and (ii) subsequent chemical modifications under mild conditions have been introduced.
