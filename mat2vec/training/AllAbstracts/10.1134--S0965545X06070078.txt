The effect of zirconocene dichloride and its indene-containing derivative on the radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate initiated by benzoyl peroxide has been studied. The influence of the metallocenes on the kinetic parameters of the process and the average degree of polymerization has been established. Concentration and temperature dependences have been measured for the initial rate of reaction and the average degree of polymerization in relation to the content of the components in the systems. The microstructure of poly(methyl methacrylate) prepared in the presence of the used initiation systems has been determined. Â© Pleiades Publishing, Inc., 2006.
