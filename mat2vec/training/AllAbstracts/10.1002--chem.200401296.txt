The dehydrocoupling of the fluorinated secondary phosphine-borane adduct R2PH·BH3 (R = p-CF3C6H 4) at 60°C is catalyzed by the rhodium complex [{Rh(μ-Cl)(1,5-cod)}2] to give the four-membered chain R2PH- BH2-R2P-BH3. A mixture of the cyclic trimer [R2P-BH2]3 and tetramer [R2P-BH 2]4 was obtained from the same reaction at a more elevated temperature of 100°C. The analogous rhodium-catalyzed dehydrocoupling of the primary phosphine-borane adduct RPH2·BH3 at 60°C gave the high molecular weight polyphosphinoborane polymer [RPH-BH 2]n (Mw = 56170, PDI = 1.67). The molecular weight was investigated by gel permeation chromatography and the compound characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, the electron-withdrawing fluorinated aryl substituents have an important influence on the reactivity as the dehydrocoupling process occurred efficiently at the mildest temperatures observed for phosphine-borane adducts to date. Thin films of polymeric [RPH-BH2]n (R = p-CF3C 6H4) have also been shown to function as effective negative-tone resists towards electron beam (e-beam) lithography (EBL). The resultant patterned bars were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). © 2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
