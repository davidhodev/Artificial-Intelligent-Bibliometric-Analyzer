The initial stages of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOTh) film growth on platinum electrodes from TBAClO 4/acetonitrile solution are investigated by means of current-time transient measurements and tapping mode atomic force microscopy. It is shown that, for growth potentials in the range 1.17-1.29 V vs. SCE, the deposition process involves the formation of oligomers in the solution, progressive nucleation of centres of the new phase and three-dimensional growth of a first compact layer followed by a non-uniform distribution of granular-like clusters, whose number and size increase with the synthesis potential and charge. The obtained results reveal that PEDOTh films prepared at distinct potentials but with the same growth charge (Q g) display similar electroactivities. They also depict that the electrochemical behaviour of the films is a function of the charge used for the synthesis, namely the reduction of tick PEDOTh layers (Q g > 20 mC cm -2) includes more that one step, as a consequence of the formation of a two-layered polymer film.
