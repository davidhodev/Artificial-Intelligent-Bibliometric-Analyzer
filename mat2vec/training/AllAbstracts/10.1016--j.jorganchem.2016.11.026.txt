© 2016In this work we describe synthesis of new chloride and alkoxo-titanium (IV) complexes 3–7 with diol O,O-type ligands from readily available and scalable precursors. Structure of complex 6 was established by X-ray diffraction. Titanium atom adopts a tetrahedral geometry formed by three oxygen atoms of ligands and one oxygen atom of isopropoxo group. The resulting complexes 3–6 are moderately or highly active in ethylene polymerization in the presence of {3Et2AlCl + Bu2Mg} binary co-catalyst. Obtained polymers are linear polyethylene of ultrahigh molecular weight (3.7–8.8·106 g/mole) with a broad molecular weight distribution. Polymers are suitable for the modern methods of polymer processing - the solventless solid state formation of super high-strength (breaking strength over 2.3 GPa) and high-modulus (elastic modulus over 150 GPa) oriented films and film tapes.
