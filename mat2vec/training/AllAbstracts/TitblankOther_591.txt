The norbornene/ethylene copolymerization was investigated by using Me 2SiCp 2MtCl 2(Mt = Zr, TO/MAO catalyst system. The copolymerization Kinetics was studied under different conditions. The copolymer was characterized by DSC and 13C-NMR methods. It was found the zirconocene has better catalyst ability for copolymerization of ethylene and norbornene than titanocene. Under similar feed ratio, the copolymers with high norbornene content and glass transition temperature were synthesized compared with literature.
