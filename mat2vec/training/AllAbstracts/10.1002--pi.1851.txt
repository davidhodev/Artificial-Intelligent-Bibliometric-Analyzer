The commercial interest of metallocene complexes for olefin polymerization has led to additional efforts to prepare suitable metallocene complexes efficiently and economically. Ethylene polymerization was carried out with a series of heterogeneous catalysts which were prepared in various Zr/silica ratios by immobilization of Ind2ZrCl2 preactivated with methylaluminoxane (MAO) on silica. This method to form the catalyst system resulted in a polymerization catalyst with reduced fouling tendencies and improved reactor operability. Polymerization of ethylene was conducted in Buchi reactors in a slurry phase under mild pressure. Some of the physical properties of the obtained polymers were also determined.
