All right reserved.With phenylglyoxylic acid and 2959 as raw materials, a novel photoinitiator (BF-2959) was synthesized by esterification, and characterized by UV, FTIR, NMR and elemental analysis. The optimized synthetic conditions of BF-2959 is that phenylglyoxylic acid and 2959 mole ratio is 1: 1.1 and dissolved in toluene with methanesulfonic acid as catalyst, when react at 105℃ for about 6 h, then the yield is 92.1%. The product is colorless and transparent liquid, and the compatibility with resins is good. The maximum ultraviolet absorption peak is at 246.1 nm. In the UV coating test, the optimum dosage of BF-2959 was 4%, the conversion rate of the B-206 polyurethane resins and TMPTA monomer polymerization was 93%.
