Â© 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.Polar groups are introduced into polyolefin chains via the postpolymerization polymer-analogous transformations using the ozonolysis of side ethylidene groups of ethylene (propylene) copolymers with the cyclic comonomer 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene. The copolymers are synthesized using ansa-zirconocene catalysts Me2Si[Ind]2ZrCl2/MAO, Et[Ind]2ZrCl2/MAO and Et[IndH4]2ZrCl2/MAO, which provide insersion of the cyclic monomer into the polymer chain without ring opening. The study of number-average molecular mass and compositions of homo- and copolymers of ethylene and propylene with 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene confirms a high selectivity of the ozonolysis of unsaturated double bonds of polyolefins. The formation of polar groups in the ozonized ethylene and propylene copolymers with 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene is proved by IR and Raman spectroscopy. The thermophysical characteristics of the initial and ozonized copolymers are compared.
