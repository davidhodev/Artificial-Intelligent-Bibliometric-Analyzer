In the coordination polymerization of styrene, selected transition metal complexes of metals other than group 4 elements and non-metallocenes have been investigated in comparison to a known half-metallocene titanium complex with regard to the catalytic activity as well as to the thermal and molecular properties of the polymers synthesized. Whereas iron catalysts lead to syndiotactic polystyrenes, catalysts with nickel as the transition metal result only in atactic polymers with an enhanced isotactic content. In addition to the influence of the transition metal, the effect of a broad variation of the ancillary ligands of a specific half-sandwich titanocene, octahydrofluorenyl titanium trimethoxide, on polymerization activity and polymer properties has been investigated and discussed in detail.
