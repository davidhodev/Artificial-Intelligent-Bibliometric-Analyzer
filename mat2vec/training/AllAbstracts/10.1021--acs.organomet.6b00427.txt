Â© 2016 American Chemical Society.An indene based borata-alkene was used as a reagent for the synthesis of B(C6F5)2-functionalized group 4 bent-metallocene complexes. The respective borata-alkene was prepared by HB(C6F5)2 hydroboration of dimethylbenzofulvene followed by deprotonation with lithium tetramethylpiperidide. Treatment of CpTiCl3 or CpZrCl3 with the borata-alkene gave the respective [(C6F5)2B-indenyl]CpMCl2 bent-metallocene complexes. Both were characterized by X-ray diffraction. The boryl-functionalized metallocenes gave active ethene or propene polymerization catalysts, respectively, upon activation with triethylaluminum.
