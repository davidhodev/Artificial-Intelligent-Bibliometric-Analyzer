Cyclic olefin copolymers (COC) which consists of rigid alicyclic polymer-backbone are attractive materials because of their good heat and chemical resistance as well as their low dielectric constants, nonhygroscopicity, and high transparency. Despite the expectation for copolymerization of cyclic olefins with higher 1-alkene giving new COC, the catalytic systems available for the copolymerization are limited and their activity and the molecular weights of the products were insufficient. ansa-dimethylsilylene(fluorenyl)(t-butylamido) dimethyl titanium complexes (1) conducted living polymerization of norbornene and 1-alkene activated by a suitable cocatalyst. Excellent copolymerization ability of compound 1 also enables the introduction of functional groups in COC via copolymerization of norbornene with functionalized 1-alkenes. Novel COC synthesized by the use of compound 1-based catalytic systems are presented.
