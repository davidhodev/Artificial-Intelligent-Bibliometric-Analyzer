The special issue of Chemical Review reviews the latest advancements in the field of coordination polymerization of polar vinyl monomers by single-site metal catalysts. This type of polymerization is achieved by catalyzed internal chain-transfer processes or by addition of an external chain-transfer reagent (CTR). A number of essential characteristics of polymerization and the resulting polymers are described in each polymerization catalyst or initiator system reviewed in the issue. These characteristics include reaction condition, polymerization activity, polymer tacticity, stereocontrol mechanism, and polymerization control. Coordination polymerization of polar vinyl monomers by single-site metal catalysts will include two major types of coordination polymerization in this review. These two types of coordination polymerization include migratory insertion and conjugate addition.
