A series of 21 dissymmetric dinuclear ansa zirconocene complexes and their ligand precursors have been synthesized and characterized. After activation with methylalumoxane (MAO), these catalysts polymerize ethylene with different productivities and polydispersities in homogeneous and heterogeneous media. The tendencies of these series are shown. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
