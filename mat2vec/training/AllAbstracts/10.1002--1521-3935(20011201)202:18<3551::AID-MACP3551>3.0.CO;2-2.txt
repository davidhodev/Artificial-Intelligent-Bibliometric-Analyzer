The effect of polymerization temperature on the polymerization of 1-hexene with the catalyst systems Cp2ZrCl2/MAO, Me2SiCp2ZrCl2/MAO, EtInd2ZrCl2/MAO, Me2SiInd2ZrCl2/MAO and 1PrCpFluZrCl2/MAO is investigated in this paper. The molecular weight and the molecular weight distribution of poly(1-hexene) provide experimental evidence for a deviation from single-site behavior at certain polymerization temperatures, depending on the catalyst system. Experimental results are interpreted in terms of different active species prevailing at different polymerization temperatures, and coexisting under certain reaction conditions.
