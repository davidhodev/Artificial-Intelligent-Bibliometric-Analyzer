Pyridine-pendent siloxane polymers containing a backbone modified with a zirconocene moiety were synthesized through the hydrolysis-condensation reaction of the mixed precursor solutions of the β-trimethoxysilylethyl-2-pyridine sol in liquor medium and the zirconocene dichloride (Cp2ZrCl2) dissolved in tetrahydrofurane. This polymer, in terms of the polyzirconocenesiloxane-2-pyridine (PZSP), was then evaluated for use as thin coating films (thickness, 0.5-1.0 μm), which provides excellent protection of aluminum (Al) alloys against NaCl-caused corrosion. The PZSP films deposited by simple dip-withdrawing coating methods to Al displayed the impedance of > 106 Ω cm2 after exposure for 40 days in 0.5 N NaCl solution at 25 °C and 3000 h salt-spray resistance. © 1995.
