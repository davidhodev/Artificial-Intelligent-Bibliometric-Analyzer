A tantalum complex of a silicon-bridged tetramethylcyclopentadienyl-phenoxy ligand, Et2Si(η5-C5Me4)(3- tBu-5-Me-2-C6H2O)TaCl3 (2), was prepared by treating TaCl5 with the dilithium salt generated by reaction of the corresponding ligand 1 with nBuLi in the presence of Et3N in heptane. The molecular structure of 2, as confirmed by X-ray analysis, showed a four-legged piano-stool geometry around the tantalum atom and slightly twisted ligand architecture with a bridging diethylsilylene unit. The tantalum complex 2 exhibited moderate catalytic activities for copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene in the presence of iBu3Al/Ph 3C[B(C6F5)4]. The methylation reaction of the trichlorotantalum complex 2 afforded the corresponding trimethyltantalum complex 4. Cationic dimethyltantalum species were generated by treating 4 with an equimolar amount of Ph3C[B(C6F 5)4] or B(C6F5)3 and found to be thermally stable in o-dichlorobenzene-d4, even at elevated temperature. © 2010 American Chemical Society.
