The free-radical polymerization of styrene and methyl methacrylate in the presence of dicyclopentadienyltitanium chloride and dicyclopentadienyltitanium dichloride has been studied. It has been shown that the process proceeds without autoacceleration up to high conversions and is characterized by a linear increase in molecular mass with conversion. On the basis of quantum chemical calculations and ESR spectroscopic data, a scheme describing the growth of polymer chains with participation of organotitanium compounds is proposed.
