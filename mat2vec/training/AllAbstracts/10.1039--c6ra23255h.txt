Alternatively, the same dimeric Ti complex was obtained via wet air bubbling of monomeric LTi(O-i-Pr)2 or addition of the same equiv. of H2O into LTi(O-i-Pr)2. All compounds including LH2 and two titanium complexes were characterized by single crystal X-ray analyses. Newly synthesized terminal oxo-titanium compound is the first example of structurally characterized dimeric terminal oxo-titanium compound having no TiO→Ti bonds. Two titanium complexes were used as effective catalysts for the cycloaddition of CO2 to propylene oxide in the presence of various kinds of cocatalysts such as n-Bu4PBr, n-Bu4NI, n-Bu4NBr, n-Bu4NCl, PPNCl, and DMAP.
