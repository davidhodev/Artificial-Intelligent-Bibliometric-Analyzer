A series of new neutral allyl Group 3 metal complexes bearing ansa-bridged fluorenyl/cyclopentadienyl ligands [{Flu-EMe2-(3-R-Cp)} Ln(η3C3H5)(THF)] (E = C, R = H, Ln = Y (2), La (3), Nd (4), Sm (5); R = t(Bu, Ln = Y (8), Nd (9); E = Si, R = H, Ln = Y (12), Nd (13)) were synthesized in good yields via salt metathesis protocols. The complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, NMR spectroscopy for diamagnetic complexes, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies for 2, 4, 9 and 12. Some of the allyl ansa-lanthanidocenes, especially 4, are effective single-component catalysts for the polymerization of styrene, giving pure syndiotactic polystyrenes (rrrr > 99%) with low to high molecular weights (Mn = 6000-135000gmol-1) and narrow polydispersities (MW/Mn= 1.2-2.6). The catalyst systems are remarkably stable, capable of polymerizing styrene up to 120 °C with high activities, while maintaining high syndiotacticity via chain-end control as established by a Bernoullian analysis. Highly effective copolymerization of styrene with ethylene was achieved using neodymium complex 4 (activity up to 2530kgPS-PEmol-1h-1) to give true copolymers void of homopolymers with Mn = 9000-152000 gmol-1 and narrow polydispersities (Mw/Mn = 1.2-2.5). The nature of the resultant P(S-co-E) copolymers was ascertained by NMR, size-exclusion chromatography/refractive index/UV, temperature rising elusion fractionation, and differential scanning calorimetry. It is shown that, regardless the amount of ethylene incorporated (1-50 mol %), P(S-co-E) copolymers have a microstructure predominantly made of long highly syndiotactic PS sequences separated by single or few ethylene units. Co-monomers feed and polymerization temperature can be used straightforwardly to manipulate with the physical and mechanical characteristics of the P(S-coE) copolymers (molecular weights and distributions, co-monomer content, microstructure, Tm, Tg, Tc). © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
