A new class of organometallic polymer having a backbone of conjugated Poly-yne and Zr-metal atoms has been prepared. Trichloroethylene (TCE) and Hexachlorobutadiene (HCB) are quantitatively converted by n-butyllithium to dilithioacetylene (LiCfeCLi) and dilithiodiacetylene (Li-C=C-C=C-Li) respectively. Quenching with Cp2*ZrCl2 affords high yields of the polymers |Zr(Cp2*)C=C}n and {Zr(Cp2*)C=C-CfeCln where Cp* = C5(CH3)5 = pentamethyl cyclopentadienyl. The Cp2*ZrCl2 and the polymers were characterized by viscosity, molecular weight, elemen-tal analysis, FTIR, NMR spectra, and TGA. Â©1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
