Cationic zirconocene complexes containing BPh 4⊖ coordinated via the meta and para‐carbons of one phenyl ring are isolable when the cyclopentadienyl ligands are of intermediate steric bulk. A novel fluxional process, involving phenyl “ring flipping”, has been observed in complexes like 1 with chiral ligands; such complexes catalyze isotactic polypropylene formation. (Figure Presented.)
