Catalytic hydroboration of ketones with pinacolborane was achieved with a 2D iron(ii) coordination polymer (CP) of a divergent 4,2′;6′,4′′-terpyridine (tpy) derivative under mild conditions with high efficiency. This solid iron catalyst system is more active towards the hydroboration of ketones than that of aldehydes, displaying a different trend of reactivity from known homogeneous iron hydroboration catalysts.
