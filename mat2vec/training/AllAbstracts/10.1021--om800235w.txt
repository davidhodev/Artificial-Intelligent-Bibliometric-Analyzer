The new inorganic/organic hybrid π ligand [Me2C(CStL)(C 2BgHiO)]3 was prepared via a selective deboration of Me 2C(C5H5)(C2B10H 11) with piperidine in ethanol. Treatment of its sodium salt with MCl4(THF)2 gave the mixed-sandwich complexes [{η5:η5-Me2C(C5H 4)(C2B9H10)}MCl2][Na(DME) 3] (M = Zr (4), Hf (5)). Complex 4 reacted with C5H 5Na, KCH2Ph, or NaNH(C6H3-2,6- Pr2i) to afford {[η5: η2- Me2C(C5H4)(C2B9H 10)]Zr(η5-C5H5)(μ-Cl)} (Na(DME)2) (7), [(η5:η5-Me 2C(C5H4)(C2B9H 10))ZrCl-(CH2C6H5)][Na(DME) 3] (8), or [η5:η5]-Me 2C(C5H4)(C2B9H 10)]Zr(NHC6H3Pr2i)(THF) (9), respectively. Both 7 and 8 were stable, and no NaCl elimination was observed upon heating the toluene solution. In the presence of excess MAO (methylalumoxane), complexes 4,5, and 8 were very active catalysts for ethylene polymerization. All complexes were fully characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and elemental analyses. Some were further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analyses. © 2008 American Chemical Society.
