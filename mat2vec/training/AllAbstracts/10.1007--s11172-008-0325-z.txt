A new procedure was developed for the synthesis of a broad range of ansa-zirconocenes containing bis(2-methyl-4-arylindenyl)dimethylsilane ligands. The method is based on the palladium-catalyzed reaction of halogen-substituted bis(indenyl)dimethylsilanes with various organozinc compounds. The aryl-substituted bridging ligands thus prepared serve as the starting compounds for the synthesis of ansa-zirconocenes, which can be used as components of promising catalysts for propylene polymerization.
