© 2015 American Chemical Society. Treatment of trichloride complexes [(PNP)MCl 3 ] (M = Ti or Zr) with 3 equiv of ethyl-Grignard reagent cleanly results in transmetalation followed by β-hydrogen abstraction to form the ethylene-ethyl species [(PNP)M(η 2 -H 2 C=CH 2 )(CH 2 CH 3 )]. In the case of zirconium, we can replace the ethylene ligand with an imido or 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy) to form [(PNP)Zr=N[1-adamantyl](CH 2 CH 3 )] or [(PNP)Zr(bpy)(CH 2 CH 3 )], respectively. The ethylene-methyl derivative [(PNP)Zr(η 2 -H 2 Ci=CH 2 )(CH 3 )] can also be prepared cleanly from the precursor [(PNP)Zr(CH 3 ) 2 (OTf)] and ethyl-Grignard reagent. Using the isotopologue [(PNP)Zr(CD 3 ) 2 (OTf)] we found that α-abstraction is not a pathway to ethylene formation. (Chemical Presented).
