The catalytic activity of Cp2ZrCl2 supported on MgCl2(THF)2 with MAO as a cocatalyst, was investigated in low-pressure polymerization of ethylene. This catalyst system was found to be active [110 kg PE/(g Zr·h)] and stable during the polymerization process. The PE obtained has a narrow molecular weight distribution (MWD); its molecular weight (M̄w) was about 200 000. The kinetic investigation of the polymerization process revealed 12% of the zirconium atoms to be involved in the formation of catalytic active sites.
