Â© 2014 Chinese Chemical Society & SIOC, CAS.Benzimidazole heterocycles have good selectivity for coordination and can form a variety of metal complexes, which exhibit excellent biological, fluorescence and catalytic properties. In this paper, the progress for synthesis of benzimidazoles-containing transition metal complexes and their catalytic activity for ethylene oligomerization and polymerization are summarized, and the influence of the structural factor of complexes such as electronic effect and steric effect of substituent group on the catalytic performance is discussed.
