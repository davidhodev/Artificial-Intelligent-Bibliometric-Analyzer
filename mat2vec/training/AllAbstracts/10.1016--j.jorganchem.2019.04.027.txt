© 2019 Elsevier B.V.A series of C2–symmetric SiMe2-bridged bis-indenyl zirconium complexes containing 2-methyl-4-aryl/isopropyl-5-amino/pyrrolyl-6-alkylindenyl fragments have been synthesized and unambiguously characterized. These complexes activated by MAO demonstrated high catalytic activity in homo- and heterogeneous polymerization of propylene outperforming the traditional Spaleck system. The degree of electronic interaction of aminogroup in pos. 5 with indenyl ring system was tested via computational investigations, and notable influence of aminogroup on electronic structure of the complexes is witnessed by C (indenyl)[sbnd]N bond order and a sum of NAC of the ZrCl2 fragment.
