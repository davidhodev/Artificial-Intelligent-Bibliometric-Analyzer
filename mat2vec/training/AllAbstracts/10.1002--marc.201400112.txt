Cross-linked azobenzene liquid-crystalline polymer films with a poly(oxyethylene) backbone are synthesized by photoinitiated cationic copolymerization. Azobenzene moieties in the film surface toward the light source are simultaneously photoaligned during photopolymerization with unpolarized 436 nm light and thus form a splayed alignment in the whole film. The prepared films show reversible photoinduced bending behavior with opposite bending directions when different surfaces of one film face to ultraviolet light irradiation. A splayed alignment of azobenzene moieties is generated in cross-linked liquid-crystalline polymer films with a poly(oxyethylene) backbone prepared by photoinitiated cationic polymerization with unpolarized light at 436 nm and results in a reversible photoinduced bending with opposite bending directions when different surfaces of one film faced to ultraviolet light irradiation.
