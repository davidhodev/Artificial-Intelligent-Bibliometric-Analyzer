An ethylene-bridged zirconocene complex, (Cp2ZrMe)2(CH2CH2), was prepared by the reaction of Cp2ZrMe2 with a zirconocene - ethylene complex, [Cp2- ZrEt(CH2= CH2)]MgBr, and the structure of this complex was determined by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study. The structure of this complex showed one methyl group on each zirconium and an ethylene ligand simultaneously coordinating to the two zirconocene moieties. Â© 1994, American Chemical Society.
