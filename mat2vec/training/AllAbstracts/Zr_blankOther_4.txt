The oligomerizations of 1-decene have been carried out with zirconocene catalysts ((η 5 -C 5 H 5 ) 2 ZrCl 2 , A; [μ, μ-(Me 2 Si) 2 (η 5 -C 5 H 3 ) 2 ][(η 5 -C 5 H 5 )ZrCl 2 )] 2 , B; [(C 6 H 5 )C(Me) 2 (η 5 -C 5 H 4 )] 2 ZrCl 2 , C; tBuNC(Me) 2 (η 5 -C 5 H 4 )ZrCl 2 , D; (η 5 -C 5 H 4 )C(C 5 H 10 )(η 5 -C 13 H 8 )ZrCl 2 , E; (η 5 -C 5 H 4 )C(Me) 2 (η 5 -C 13 H 8 )ZrCl 2 , F; (η 5 -C 5 H 4 )C(C 6 H 5 ) 2 (η 5 -C 13 H 8 )ZrCl 2 , G) in combination with MAO and the effects of the dosage of complex F, reaction temperature and Al/Zr ratio on oligomerization and properties of oligomers were also investigated. It was found that the structure of ligands with different steric effects and electronic effects affected the catalytic behavior greatly, and determined the oligomer's component and microstructure. Among them, Cp 2 ZrCl 2 , silicon bridged binuclear zirconocene complex B and sterically hindered complex C mainly produced low viscosity oligomers (100℃ Kv: 2~3 cSt, dimer content about 60%); As expected, constrained geometry configuration zirconocene complex D with more open coordination space displayed higher catalytic activity and the kinetics viscosity of oligomer was higher than that of Cp 2 ZrCl 2 (100℃ Kv about 3~4 cSt); It was interested to find that Cs symmetrical zirconocene complexes E, F, G showed higher activity and primarily produced medium-high viscosity oligomers (100℃ Kv>20 cSt), which was attributed to the special structure of the zirconocene catalysts and different polymerization mechanism. The GC-MS results demonstrated that the oligomer mixture was less isomerization and composed of dimer to pentamer. The optimum reaction conditions involved a dosage of complex F 10μmol, a reaction temperature of 80℃, and an Al/Zr ratio of 300:1.
