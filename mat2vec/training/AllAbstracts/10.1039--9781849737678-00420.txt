In this chapter, the papers devoted to NMR application to study synthetic polymers over a period from June 2011 through May 2012 have been reviewed. It includes analysis of primary structure of polymers such as tacticity, regioregularity, end group, sequence distribution (section 2), application of imaging, diffusion and solidstate NMR techniques to characterize the synthetic macromolecules (sections 3 and 4). Finally in section 5, papers devoted to dynamics and polymer blend of the synthetic macromolecules have been surveyed. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.
