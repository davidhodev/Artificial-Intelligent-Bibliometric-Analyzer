A new method was presented for preparing (co-)polyethylene with broad molecular weight distribution (MWD) and high molecular weight employed by the novel heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts via one-pot strategy. The preparation of these catalysts involved the introduction of alkoxy silane compounds as electron donors. The influences of the electron donors structure, as well as polymerization conditions such as temperature, molar ratio of Al/Ti, ethylene pressure and the concentration of 1-hexene in feed on the polymerization performance for ethylene (co-)polymerization, were investigated. The morphology of the catalyst particles was characterized by SEM and Ti content of these catalysts was characterized by ICP. The GPC results showed that the obtained homopolyethylene and ethylene/1-hexene copolymer had the widest molecular weight distribution up to ca 50 when diethoxy-isopropoxy-(t-butoxy)-silane (ED3) was used as internal electron donor. The 13C NMR and FT-IR analysis indicated that these catalysts efficiently catalyzed the copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene.
