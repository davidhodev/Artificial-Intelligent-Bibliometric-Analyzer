β-Diketiminato and 1-aza-1,3-butadienyl-imido complexes [MCl 3{TbtNC(Me)CHC(Me)NMes}(thf) n] (1a, 1b, 1c) and [M( = NTbt)Cl 2{C(Me)CHC(Me)NMes}Li(tmeda)] (3a, 3b, 3c) (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) bearing an extremely bulky substituent, Tbt group (Tbt = 2,4,6-[(Me 3Si) 2CH] 3C 6H 2) showed high activities for ethylene polymerization and ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization (up to 1.1 × 10 7 g of polymer·mol M -1 h -1). Complexes 1a, 1b, 3a, 3b, and 3c could produce ultrahigh molecular weight ethylene/1-hexene copolymers (M w > 4 × 10 6) that were hardly soluble in o-dichlorobenzene under the molecular weight measurement conditions. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
