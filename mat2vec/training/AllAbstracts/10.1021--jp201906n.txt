Palladium(0) nanoclusters having an average particle size of 3.2 nm were generated in situ from the reduction of palladium(II) acetylacetonate in the presence of oleylamine (OAm) during the dehydrogenation of ammonia-borane (AB) in THF under inert gas atmosphere at room temperature. OAm-stabilized palladium(0) nanoclusters were stable enough to be isolated as solid materials and characterized by TEM, HRTEM, XRD, UV-vis, and FT-IR techniques. They were found to be highly active catalysts in the hydrogen generation from the dehydrogenation of AB; in total, 2 equiv of hydrogen gas per AB was generated even at low catalyst concentration and room temperature. The first and second equivalent of H2 generation from AB were completed in ∼20 and 100 min, respectively, from the dehydrogenation of AB in the presence of palladium(0) nanoclusters corresponding to an initial turnover frequency of 240 h-1. 11B NMR study of the reaction shows that hydrogen evolution likely takes place in one or both of two parallel routes: (i) through formation of cyclopolyborazane followed by its polymerization to polyborazylene and (ii) through formation of long-chain B-N linear polymers. Carbon disulfide poisoning experiments indicate that the dehydrogenation of AB catalyzed by OAm-stabilized palladium(0) nanoclusters is heterogeneous catalysis. Moreover, the work reported here includes a wealthy collection of kinetic data to determine the rate law and apparent activation energy for the catalytic dehydrogenation of AB. © 2011 American Chemical Society.
