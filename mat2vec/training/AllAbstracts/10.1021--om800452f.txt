The new inorganic/organic hybrid ligand [NMe3H][Me 2C(C9H7)(C2B9H 11)] was prepared via a selective deboration of Me 2C(C9H7)(C2B10H 11) with piperidine in ethanol. Reaction of the ligand with Zr(NMe2)4 provided the neutral group 4 metal amide complex trans-[η5:η5-Me2C(C9H 6)(C2B9H10)]Zr(NMe 2)(NHMe2) (3) through an amine elimination reaction. Treatment of the trianionic salt of the ligand with MCl4(THF) 2 gave the mixed sandwich complexes trans[{η5: η5-Me2C(C9H6)(C 2B9H10)}MCl2][Na(DME)3] (M = Zr (4), Hf (5)). Complex 4 reacted with KCH2Ph, C 5H5Na, or NaNH(C6H3-2,6-Me 2) to afford trans-[{η5: η5-Me 2C(C9H6)(C2B9H 10)}ZrCl(CH2C6H5)][Na(DME) 3] (6), trans-{[η1:η5-Me 2C(C9H6)(C2B9H 10)]ZrCl(η5-C5H5)}{Na(DME) 3} (7), or [η5:η5-Me 2C(C9H6)(C2B9H 10)]Zr(NHC6H3Me2)(THF) (8), respectively. Both 6 and 7 were thermally stable, and no NaCl elimination was observed upon heating their DME solutions. Complex 4 also reacted with excess NaH in THF to generate the ring-opening product trans-[η5: η5-Me2C(C9H6)(C 2B9H10)]Zr(OCH2CH2CH 2CH3)(THF) (9). In the presence of excess MAO (methylalumoxane), complexes 3, 4, and 6 were active catalysts for ethylene polymerization. All complexes were fully characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and elemental analyses. Some were further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analyses. © 2008 American Chemical Society.
