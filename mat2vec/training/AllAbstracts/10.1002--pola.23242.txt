A procedure where liquid propene is used directly as a dispersed phase in a perfluorinated minoemulsion while maintaining a high monomer concentration inside the droplets throughout the entire polymerization was described. A new type of emulsifier named high-molecular-weight amphiphilic block copolymers based on lipophilic and a fluorophilic block was developed. Propene polymerization was carried out in a BÃ¼chi Glas Uster polymerization autoclave equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermostat, and an upstream propene condensation column. The results show that the prerequisite for the polymerization of liquid propene in a miniemulsion are suitable emulsifier, which stabilize the liquefied monomer inside the fluorous phase. The inorganic and organic supports for metallocenes generate polyolefin particles, and the minoemulsion process controls the product size and morphology in a nanometer scale.
