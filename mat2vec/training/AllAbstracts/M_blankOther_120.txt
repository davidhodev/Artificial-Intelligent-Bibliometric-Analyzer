A novel syndiotactic polystyrene-b-polypropene(sPS-b-PP)copolymer was synthesized in this laboratory with homgenous metallocene catalyst of η 5-cyclopentadienyltripropoxy titanium and MAO. The influence factor of monomers feed ratio, catalyst concentration, Al/Ti molar ratio and polymerization temperature on block copolymerization has been investigated. The copolymerization products were fractionated by succesive solvents extration with boiling butanone, boiling heptane and 40°C THF. The titled block copolymer with 20-30wt % percent of total product, chiefly existing in butanone soluble fraction, were isolated and characterized by 13C-NMR, FTIR, WAXD, DSC methods.
