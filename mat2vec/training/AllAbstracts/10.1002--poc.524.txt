Treatment of 2-(5-methyl-2-furyl)tetrahydroindenyllithium with ZrCl4 gave bis[2-(5-methyl-2-furyl)tetrahydroindenyl]zirconium dichloride (8). Dynamic 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed a Cp-furyl rotational barrier of ΔGArrot≠ (148 K) = 6.8 ± 0.4 kcal mol-1. The x-ray crystal structure analysis of 8 showed the presence of a rac-like metallocene conformation in which the furyl rings are oriented coplanar with the Cp moiety of the tetrahydroindenyl ligand systems, but the two furyl rings are oriented differently: one has the oxygen atom oriented toward the open front side, whereas the other has the furyl oxygen pointing toward the narrow back side of the bent metallocene wedge. The 8-MAO Ziegler-Natta catalyst system produces an atactic polypropylene oil. © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
