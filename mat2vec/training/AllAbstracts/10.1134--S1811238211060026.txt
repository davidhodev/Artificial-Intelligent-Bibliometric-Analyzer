The effect of initiating systems based on substituted and unsubstituted metallocenes; polynuclear macrocyclic semi-and clathrochelates of Fe(II); and metal complexes of Ti(IV), Zr(IV), Fe(III), and Co(III) porphyrins on the free-radical polymerization of MMA and styrene is analyzed. Experimental data are systematized, general relationships are ascertained, and specific features of the process related to the structure of metal-complex compounds and the nature of initiators and monomers are revealed.
