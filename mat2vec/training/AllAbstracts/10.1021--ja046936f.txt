Epoxides and paramagnetic early transition metal complexes are introduced as two new classes of initiators and catalysts, respectively, for living radical polymerizations. Thus, Ti(III)Cp2Cl synthesized in situ from the reduction of TiCp2Cl2 with Zn catalyzes the radical ring opening of oxiranes to initiate the radical polymerization of styrene. A linear dependence of molecular weight on conversion, low polydispersity, and reinitiation of the polymerization in the presence of fresh monomer indicates that the polymerization is living and that it most likely occurs by the reversible endcapping of the macroradical with Ti(III). Moreover, epoxides provide convenient access to alcohol chain ends, suitable for further transformations. Copyright Â© 2004 American Chemical Society.
