Kinetic studies were performed in short-time ethylene polymerization with biscyclopentadienyl zirconium dichloride (Cp2ZrCl2) in conjunction with a methylaluminoxane catalyst system using two solvents, toluene and n-decane. The concentration of active centers ([C*]) and the polymerization rate constant (kp) were greatly dependent on the solvent, that is, 1 mol/mol Zr and 1700 1(mol·s)-1 in toluene, and 0.6 mol/mol Zr and 300 1(mol·s)-1 in n-decane. Moreover, the catalyst activity was increased significantly by introducing a small amount of 1-hexene or propylene as comonomer. From the observed results, the increase in the kp value caused by the comonomer was proposed.
