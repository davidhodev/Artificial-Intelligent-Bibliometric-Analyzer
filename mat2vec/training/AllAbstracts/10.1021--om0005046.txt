Several new, novel bridged and unbridged bis-tetrahydrofluorenyl zirconocenes were synthesized and evaluated as Ziegler-Natta type catalysts for ethylene and propylene polymerization. The complexes were found to be highly stable compared to some bisfluorenylzirconocenes. Polypropylene and polyethylene were produced in good yield using the new catalyst precursors with MAO or Trityl/TIBA as cocatalysts. Both the unsubstituted and substituted bridged bis-tetrahydrofluorenyl zirconocenes were isolated as 50:50 mixtures of rac and meso isomers, which produced mostly atactic polypropylene. Partially crystalline polypropylene was obtained at low temperatures with bis(3-methyltetrahydrofluorenyl)-zirconium dichloride.
