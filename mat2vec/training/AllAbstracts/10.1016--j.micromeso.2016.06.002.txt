Different nanocomposites have been attained by in situ polymerization based on ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and mesoporous SBA-15, this silica being used for immobilization of the FI catalyst bis [N-(3-tert-butylsalicylidene)-2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoroanilinato] titanium (IV) dichloride and as filler as well. Two distinct approaches have been selected for supporting the FI catalyst on the SBA-15 prior polymerization. A study on polymerization activity of this catalyst has been performed under homogenous conditions and upon heterogenization. A study of the effect of presence of mesoporous particles and of the immobilization method is also carried out. Moreover, the thermal characterization, phase transitions and mechanical response of some pristine UHMWPEs and UHMWPE/SBA-15 materials have been carried out. Relationships with variations on molar mass, impregnation method of catalyst and final SBA-15 content have been established.
