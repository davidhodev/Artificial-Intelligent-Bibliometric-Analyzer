The lithium derivatives of the chiral substituent bearing cyclopentadienyl ligands, Li{C5H4(CHRR′)} (R = Pri, R′ = Me (1); R = Pri, R′ = Ph (2); R = But, R′ = Me (3); R = But, R′ = Ph (4)), were prepared via the reaction of alkyllithium compounds with the corresponding fulvene reagent. The mixed cyclopentadienyl zirconocene complexes [Zr(η5-C5H5)(η5-C5H4{CHRR′})Cl2] (R = Pri, R′ = Me (5); R = Pri, R′ = Ph (6); R = But, R′ = Me (7); R = But, R′ = Ph (8)) were prepared via the reaction of the lithium precursors 1-4 with [Zr(η5-C5H5)Cl3]. The symmetrical zirconocene complexes, [Zr(η5-C5H4{CHRR′})2Cl2] (R = Pri, R′ = Me (9); R = Pri, R′ = Ph (10); R = But, R′ = Me (11); R = But, R′ = Ph (12)), were synthesized from the reaction of two molar equivalents of 1-4 with ZrCl4. When the mono(cyclopentadienyl) complexes [Zr(η5-C5H4{CHRR′})Cl3] (R = Pri, R′ = Me (17); R = Pri, R′ = Ph (18); R = But, R′ = Me (19); R = But, R′ = Ph (20)) were reacted with Li(C9H7) the zirconocene derivatives, [Zr(η5-C9H7)(η5-C5H4{CHRR′})Cl2] (R = Pri, R′ = Me (21); R = Pri, R′ = Ph (22); R = But, R′ = Me (23); R = But, R′ = Ph (24)), were obtained. The molecular structure of 11 has been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. 5-12 and 21-24 have been tested as catalysts in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene. Isotactic polypropylene with [mmmm] pentads between 20 and 40% were obtained and their tacticity can be related directly to the structure of the catalyst. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
