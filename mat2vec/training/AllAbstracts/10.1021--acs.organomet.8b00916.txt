However, nickel catalysts usually suffer from poor thermal stability and low copolymer molecular weight. In this work, by combination of design strategies of sterics and electronics, a family of sterically demanding aliphatic/aromatic-substituted phosphine-sulfonate neutral nickel complexes 1-4 {[κ2(P,O)-(menthyl)ArP(C6H4SO2O)]NiMe(pyr)} (1: Ar = (MeO)3C6H2; 2: Ar = 2-(2′,6′-(MeO)2C6H3)C6H4; 3: Ar = 2-(C6H5)C6H4; 4: Ar = 2-(2′,6′-F2C6H3)C6H4) with different sterics and electronics were synthesized and fully characterized by comprehensive NMR spectroscopy, single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and elemental analysis. Among these nickel catalysts, catalysts 1 and 4 are in favor of generating polyethylenes with high molecular weights (up to 224.0 kg mol-1) in high activities (up to 1.6 × 106 g mol-1 h-1) and good thermal stabilities (up to 90 °C), while catalysts 2 and 3 suffer from low thermal stability. More remarkably, the preferred catalysts 1 and 4 are also efficient for ethylene copolymerization with a broad scope of polar monomers including vinyl trimethoxysilane, various allyl monomers, 6-chloro-1-hexene, 6-bromo-1-hexene, methyl 10-undecenoate, and hydroxymethyl norbornene. These copolymerizations exhibit moderate to high activities (up to 18.0 × 104 g mol-1 h-1), high molecular weights (23.9-165.5 kg mol-1), and relatively low incorporations (<2.4 mol %).
