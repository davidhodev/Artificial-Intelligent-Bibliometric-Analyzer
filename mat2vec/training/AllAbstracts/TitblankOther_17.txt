Selected recent topics concerning synthesis of new polyolefins by incorporation of monomers (disubstituted olefins, sterically encumbered a-olefin etc.). which have never been used by Ziegler-Natta. ordinary rnetallocenes. and linked half-Titanocenes. using designed early transition metal catalysts are introduced. Recent catalyst development also enables synthesis of new highly transparent, thermally resistant cyclic olefin copolymers. Synthesis of polyolefins containing reactive functionality with uniform composition has also been achived by incorporation of nonconjugated diene in ethylene copolymerization. or syndiospecifc styrene polymerization in the presence of p-divinyl benzene etc. Recent catalyst developments for stereo-specific olefin metathesis reactions/polymerizations are also introduced: several examples, which proceed via highly as-specific olefin metathesis reactions, arc introduced.
