An alkylthiol functionalized monomer based on 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene methanol (EDTM), namely 3-((2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-2-yl)methoxy) propane-1-thiol (EDTMSHA), was synthesized and confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC/MS). The new monomer successfully produced a self-assembled monolayer (SAM), which was deposited on a gold disc electrode and then electrochemically polymerized. The SAM formation of the new conducting polymer films exhibited relatively low oxidation potentials with a well defined reversible and stable electrochemical behavior compared to conventional electropolymerized film.
