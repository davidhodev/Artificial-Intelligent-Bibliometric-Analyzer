The sequential homo- and copolymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene and 1-octene initiated by Cp2ZrCl2-methylaluminoxane and C2H4[Ind]2ZrCl2-methylaluminoxane homogeneous catalysts yielded reactor mixtures based on HDPE and different amounts of ethylene copolymers with these olefins. The composition and properties of polymeric products formed at the stage of copolymerization are independent of the preliminary homopolymerization of ethylene. The components of the reactor mixtures are capable of cocrystallization directly in the course of synthesis. The synthesized reactor mixtures based on HDPE and ethylene-1-hexene copolymers which surpass linear LDPE in tensile strength possess good plastic properties and a high melt flow index.
