Under certain conditions (150Â°C, P(C2H4) = 1.4 MPa), the oligomerization of ethylene catalyzed by Cp2ZrCl2/EAO (ethylaluminoxane), Et3Al or (i-Bu)3Al afforded methylenecyclopentane (MCP) along with chain oligomers. The nature of cocatalysts and the Al/Zr ratios as well as the hydrolysis extent of Et3Al have tangible effects on the selectivity of the cyclic oligomer. With Et3Al as cocatalyst under optimal conditions, the oligomerization of ethylene gave MCP and C4-C10 chain olefins in a ratio of 45/55. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.
