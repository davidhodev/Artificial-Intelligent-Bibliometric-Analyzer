The reaction of [CPh3][B(C6F4R)4] with [Cp′2-ZrH2]2 (Cp′ = C5H4SiMe3) gives the new binuclear hydrido complexes [Cp′4Zr2H3][B(C6F 4R)4J (R = F, SiPr3i), which are highly active initiators for the polymerization of isobutene and isobutene - isoprene copolymerizations at near-zero concentrations of ionizing solvents. The structure of the trinuclear hydride [Cp′5(η1:η5-C5H 3-SiMe3)Zr3H4J+[B(C 6F4SiPri3)4]- is reported.
