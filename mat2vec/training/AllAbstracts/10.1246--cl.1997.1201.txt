The reaction of dilithiated silylene-bridged Cp-ligands, whose silylene had one or two vinyl substituents, with ZrCl4 gave racemo-rich mixtures of the complex RR′Si(C5H2-2,4-Me2)2ZrCl 2 (1: R = vinyl, R′ = Me, rac/meso = 77/23, 4: R = R′ = vinyl, rac/meso = 77/23). The pure racemic complex 1-rac was isolated after several recrystallization processes in a satisfactory yield (31%, rac/meso > 99/1) and was structurally characterized. Polymerization of propylene with 1-rac/MAO gave highly isotactic polypropylene.
