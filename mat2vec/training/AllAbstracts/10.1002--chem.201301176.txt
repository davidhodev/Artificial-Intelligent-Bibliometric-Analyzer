Long chain running: The polymerization performance of guanidinato titanium(IV) olefin catalysts is tuned by monodentate ancillary ligands. Polymerization activities of up to 8800 kgPE molcat. -1 h-1 bar-1 together with molecular weights of 2500 kg mol-1 were observed (see figure; d-MAO=dry methylalumoxane). Ligand transfer of the additional donor ligands has to be avoided. Copyright Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
