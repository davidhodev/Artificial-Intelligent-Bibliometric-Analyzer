Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.We report here the synthesis of two new ansa-bridged permethylindenyl zirconocenes, their reaction with solid polymethylaluminoxane (sMAO) and their use in slurry phase ethylene polymerisation. Meso-(EBI*)Zr(CH2Ph)2and meso-(EBI*)Zr(CH2tBu)Cl, (EBI* = ethylenebis[1-(2,3,4,5,6,7-hexamethylindenyl)]) were synthesised from meso-(EBI*)ZrCl2and KCH2Ph and LiCH2tBu respectively. The new zirconocenes were characterised by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, and density functional theory calculations were carried out. Solid precatalysts were obtained when these compounds were reacted with the polymethylaluminoxane support. Ethylene polymerisation activities of up to 6000 kgPE/molZr/h/bar were obtained in the slurry polymerisation of ethylene. The polyethylenes showed molecular weights, Mw, above 200 000 kg/mol and low polydispersities, Mw/Mn < 3.
