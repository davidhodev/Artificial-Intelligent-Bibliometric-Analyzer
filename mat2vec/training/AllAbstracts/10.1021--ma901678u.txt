The 2,1-insertion of propylene which was controlled by the bridging substituents to produce high molecular weight polypropylene (PP), and additionally found reasonable correlation between Mw and 2,1-content of PP has been demonstrated. Single-site polymerization catalysts have attracted great interest in terms of their highly controllable polymerization performance based on precise design of catalyst architecture and their industrial applications. All PHENICS-Ti similarly exhibited high polymerization activities, and generally afforded high molecular weight PP. silicon atom. The proposed mechanisms are also applicable to the copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene, where PHENICS ligand hampers 2,1-insertion of 1 -hexene to yield high molecular weight copolymer. The mechanisms described are also applicable to the copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene, where PHENICS ligand hampers 2,1-insertion of 1-hexene to yield high M wcopolymer.
