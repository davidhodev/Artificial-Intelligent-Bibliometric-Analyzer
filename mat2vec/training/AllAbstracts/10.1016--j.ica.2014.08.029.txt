© 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.Three bulky cyclopentadienyltitanium aryloxide complexes, [Ti(η5-C5Me4Ar)(O-2,6-tBu2C6H3)Cl2], (Ar = C6H5(4), 4-iPrC6H4(5), 4-Me3SiC6H4(6)) have been synthesized from reaction of the corresponding cyclopentadienyltitanium trichloride derivatives with 1 equiv of LiO-2,6-tBu2C6H3. These half-sandwich complexes 4-6 have been characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The molecular structure of complexes 4 and 6 has been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. When activated with iBu3Al and Ph3C+B(C6F5)4-, complexes 4-6 exhibits reasonable catalytic activity for ethylene polymerization, producing moderate molecular weight polyethylenes.
