Poly(methylene-1,3-cyclopentane) (PMCP), which is composed with alternating linkage of methylene and 1,3-cyclopentane unit, was synthesized by cyclization polymerization of 1,5-hexadiene (HD) with various metallocene catalysts. The optically active PMCP samples were prepared by cyclization polymerization of HD with an optically active zirconocene catalyst, [(+)-(S,S)-ethylene-1,2- bis(n5-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-indenyl)- 1,1'-bi-2-naphtholate], combined with methylaluminoxane (MAO) as a cocatalyst in the presence of triethylaluminum (A1Et3) as a chain transfer reagent to control the molecular weight in toluene at room temperature. The PMCP samples obtained with the optically active zirconocene catalyst show optical rotation in chloroform solution. The MnS of the PMCP samples were measured by gel-permeation chromatography and relatively calibrated with standard polystyrene samples. The birefringent texture of PMCP with relatively high molecular weight showed the fingerprint texture indicating cholesteric liquid crystal.
