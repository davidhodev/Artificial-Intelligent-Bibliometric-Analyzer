Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.The synthesis of mono- and bi-supported Ziegler-Natta catalysts using magnesium etoxide Mg(OEt)2 and graphene oxide (GO) as catalyst support for production of Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) is reported in this investigation. Nano-graphene oxide was prepared by the modified Hummer's method and its structure was analyzed by XRD and FTIR indicating the presence of hydroxyl groups on graphene oxide and the formation of an exfoliated structure. The activity of TiCl4/Mg(OEt)2, TiCl4/Mg(OEt)2-GO, and TiCl4/GO catalysts in terms of grams of PE produced per mmol of Ti per hour was experimentally obtained for catalysts with different ratios of co-catalyst (triisobutylaluminium) to TiCl4. For all three series of catalysts, the activity curve showed an optimum point at a specific Al/Ti molar ratio. Catalyst activity was highest for TiCl4/Mg(OEt)2 and lowest for TiCl4/GO. The characterization of UHMWPE products indicated that the viscosity average molecular weight (Mv) was highest for the polymer produced by TiCl4/Mg(OEt)2 and lowest for the polymer produced by TiCl4/GO. Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), and mechanical tensile testing were conducted on the prepared polymers indicating that the polymer produced by TiCl4/GO had the highest thermal and mechanical properties, while these properties were at their minimum for polymers produced by TiCl4/Mg(OEt)2.
