Propylene polymerization was conducted with CS symmetric (Ph2C)CpFluZrCl2/B(C6 F5)3/Cp* TiMe3 system using AlOct3 as a scavenger at -50°C. The polymer produced was consisted by two kinds of fractions; i.e., hexane soluble (atactic) fraction and hexane insoluble fraction. The insoluble polymer had highly syndiotactic structure, indicating that the polymer was produced from CS symmetric zirconocene. M̄u's increased linearly with increasing polymer yield, although the activity was low. Thus, it could be said that syndiospecific polymerization of propylene proceeded in a living like manner with CS symmetric zirconocene active species by using the mixed metallocene system. And by the reaction of the syndiotactic poly(propylene) chain end with carbon monoxide (CO), it could be found that CO was quantitatively incorporated into the syndioPP-Zr chain end.
