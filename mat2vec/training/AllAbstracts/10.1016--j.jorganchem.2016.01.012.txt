Complexes 2, 5, 6, 7, 8a, 9 and 10 have been characterized by X-ray crystal structural analysis. The structures reveal that all these complexes are analogous binuclear via two bridging amidate ligands, built around a planar Ln2O2 ring. The catalytic properties of complexes 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 10 on the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of ε-caprolactone have been studied. The results show those complexes are efficient catalysts for the ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone.
