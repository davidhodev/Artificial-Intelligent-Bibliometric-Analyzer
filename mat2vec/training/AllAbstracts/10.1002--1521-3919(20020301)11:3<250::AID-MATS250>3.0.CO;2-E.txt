This work presents a proposal for a mechanism of olefin polymerization using metallocenes, taking into account the effect of the counter ion, solvent, and olefin. The Ystenes mechanism is also evaluated for the different symmetries of zirconocenes and for soluble and supported catalysts. The mechanism is related to experimental evidence and analyzed taking into account publisbed results about polymer characterization, kinetic evidence, and other experimental facts. The model tries to give a reasonable explanation for the different dependencies of the kinetics on the monomer: between 1 and 2 for Cs and C2 catalysts and 1 for C2v.
