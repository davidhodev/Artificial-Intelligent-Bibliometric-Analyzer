Carbonaceous materials with different degree of coalification, surface area, nitrogen content as well as electronic nature in their structure have been modified with prescribed amount of MAO and characterized by XPS analysis. Syndiospecific styrene polymerizations using half-titanocenes containing aryloxide ligands, Cp′TiCl2(OAr) [Cp′ = tBuC5H4, Ar = 2,6-iPr 2C6H3 (1), 2,6-iPr 2-4-tBuC6H2 (2); Cp′ = Cp*, Ar = 2,6-iPr2-4-tBuC 6H2 (3)], have been explored in the presence of various MAO-supported organic materials. These catalyst systems were effective to afford syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS) exclusively, and the activity by 3 increased at higher temperature (25-55 °C). The Mn values in the resultant sPS prepared by 3 in the presence of the present supported cocatalysts were not strongly affected by the temperature, whereas the Mn values were highly dependent upon the temperature in the presence of MAO cocatalyst. Both, the activity and the Mn values were slightly affected by the nature as well as the chemical character of surface functional groups of the carbonaceous materials employed. The ethylene/styrene copolymerization by Cp*TiCl2(O-2,6-iPr2C6H 2) afforded the copolymer exclusively with similar degree employed by the homogeneous system. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.
