© 2018, The Society of Polymer Science, JapanSiMe2(©1-C13H8)(©1-tBuN)TiMe2(thf) (1; C13H8 = fluorenyl, thf = tetrahydrofuran) was synthesized and characterized by1H,13C, DEPT NMR, and single crystal X-ray analysis. The catalyst system composed of the complex 1 and modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO) exhibits the characteristics of a quasi-living polymerization of 1-hexene in toluene at130°C, producing a syndiotactic-rich polymer with a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw /Mn = 1.36). Moreover, this catalyst system is also capable of promoting the quasi-living copolymerization of 1-hexene with norbornene at room temperature, yielding random copolymers with narrow molecular weight distributions. The quasi-living nature of the catalyst allows the synthesis of syndiotactic-rich poly(1-hexene)-block-poly(1-hexene-ran-norbornene) diblock copolymers.
