Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.A series of monodisperse polynorbornene (PNB) chains bearing different contents of aryloxide ligands at their side chain were synthesized by Grubbs ring-opening metathesis copolymerization between norbornene and 2-aryloxonorbornene. These PNB chains were employed as a soluble support for grafting half-titanocene complexes to afford structurally well-defined supported catalysts, where a pre-defined number of Ti centres was confined in a nano-sized random coil of PNB chains. Extensive investigation in ethylene polymerization revealed unique catalytic features of these soluble polymer-supported catalysts, represented by a synergistic activity enhancement among multiple active centres confined in a random coil. The well-defined nature of these novel polymer-supported catalysts is powerful in studying interactions between active centres and supports as well as among active centres themselves in catalysis.
