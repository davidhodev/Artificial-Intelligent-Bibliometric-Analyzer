Copolymerizations of ethylene and disubstituted diallylsilanes (CH 2=CH-CH2)2R2Si (R = CH3, C6H5) have been investigated with various zirconocene catalysts using methylaluminoxane as a cocatalyst. The bridged stereospecific catalysts showed a higher reactivity for disubstituted diallylsilanes than the non-bridged aspecific catalysts, Disubstituted diallylsilanes were incorporated into the polymer chain via cyclization insertion preferentially, and formed 3,5-disubstituted silacyclohexane units in the polyethylene main chain. A zirconocene catalyst, dimethylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride, produced a copolymer containing pendant ullyl groups derived from the 1,2-insertion of diallyldiphenylsilane without cyclization.
