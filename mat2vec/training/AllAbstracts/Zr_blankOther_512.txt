In this paper we report on some preliminary results on ethylene polymerization with Cp* 2ZrX2 (Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, X=Cl, OH, Me) - AlR3 (R=Me, Et, i-Bu). Furthermore, we carried out a study on propylene polymerization with Cp* 2MCL2 (M=Zr, Hf) - MAO in comparison with Cp2MCL2-MAO: some data concerning the different chain-transfer mechanisms observed in the two systems are reported.
