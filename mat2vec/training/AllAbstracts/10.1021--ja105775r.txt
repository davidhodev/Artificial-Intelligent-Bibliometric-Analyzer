Accurate active-site counts are necessary for the establishment of olefin polymerization kinetics, yet current techniques are often tedious and limited in sensitivity. Herein, we describe the development of a novel method for determining the fraction of initiated catalyst using standard gel-permeation chromatography (GPC). The first insertion of monomer into the chromophore-bearing zirconocene 1 generates a single equivalent of a labeled polymer chain. The polymer-bound label can be quantified as a function of polymer molecular weight using a GPC with a UV detector; simultaneous RI detection allows both the extent of monomer conversion and the molecular-weight distribution to also be established. We estimate that monomer to catalyst ratios of as high as 10000:1 can be measured using this technique. Â© 2010 American Chemical Society.
