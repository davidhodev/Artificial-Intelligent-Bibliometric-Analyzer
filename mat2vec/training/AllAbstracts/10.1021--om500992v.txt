Complexes 1-4 were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies and X-ray diffraction analyses as THF-solvated monomers, adopting a half-sandwich geometry. Upon activation of [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4]/AliBu3, these half-sandwich scandium complexes displayed various activities toward the copolymerization of ethylene (E) and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD). Complex 1, supported by the phenyl-substituted pyrrole-fused cyclopentadienyl ligand, showed a slightly higher activity than the phenyl-substituted thiophene-fused cyclopentadienyl complex 2. Among the thiophene-fused cyclopentadienyl complexes 2-4, 4, bearing pentamethyl substituents, showed the highest activity of 2.9 × 106 g/molSc·h·bar. The resultant copolymers had adjustable DCPD incorporation varying from 14.0 up to 46.1 mol %, of which the alternating poly(E-alt-DCPD) had a high Tg of 166 °C. In addition, no cross-linking was observed in the copolymers, suggesting that these catalytic systems were highly regioselective for the two active double bonds within DCPD.
