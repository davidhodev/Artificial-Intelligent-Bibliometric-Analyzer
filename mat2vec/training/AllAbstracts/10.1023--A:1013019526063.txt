Polymerization of propylene with the three-component catalytic system bis(2-phenylindenyl)zirconium dichloride-alkyl magnesium chloride-triisobutylaluminum is studied. The annelated zirconocene is alkylated by the Grignard reagent. The three-component system is as good in activity as two-component systems with polymethylalumoxane as a cocatalyst. Stereoblock elastomeric polypropylene with a high molecular weight is formed.
