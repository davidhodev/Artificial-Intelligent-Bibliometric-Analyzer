Summary: Quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopy is used to determine reactivity ratios and end group and branching frequency of ethylene-styrene and ethylene-isobutylene co-polymers synthesized at a temperature T = 205 °C and pressure p = 1650 bar at different levels of co-monomer fraction. In the forefront of the studies quantitative 13C NMR conditions have to be investigated. Optimum conditions are achieved using a relaxation agent Chromium(III) acetylacetonate (Cr(acac)3) at measurement temperature T = 100 °C and a delay time d1 = 7 s with a 90° pulse and inverse-gated decoupling. The analysis of conversion dependence of co-monomer content shows an increase in conversion with increasing co-monomer content for the ethylene-styrene co-polymerization, whereas conversion decreases with rising isobutene fraction in the co-polymer. Reactivity ratios for ethylene-styrene as well as for ethylene-isobutylene co-polymerization system are determined with values rES = 0.09 ± 0.007 and rSE = 2.3 ± 7.0 and rEIB = 3.3 ± 0.6 and rIBE = 6.3 ± 4.2. Frequency on methyl end groups, end-of-chain contributions caused by transfer to propionic aldehyde and butyl branches are gained. For the ethylene-styrene co-polymer system a decrease in frequency is observed, whereas for the ethylene-isobutylene co-polymer system the opposite occurs. Influence of the co-monomers on the polymerization reaction steps as transfer to chain transfer agent and backbiting reaction is discussed. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
