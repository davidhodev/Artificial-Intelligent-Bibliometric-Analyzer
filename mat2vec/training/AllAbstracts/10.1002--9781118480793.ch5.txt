This chapter first describes the coordination polymerization of acyclic and cyclic vinylic monomers, conjugated dienes, and polar vinylic monomers with the most important catalytic systems. Next, the chapter presents definitions, chemical and physical properties, and general features of the most relevant catalyst types used in coordination polymerization. The discussed catalyst types are Phillips catalyst, Ziegler-Natta catalysts, and single-site catalysts. The last part of this chapter deals with coordination polymerization kinetics and mechanism, mathematical models at different scales, as well as some analyses on the supported catalyst particle breakup and growth Â© 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
