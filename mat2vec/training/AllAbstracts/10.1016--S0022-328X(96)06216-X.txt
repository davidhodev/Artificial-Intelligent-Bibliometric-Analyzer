Density-functional theory has been used to study the first few steps of ethene polymerization with the single-site catalyst Cp2ZrCH3 + (biscyclopentadienyl methyl zirconium cation). Insertion of the first monomer yields a γ-agostic product Cp2ZrC3H7 + which can transform into a more stable β-agostic conformation with an activation barrier of 11 kJ mol-1. The interaction of the β-agostic structure with a second monomer leads to chain termination (front-side attack) or insertion (back-side attack) with barriers of about 35-40 kJ mol-1. A more likely step appears to be insertion directly into the γ-agostic Cp2ZrC3H7 +, to form the γ-agostic product Cp2ZiC5H11 + with a barrier of only 11 kJ mol-1. © 1996 Elsevier Science S.A.
