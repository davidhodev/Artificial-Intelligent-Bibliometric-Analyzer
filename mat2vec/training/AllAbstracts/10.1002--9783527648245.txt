Photoinitiating systems for polymerization reactions are largely encountered in a variety of traditional and high-tech sectors, such as radiation curing, (laser) imaging, (micro)electronics, optics, and medicine. This book extensively covers radical and nonradical photoinitiating systems and is divided into four parts: • Basic principles in photopolymerization reactions • Radical photoinitiating systems • Nonradical photoinitiating systems • Reactivity of the photoinitiating system © 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
