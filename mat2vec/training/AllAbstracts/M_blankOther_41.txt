Group IVB-containing poly(este r amine) polymers containing norfloxacin in the backbone were synthesized in moderate yield using the interfacial polycondensation technique. The products are of moderate chain length with degrees of polymerization ranging from 60 to 190. The products were characterized utilizing HR EI MS, MALDI-TOF MS, and infrared spectroscopy. MALDI spectroscopy showed to be a useful tool in the analysis of the products with sizes up to six units found. Â© Oxford & IBH Pub. Co. Pvt. Ltd.
