The catalytic activities of five bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene complexes of group IV metallocenes in the dehydrocoupling reaction of various 1,2-disubstituted hydrodisilanes were investigated. The reactions were monitored by GC/MS analysis in the early stages, and the polymers were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography.
