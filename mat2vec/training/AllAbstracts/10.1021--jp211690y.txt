Reduction of titanium and vanadium compounds is a process accompanying the activation of coordinative olefin polymerization catalysts. Four density functional theory (DFT) functionals, coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations method CCSD(T) as well as complete active-space second-order perturbation theory method CASPT2 with a complete active-space self-consistent field CASSCF reference wave function were applied to investigate the thermodynamics of titanium and vanadium reduction. The performance of these theoretical methods was assessed and compared with experimental values. The calculations indicate that vanadium(IV) chloride is more easily reduced by trimethylaluminum than the corresponding titanium compound; the energies of reaction calculated at the CCSD(T) level are equal -57.21 and -33.10 kcal/mol, respectively. The calculations deal with the redox reactions of metal chlorides in the gas phase, rather than solvated ions in the aqueous solution. This approach may be more appropriate for olefin polymerization, usually carried out in nonpolar solvents. Â© 2012 American Chemical Society.
