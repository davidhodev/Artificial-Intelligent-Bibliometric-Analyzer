Reactions of phenylethynyl lithium with substituted cyclopentenones gave the corresponding pendant phenylethynyl substituted cyclopentadienes. Subsequent deprotonation and transmetallation with TiCl4·2THF, ZrCl 4, and Cp1ZrCl3 yielded the alkyne-functionalized metallocene complexes [C5Me4(CCPh)] 2MCl2 [M = Ti (1), Zr (2)], Cp1[C 5Me4(CCPh)]ZrCl2 (3), and Cp1[C 5H2R′2(CCPh)]ZrCl2 [R′ = Me (4), Ph (5)]. These complexes were fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MS spectra, and elemental analysis. The molecular structure of 2 was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Ethylene polymerization was studied with these complexes in the presence of methylaluminoxane (MAO). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
