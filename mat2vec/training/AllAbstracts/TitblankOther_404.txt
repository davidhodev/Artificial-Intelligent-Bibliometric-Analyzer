A nickel catalyst, bis(Î±-naphthyl)-2,3-butanediimine nickel(II) dichloride {[C10H7-N=C (CH3)C (CH 3)=NC10H7]NiCl2} was synthesized and then activated by methylaluminoxane (MAO). By using this catalytic system branched polyethylenes (PE) of bimodal (wide) molecular weight distribution (MWD) were prepared. The effects of various conditions, including the polymerization temperature (Tp), ethylene pressure and n Al/nNi on the catalytic activity, molecular weight, degree of branching and branching types of PE were investigated. The catalytic activity and the resulting polymer microstructure were sensitive to the polymerization temperature. The microstructure of the resulting PE was determined by FTIR and 13C-NMR. According to Gel Permeation Chromatography(GPC), the resulting PE exhibited a bimodal molecular weight distribution. The influence of the existence of three possible stereo isomers of the Ni single-site catalyst with unsymmetrical imino- substituted bulky ligands on the molecular weight distribution was discussed.
