Â© 2018 by the authors.Group 4 metallocene polymers offer a wide variety of unique properties. Some of these are reviewed in this paper, including the ability to form fibers and to absorb laser radiation, thereby protecting materials containing them in small amounts; the possibility of becoming conductive materials through simple doping; increasing the productivity of damaged, old and mold-infested seeds through incorporation of plant growth hormones; and acting as anticancer drugs that inhibit a variety of human cancers including breast and pancreatic cancers.
