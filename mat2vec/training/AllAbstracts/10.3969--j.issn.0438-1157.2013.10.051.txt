Heterogeneous Z-N catalysts were prepared by loading TiCl4 on a mixture of modified nanoclays and functionalized carbon nanotubes as effective composite nanofillers in magnesium chloride. The polyethylene nanocomposites were produced via in-situ polymerization. The properties of nanocomposites were studied by controlling the content of montmorillonite (MMT), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in MgCl2. Highly active polymerization catalyst with the nanofillers containing MMT, modified MWCNTs and MgCl2 could be obtained. Mechanical properties of polyethylene containing composite nanofillers were better than those of polyethylene resin containing only one kind of nanofiller. WAXD analysis of the composites indicated that composite nanofillers of low content were uniformly dispersed in PE matrix and played an effective enhancement effect. Â© All Rights Reserved.
