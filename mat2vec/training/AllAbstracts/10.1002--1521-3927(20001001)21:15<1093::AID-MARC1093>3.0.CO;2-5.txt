The cationic bridged zirconocene complex [iPr(Cp)(Ind)Zr(Me)(THF)][BPh4] (1-BPh4) was synthesized. Polymerization of methyl methacrylate with 1-BPh4 in CH2Cl2 at temperatures between -20 and 20°C led to the formation of isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate). The low polydispersity index of the polymer obtained and a successful two step polymerization of methyl methacrylate with 1-BPh4 are hints towards a living polymerization mechanism. 1H and 13C NMR analysis revealed an enantiomorphic site-controlled mechanism for the formation of isotactic poly(methyl methacrylate). © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 2000.
