Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.Bifunctional Ag(i), Pd(ii), Rh(i), Ru(ii) and Au(i) complexes containing a NHC ligand and a pendant trivalent boron moiety have been synthesized in high yields. Fine-tuned reaction conditions were used to prevent potential ligand self-quenching or polymerization due to the eventual co-existence in situ of free NHC (Lewis base) and boronic ester (Lewis acid) in the same molecule.
