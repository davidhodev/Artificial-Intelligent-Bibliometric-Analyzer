Ethylene polymerization was performed using bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride ((n-BuCp)2ZrCl2) supported on alumina- and titania-based acidic oxides (Al2O3, TiO2, AlPO4, TiO2-Al2O3, SiO2-Al2O3, TiO2-SiO2 and H-Y zeolite) in the presence of triisobutylaluminum. These oxides were also tested in an isopropylbenzene cracking reaction to determine their acid properties. Among the catalysts, AlPO4-supported (n-BuCp)2ZrCl2 showed the highest polyethylene productivity, but AlPO4 was inactive in the cracking reaction. FT-IR spectra of pyridine-adsorbed AlPO4 and Al2O3 indicated that the acid sites do not participate in active-site formation. It is possible that the metallocene is activated on sites formed by the reaction of characteristic OH groups of AlPO4 with triisobutylaluminum. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
