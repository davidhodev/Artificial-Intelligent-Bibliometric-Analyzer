Polymerization of vinyl chloride (VC) with half-titanocene/ methylaluminoxane (MAO) catalysts was investigated. The polymerization proceeded easily to give high molecular weight polymers. The relationship polymer yield and molecular weight gave a straight line pass through the origin. Moreover, the line was good agreement with the calculated value, suggesting that the controlled polymerization of VC is possible in the polymerization with half-titanocene/MAO catalysts.
