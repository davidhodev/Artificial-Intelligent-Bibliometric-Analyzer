A full, two-level factorial experimental design with temperature and concentrations of zirconocene dichloride and methylaluminoxane as variables was employed to study the polymerization of ethylene. Rate of polymerization and molecular weight data were used to develop a kinetic model and estimate the kinetic parameters. The polymerization rate was continuously recorded from a semi-batch reactor and molecular weights were measured at the end of each experimental run. The analysis of the data suggests the presence of two kinds of active species. One kind of species is produced from the other via a pseudo-first-order reaction. Â© 1994.
