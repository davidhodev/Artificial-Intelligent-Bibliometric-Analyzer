A quantitative study was carried out on the homogeneous zirconocene dichloride/methylalumoxane/trimethylaluminum (Cp2ZrCl2/MAO/TMA) catalyst system in ethylene polymerization. The effects of variation of the AlMAO/Zr ratio, absolute Zr concentration, and addition of TMA on ethylene polymerization activity and polymer properties were investigated. The polymerization profiles for small AlMAO/Zr ratios and the changes with the Zr concentration are explained with a complexation equilibrium for the active homogeneous complex and with the change to a heterogeneous catalyst upon polymer precipitation. Good polymer productivities can be achieved at AlMAO/Zr < 1000 when working at Zr concentrations between 10−4 and 10−5 mol/l with addition of TMA (AlMAO/AlTMA≈ 1.4). © 1994 Hüthig & Wepf Verlag, Basel
