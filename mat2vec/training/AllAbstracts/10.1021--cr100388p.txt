A description of catalytic and stoichiometric reactions in which 2-metallaoxetanes are identified as likely intermediates is provided. The properties of 2-metallaoxetanes and metallaoxetane reactivity are also described. Sharpless and co-workers stated a chromaoxetane intermediate formed after olefin-metal precoordination and subsequent [2 + 2] addition with an oxo ligand would best explain the product distribution in the reaction of chromyl chloride with olefins. Jacobsen suggested in his original report the direct transfer of the oxo ligand to the alkene, similar to the mechanism reported for related iron-porphyrin systems. Friend and co-workers suggested formation of a surface metallacycle from the olefin and adsorbed atomic oxygen as intermediate in their study of the oxidation of propylene to acetone on a Rh(111) surface. Milstein et al. had proposed sequential C-O oxidative addition, formation of a metallaoxetane, Î²-H elimination, and reductive elimination, although they could not isolate any intermediates.
