As an alternative to inorganic supports, emulsions and organic carriers were developed for metallocene-catalyzed polyolefin synthesis in the last years. Oil-in-oil emulsions based on a perfluorinated solvent provide the possibility to synthesize polymer particles on the nanometer length scale, while the latex particles consisting of polystyrene with different surface functionalities yield particles on the micrometer range. To obtain a deeper insight to the reaction course of both techniques and to the product morphology and fragmentation behavior of the organic carriers, substantial information concerning the kinetics of these reactions is crucial. Thus, standard analytical methods were combined with real-time video microscopy and laser scanning fluorescence microscopy (LSCFM) of perylene labeled particles for improving these methods for polyolefin synthesis.
