Highly active copolymerization of ethylene and norbornene was explored using (fluorenyl)(amido)titanium complexes bearing substituted amido ligands. The norbornene content and norbornene sequence distribution of the copolymers were controllable by changing the comonomer feed ratio and the polymerization temperature, respectively. The evaluation of the monomer reactivity ratios indicated that the copolymerization behavior of the (fluorenyl)(amido)titanium complex was tunable from alternating to random nature. The thermal and mechanical properties of the resulting copolymers depended on the sequence distribution of norbornene.
