Synthesis and structural analysis of various phenoxy modified half-titanocenes with different anionic ligands of the type, Cp*TiX(Y)(O-2,6- iPr 2C 6H 3) [X = Y = pyr (2, pyr = C 4H 4N), pz (3, C 3H 3N 2), OPh (4); X = Cl, Y = OCH(CF 3) 2 (5)] have been explored. Ethylene/styrene copolymerization by 2, 5, and Cp*TiCl 2(O-2,6- iPr 2C 6H 3) (1) in the presence of [PhN(H)Me 2][B(C 6F 5) 4] and Al(i-Bu) 3/Al(n-octyl) 3 afforded poly(ethylene-co-styrene)s as the sole product even at 55 and 70 °C, whereas the pyrazolato analogue (3) showed the negligible activity and 4 afforded a mixture of copolymer and syndiotactic polystyrene: 5 showed the better catalyst performance in terms of activity, suggesting that the anionic ligand (X,Y) plays a role in this catalysis. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
