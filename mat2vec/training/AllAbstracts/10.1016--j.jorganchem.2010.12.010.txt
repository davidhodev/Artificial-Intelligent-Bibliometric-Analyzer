A series of monomeric pentamethylcyclopentadienyltitanatranes, [n = 0, 1; n = 1, 2; n = 2, 3], were synthesized by the reaction of CpTiCl3 with corresponding triethanolamines such as (HOCH2CH2) nN(CH2CMe2OH)3 - n (n = 0, L1H 3; n = 1, L2H3; n = 2, L3H3), which varied by the number of CMe2 groups adjacent to an OH functionality from 3 (L1H3) to 2 (L2H3) to 1 (L3H3), in the presence of NEt3. All complexes were characterized by elemental analysis and solution 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy. Moreover, their solid state structures, which are slightly distorted three-legged piano stool geometry, have been confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. On activation with methylaluminoxane (MAO), these complexes showed good catalytic activity for the polymerization of styrene producing syndiotactic polystyrene (SPS) with high molecular weights. Compounds 1 and 2 bearing more than two pairs of methyl substituents on the side arms of triethanolamines showed the enhanced catalytic activities as the polymerization temperature went up from 50 °C to 110°C, whereas less bulky complexes 3 and CpTi(OCH2CH2)3N (4) gave the decreased activities as polymerization temperature rose. Unlike 3 and 4, complexes 1 and 2 in the presence of MAO as a cocatalyst gave SPS with controlled bimodal molecular weight distribution. Bimodal properties were much distinct at low polymerization temperature. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
