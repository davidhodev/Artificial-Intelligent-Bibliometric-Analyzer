A number of transition metal catalysts including early and late transition metals have been investigated for olefin polymerization and copolymerization. Progress of the field in this decade is reviewed, and important topics among them such as binary catalysts and polymerization of new monomers are described in detail. Our recent results on the polymerization of olefins having cycloalkenes and non-conjugated dienes using late transition metal complexes are also mentioned. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry.
